but as for questions , after all i had but one : why did adrian- if he wanted to let marie know that he , vas making plans in order to see her - not address himself to her direct , ring her up , even go to munich , call on the ladies and put his plans before them ?
she knocked a short , bony knock , entered almost before he had said come in , and then , upon the threshold , bent round to make sure of the number of the room
hans castorp assured himself that he felt only contempt for any propagandist of the republic and the bello stile who went about with his nose in the air , and calmly—with particular calm , although at the same time both febrile and fuddled—lumped the members of both tables together under the title of parthians and scythians
dr mantelsack smiled too
the alchemistic ritual of the lodges , in later centuries , led many a noble and inquiring spirit to that end—to which i need give no name , for it can not have escaped you that the successive degrees of the scottish rite were only a surrogate , a substitute of the hierarchy , that the alchemistic learning of the master-mason fulfilled itself in the mystery of transubstantiation , and that the hidden guidance which the lodge vouchsafed to its pupils has its prototype just as plainly in the means of grace , as the symbolic mummeries of lodge ceremonial have theirs in the liturgical and architectural symbolism of our holy catholic church
he ( laughing through his nose ) : do , re , mi !
but not longer ; buddenbrdoks and put on her thick jacket
the wedding party was not large : the oberwciler clergyman , the schoohnaster , the justice of the peace , , vith their wives ; from kaisersaschern besides us zeitbloms only uncle nikolaus ; rela- tives of frau leverkuhn from apolda ; a married pair , friend of the leverktihns , with their daughter , from weissenfels ; brother george , the farmer , and the dairy inanageress frau luder - that 'vas all
the cemetery was irregular in shape , having begun as a narrow rectangle facing the south , and then thrown out other rectangles on both sides
the dutchman had flung back his mighty torso more and more , his kingly head sank lower on his breast , he seemed to be dozing as he talked
all that is still very dark ; and the explanation is yet to come
it was half-past eleven , and mamsell jungmann and the children were already asleep in the corridor rooms
i confide to you the control of the medium
there is the position , in round figures , aside from small fluctuations in the capital
the return of the lad interrupted this parley , which had been carried on through the doorway
principally he saw his cousin , joachim ziemssen , in a strange , dislocated attitude on a bob-sled , riding down a steep course
but his father did not seem to be listening
he was the professor ordinarius , for whom it was usual to show respect
upon my word , one lives at least as well here as at the kurhouse , tony said a quarter of an hour later , as they sat around the coffee-table in the verandah
things being as they were between them , and the situation for them both , there was indeed not much to say
and i thank you in my turn , most warmly , for your willingness to share with me the great responsibili-ties which would perhaps be too heavy for me alone
you are not going to leave us ?
she added tonelessly , and i could not help recalling adrian 's words , vhen i first told him about the affair : fie illust see that he gets out of it whole
wehsal , however , obviously enjoyed this narrative of a man ’ s rise to success from humble and oppressed beginnings—and in any case there was no ground in it for arrogance , since the good fortune seemed dwindling away again in the prevailing fleshly infirmity
old behrens hasn ’ t forsaken you yet , my lad
and has hofrat behrens also told you about the germanrussian woman we had here last year—no , year before last—for five months ?
should one put down the actual children of the field as the pattern because they possessed organic actuality , while the snow crystals were mere show ?
he was holding his punch-glass with his hand at the level of his eyes and twisting the wrist round as he talked and jested with a group of masqueraders
october i he read this aloud first ; then turning the paper over , he began , in a voice that was already somewhat tremulous : honoured friends , my modest lay hastes to greet you in these walls : may kind heaven grant to-day blessing on their spacious halls
he spoke with sudden earnestness , and a slight flush spread over his face
i may be allowed here to say a word on the treatment of the chorus in my friend 's work : this never before attempted break- ing-up of the choral voices into groups both interweaving with and singing against each other ; into a sort of dramatic dialogue and into single cries which , to be sure , have their distant classic model in the crashing answer barrabam !
he turned sharply away from the window and gave vent to a little good-natured sigh , smiling familiarly at several pupils
hans castorp had heard nothing of her sudden turn for the worse and final exit , else he would gladly have assisted at the last rites , as a comradely attention , if not simply out of his confessed liking for funerals
there was no doubt of that ; but he was middle-class , respectable middle-class
fraulein weu-hbrodt sat on two sofa-cushions at the top of the table and presided over the meal with tact and discretion
i was received at first by an elderly companion , with whom i spoke french , but then gerda came , and we talked as on the day before for perhaps an hour , only that this time we drew nearer together and made still more effort to understand and know each other
of old sat freedom on the heights , quoted hans castorp airily
you can see for yourself ; there it is
the product of a perverted science , laden with death , slopes earthward thirty paces in front of him and buries its nose in the ground ; explodes inside there , with hideous expense of power , and raises up a fountain high as a house , of mud , fire , iron , molten metal , scattered fragments of humanity
cried probst , honestly startled , and peered with his pale blue eyes at adrian 's forehead as though he expected it to be glowing with fever
no , herr settembrini , there i find you are unjust
i will go , without being thrown out
thomas buddenbrdok was , in his heart , far from pleased with the development of little johann
but some day they get acquainted , and take to each other , only to find that one of the parties is on the point of leaving
if i may so express myself -- here he turned again to the consul -- i like best the names which show that the bearer is a christian
consul buddenbrddk came from the'harmony -- a reading-c-lub for men , where he had spent the hour after second break-fast -- hark into meng street
she was pale and shivered in her soft autumn coat -- from cold , weariness , excitement , and a grief that now and then rose up suddenly and filled her breast with a painful oppres-sion
she washed and dressed with quick , eager movements
we have as much right as the next person to our private thoughts about the story we are relating ; and we would here hazard the surmise that young hans castorp would never have overstepped so far the limits originally fixed for his stay if to his simple soul there might have been vouchsafed , out of the depth of his time , any reasonably satisfying explanation of the meaning and purpose of man ’ s life
lie may have decided
thus adrian 's confession in avoidance
yet though his tiny destiny fainted to nothing in the face of the general , was there not some hint of a personal mercy and grace for him , a manifestation of divine goodness and justice ?
above the house-door , in ornamental gilt lettering , was the word quisisana , by which name the retired little dwelling was known throughout the town , where they pronounced it with a very soft s and a very broad a christian buddenbrook , as senator giescke 's best friend , had obtained entry into quisisana , and been successful there , as formerly with aline puvogel in hamburg , and on other occasions in london , valparaiso , and sundry other parts of the world
considered courage , pride , and presumption because i would win glory in this worid , i made \ , rith him a bond and yow , so that all which during the term of four-and-twenty years i brought forth , and which mankind justl ) t regarded with mistrust , is only with his help come to pass and is divel 's work , infused by the angel of death
such was the spirit—it was aristocratic in its own special sense , and hans castorp deferred to it , out of an inborn respect for law and order of every sort
his friend was a child of aristocratic birth but neglected appearance , a certain count molln , whose first name \\as kai
so much is certain
what luck , to be called von schilling !
schwerdtfeger stood still and looked at the speaker , first in the one eye and then in the other
adjoining were the roomy bedchambers , also very sparsely furnished , a third one being opened for us
now he blithely took it up again and desisted , 'with entire unconcern , only when adrian for the sec- ond or third time refused to respond
all this was making the very oddest impression on our good hans castorp
he stood there as pale as at that first examination , which had ended by his being admitted as a patient
servant , herr consul , and , throwing his cap on his head and pulling the leather visor well down over his brows , carl smelt ran with great swinging strides down the street , chapter iv when the consul and siegismund gosch returned to the hall , the scene was a more comfortable one than it had been a quarter of an hour before
it is the despair of the teacher , for its proneness to display itself in the wrong direction
obedient servant , r say
it looked , in fact , as though hans castorp would return home in possession of a first-class cold
he liked to hold forth on the subject of metaphysical passages from the bible ; and when in a good-natured or discursive mood , he would entertain the boys of the first and second forms with marvellous interpretations of mysterious passages
if there is a god , then there is also this distinction
according to custom he was bare-headed and overcoatless—and moreover very well dressed , in a dark-blue flannel suit with white stripes
great waves , said thomas buddenbrook
it was to joachim , though he had the paper in front of his nose , that she had turned with her question ; because he was the older inhabitant of course , whom she had known longer by sight ; but perhaps for another reason as well , because they two might meet on a conventional footing and carry on an ordinary conversation in articulate words ; because nothing wild and deep , mysterious and terrifying , held sway between them
he wo not skin us alive , be- cause of our old friendship , and you will get a foundation for your castles in the air
heaven has willed otherwise
and what i had in me , as i quite clearly know , was that from long ago , even as a lad , i was familiar with illness and death , and had in the face of all common sense borrowed a lead pencil from you , as i did again on carnival night
it vas an isolated occurrence
he had assembled an apparatus to serve his need : a botanical text-book , a handy little trowel to take up roots , a herbarium , a powerful pocket-lens
he sat upright , and more than upright , he sat , so to speak , on tiptoe , for only his shanks touched the chair ; and with flashing black eyes faced the enemy , who turned toward him in assumed surprise
she held by the hand an extraordinarily thin small child , dressed in a flowered print frock , with lustreless ash-coloured hair and the manner of a little old maid
i beg you , my young friend , not to adopt the phrases current up here , but to speak the language of the european culture native to you
the consul puffed at his cigar till it glowed , threw back his head and blew out the smoke , and then went on : you are thinking , of course , that when god calls your dear parents unto himself , we shall have a considerable sum to look forward to -- and so we shall
the sun , he might begin , as they took their walks together , will soon be entering the sign of the crab
sometimes she gave such heart-breaking sighs as would move a stone to pity
it was provided , vith a supply of oxygen , a telephone , high-voltage searchlights , and quartz windovvs all round
of righteousness to chew
they sympathized with what they recognized ; without this sympathy they could not have recognized it
tom asked , to bring her back to her starting-point
but alas , every characterization of this kind involves a moral judgment , whether favourable or unfavourable—though , to be sure , each trait of character has its two sides
why must this proposition corns up just now , to shake him untimely out of his canny resignation and make him a prey to doubts and suspicions ?
father , herr gr� broke out
and then , in the sudden pause , there was no sound but the agonizing gurgles of thomas buddenbrook
, into the kingdom of the fend£fl and graceful and respect was paid it , the more readily because there were already newer works
now that , clavdia , is not spirituel—it even sounds conventional
in the winter it was good for coasting , but i was seldom there
it seemed that tony , despite frequent correction , had been guilty , not for the first time , of creating a disturbance in the street !
then he opened the door into the corridor and called out in an irritated voice : if there were nothing very important to prevent it , would herr brecht kindly make haste -- he was suffering
when settembrini spoke behind his back of naphta and his intellectual tendencies , it was always on an appealing note of warning , with a hint that the subject had more than a little of the diabolic about it
my poor , great friend !
it was an ordinary hour , not long , not short
in his blue eyes , under their reddish-brown brows , his fellow citizens read no answer to their curious questioning
somebody named uzza had laid hands the chest , the so-called ark of the covenant , as it threatened to slip when it was being transported by wagon , and he fell dead on the spot
reason stands simple before him , for reason is only virtue , while death is release , immensity , abandon , desire
look at that monstrous type , the inquisitor—for instance , the sanguinary figure of conrad von marburg—and his infamous zeal in the persecution of everything that stood in the way of supernatural domination !
in a word , hans castorp envisaged in this opening affair between him and the heedless creature who was a member of the berghof society no more than a holiday adventure
i ’ m positive she is married
my soul , think not on it !
take our great cities , the centres and foci of civilization , the crucibles of thought !
then of course kapellmeister sacher , who had arranged the concert , dr andrere , the regular conductor of the tonhalle , and dr schuh , the excellent music- critic of the neue zuricher zeitung - all these were present with their wives
but then he was roused by fresh vomiting , skull-splitting head- ache , and convulsions that shool { his small frame
but pre-cisely this casual , indiscriminate acknowledgment irritated thomas , for it had the appearance of setting no value upon superior capacity , earnestness , or respectability
he asked , and looked very embarrassed
( there , in fact , he really was sitting , his great hands folded before his place )
for it is like a dream to me , that we are sitting like this—comme un rêve singulièrement profond , car il faut dormir très profondément pour rêver comme cela
madame driinlich did not fail to tell the story at the table , so that even the frau consul burst out into her sputtering kroger laugh
in his cantata adrian might if he chose trans- form that cry of human and divine agony into the masculine pride and self-confidence of his faust 's sleep quietly and fear nothing !
i tnight com- pare his absentness to an abyss , into which one 's feeling towards him dropped soundless and without a trace
the high school of the resort had cannily secured the services of this distinguished latinist—the pupil of a religious house , as settembrini father vaguely expressed it—and it went without saying that he was an adornment to his position
the first engagement in celle had come to an end and the next one had not carried her much further : she was playing the juvenile lead in remote east prussian elbing
there was a singer there from the court opera , who sang songs , and a young artist , who asked me to sit for him , which i refused , as i thought it not suitable
i have preserved a letter which adrian sent to me at that time to freising from pfeiffering , where he was at work on the hymn of a great multitude , which no man could number , of all nations , and kindreds , and people , and tongues , standing before the throne and before the lamb ( see durer 's seventh sheet )
to tell the truth , however , i am hardly a very passionate man , though i have my passions , phlegmatic ones
with amazement , with tears of joy in my eyes , yet secret and loving concern , i read and heard , from week to week , what he put on paper : in the neatest , most precise , yes , even elegant notation , betraying not a trace of spasms
you work not because you must , but as master and head , and let others work for you , and you have the control , make your calculations , and are free
naphta replied : there can be no such triumphs as those you speak of ; for the authority is man himself—his interests , his worth , his salvation—and thus between it and truth no conflict is possible
beyond them was the throng of officials , clerks , grain-porters , and warehouse labourers
had kaisersaschern ever released him ?
i do not know what it was : i only know it is too much for my poor brain
and bach -- why , good heavens , you know how he was reproached for his want of melody and clearness !
for one would usually con-
his gaze grew dim , the unconscious tension of the features relaxed , the strained and swollen look about the lips notably diminished ; the beauty of early manhood visited once more our joachim ’ s quiet brow , and all was over
public property , was it ?
i came here to be in peace and quiet
his little book on church music was recommended for private study in several conservatories , and his fugues and chorals were played now and then where an organ sounded to the glory of god
the collection of the establishment was an amplification of the literature found in a dentist ’ s waiting-room—in many languages , profusely illustrated , and offered free of charge
his son was in fact often his superior when it came to a quick decision upon the advan-tageous course
yes , but that was the influence of the
but the thing about himself which he did not know , which he never studied and described , but which none the less grew worse and worse , was his singular lack of tact
a mist lay over the town
there was no stir of air , not so much as might even lightly sway the treeboughs ; there was not a rustle , nor the voice of a bird
i often found him at such studies and at written instrumentation
yes , they were , in the sense that they were the core of a period when with my senses at their freshest i was freely seeing , searching , and gathering in
i don ’ t want to wound you , and i admit that your mental state is a quite choice and par ticular mess
piz michel and tinzenhorn , in the notch— you can ’ t see them from here—have snow all the year round
one could temporarily suspend the irritability to sensation of every form of living matter in the plant as well as in the animal kingdom ; one could narcotize ova and spermatozoa with chloroform , chloral hydrate , or morphine
after the draught he would proceed thus , choking off with one hand the conversation , making a silence round him , as a conductor hushes the confused sounds of tuning instruments and collects his orchestra to begin a number ; mastering at will any situation , for could anything resist that regal head , with its aureole of white hair and its pallid eyes , the great folds of the brows , the long whisker and shaven raw upper lip ?
it was good that the coffin was now to be closed , the lid screwed on ; that the hour for removal was at hand
the mornings were very dark , breakfast was taken by the light of the artificial moon that hung from the vaulted ceiling of the dining-room , above the gay stencilled border
the frau consul , deeply moved , embraced her eldest-born
the plan , as he had said , was originally schwerdtfeger 's , hut i would probably understand his , adrian 's , wish that they should not get that im- pression in pension gisela
not only the persons involved felt the shock of these events ; the whole circle shared the shattering effect
it was odd , after all
no , you have nothing to do with the devil
oh , tony , be brave , said the senator
sit tibi terra levis
he had always pictured him as an officer ; but here he was in grey uni , looking like everybody else
con- tending that it had often been highly christian characters , bowed down by conscience , refined by suffering , their view of life marked by melancholy , from whom had come great things in art
and so it was in the lectures as well : and so it went in associa- tion with his fellow-students , the members of the christian stu- dents ' union winfried , which he had joined on external grounds and whose guest i sometimes was
and as thus a beginning had been made , he arranged on the same day with alfreda schildknecht a visit to her patient , fritz rotbein , who was as bored with life as his nurse , though to him , unless all signs failed , only a short term still remained
let me suggest to you , my son , that you yourself are ignoring the duty and respect which you owe to your mother
short trips on errands 'were given up , the last one having been made to buy toys for tie dead child
human devotion he accepted , i would swear often unconsciously

thy prospects are poor
tom and gerda made plans to go to the christening , and tony 's head was full of giving them an elegant reception
hans castorp could seldom refrain from caressing them with his hand , or stroking his cheeks with them as he went on his walks—their softness and freshness were irresistible
he came out of the diningroom leaning on his cane , dressed as usual in his pilot coat and yellow check trousers , looked about him with his critical , alert , and elegant air , and approached the cousins ’ table
from now on he had lessons twice a week from wendell kretschmar
whenever i see one of these , for in-stance -- he picked up one of the heavy silver spoons and turned to madame antoinette -- i ca not help wandering whether they belong to the set that our friend the philosopher lenoir , sergeant under his majesty the emperor napoleon , had in his hands in the year -- and i think of our meeting in alf street , madame
she coughed almost constantly ; and all her finger-ends were plastered up , as they had running sores
lo , he is silent , the highly prejudiced presiding officer announces once more ; and all the priests acain unanimously declare him guilty
it did not—only the misery remained
it was a simple motif which he employed -- a mere trifle , an unfinished fragment of melody in one bar and a half
the frau consul had brought a silver collapsible cup , and they scooped up the water from the little stone basin directly under the source and refreshed themselves with the iron-impregnated spring
the painted statues seemed to stand out white and proud on their pedestals against the sky-blue background
signs enough were present to prove such doubting uncalled for
and the captain , already white-haired and rather deaf , had retired from his office -- and madame griin-lirh was not a goose any more !
afterwards one could hardly find pleasure in anything in that field
it is annoying but not serious , nobody troubles about it , probably not even the fair one herself
mr richardson , threadneedle street , is , as you know , a close business friend of our house ; i consider myself lucky to have placed both my sons with such friendly-disposed firms
his fluctuating health had constrained him to give up his last undertaking , the champagne and spirit agency
he expected nothing good
magnificent , he said , between clenched teeth

a yellow wainscoting ran round the lower part of the wall , and above it the bare white-washed surface was decorated with a few maps
my opinion is that he will buy the whole property , live here in the front , and utilize the back part in some other way

the chapter just finished is also , for my taste , much too extended
but now i had to laugh , yet at the same time was amazed when the gentlemen at this point came upon the subject of dental medicine and quite objectively began to talk about adrian 's and my symbolic musical critique of the dead tooth
were they , those children of the sun , so sweetly courteous to each other , in silent recognition of that horror ?
why , man , you ’ re bound to have perfect command of the language before long ; and that will be a great advantage to you if there should be a war—which god forbid
you went in a circle , gave yourself endless trouble under the delusion that you were accomplishing something , and all the time you were simply describing some great silly arc that would turn back to where it had its beginning , like the riddling year itself
in his narrow , dark little office , however , he had a large book-case filled with poetry in every language , and there was a story that he had been engaged since his twentieth year on a translation of lope de vega 's collected dramas
actually it was the suite of dramatic grotesques , whose themes , so we heard , he had taken from the old history and anec- dote book , the gesta rolnanorum

i have something for you : a little rhymed epigram from the french
there are always such peo-ple -- they are too funny for words
they were not separate and without all connection , for the present state had been preparing in the former one and to some extent had already been contained in it - just as indeed , on the other hand , the outbreak of the healthy and creative epoch was by no means a time of enjoyment , but rather in its own way one of affliction , of painful urgency and compulsion
i would tell him father- stories , i too
he held nepomuk 's hand , gazed into the starry eyes , and soon was lost in the sweet depths of that azure upturned smile
but he had a way of adapting what he picked up and giving it a personal character which took from his adaptatins anything that might sound ridiculous , if not everything boyisll and derivative
johann buddenbrook felt keenly the cloud on his wife 's family and looked with the more anxiety to the future of his own children
and she had strained her ear to hear too , but even at dinner she did not succeed , and somehow it did not seem proper to ask
everything—from the moment when an emanation from his nephew had first whispered to the consul that his undertaking had small chance of success—everything about the situation fulfilled itself , simply , inevitably , up to the end , and hans castorp accompanied the process with his melancholy , fatalistic smile
consul tienappel ’ s temples , covered with thin blond hair , showed swollen veins
and now the speaker described beethoven 's condition in the year , when his hearing , attacked by a resistless ailment , was in progres-

an unassuming young man was travelling , in midsummer , from his native city of hamburg to davos-platz in the canton of the grisons , on a three weeks ’ visit
i would give them something for it
once , when she was alone in the room with hans castorp and the patient , who was not asleep but lay on his back with open eyes , she actually made the remark : who would have dreamed i should ever come to tend the last illness of either of you ?
he already looked forward seriously and eagerly to his career
i should die , said she
said the con-sul 's wife , displeased
she over-saw kitchen , larders , linen and china cupboards , she made the most important purchases , she read to little erica , made clothes for her dolls , and fetched her from school , with a slice of french bread , to take her walking on the mill-wall

the turkey , stuffed with chestnuts , raisins , and apples , was universally praised
piano reduction , clcllanced a rough , mat paper , quarto format , wide margins , and notes printed not too close together

the sense of mourning still lay too heavily on the air for tony to give expression to her outraged feelings in livelier or stronger terms
a physician might have ascribed the veiled effort in his gaze , a certain sensitiveness at the temples , to migraine ; and jonathan did in fact suffer from headaches , though moderately , not oftener than once a month and almost without hindrance to his work
which , in fact , it did
it was this : that on certain days , i e , under certain weather conditions , and in certain states of mind , he could not see an open window without having a horrible and in-explicable impulse to jump out

the smallest unit of time was the month , settembrini had said ; and as hans castorp ’ s stay was less than that , it amounted to nothing ; it was a week-end visit , as hofrat behrens put it

he had been exhausting himself , all this time , with a false start

settembrini shrugged his shoulders
of course they were ill—but , after all , these young folk up here did have peculiar social standards !
we feel like the nobility , and we realize the differ-ence ; we should never try to live where we are not known , where no one understands our worth , for we shall have nothing but chagrin , and be laughed at for our arrogance
the great schoolmen of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries were agreed that what is false in theology can not be true in philosophy

he sympathized - and at the same time found it all so unnatural that he even took his monocle out of his eye , thus robbing his face of every gleam of intelligence
it is twenty-two years since , almost before my eyes , clarissa rodde the actress , sister of the just as obviously doomed inez , went to her death : at the end of the winter season of - , ill the month of lvlay , at pfeiffering in her mother 's house and with scant consideration for that mother 's feelings , with rash and reso- lute hand she took her life , using the poison that she had long kept in readiness for the moment when her pride could no longer endure to live
when we were children , i boxed his ears in the open street , for very good reasons ; and his precious little sister julchen nearly scratched me to pieces for it
henri 's family , henri himself should learn of their relation if she did not yield to him again

he will continue to take his walks abroad , displaying outwardly his usual mingling of civic pride and self-satisfaction : but he will bear down with him into the grave the secret chagrin of never having been elected senator
the cards were covered with futilities , they had all done their worst , and now the current had set in another direction
the room was familiar to him from the hours he had spent here , behind joachim ’ s back , in conversation with the psycho-analyst
for the creature not only laughed at him , but shook her head and gave it as her view that there must be something wrong , it certainly had a bad smell , when a fine lusty chap like him all of a sudden was just not up to it , he must be possessed , somebody must have given him something - and so on
he did this despite his firm intention to get up the next morning at half-past five , to do some most necessary preparation
but contrary to some rather exaggerated expectations , mercurius climbed no further than before—though hans castorp kept the instrument under his tongue eight minutes for good measure
meanwhile , first her father would draw her aside and speak seriously , and then her mother would take up the tale , both pressing for a decision
it will be a pity for erica , if it turns out badly ; but i feel most for tony
but i am not insulting you , herr gr� , said tony , repenting her brusqueness
a part of their torment and lust of shame standeth therein that they must cogitate the extremity of filthiness
'think it over till this afternoon , finished the senator , and went into the dining-room
not a soul felt any qualms before it , and it even promised occasion for entertainment and mischief
but i have been thinking about these questions lately , in the rest-cure ; and i find it wonderful , i find it a simply priceless arrangement of things , that the formal , the idea of form , of beautiful form , lies at the bottom of every sort of humanistic calling
he had a hundred times regretted the building of his new house , which he felt had brought him nothing but bad luck
if so , she was the blood sister of inez institoris , the beloved - or ci-devant beloved - of rudi schwerdtfeger
and he uses the word virtue just like that , without the slightest embarrassment
i agree with everything except the relations after the flesh , which obviously must at all times have subsisted , since man is a highly developed vertebrate , and , like other creatures of his kind—
and if anybody had ever had the temerity to call his attention to it , that person would have been for ever deprived of even the chance of be-coming a favourite and being called by his first name
the opera of the south , a high-hearted , light-hearted ravishment ; the german , racy of the people , whimsical , hobgoblinish ; and both grand and comic opera in the french style

instead of glory to the lord ?
for there is one thing which he does not know at all ; with respect to one fact , he labours in complete darkness
he saw the single-celled organism of the fructified egg on the point of being transformed into a multiple-celled organism , by striation and division ; saw the cell-bodies attach themselves to the lamellæ of the mucous membrane ; saw the germinal vesicle , the blastula , close itself in to form a cup or basin-shaped cavity , and begin the functions of receiving and digesting food
the thing was that they were practical men , more naturally , more vigorously , more im-peccably practical than he was himself
i must permit myself to remark that my time is limited , my carriage is waiting , and i am really obliged to ask for the favour of a few words with you
the sight was no longer strange , it was already right familiar ; and as on those earlier occasions , only in still greater degree , he bore himself in the presence of death with a responsible air , quite self-controlled , showing no nervous weakness , if some natural dejection
but at this question the night closed in again upon him
it was not to klopfgeissel 's mind , he did not want to go with them

did herr settembrini remember that the greatest poet of the middle ages , wolfram von eschenbach , could neither read nor write ?
but at length saturday came , school was over for the week , and herr brecht 's little drill had bored and buzzed away in the mouth for the last time
her daughter 's future had troubled her for years ; for erica was at a disadvantage compared with other young girls of her age
he silently apostrophized the oncoming one
hans castorp modestly mentioned the figure
action like that of bad food , the mere sight of a dish of straw- berries could make the skin of an allergic person break out ; yes
the prevailing temper did not permit hans castorp to laugh , as he would otherwise surely have done , at this rapid fire of boxes on the ear
she got out what is the matter with you ? -- but the tears were already rising
but mynheer peeperkorn , after a few bites , dismissed the whole as kickshaws—dismissed them with a scorn which gave dismaying evidence of the uncertain temper of this lordly man
he was also wrangling inwardly with joachim , who had not wanted to join the society on the verandah after luncheon , and had drawn his cousin against his will into the stillness and seclusion of the garden , until such time as they should go up to their balconies
i can only repeat that paragraphs and asterisks are in this book merely a concession to the eyes of the reader , and that i , if i had my way , would , vrite down the , vhole in one burst and one breath , without any division , yes , without paragraphing or inter- llissions
so now you have it
he held up his forefinger , close to his tired eyes
that proved again , he said , the relation between llusic and astronomy , as it had been shown already by pythagoras ' cos- mic theory of harmony
even christian appeared now and then , when there was nobody at the club , drank a little glass of benedictine , and talked about a project he had of opening an agency for champagne and brandy
that sum , translated into gulden , had at last safely reached herr permaneder 's hands , and herr permaneder had invested it securely and not unprofitably

one after another joachim passed easily through the stages of his chosen vocation , whose difficulties were smoothed away by the interest of his superiors and his own passionate love for the service
but let it go , tom
he was dispensed from the duty of going to the military academy , as he had already studied some semesters , and from the cornetcy
that music turns the equivocal into a system
thus passed the second hour , while the guitar was strummed or the gramophone gave out the contents of the album of light music into the twilight to which they had again accustomed their vision
chide her ; but she assured them she had not blushed in that sense
her faithful , loving heart , just then , in its weakness , yes , she admitted , in its weakness , about to while away an hour with him in dance and song ?
if it did happen to any of them , it would be a sure sign that they were not sound , but diseased , and they would not react to the appearance with emotions of horror and by taking to their heels , but treat it as though it were entirely in order , and begin a conversation with it—this being , in fact , the reaction of a person suffering from a hallucination
'then go , in god 's name , jean
years on end they had to practise the sacred craft , the fundamentals of harmony and the strict style before they were allowed to make a song , and this music-teaching had not the faintest connection with any little friend
mais c ’ est un sauvage ! —
y say that the tilnes are not precisely favourable to the steady pur- suance of such a work as this
every-thing depends on the question i have already asked you
it seems to me you are contradicting yourself ; first you say our cases are different ; then you say they are alike
you would be right to deny it
i keep it in readiness for the day when i can ’ t stand this farce any longer , and do myself the honour to bid you a respectful adieu
neither in familiarity with the features peculiar to life as lived up here—a familiarity impossible to achieve in so few days , which , as he was quite aware , and had even said to joachim , he could hardly hope to acquire in the three weeks of his stay—nor in the adaptation of his physical organism to the prevailing peculiar atmospheric conditions
if anything hit him -- ' certainly , my dear
his face glowed rosy-red with dry , internal heat , a sign that for this child of the lowland , bred in an atmosphere that rejoiced in a high degree of humidity , acclimatization could only consist in getting used to not getting used to it—which , in fact , rhadamanthus himself never did , being perpetually purple-cheeked
i say all this only in order to explain the discomfort caused in me at times by my stay in halle and my participation in adrian 's studies , the lectures that i followed as a guest hearer in order to hear what he heard
well , that happens , tom
it was no pleasure excursion
yes , certainly it had a religious emphasis , he ipoke as a theologian , and he spol { e by no means with contempt

he mentally addressed herr settembrini
in fact , the personal was here the decisive factor

yet conscience still urged him to continue in the effort ; so clearly that often , as opportunity arose , he would even invite the italian to discourse on the subject of his ideas
i conjure you , madame , to tell me !
for me the talk , vas a real sacrifice
he spread the news of his cousin ’ s return , and all those who had been the young man ’ s friends were glad and sorry and both quite sincerely ; for his clean and chivalrous personality had been universally approved , and there was a sort of unspoken feeling that joachim had been the best of the lot up here
and went back , to the end that he and she might meet on the way , since that afforded a keener throb than when she merely walked in front of or behind him
one ought to be just
it ’ s all the same to us up here , remarked the dislocated joachim ; and then it was he and not the gentleman rider who was coughing in that horribly pulpy manner
the truth was that the consul 's estate was more considerable than any one had supposed
tony dropped her stocking and looked thoughtfully into armgard 's face
many a turn of phrase in musician 's jargon came not from the acoustic but the visual , the note-picture : for instance , one speaks of occbiali because the brol { en drum-basses , half-notes that are coupled by a stroke through their necks , look like a pair of spectacles ; or as one calls cobbler 's patches ( rosalia ) certain cheap sequences one after another in s : :ages at like intervals ( he wrote examples for us on the blackboard )
then i would better do it
those were three worries
but which devil was it he had been giving ground to just now ?
so long ago , indeed , that we wonder if the reader is clear how long ago it was
he suffered the man to carry his overcoat as they went on their walks together , and wehsal did this devotedly ; suffered even the conversation of the mannheimer , which was depressing to a degree
he took the liberty of remaining seated , because it looked less formal , and gestured with his head and hands most charmingly as he proposed a toast to the two ladies of the family , madame antoinette and the frau consul
to-morrow , after midday meal , i have my regular monthly examination

these are human topics we are treating of ; human in the sense that they have to do with freedom and the spirituel—you must pardon me if i use a rather ambiguous terminology , but i needed the expression lately , and made it my own
delighted to find favour in the eyes of a colleague
yes , he was already quite tall , was little johann
he answered : i don ’ t quite understand , herr settembrini
she drank from an invalid cup , all her fingers decked to the joint with opals , amethysts , and emeralds ; in no long time she had told her guests her story , the golden ear-rings swaying as she talked
the consul closed the portfolio and stowed it away carefully in a drawer at the back of the desk
this is , of course , only the beginning of a stream of callers
the baroness gleichen moved about , seeking sympa- thy for the obscure fatality that had befallen her and her hus- band : you know about this ennui we have had , she was saying to all and sundry
successful social reform would have robbed them of their necessary justification , as it would the wretched of their sanctified state
he was then , in the spring of , in vienna , where in the ehrbar hall and in the setting of one of the so-caljed anbruch evenings rudi schwerdtfeger at last and finally pla ) ted the violin concerto written for him
her position was no longer tenable
to whom should i write ?
she cried out , aston-ished , turning around on her sand-heap
we will just have to sit on the rocks
his days were consumed by nervous pedantry : harassed by a thousand details , all of them unimportant , he was too weak-willed to arrive at a reasonable and fruitful arrangement of his time

she sat reading her home letters , which were written in round hand , and drinking tea the colour of blood
the frau consul said : my good man , we will take our walk first , and after an hour or so we should like luncheon served up above -- but not too high up ; say perhaps at the second landing
i-ie seemed grown smalle
yes , he thought , there was a difference , after all , between this light , soft , white powder he trod with his skis , that weighed down the trees , and covered the open spaces , a difference between it and the sand on the beaches at home , to which he had likened it
i have described the coolness of our parting in halle
he would not dis-illusionize the deep solemnity of his mood by making him buddenbrodks practise commonplaces
even the complaints which at first joachim had so frequently and loudly voiced at missing the manœuvres , and neglecting the service in general , he voiced no more
on thursday , when consul buddenbrook and the ladies from broad street , consul kriiger , clothilde , sesemi wiechbrodt and erica came to tea , she talked vividly about munich
but out of the corner of his eye he looks - or perhaps not quite looks , perhaps his blue eyes are only the slightest shade turned from a direct gaze up at the platform and towards the corner where she stands and waits
her strongly developed family sense was instinctively hostile to conceptions of free will and self-development ; it inclined her rather to recognize and accept her own characteristics wholesale , with fatalistic indifference and toleration
he will never get to be a master , poor chap !
when i came back to leipzig , once more a civilian , i found my friend unchanged in his walks and ways
anyhow , i shall marry again
joachim ’ s rounded back expanded and so remained ; the assistant , at the switch-board , pulled the handle
to save and conserve paper meant to save cellulose , meant the conservation of our forests , the protection of human material that was used up in the manufacture of cellulose and paper—human material and capital
and now began a festival , a triumph , an unbounded orgy of this very figure , which now displayed a wealth of dynamic colour which passed through every octave , wept and shivered in tremolo , sang , rejoiced , and sobbed in exultation , triumphantly adorned with all the bursting , linkling , foaming , purling resources of orchestral pomp
hard to say why , but in his mouth , alto- gether in connection with him , there was something dismaying about it , something wherein anxiety mixed in an odd way with reverence
senator buddenbrook sat alone in the living-room , which was done in olive-green rep , with a large round centre-table and a great gas-lamp hanging down over it from the ceiling
he is lumpy and lazy , and he caused you a cruel disappointment
i only say to myself that wherever theology is , and certainly in so meaty a personality as ehrenfried kumpf , there too the devil belongs to the picture and asserts his complementary reality to that of god
the social life of meng street had been extinguished with the death of consul johann buddenbrook
they reached a rotunda with covered galleries , where a band was giving a concert
and the agitations , the consultations , the struggles of opinion took their course
the ceremonies by which the evil one had sealed his pact with the old crone came out bit by bit under re- peated pressure , and were hair-raising
she was entirely reasonable about her own guilt and did not pretend that she had been seduced- on the contrary , carl , the chauffeur , had even said : it 's no good , fraulein , better not , but it had been stronger than she was , and she had always been ready to pay with death , and would do , and being ready for death , so it seemed to her , made up for the vvhole
oh , ida , do come here a minute
no , you are mistaken
never had it been filled by such reeking pipe-smoke ; such unpleasantly easy manners were foreign to it
she shaped the words with her lips and gave them voice out of her white throat ; it was the voice , not deep , but with the slightest edge , and pleasantly husky , that hans castorp knew—had known so long ago and yet heard so lately , swing : with pleasure , only you must be sure to give it me back after the lesson
it was not all intelligible , for she spoke into the folds of her mother 's stuff gown , and broke into her own nar-rative with explosions of passionate anger
do we eat now ?
and what does he an- swer them ?
what , he asked , about plotinus , then , who was known to have said that he was ashamed of having a body ?
what are we thinking of ?
he was bathed in perspiration ; yet he felt frozen in every limb
the young man accordingly took his leave
the jesuit , a much-travelled and cultured person , a judge and fisher of men , pedagogue by passion and conviction , pricked up his ears at the scornful tone , the clearly articulated sentences , in which the poor jewish lad answered his first questions
the decency to leave her post after a while , whereon the other adoring soul occupied it straightway
foxy-loxy is in the same boat with the rest of us after all !
if one of them had dragged the other ’ s good name in the dirt , if it was a question of a woman , or anything else really momentous , that you could take hold of , so that you felt there was no possibility of reconciliation !
tony paid little or no attention to sievert tiburtius and his betrothed -- which troubled them not at all
i hope , engineer , you have nothing against malice ?
dijhlmann -- in a voice loud enough so that all the people who did not already know the story could laugh at the joke
it had been odd , in church and at the table , to see the same sign in his father too
there was some hope for germany of social progress in peace and freedom ; of adult and forward-iooking effort ; of a voluntary adaptation of our thoughts and feelings to those of the normal world
she adored expressions of a cheap and common stamp , worn threadbare by over-use , which got on hans castorp ’ s nerves—as , for example , you haven ’ t the faintest idea !
the christian middle ages clearly recognized the inherent capitalism of the secular state : money will be emperor ’ is a prophecy made in the eleventh century
it would come , this war , and it would be a good thing , though the consequences of it would not be those anticipated by its authors
the other day he was telling me about dynamic drugs and asiatic poison-trees ; it was so interesting it was almost uncanny—interesting things are always a bit uncanny—but the interest was not so much in what he was saying as it was taken in connexion with his personality , which made it interesting and uncanny at once
have i had a revelation ?
monic , the german word for that is the instincts
but herr settembrini shook his head
old buddenbrook used his gold snuff-box
to it many factors contributed : masculine rascality , fenlinine frailty , feminine pride and professional unsuc- cess
i too prefer an intelligent ailing person to a consumptive idiot
he murmured that it was a shame , but added to console himself that even if he were up and about he would hardly know how to take advantage of it , since it seemed it did not answer for him to exert himself much
in this way we were always separate from each other in time , but the melodic presence of each kept together pleasantly with that of the others and what , ve produced made a graceful web , a body of sound such as unison singing did not ; a texture in whose polyphony we delighted without inquiring after its nature and ca
it was the expression all of us up here , which joachim had used several times , that had somehow struck him as strange and given him an uneasy feeling
tony sat down apart with another book , and herr gr� softly questioned : our book is not to your taste , fraulein ?
she stood at gerda 's side to receive the visits of condolence in the living-room and there was no end of these ; their name was legion
we ’ ve come for a little visit , said hans castorp , with his eyes more on the pious horror in the corner than on the owner of the surprising room , who was expressing his gratification that the cousins had kept their word
it is not certain what he meant by 'the rest , probably various things , both love and art
tears stood out in them , from the effort of the forced breathing and coughing and they gazed into space with a pathetic expression as the examination went on
she seemed to try to concentrate her gaze and make it penetrate ; but it slipped aside
i will tell you , tom
he jested : what do i hear , engineer ?
ah knows as iverybody gits summat as comes here to-day , but ah bai not come fer that , an ' so ah tells ye !

frau schwarzkopf made excuses for tony 's room , whither she had already been to make herself tidy after the journey
she was feeling again the sense of in-creased personal importance first experienced when herr gr� proposed for her hand
i hope you do not think i mean i do not like to be with you , papa
yea verily , dear mates , that art is stuck and grown too heavy and scorneth itselfe and god 's poor man knoweth no longer where to turn in his sore plight , that is belike the fault in the times
under a deep blue sky , the two-colourrd flag floated above all the houses , ri^ht down fi^hfiv lane , frnm broad street to the wharf , where the wullenwrwri and thr fiiederike dverdierk ' lay under full flap , in their owner 's honour
i suppose i ave not wished for it , be- cause iny pity is too deep , my grief and sympathy are with this unhappy nation , when i think of the exaltation and blind ardour of its uprising , the breaking-out , the breaking-up , the breaking- down ; the purifying and fresh start , the national new birth of ten years ago , that seemingly religious intoxication - which then be- trayed itself to any intelligent person for what it was by its crud- ity , vulgarity , gangsterism , sadism , degradation , filthiness - ah , how unmistakably it bore within itself the seeds of this whole war !
she held herself very erect , chin in , and looked down at the world from above
created being the free viii to turn away from god - which would have been an incomplete creation , yes , positively not a creation at all , but a surrender on the part of god
for death was only the logical negation of life ; but between life and inanimate nature yawned a gulf which research strove in vain to bridge
hans castorp did not assist in person at the successive episodes ; but was informed of its involved and dramatic course by means of certain documents , protocols and formal declarations , touching the affair , circulated not only in the house and without , not only in the village , the canton , and the country , but even abroad and in america ; and presented for the consideration of persons who most certainly were not in the faintest degree interested in the circumstances
because if i am left up here—as i shall be , if he goes down , for it is out of the question for me to go with him—if i am left up here , it is for ever ; alone i should never find my way back
she was very musical , a pianist , a chopin enthusiast , a writer on schubert ; on friendly terms with more than one bearer of a great name in the contemporary , vorld of music
see what coal-black eyes she has !
the director was a silesian by birth
settembrini came , was very affectionate and charming , and called joachim capitana , instead of lieutenant as before
she drew her hand out of her shawl and gave it to him , a veined , emaciated , yellowish hand , with many rings , as she continued to gaze in his face
his active figure showed indistinctly against the dark red curtains , the only gleams of white being from his powdered hair and the lace frill at his throat
give me some reason
the young man weighed that possibility for a second , standing with lowered lids
as a neutral party , perhaps— the presence of such an one was a part of the prescribed chivalrous mitigations—he might be present
ah , that was not the effect thomas buddenbrook looked for from the influence of his own personality upon his son 's !
more doubt that he was indeed possessed
out with the gas !
his mid rile-class instincts rose against them -- and his vanity , too : the fear of being eccentric , of playing a laughable role
i do not under-stand -- it is from berlin
such was the multiple state of life , sprung from the union of two parent cells , the association of many non-sexually originated generations of cell units ; its growth meant their increase , and the generative circle came full again when sexcells , specially developed elements for the purpose of reproduction , had established themselves and found the way to a new mingling that drove life on afresh
the fact displays the inborn tendency of music to superstitious rites and observances , the sym- bolism of nulnbers and letters
but for the rest , his brilliant display of arithmetic had simply been so much dust thrown in his cousin ’ s eyes ; for here , as elsewhere , his mental processes were rather slow than fast , and the truth is that a previous calculation with pencil and paper underlay his present facility
however , fate was unkind , and the bargain came to light
if this failed - and it stood v/ritten that it must fail- then , whatever we might still for years accomplish , we were lost in principle and before we began : this time , next time , always
no , he sat there to be alone : to recall and go over in his mind the events and impressions of the past months
dr morris was nar-row-chested and yellow-skinned , and he talked very gaily , showing pointed teeth with gaps between them
we make money with the joint-stock brewery , that niederpaur is director of
clavdia took no interest in the mannheimer—had she done so , it would not have escaped hans castorp ’ s perception ; in this case it was not the dart of jealousy he felt pierce his soul
he himself had not expressed his own actual thoughts , his real misgivings
the sick person had no real right to it
for ' v £ brahms meant ie dernier ennui
he was feeling rather out of sorts himself ; he went to the platform and sat down buddenbrdok in the master 's chair , where he began to rock back and forth , scowling
do you too advise me to -- to -- to yield my consent ?
now and then he would start up , rub his hand over his bald brow , and murmur , yes , it 's frightfully sad
herr kesselmeyer 's face took on a serious expression which was vastly becoming to it
do you know what makes you go red and pale ?
he set more store by discipline than any of the other masters : he would reveiw the ranks of sturdy youngsters with a professional eye , and he insisted on short , brisk answers to questions
have we perhaps already made up our mind ?
i am aware you tend to do so , and are in the habit of saying that these conditions produce nothing fixed and stable enough to guarantee the harmony of the self-sufficient work
two great tears rolled down his cheeks and ran into the golden whiskers
adrian had seen from the train the rohmbtihel vvith its crown of trees , the grey mirror of the klammer ; now his eyes rested on these sights from close at hand
thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people
two days later , passing the room with joachim , hans castorp saw that it was being turned out
to speak of sorrow would be disingenuous
but still the faint scratching sound of the pen went on , over several more pages
he would have liked to stop behind in an easy-chair in the landscape-room and indulge the reveries that the music conjured up ; but his duties as host bring some coffee and cigars into the billiard-room , he said to the maid whom he met in the entry
ida jungmann confined herself to making a deep bow , while she played with the silver watch-chain on her flat bosom
behrens mean him to understand the title ?
joachim ’ s bearing became even more correct
in brief , our traveller was now over head and ears in love with clavdia chauchat— we may still use the phrase , since we have already obviated any possible misunderstanding on the score of it
i am sure i went the colour of a turkey-cock for laughing , while listening to a discussion , pursued with the same intellectual satisfaction as before , about the growing tendency of dentists to pull out forthwith all teeth with dead nerves ; since it had been concluded - after a long , painstaking , and refined de- velopment in the nineteenth-century technique of root treatment - that they were to be regarded as infectious foreign bodies
a tiny mole , at the point where the breasts began to divide , had been done with care , and on their rounding surfaces one thought to trace the delicate blue veins
she was in the habit of leaving the light burning on her balcony and stealing off to seek distraction in the quarter below
he has enough gift , herr pfiihl said , and nodded
thus the elder art did not know rhythm as music later understood it
the conception of the apocalyptic oratorio , the secret preoccu pation with it , then , went far back into a time of apparently com- plete exhaustion , and the vehemence and rapidity , vith which afterwards , in a few months , it was put on paper always gave me the idea that that period of prostration had been a sort of refuge and retreat , into which his nature withdrew , in order that , unspied on , unsuspected , in some hidden sanctuary , shut avvay by suffering from our healthy life , he might preserve and develop conceptions for which ordinary well-being would never sunmon the reckless courage
yes , said tom , i understand what you mean very well , tony
but i will be quite open with you - as open as you have been with me
and the way it proved not to be was really beautiful
casually he displayed letters from foreign potentates of the society : one from the very hand of the swiss grand master , brother quartier la tente , of the thirty-third degree ; and discussed the proposal to make esperanto the official language of the body
'the duke was very likely a feather-brained and seditious person , and as for the prisoners , their execution was probably the deliberate and necessary policy of a council of war
you wouldn ’ t believe it
i-low quickly one learns to tie a white tie , to enter a salon with complete noncha- lance , even if it goes a few steps down , and to forget the sensa- tion that you do not l { now what to do with your hands !
he jumped violently ; then , in these straits , he smiled exactly as though nothing had hap-pened and took his place before the middle row of benches , stooping sideways , in his customary attitude , and resting one palm on the desk in front of him
you are a lout , he said , not to like it
that was the time of the reasonable worship of god , of a generation of theologians in , vhose n

these were frau iltis and herr albin ; they wore cardboard placards , on which were written the silent sister and the blue peter ; together , with sidling gait they moved through the room
there was probably buddenbro dks nothing very permanent about it at that time , and it was re-built again , on the trave
on the hard upper facet of the precious beryl two lines were graven in the tiniest greek characters

at worst , the experiment would have a negative result—which could hardly be called unfavourable , since even without it the patient must stop on in any case !
she did it all the time , to enjoy the aris- tocratic service and assure herself of the protection and care she

madame chauchat wore a blue frock with a white lace collar
le ship and plunged into the , vater , crystal-clear at first , ] i ; hted by the sun
get up , gr� , she said , sobbing
it is covered up with flesh and put away once and for all ; nobody and nothing ought to come near it
i think the citizens -- then you feel lonely ?
you have a conscience like a butcher 's dog , and yet you are nothing but a ninny , a scapegoat
he met his brother 's remonstrances with a mor-tified air , making no defence , and for a few days would apply himself with somewhat more zeal to the english correspond-ence
they had declared , the heads , in the accents of a corps-student , that they were on track of the actual causes of the instability of hans castorp ’ s heating economy
my dear sir , what do you think of me ?
no truth may be written or taught which might not agree with the established order of things
if my conviction is worth anything , it was certainly not written after our visit to the moun- tain village or during our stay there
he had a head full of remark-able bumps , to which his blond hair clung as smooth as glass ; grey eyes with black rings beneath them , and long brown buddenbrook hands that stuck out beneath the too short sleeves of his neatly brushed jacket
the gentlemen have an eloquent advocate
i know him well , have been friendly with him for a long time ; he was kind enough to take me up , because he found i was a delicate child of life
how he looked , she heard , when they brought him !
i do not know how much of the situation you know or suspect
or , on the contrary , did they seem much longer than had actually been the case ?
he looked at his cousin , who only shrugged indifferently with brows and shoulders , as though to say : well , what of it ?
they pressed their arms to their sides , stood on their tip-toes , bent their heads , and bit their tongues in the fervour of their devotion
they describe with unearthly terror the sign of an epiphany of the god at his shrine
thus she went about in the town like a little queen ; and like a queen , she was kind or cruel to her subjects , as the whim seized her
yes , but wait a bit—if you had been there , you wouldn ’ t have known what kind of
a spacious cabinet , like another room , was built into the wall of his dressing-room ; and here , on long rows of hooks , on wooden hangers , were coats , smoking jackets , frock-coals , evening clothes , clothes for all occasions , all seasons , and all grades of formality ; the care-fully creased trousers were arranged on chairs beneath
he bent over his plate , turned his head away , and looked as though he wanted to sink through the floor ; and several times he interrupted her with a low , tormented good cod , tony !
she prob- ably thought that once accepted by the family , once married to henri and safe in another country , she would find ways and
it is pleasant to celebrate the past , when one is gratified with the present and the future
he sat up straight on the sofa , with one knee crossed over the other , puffed at his cigar , knit his brows a little , and mar-shalled his figures with wonderful fluency
i have had a card from munich too , from eva ewers
mynheer peeperkorn , genuinely thirsty , drank down glass after glass of the simple , effervescent drink
upon classical learning - luther had personally little enough of it - as the source of the spiritual turmoil
this was received with enthusiasm , though dr blumenkohl , whose state had now much altered for the worse , muttered something to himself , with the expression peculiar to him upon his face , or rather upon his lips ; he seemed to be asking what sort of verses were these
but the rules stood in the way , and hans castorp resolved to act behind his back
nothing in them but the orsini bombs
according to programme , hans castorp drew in deep draughts of the pure morning air , the fresh , light atmosphere that breathed in so easily , that held no hint of damp , that was without associations , without content
i call it very feeble of them
only a little further— supposing one were to give way to the temptation , and his temptation was great ; it was so strong that it quite lived up to the many descriptions he had read of the typical danger-state
but why so testy ?
his father and pastor wunder-lich could be seen to exchange the smallest of smiles
a matter of decades ?
on the previous day , the th of march , — , he was able to confirm the fact of the said calumny and detraction by the mouth of an immediate witness to the conversation in which the offensive words and insinuations had been uttered
he tried to speak , but no words came
hence our holy duty of feeling , hence the shame in unfeelingness , in powerlessness to awaken the woman to desire
here too the stove was burning merrily , behind a brass lattice
the will no longer availed
he found her excitation , or rather the expression of it , somehow unsuitable , almost offensive , in so homely and insignificant a creature
he talked a great deal , laughed without reason , struck his nephew with his fist in the pit of the stomach , shouting : hullo there , old fellow !
one does not at bottom understand that , one just accepts it as a well-bred man should , in objective respect for a law of nature - and indeed the attitude of a man is usually more tolerant and benevolent than that of a woman , who mostly casts a jealous eye on a friend who tells her a man is in love with her , even though she cares nothing at all for the man
i could not be seen with it here , you understand
obviously the system of this kingly man stood in more than common need of moistening
for the station of landquart lies at a relatively low altitude , but now the wild and rocky route pushes grimly onward into the alps themselves
thought the consul to himself , bowing as the company lifted their glasses
but / heard it , and it was a word that -- a word -- oh , it was that word , let me tell you , thomas , that caused me , to spend the whole night packing my trunk , to wake erica early in the morning , and to leave the place , rather than to remain in the neighbourhood of a man who could utter such words
so you think your wife is ruining you ?
they were not certain half-human beings settembrini corrected him
what do you mean by that ?
again he had learned that beauty can pierce one like a pain , and that it can sink profoundly into shame and a longing despair that utterly consume the courage and energy necessary to the life of every day
did he find things easier , for that ?
the little one looked up at grandfather ’ s narrow grey head , bending over the basin
and little johann stammered , retreating , with his hand to his cheek , i thought -- i thought -- there was nothing else coming ,
he sat straighter , higher , stiff er than ever , without touching the cushions
funny , joachim said , bending forward to look at his cousin , on herr settembrini ’ s farther side
music was heard ; the tapir-faced lady was playing handel ’ s largo on the violin , and then a drawing-room sonata by grieg , characteristically northern in mood
i felt myself that the image was inapplicable to the extremes of adrian 's nature , his swing between penitential paralysis and compensating creative re lease
he went on to say that in behaviour , in action , determinism did indeed rule ; there was no freedom of choice
it shouts for a campaign against the fall in the birth-rate , it demands a reduction in the cost of bringing up children and training them to a profession—and meanwhile men are herded like cattle , and all the trades and professions are so overcrowded that the fight round the feeding-trough puts in the shade the horrors of past wars
i refrain from quoting it , merely characterizing it as a human document which affects the reader like the baring of a wound and whose painful lack of reserve the writer probably considered an utter- most hazard
then he listened at the patient 's chest and felt his pulse
after gerda buddenbrook had watched her son a little , she decided that he must have piano lessons
but , after all , was it not best thus ?
hans castorp knew , for had not those events visited himself with justifiable pangs ? —even her way of turning , before she sat down , to present herself , as it were , to the room , she had as of yore
such was the announcement settembrini had made , that easter sunday
and here ’ s the libretto , he said , and gestured with his head toward a little case on the wall , filled with broad-backed albums
there is a case of a party of miners , buried and shut off from every possibility of knowing the passage of day or night , who told their rescuers that they estimated the time they had spent in darkness , flickering between hope and fear , to be some three days
as you grew , said jonathan to us , and you can easily prove it by feeling your elbows and ribs , you formed in your insides a solid structure , a skeleton which gives your flesh and muscles sta- bility , and which you carry round inside you - unless it be more correct to say it carries you around
the lady in front of him did , indeed , turn her head as he sat down , and measured him with narrow eyes
as your father says , you have time to consider , the frau consul continued
in my view theology can not be mod- ern - one may reckon that to its advantage , of course - and as for symbolism , i cann , dt see why one should take hell more sym- bolically than heaven
he despised , he scorned it , and himself ; but had reached the point where it obliged him , every few days , to take to his bed
leipzig , friday after purificationis s in the peterstrasse , hozlse the th most honourable , most illustrious , learned , and \-vell-beloved magister and ballisticus !
i have been with my brother -- on pressing business
ah , yes , it is well and truly dreamed
but how long , or how short , it actually is , that nobody knows
i generally take a match
after our roast fowl rudi schwerdtfeger could stand it no longer and made up his mind to let his light shine , as it says in the good book
but to continue with the most indispensable facts in my vita : my parents allowed me to attend our gymnasium , the same school where , two forms below me , adrian was taught
the knowledge of drugs possessed by the coloured races was far superior to our own
well , to arrive at the point , this young lady looked so charming as walter tell , wore her brooch and spoke her lines with such effect , that christian felt his heart swell with en-thusiasm , and tears rose to his eyes
vale , he said , and god be with you , leverklihn
but in social intercourse he was more apt than his son to draw the line rigidly and give the cold shoulder to strangers
uncle christian was the only person who did not display this grown-up arrogance
herr grunlich , on his side , bowed with deliberation , al-though one corner of his mouth seemed to go down
a little resigned curl of the lip , or a shrug of the shoulders in their blue sailor suit , would be the only answer
then everything grew quiet , the phenomena disappeared , and joachim let out his breath with a sigh
hans castorp and he sometimes made their daily round together
they passed among the hat- and coat-racks and entered the light , low-vaulted hall , where there was a buzzing of voices , a clattering of dishes , and a running to and fro of waitresses with steaming jugs
- let us not dwell on the odd circumstance , which became second nature to me , but drop it and return to buchel
true to our principle of making him out neither better nor worse than he was , we assert that he simply declined—not expressly and consciously , but quite naïvely , declined to let his judgment of his own sex be perverted by romantic considerations
the object , cried one , the other : the ego !
now dr mantelsack crossed his legs , still standing , and began to turn over the leaves of his notebook
he declared himself to the party of conservation and of life , and struck out against the decadent spirit which hid itself behind all that seraphic cant
are you making fun of me ?
dr krokowski ’ s smile retreated as it were , lost for the moment something of its genial warmth
a belief , a given conception of the universe , an idea—in short , a will , is always in existence ; which it is the task of the intellect to expound and demonstrate
at all events , the young man ’ s activity during these days confined itself to a visit to behrens ; a consultation of which joachim was aware , the result of which he could have accurately predicted beforehand
the candles burned down slowly in their sockets
the irritation was probably the same in kind as that which coloured her feeling toward herr settembrini , the humanist and haranguer , whom she could not abide , calling him arrogant , not hu—man
there were long sums that rovnred both sides of the slate with additions , subtractions , multipli-cations , and divisions , and had to come out to zero in the end ; otherwise there was a mistake , and they must hunt and hunt till they had found the little beast and exterminated him
hans castorp , on this subject , received a singular impression : it was that a certain fundamental fact of life , which is conceded the world over to be of great importance , and is the fertile theme of constant allusion , both in jest and earnest , that this fundamental fact of life bore up here an entirely altered emphasis
he was going to the wars : the rhythm changed , grew brisk and lively , dull care and sorrow might go hang !
he stood up at last , flung joachim ’ s coverlet on the bed , and got something out that sounded like a good-night : don ’ t freeze to death ; call me again in the morning , his lips hardly shaping the words ; then he staggered along the corridor to his own room
come here , tom , said frau permaneder uncertainly
yes , yes , she said ; this is very sad , tony
well , the bad thing about it is , that erica is a little bit inclined to be melancholy
yet hans castorp found the patience-players even worse
but he always ate a good deal , out of pure self-respect , even when he was not hungry
it had contracted almost painfully at the moment when the glass door slammed , for to that moment he had looked forward with his breath coming thick and fast
then came , in a long , black procession , the slow drive through the grey , misty streets out through the burg thor , along the leafless avenue in a cold driving rain , to the ceme-tery , where the funeral march sounded behind half-bare shrubbery on the edge of the little grove , and the great sand-stone cross marked the buddenbrook family lot
he went up to gerda , who sat there alone , reading , and put out his hand
she confided in herself to hold and bind him , in her
they are in a position to build a rival railway : east holstein , neuminster , neustadt -- yes , that is quite on the cards
as ye now are , my protean friend , i look to find you ready to quench my thirst for knowledge and concll\ively demonstrate your independent presence by telling me not only things i l { now but also of some i would like to know
national nation of industry , which some day can form a right and genuine european economic society
perhaps rudi would find it more understandable when he heard what he had to say
a youthful looking man with a blond pointed beard kept order down here : dr goldener , the dressy one
do you think i would carry it into court and sue my own mother , and add a public scandal to the family one ?
christmas came : the first christmas without the frau consul
but my mental state is only a variant of that which , aside from cases of ordinary self-interest or extraordinary stupidity , has become the destiny of a whole people ; and this destiny i am inclined to consider in the light of a unique and peculiar tragedy , even while i realize that it has been before now laid on other nations , for the sake of their o , vn and the general future , to wish for the downfall of their state
the cousins sat down on an empty bench to watch and criticize the game
his lips seemed to take a certain pleasure in forming the words
she had been in the family now for more than thirty years
he is a devotee of your vice
the gentlemen had seemed serious people to her , whereas painters were mostly a loose lot , without much feeling for the serious things of life - she did not mean the practical side , earning money and that , no , when she said serious she meant the dark side of life , its hardships and trou- bles but she did not mean to be unfair to artists : her lodgers , for instance , had been an exception to that kind of light-headed gen- try , he being a quiet , reserved sort of man , rather low-spirited if anything - and his pictures had looked like that too , the atmos- phere of the moors , and the lonely woods and meadows , yes , it was perhaps surprising that director stiglmayer should have bought one , the gloomiest of all , of course he was a financial man but maybe he had a streak of melancholy himself
there are assistant masters , you may know , and there are head masters ; but never by any chance a plain master
the buddenbrooks in broad street think she is very like him too
the trouble , a catarrh of the apex of the lung , then seemed to have been cured , and through- out the ten years that passed before the birth of her youngest , little nepomuk , ursula had been a capable wife and mother to her family , although the years of privation during and after the war took the bloom off her health
when pressed to speak , she con- fesses that this little dog is actually her own all-too-chaste daughter , who by reason of the unbending denial of her favour to a young man on fire for her had driven him to his death ; and now , in punishment therefor , she has been turned into this shape and of course constantly weeps tears of despair over her doggish estate
but herr albin was inexorable
one did not feel the cold , it might have been much less , for the dryness and absence of wind deprived it of sting
i was also irritated by the presence of bullinger , the manufacturer ; he , vas legitimated only by his high income tax , but he talked dogmati- cally on the loftiest cultural themes
nothing , answered the player , with a short shake of the head , more like the gesture with which one shakes off a fly
raising her fists , she hurled her curses down on our heads , repeating three times : jechants !
they were probably all his wardrobe could boast
was such a hope , after all , entirely vain ?
the frau consul , christian , clothilde , clara , and ida jungmann stood above on the landing to greet her
one always wills one ’ s fate
he had long ceased to be a beginner in music , that curiously cabbalistic craft , at once playful and profound , artful and austere , when he placed himself again under the guidance , direction , su- pervision of wendell kretschmar in leipzig
there was no size to the infinite ; in eternity was neither duration nor change
tell me : you did not like this herr gr�
and the honey , tom , i have always considered honey one of the very best of foods
ay , answered behrens , and shrugged his shoulders
many happy returns , herr se noter , many happy -- ' n ' one is rich ' n ' great , ' n ' t'other 's pore -- yes , yes , grobleben , you are right , that 's just how it is !
the car-riage stopped before the terrace
the classroom suddenly became full of noise and movement
in particular it did not suit frau stöhr , the skin of whose arms was too porous ; such a fashion was distinctly not for her
morten , said tony , sadly
but thomas betrayed himself to his sister tony , when they said good-bye on the street one thursday evening , and she alluded to the pbppenrade harvest
but , like the other easy men of pleasure in the community , he knew how to avoid trouble by wearing the proper expression and saying the proper thing
but before september was out she had returned , saying she did not feel well at home
he never , it is true , quite reconciled himself to tristan , though he eventually carried out gerda 's wish and made a very clever arrangement of the liebestod for violin and piano
what do you think -- where shall we put it ?
it is the end of everything , she burst out another time , in sheer despair , and flung her arms around her sister-in-law 's neck with loud weeping
clara comes into pleasant connections , in any case , and the position as pastor 's wife will be very suited to her temperament
but if they were , then , however impossibly small they were , they must themselves be built up , organically built up , as a law of their existence ; for the conception of a living unit meant by definition that it was built up out of smaller units which were subordinate ; that is , organized with reference to a higher form
and may one ask , he queried , whom , or what—you see i am all question , i ask even how to ask—whom , or what you envisage as the bringer of this—this—i repeat the word with some unwillingness—this terror ?
herr settembrini duly gave him a dressing-down , and did produce a temporary reaction of the conscience , even something like a promise to steer clear in the future of such abominations
it was midsummer before he made up his mind to go
gradually he widened the sphere of his activities
there was an elderly man from somewhere in the back blocks of austria , a one-time sculptor , with white moustaches , a hooked nose and blue eyes ; who had conceived a project , financial and political in its scope , and drawn it up most meticulously in a calligraphic hand , colouring the important points in sepia
are you a little girl ?
insights fundamentally remote from nly own na- tive easy-goingness he expressed in talk as casua aper
hanno 's and kai 's conversation was in striking contrast to that which went on ardund them , among their fellows
v be paid for
i am no country innocent , i tell you ; and the affair with babette would not have made me go off the handle like that , just by itself
yes , i know , the brenner frontier
one and all of them , but expressly the flowers , and of these more expressly the hosts of tuberoses , were there to palliate the other aspect of death , the side which was neither beautiful nor exactly sad , but somehow almost improper—its lowly , physical side—to slur it over and prevent one from being conscious of it
hans castorp might look forward to the pleasure of seeing him
dr faustus dear to me , one of which is the highly subjectivizing contrast feel between the nature of the artist and that of the ordinary man
and you are an out-and-out critic and sceptic , i must say
this child , sooner than any of us , was privileged to get an insight into the drafts of the score of ariel 's songs , on which adrian \-vas privately at work
and the latter answered indifferently : nothing new
is not it because there was crooked work four years ago ?
imself before the pub- hc through music , music being the occasion he took
a poor thing—but yours , he said , brow to brow with her , speaking down upon the pencil , stiff-lipped , so that most of the labials went unsounded
father , she said -- for in these conversations she never railed him papa -- father , how is our affair going on ?
but he was paralyzed
then , as one gets used to the place , a gradual shrinkage makes itself felt
the room was not much more than adequate , with some slight indication of middle-class amenity in the shape of a red plush cover on the square table in front of the sofa , where his books lay and he drank his breal { fast coffee
he realized at once that he had used the hard word buddenbroks instinctively to frighten her , and he added : he can work himself up again , of course
press your breast against it , as though it filled you with rapture
consequently one must take steps to warn people of what is coming and do one 's best to prevent it
you rather like mixing in matters that are not harmless , but you treat them as though they were and think to find favour in the eyes of god and man
he well knew that long letters were neither asked nor expected , it being no humanistic or literary circle to which he addressed himself down there , and the replies he received were equally lacking in expansiveness
cried herr gr� , springing to his feet
i did no work saturday , because the next day was sunday ; and i did no work on sunday , because it was sunday !
unconscious and tranquil , with his soft curling hair and voluminous pinafore frocks , he played in the garden by the fountain , or in the little gallery partitioned off far his use by a pillared tailing from the vestibule of the second storey -- played the plays of his four and a half years -- those plays whose meaning and charm no grown person can possibly grasp : which need no more than a few pebbles , or a stick of wood with a dande-lion for a helmet , since they command the pure , powerful , glowing , untaught and unintimidated fancy of those blissful years before life touches us , when neither duty nor remorse dares to lay upon us a finger 's weight , when we may see , hear
everything about him was sharp : the hooked nose dominating his face , the narrow , pursed mouth , the thick , bevelled lenses of his glasses in their light frame , behind which were a pair of pale-grey eyes—even the silence he preserved , which suggested that when he broke it , his speech would be incisive and logical
even the barbaric pair at the bad russian table had taken notice of the day : he by exchanging his leather jacket for a short coat , and the felt boots for leather shoes ; she , though she still wore the soiled feather boa , by putting on a green silk blouse with a neck-ruche
frau hagenstrbm whispered to frau sena-tor mbllendorpf
you ’ ll get off by the autumn , the old un has more or less committed himself to that
told of her respectable , tiresome husband , her no less respectable and tiresome children , who were precisely like their father , and for whom she had not been able to feel great warmth of affection ; of the half boy , half man with whom she had fled , whose poetic tenderness she never tired of describing
a man could know that and recognize freedom above and beyond all critique
so well-read a girl , one might say psychologically trained , keeping watch with a poet 's eye upon her own experiences must certainly have had an insight into the growth of her own feeling - however surprising , yes , un- believable the development might have seemed to her at first
they even went abroad together , took walks with herr ferge and wehsal , naphta and settembrini , those opposed spirits , whom they could hardly fail to meet
there did not lacl { much for their zeal in destroying the things of the spirit - a zeal that is entirely foreign to the masses - to have made sacrifice of the works of the hero of these pages , adrian leverktihn
the october terminus had slipped by and no man named it , neither the hofrat nor the cousins between themselves
the youthful listener would perceive the distinction , even the opposition , between foreign and domestic freedom ; also note the ticklish question , which unfreedom was soonest—he he ! —which least compatible with a nation ’ s honour
to put it briefly , my father had , before my sister 's mar-riage , a round sum of nine hundred thousand marks net , not counting , of course , real estate , and the stock and good will of the firm
said hans castorp , taken aback , and still seated
the troublesome child—that i have been for you , in your capacity as pedagogue—you remember , you came to speak of that on the first day we met , it is one of the associations you have taught me , the relation between humanism and pedagogy ; and there are many others i shall think of as time goes on
but on the whole i must say i find it cheap rather than dear , considering what they offer , and before second breakfast they went down to the management in order that hans castorp might acquit himself of his debt
he knew the name and circumstances of each patient
hans castorp regarded him earnestly as they drove
consul hermann hagenstrbm supports his considerable weight on the balustrade , breathes heavily into his red beard , and talks with senator dr cremer , the chief of police , whose brown beard , mixed with grey , frames a smiling face expressive of a sort of gentle slyness
the lawyer apparently no longer practised his profes- sion , he only read the newspaper , read it indeed all the time ; on hot days he permitted himself to do it sitting in his room in his drawers , with the door open
they sent for sister leandra , and she came
one was , indeed , compelled to recognize in the hierarchy a force making for freedom : had it not set limits to the boundless pretensions of monarchy ?
often enough , from his youth onwards , he had sternly brought his feelings into line
but then when he had shaken hands all round he came back and said good- bye again , quite simply , so that one was able to respond
the truth was , peeperkorn said , and lifted his head from the pillow , elevated the arabesques on his brow , and gave point to his remarks by the little circle and the upright finger-tips—the truth was , in the world of matter , that all substances were the vehicle of both life and death , all of them were medicinal and all poisonous , in fact therapeutics and toxicology were one and the same , man could be cured by poison , and substances known to be the bearer of life could kill at a thrust , in a single second of time
very good indeed , said the doctor
he would have been sought in vain within her walls
more than that , the estates had paid for themselves over and over , with the entrance fees drawn from the romantic curiosity of two helnispheres
even hans castorp laughed ; but this , however humiliating it was to his better feelings , was nothing compared to the tales that circulated about a certain lawyer from jüterbog , einhuf by name ; a man perhaps forty years old , with a pointed beard and very hairy hands , who had taken the swede ’ s place at herr settembrini ’ s table
the sound , that is , had thus been thrown up to the rather low ceiling of the hall , and it had seemed as though the notes , unlike any familiar to man , and in any case unlike any known church music , floated down thence and hovered angeli- cally above the heads of the assemblage
tony laid the wreath on the tablet , where her father 's name stood on the stone in fresh gold letters : then , despite the snow , she knelt down by the grave to pray
this simply was not the fact ; but she saw it , and it made her happy
an absurd remark , if you like
one doesn ’ t know what to make of it ; one wants to feel a proper respect for illness , of course—after all there is a certain dignity about it , if you like
for business reasons - this and that
he had heard his name often enough from frau antonie , and he threw a quick glance at his sister as he greeted herr permaneder in his most fascinating manner
i forgot to mention that there was in the schweigestill court- yard , adrian 's later home , and certainly not surprisingly , a stable- girl , with bosoms that shook as she ran and bare feet caked , vith dung ; she looked as much like i-ianne of buchel as one stable-girl does look like another , and in the reproduction was named walt- purgis
but here now was naphta on the side of the soul and disease , wherein alone true nobility and humanity resided , while settembrini flung himself into advocacy of nature and her noble sanity , regardless of his inconsistency on the score of emancipation from her
but hans castorp answered : let be
you must forgive me , then , and not think too hardly of me
he had been attacked by a stomach ailment , not yielding to any dietary measures , beginning 'with violent headache , lasting several days and recurring in a few more ; with hours , yes , whole days of retching from an empty stonach , sheer misery , undigni- fied , niggling , humiliating , ending in utter exhaustion and per- sistent sensitivity to light after the attack had { > assed
how can the herr consul say that after his speech in the assembly -- ?
are you making a complaint of him ?
he went in , whereupon the bell above the door began to give tongue , like a little watch-dog
albeit inasmuch as the glass is set and the sand has begun to run ; for this reason , my good man , i would fain come to an understanding with you
dh , that 's ton good !
he recalled the contemptuous gesture of the humanist when he spoke of the parthians and scythians in whose company he was forced to take the rest-cure
george looked more like his father too , while adrian physi- cally resembled the mother - though again there is a discrepancy , for it was adrian , not george , who inherited the tendency to mi- graine
but these experts are in the aforementioned box
two human beings , buried alive , their lungs full of pit gas , would here together—or , more horrible still , one after the other—succumb to the pangs of hunger , and thereafter the process of putrefaction would do its unspeakable work , until two skeletons remained , each totally indifferent and insensible to the other ’ s presence or absence
for well you knew that your proletarian soul could of its own strength bring no art form to birth ; and you hoped to defeat antiquity with its own weapons
how do i know ?
i will support the laws of the state and do justice on all alike , whether rich or poor
and when we talk about the excursion we are ac- tually on the subject - a subject about which you could oblige me very much
the youth of the place had got hold of the treatise before those of riper years ; studying it in part in groups , after supper , in their various rooms
everything possible for the vvagner of painting !
he was not more polite to one than to the other
he had not had the heart to leave her in the lurch at this hour ; and he now walked to the middle of thii room to meet their d guests , while tony remained on the sofa
people were beginning to find him a little ludicrous ; but perhaps their laugh would have turned to pity if they had even dimly suspected how much he was on his guard against their laughter !
listen to me , shouted the consul , stretching out both hands in front of him and shaking them in excitement
my cousin is just asking
i have nothing to do with it
come in , called behrens , stressing the first word
the ration- alism you call for has a good deal of superstition about it - of be- lief in the incomprehensibly and vaguely d
they ordered a bite from the obliging landlady : coffee , honey , white bread and pear bread , a sort of sweetmeat , the speciality of the place ; red wine was sent out to the coachman
it took a long time
i do not care about being made a fool of
then heir modersohn stood up and shouted in to the hub-bub : buddenbrook , you will do me a hundred lines imposition
rotbein conveyed all this in a whisper , and with great objectivity
the enormous difficulties which every rehearsal and perforlnance of leverktihn 's apocalypse presents , have di- rectly to do with all that
-- but do you think he kept his promise ?
armgard von schilling talked about the cows at home
he took out his notebook and turned over the leaves in silence ; but as the order in the classroom left much to be desired , he lifted his head , stretched out his arm over the desk , and waved his flabby white fist a few times power-lessly in the air
he doesn ’ t trouble himself about her ?
to-morrow is another day
popinet with a glance whenever the latter seemed about to take unto herself all the cold veal jelly
what a pedagogue it is !
herr settembrini has omitted to add , broke in naphta , that the rousseauian idyll is a sophisticated transmogrification of the church ’ s doctrine of man ’ s original free and sinless state , his primal nearness and filial relation to god ; to which state he must finally return
he was built on such a grand scale , hans castorp began again , that he considered it a blasphemy , a cosmic catastrophe , to be found wanting in feeling
that i point it out is all that speaks in my favour
perhaps there is nothing that applies to this case
you must bring about the obliquity the same way nature does , you must add illusion to illusion—and for that you have to know about the epicanthus
he sat down on the piano-stool , which he shoved up in front of the theatre , and began id give a performance , singing all the roles and the accompaniment as well , and gesticu-lating furiously
' now included in stories of three decades , translated by h t lowe- porter
pleasantly , courteously , it put the question : well , and what of it ?
it has such an infernally serious side to it , sort of ascetic , as you say—that was the expression you used , wasn ’ t it ?
you would gain an extraor- dinary unity and congruity , a sort of astronomical regularity and legality would be obtained thereby
he tried to catch his cousin ’ s eye , and saw that joachim ’ s sunburnt face had gone all spotted , as a tanned complexion will when the blood leaves it with suddenness ; his mouth too was pitifully drawn , and wore an expression that sent an indefinable chill of fear over hans castorp and made him hasten to change the subject
moreover there was nothing to say against it , pro- vided youth and its time understood each otler
you will call me when it is time , i suppose
for as he wrote he felt that nothing could be clearer than his presentation of the matter , and that there was no doubt it would meet with perfect comprehension at home
shortly after his ar- rival , and obviously out of some feeling of loneliness and for- sakenness , he had even proposed to me to join him ; and though some months would have to pass before i answered his call , i was at once ready , yes , probably would not have needed the invita- tion
he felt his breast lightened when , on his way home , the first chalets , the first abodes of human beings , loomed visible through the fog
nature vividly riminded me of a similar one of richard wagner , who at the time of parsifal added to his name signed to a letter the title member of the high consistory
the taste displayed by the hofrat in his choice of a model was too like hans castorp ’ s own for him to put great faith in the disinterested character of the affair , and the thought of the hofrat ’ s purple cheeks and bloodshot , goggling eyes only strengthened his scepticism
they hid be-hind uncle justus , and got him to send his wife ta her sister-in-law , the wife of ovcrdieck the lumber dealer
he had been in the employ of a fire-insurance company , and made constant extended journeys from st petersburg up and down the whole of russia , visiting insured factory buildings and spying out those which were financially suspect ; for it was a fact supported by statistics that the larger percentage of fires occurred in just those factories where business was not going too well
the passages of horror just before heard are given , indeed , to the indescribable children 's chorus at quite a dif-
but even that was enough to cast a shadow , rob their brilliant performance of some of its gloss , emasculate it , as it were , set up a cross-current perceptible to them all , though peeperkorn himself remained unconscious , or conscious to a degree impossible for them to guess
i regret to hear that your health is not so good as it should be
she would pass over from the particular to the general , and talk in her throaty voice about wicked people , interrupting her-self with the little cough that was due to poor digestion
yes , good night , lucky we can say it
above the aspiring lance-shaped tips of the fir-trees the sky gleamed deepest blue , the village down in the valley glared white in the heat , and the air was filled with the sound , half gay , half pensive , of bells , from the cows that roamed the slopes , cropping the short , sun-warmed meadow grass
dr krokowski would enter by the open balcony door at a quarter to four or earlier , greet the patient with manly readiness , put the usual professional questions , with perhaps a little personal touch as well , a jest or two—and if all this had a slight aura of the questionable about it , yet one can get used even to the questionable , provided it keeps within bounds
joachim had stepped down ; the technician changed the plate
that sound-sparkling ocean lights was in my eyes a very remarkable instance of hovv an artist can give his best to a thing in which he privately no longer be ] icves , insisting on excelling in artistic devices , vhich for his consciousness are already at the point of being worn out
it was a solemn ceremony : in the presence of the standard he would be sworn to it , literally , to the standard— you don ’ t say !
you do not know what you are talking about
the house in meng street was hardly emptied when a host of workmen appeared and began to tear down the back-building ; the dust from the old mortar darkened the air
i am asking that in order that you may not ask me
it em- barrasses me to play the languishing swain in the colnpany of others
he had very good looks and had kept his swiss manner of speech , pleasant to the ear , deliberate , formal , inter- spersed with survivals of old-gerlan expressions oddly solemn to hear
universal franchise , said the others ; heinrich hagenstrb am was one of these till others cried universal voting by estates -- and dear knew what they meant by that !
who is still in the salon ?
heavens , christian ! -- you have not swallowed it , have you ?
this friendship liad been recognized in the school for a long time
what a monkey he is !
it was scarcely sad at all—as things are not which have to do with the body and only with it
as he sat down , thomas buddenbrook briefly ex-plained what the trouble was
i have known herr settembrini for some time , more than a year , for years , in fact
i hope your civilian principles will not prevent you from knowing what you owe me—else i shall be forced to put these principles to a test that—
the hofrat , after his own fashion , had announced the day and hour of clavdia ’ s return
i am sending you a hundred thousand marks as a wedding present , and i will leave you another hundred thou-sand in my will
you are making a mistake about her
hans castorp thought he might go and come again and take up his business where he had left it off ?
it was remarkable that besides our priest , eccl
for how long must the undersigned exist without a glimpse bf his enchantress ?
it would have been penible too , considering their opinions of each other
did he say that ?
they would certainly be back by autumn , so you could hardly say they had left
and still , it is a great pleasure to the superior individual , just once - and where should one find this once , if not here and now ?
and that flickering glance—over which the frau directress , had she tried , might now have triumphed ?
two hundred years ago , settembrini said , you had a poet in your country , a magnificent old chatterbox who set great store in good handwriting because he thought it must induce a good style
this too i say only to characterize the fleeting , insecure times we lived in ; certainly not to direct the reader 's attention upon dy inconsiderable person , to which only a place in the background of these mernoirs is fitting
but i must drop out now , said the hofrat
seriously , on the other hand : i ’ ve had my share too ; but any so-called drunkenness to the contrary , i fully recognize the honour of helping such a tremendous personality to bed ; i am not so drunk i don ’ t know that in the matter of size i don ’ t hold a candle—
that stuff about the place of intercourse ’ was distinctly shady , not to mention anything else
since the blow he had then received , they had grown worse instead of better ; until now , at a time when prospects were brighter than ever -- when everybody was flushed with victory , the city had at last joined the customs union , and small retail firms all over the country were growing within a few years into large wholesale ones -- the firm of johann buddenbrook rested on its oars and reaped no ad- vantage from the favourable time
cards and counters were produced , they decided on some rounds of vingt et un
opposite him there had sat for a short time a very lean , light-blonde girl who emptied a bottle of yogurt on her plate , ladled it up with a spoon , and took herself off
the acrid , steaming shadows of the arm-pits corresponded in a mystic triangle to the pubic darkness , just as the eyes did to the red , epithelial mouth-opening , and the red blossoms of the breast to the navel lying perpendicularly below
it appeared that there had been wild and arbitrary exhibitions of power , like those in fräulein kleefeld ’ s room : knockings on walls and table , the turning off of the lamp , and these as well as further manifestations were being systematically produced and investigated , with every possible safeguarding of their genuineness , after comrade krokowski had practised the approved technique and put little elly into her hypnotic sleep
the senator himself , one thursday afternoon when the weinschenks were not present , had called it that , and frau permaneder quite relished the joke
i seldom do , even a card , and that is already stamped
and herr friedrich wil- helm marcus is present , of course
the consul went on foot every morning to his business in the old town—although he possessed more than one fine equipage—in order to get a little exercise , for he sometimes suffered from cerebral congestion
for instance , how else could i have endured to wait so long ?
there the tree rose to the ceiling , decorated with white lilies , twinkling and sparkling and pouring out light and fragrance ; and the table with the presents on it stretched from the windows to the door
hans castorp watched him
as for christian -- christian , through the good office of mr rirhardson , his former chief , had found a situation in london , whence he had lately telegraphed a fantastic desire to marry fraulein puvogel , an idea upon which his mother had firmly set her foot -- christian now be-longed , quite simply , to jacob krbger 's class , and was , as it were , a dead issue
no , no , i can not advise him either for or against
he had not heard me approach
for herr settembrini was a humanitarian , yet at the same time , half explicitly , he was warlike too
it must be stupid on the beach
does anyone doubt that i was there ?
he was a charm- ing lad , with a great wave of blond hair on his forehead and lovely blue eyes which now flickered in a frightened way
the warmth , the purring of the gas , and the drone of the reader 's voice lulled them all to a point where they were more asleep than awake
the icy gusts made his ears burn painfully , his limbs felt half paralysed , his hands were so numb he hardly knew if they held the staff
it merely gratified breisacher 'then a lady interposed and said she had not known that a census vas such a sin
she wrote romances for the family story-papers , un-der a dashing pseudonym
some of the foci are absorbed , the area is smaller and more clearly defined , which you are experienced enough to know is a sign of healing
his way of discovering thematic connections that the other kind of man does not see ; of perceiving the articulation of a short ex- tract in the form of question and answer ; altogether of seeing from the inside how it is made , confirms me in my judgment
he was told of the galloping form the disease sometimes assumed , which made the end an affair of not more than a few months or even weeks ; of pneumotomy , of the hofrat ’ s masterly surgery , of resection of the lungs , an operation which was to be performed to-morrow or the day after upon a severe case just brought to the sanitorium , a charming , or once-charming scotswoman suffering from gangrœna pulmonum , gangrene of the lungs , a green and black pestilence , which obliged her to inhale all day a vaporized solution of carbolic acid , lest she go out of her head from sheer physical disgust
he made proper protest
and , viii know how to carry it with dignity , he broke in
but instead of going to the good russian table , the unmannerly female glided noiselessly to hans castorp ’ s side and without a word reached him her hand—not the back , but the palm—to kiss
that 's a funny chord to strike
clavdia had been right in feeling herself dispensed from writing by virtue of the freedom her illness gave her
they went into the street
it went downhill , the steep sides grew higher , this fold of the earth ’ s surface seemed like a narrow passage leading into the mountain
for it is really the case that this music , wise and true and over-shrewd , here continually and painfully woos the folk-air
why should not he take a walk ?
a shrewd look came into his eyes : here was a question of money to be paid out
the mighty one was immensely pleased
while pastor pringsheim was delivering his sermon , he whispered to hanno : that was a crab-fashion imitation , johann
his predecessor had evidently gone out by another door
he was settled for the afternoon
but the result is what we see , the dynamic effect—he puts us in his pocket
adrian demurred , but rudolf knew how to plead and the recent du was strong enough to open the way for what was to come
oh , thou meanest because thou sayst to nobody thou , not even to thy jester gentilman , but only to the trusty play-fere , he who clepes thee b ) t the first name but not thou him
the visitors praised the abbot 's room warmly
sometimes it did well up insistently in hans castorp ’ s civilian breast , as though it must out
there is , how-ever , no rank and no discrimination before jesus ; and so cer-tain humble oddities were also guests at the jerusalem eve-nings -- for example , a little wrinkled creature , rich in the grace of god and knitting-patterns , who lived in the holy ghost hospital and was named himmelsburger
but i know the real reason why you are vexed : it is because you are not so firmly decided not to touch fhe business
dr faustus from unknown
he thinks she wears an expression as though musing on their encounter at the door
the silent sister ’ is a mercury thermometer without figures—you see , i got it all
for there was oftentimes heard by me all manner of instrument : an organ or positive , more delectable
how could such primitive unreason be reconciled with the conception of the universe which underlay their calling ?
who was ellen brand ?
but i tell you straightaway , a case like yours doesn ’ t get well from one day to the next : it isn ’ t a question of the miracle cures you read about in advertisements
- reason enough for the anxious cautiousness of a supreme com mander who had been elevated to his rank on account 'of his uncle , to order a general withdrawal
tell me yourself , tu whom ?
but then they had these penitential practices sung , delivered over to the sounding breath of the human voice , which is certainly the most stable-warm imaginable thing in the world of sound
it is this : i recall an exalted moment , when our acquaintance was very young , when i felt myself pleasantly impressed by your native parts , and stood ready to offer you the brotherly thou ; but then perceived that the moment was premature
young man , we are brothers
he did not smile -- he seldom did on such occasions
the invested capital is out of all proportion to the value of the property
there was too much candid cynicism in the community to permit a display of serious moral disapproval
if the spirit was recalcitrant , there remained the body , which could be got at
children played and exulted among the breaking waves
she still lived among us , in her mother 's house , and shared in the carnival gaieties
'all is over , he repeated
i heard him later at the roddes ' and schlaginhaufens ' , and got him to tell me how , as quite a little lad , before he had violin lessons , he had begun to develop this technique and never stopped whis- tling the music he heard , or practising what he learned
the duchamps , explained the consul
and now the whole at-mosphere of the house changed
while the guests continued to eat in the salon , with the pastor in their midst , the consul and his wife accompanied the young pair , who had dressed for their journey , out into the snowy , misty air , where the great travelling coach stood be-fore the door , packed with boxes and bags
let me lean upon you , my child !
even frau magnus ’ s ears were red , and she admitted that she felt as though life were running through her— which herr magnus seemed not over-pleased to hear
when i go to sit down in my chair in the rest-hall , whom do i find on my right hand ?
here i have climbed up some five thousand feet to get here—
she put her work down calmly and crossed the room , wilh her long heavy stride , to hanno 's bed
one may say they live separated , and she visits him now and again
i saw it confirmed that it is only a step from capitulation to pure abdication and the suggestion to the conqueror that he would please take over the conduct of the defeated country ac- cording to his own ideas , since for its own part it did not know what to do
the invisible character sang :
it was this that made me agree to his rejecting the proposal which dr ktirbis at that time in duty bound put before him : he recom- mended or asked consideration for a consultation with a higher medical authority ; but adrian avoided it , would have none of it
at least , you can , i ’ m sure—you are an upright man , settembrini said
her language , seasoned with dialect , with halt and fei and gellen 's ja , was yet not coarse
that gap which in exterior nature we vainly sought to close , that between living and dead matter , had its counterpart in nature ’ s organic existence , and must somehow either be closed up or bridged over
she sits and listens to him when he tells about his troubles -- dear me , i suppose he entertains her
on madame budden-brook 's account , the double windows had already been put in
those eyes had always , we know , been large and mild , but to-day , precisely on this very day , had seemed to grow larger and deeper , with a musing , yes , we must even say an ominous expression , together with the above-mentioned light
on the other hand , that belgian captain that was discharged cured the other day , he was simply alive with them , gaffky ten—and only the very tiniest cavity
prince esterhazy was an especial friend of this master art , but in the mass in c which beethoven wrote for him , the composer , after unsuccessful attempts , had not arrived at a fugue ; even socially considered , that was a discourtesy , but artis- tically it had been an unpardonable lack , and the oratorio christ on the mount of olives altogether lacked any fugue form , al- though it would have been most proper there
here too music played
he turned to his theatre
arrogant personal uniqueness - maybe you have to do that
the care-free piping rose toward the deep-blue sky , and beneath the sky stretched the branching , wind-tossed boughs of single ash-trees and birches whose leaves twinkled in the sun
he took a good look at them , from the side , as he walked with bent head , thinking about joachim
objects of porcelain , silver , gold , nickel , wood , silk , cloth , and every other conceivable material lay on the table
what does it matter ?
on the day when she first laid some piano arrangements from tristan on the music-rack , he played some twenty-five beats and then sprung up from the music-stool to stride up and down the room with disgust painted upon his face
it was so beautiful , that aida should have found her way to the condemned radames , to share his fate for ever !
'then the fellow ripped out his knife -- for some reason thomas never applauded these tales
at six o ’ clock in the afternoon he began making a strange continuous movement with his right hand , with the chain bangle on the wrist : passing it across the bed-cover , at about the hips , lifting it as he drew it back and toward him , with a raking motion , as though he were gathering something in
hans castorp turned the cylindrical coffee-mill about in his hands
but there was no idle watching , for visitors came : old senator duchamps , the dying woman 's brother , from ham-burg , with his daughter ; and a few days later , the consul 's sister from frankfort and her husband , who was a banker
i confess my weakness for flowers , and for nature in general
i am sure i have heard good things of your firm from my son , said the ' frau consul cordially
are you out of your head ?
music , vas after all too deeply and essentially bound up , vith the romantic ever to reject it without serious natural damage to itself
his pronunciation was perfect , for , as he explained , his business trips had taken him to england
rare museum pieces such as a pair of beautifully curved bronze lurer turned right and left , like steer-horns , were also to be found in leverktihn 's ware- house
then he has not taken a room at a hotel , so we ask him to stop the night
and then announced that he could stop eight days—a week , that was ; seven days—or perhaps six
but you see -- i am perfectly frank ; i am an honest woman and speak as i think , without making words -- which is splendid of you , tony
they spoke of the oberin and the doctors , of dr krokowski ’ s lectures , at one of which james would be present if he stopped a week
his throat contracted and a four- or fivefold sob went through and through him
no , they are no problems , neither is the problem of their aristocracy
this visible acoustic , wherein the simple and the mysterious , law and miracle , so charmingly mingled , pleased us lads exceedingly ; we often asked to see it , and not least to give the experimenter pleasure
if it were only this -- !
hang it -- he had been con-scious of powers -- and as the power is , so is the ideal -- as feuerbach says
and stop soon enough ?
it had not been three hundred years since european pharmacology made its acquaintance ; not a century since the alkaloid had been isolated which was its active principle ; isolated and , to a certain extent , analysed , for it would be too much to say that chemistry knew all there was to know about it , or was in a position to reproduce it synthetically
but he was no dry pedant , notwithstanding
your cousin has been too , hasn ’ t he ?
he spoke of the jeru-salem evenings and the sunday-school ; he gilded with matchless oratory the whole long rinh and happy earthly course of her who had left them ; and when he came to the end , since the word end needed some sort of qualifying ad-jective , he spoke of her peaceful end
i have dreamed of man ’ s state , of his courteous and enlightened social state ; behind which , in the temple , the horrible blood-sacrifice was consummated
they would probably blush for the ceremonial of former periods as an extravagant mummery , and not without reason , for it would be absurd to present their atheistic republicanism in the guise of a mystery
asia surrounds us— wherever one ’ s glance rests , a tartar physiognomy
imagine , on my whole left side , my nerves are not long enough !
and so it fell out
he felt that his whole being had unaccountably expanded , and at the same time there clung about his senses a profound intoxication , a strange , sweet , vague allurement which somehow resembled the feelings of early love and longing
they fled through the library
carducci had no use for the practice
you are in absolute danger of your life , he had bellowed at her , just like that , without making any bones of it
she would not have married him if she had not felt sure of his essential agreement with her in these matters
he was much more sprightly than he used to be ; there was a certain lack of re- straint in his roving eye , and he would ask ever so many times about gerda buddenbrook 's fiddle without getting any reply
buchel was a property of a size corresponding to the ownership of a team and cattle ; it was a good fifty acres of meadow and ploughed land , with communal rights to the adjoining mixed 'woodland and a very comfortable wood and frame dwelling-house on a stone foundation
this feeling he experienced anew in his dream , only a thousand-fold stronger than in his waking hour
but she merely expressed her amaze- ment at his use of her first name and repeated her farewell- the sound of her voice rings clearly in my ears : adieu , monsieur !
he would have let the subject drop , as it had after the previous lecture , had not hans castorp persisted , and demanded to hear details
yes , such consolatory promises must have been vouchsafed our young man before he returned to number thirty-four ; for he had had no word with frau chauchat on the day following , had not seen her indeed , save twice at some distance : once when the glass door slammed , and she had slipped for the last time to her place at table , clad in her blue cloth skirt and white sweater
so , then -- well , why should we , you know !
all that , lawyer paravant found , had been a bit strong for the ladies
not far from this group was hinrich hagenstrom , a square-built , fleshy man with a reddish beard sprinkled with grey , a heavy watch-chain across his blue-checked waistcoat , and his coat open over it
at any rate , here was a consoling thought for joachim during his five remaining months—in case he really got off with five
everybody remembered the sudden re-solve of thomas buddenbrook eighteen years ago , when he was thirty years old
friends are like that today
the authorities , of course , might have what notions they chose about fresh water
for therein lies goodness and love of humankind , and in nothing else
we should not ask—for in the time when it was made they never did

then come leo and virgo , and then the autumn , the equinox , toward the end of september , when the rays of the sun fall vertically upon the equator again , as they did in march , when the sun was in the sign of the ram
i should like to know what kind of self-appraisement is at the bottom of the feminine answer
he expressed his satisfaction and , going back to joachim , warned him to draw in his breath and hold it until all was over
opposite her sat a czech , whom everybody called herr wenzel , as his family name was impossible to pronounce
it had nearly cost him his life to cut his first set ; the gums showed a constant tendency to inflammation , and there were abscesses , which mamsell jungmann used to open with a needle at the proper time
the conversation dragged on ; the rain set in again and veiled the prospect
would it be surprising if joachim ’ s agitation consisted only in part of joyful emotion , and also in part of dread—if it was not also the pang of parting with all this familiar life that made him stride thus up and down his room ?
long has it lasted ; or , rather , the pace of its contentual time has so increased that there is no more holding it , even its musical time is running out
it was impossible that all the effect which this had upon hanno should pass over into his audience
they could not get on without sarah semlinger !
do not , for one moment , imagine i addressed you with this form just now
not easily did these become discouraged ; it was the , vill and way of them to make light and they did so to their uttermost , so that the next stage of light 's exhaustion and retreat actually had more colour than the previous one
thus far , whenever we have referred to any questionable performances at the berghof , we have done so in what may have seemed a light and jesting tone ; this without prejudice to our real opinion as to the levity , or otherwise , of the performances , and solely for the usual obscure reasons which prompt other people to adopt the same
in making a mystery of the personality , you run a risk of idol-worship
in the first place , i ’ m not the proprietor here !
well , buddenbrook , so you are cutting the session ?
your interest in that ancient obstruction is due , i presume , to the fact that her decaying empire is a sort of mummy , as it were , of the holy roman empire of the german people
the route was bordered here and there by crumbling rock tufted with grass and flowers
in fact , there would be no sense in that at all !
and there was clavdia chauchat herself , charming , soft-stepping invalid , the property of peeperkorn—surely by choice and conviction , yet uneasy and sharptongued to see her carnival cavalier on such good terms with her sovereign lord
but she complains a lot about her temperature , and how relaxed she feels , and i ’ m afraid she is by no means a light case
i have no mechanical ingenuity , however sincere my respect for it
but neither was taken seriously
the holy , the feminine claims life makes upon manly honour and strength—
i saw him first at a distance : adrian showed him to me round the comer of the house , sitting on the ground in the kitchen garden at the back , between a strawberry and a vegetable bed , one little leg stretched out , the other half drawn up , his hair falling in strands on his forehead
both ladies proved receptive to the at- tention shown them , and welcomed with enthusiasm the plan for an excursion , of which i only said that i had not originated it- after dropping the remark that i was on the way to my friend leverktihn
a gift of life like music , i responded , not to say a gift of god , one ought not to explain by mocking antinomies , which only bear witness to the fullness of her nature
a second blackboard stood on an easel by the master 's chair
to military service he was not inclined
to myself , of course every word i write is of burning interest ; but what care must i take not to see this as a guarantee of the sympathy of the detached reader !
yes , sir , answered morten , trying to keep his face straight
you will get a free copy , castorp ; then you can project the secrets of your bosom on the wall for your children and grandchildren to see !
away to the mountains , away , away , share in our life , careless and gay ,
and they found him a disagreeable oddity , who did not care for horses or hunting or play or women
the likeness was plain as long as he was smooth-shaven , before he grew the heavy beard
they escaped her finally and went ; she kept on looking after them awhile , her body bent forward , her gaze so avid it seemed as though she would fairly suck them back with her eyes
what do we want of more ?
song was set according to the metrical laws of speech , it did not run articulated by bars and musical pe- riods ; rather it obeyed the spirit of free recitation
but it would have seemed too risky to put his opposition into words
until yesterday -- yesterday he was in a good mood , and asked me a dozen times if i loved him , and if i would put in a good word for him with you if he had something to ask you
he must have simply lapped it up
he sounded more than ever like a cracked plate and ended in a fit of coughing
was that artificial return simply a whim ?
at home , when i come down to breakfast , papa 's cigar-smoke is already in the room
it is , vritten by one not present , vhen he came , and only as clumsy words can approximate the scene
diederich schwarzkopf did not offer to shake hands with him
i would rather wash my hands of tke whole affair
this trouble with his teeth affected not only his spirits but also the functioning of all his other organs
squeal away , madame , squeal away , said he
it had flowered hangings and solid mahogany beds

she talked well , she entertained her brother capitally
when do we lie down again ?
well , of course the dialectic of freedom is unfathomable
and his earliest researches in this kind discovered in himself an irremediable unpre-paredness
you may be right ; and , as i said , i am not going to press you
and where lllad- ness begins to be malady , there is nobody knows at all
things seemed in train
it was evening—and had just been morning
he forgot either to hang up or put down the picture he had been holding , but tugged it with him into the neighbouring room
it is certainly re- markable : a budding reputation such as had begun to attach it- self to leverkiihn 's name is unknown to the general , having its seat in the initiate sphere , on the heights of connoisseurship ; from those heights the invitation to paris had come
oh , you have company , he said
and truly the affair developed with precision
frau permaneder stood there , very erect , her shoul-ders rlevated , her black-bordered handkerchief between her folded hands ; and her pride in the chief role which it fell lo her lot to perform was so great as sometimes entirely to ob-scure her grief
the door was opened by a half-grown boy , in a sort of livery of gaiters and striped jacket , a little page , with shaven poll and rosy cheeks

it was this he must let them know at home , even if only as a possibility ; he must tell the whole story , and not put them , or himself , off any longer with pretexts
a semi-circular niche in the remaining wall was occupied by the stove , which crackled away behind a polished wrought-iron screen
that future , to be sure , lookea quite different from the earlier dreams
a magic square , i said
it was no joke
it was not hard , with the help of sesemi 's bishop , to get acquainted
and more of the same kind
then she drew him into the bow-window and pointed
with the motif passed through many vi- cissitudes , which takes leave and so doing becomes itself entirely leave-taking , a parting wave and call , with this d g g occurs a slight change , it experiences a small melodic expansion
rudolf was not like that at all
i have long wished you would come to us on a visit by yourself , without your husband , so that we could be en famille together once more
i tell you , pfiihl , this music is less foreign to your inner self than you think !
yes , for us all , adrian said softly
yet can one quarrel vvith the jewish spirit when its quick hearing and recep- tivity for the coming thing , the new , persists also in the most ex- traordinary situations , where the avant-garde coincides with the reactionary ?

but to make clear what this last one , the old linden-tree , meant to him , is truly a ticklish endeavour ; requiring great delicacy of emphasis if more harm than good is not to come of the undertaking
she would reply : ah , very well
with pleasure , he said aloud , in the profound stillness
the interruption , indeed , had been insignificant , as he saw when he resumed his seat at table
certainly , as you say , it was he through whom the victory was achieved by harmony over counterpoint
they were many , varied , and hard to classify ; so interwoven and mingled they seemed , as almost to obscure any clear distinction between the concrete fact and the dreamed or imagined
the air is very strengthening to the nerves , and for the moment i am quite in order with my stomach trouble
he put it from him with manly sobriety , almost with regret
and this state of things showed itself by peculiar symptoms and strange whims , which he observed with surprise and dis-gust
ger- man youth , precisely as youth , represents the spirit of the people itself , the german spirit , which is young and filled with the fu- ture : unripe , if you like , but what does unripe mean ?
it was just like yours and mine , the bed on the side wall left of the door , and people were standing at the head , the relatives of course , the parents , talking soothingly at the bed , where you could see nothing but a formless mass that was begging and protesting horribly , and kicking about with its legs
the possibility has occurred to me that your symptoms were not necessarily to be referred to tuberculosis alone—because it is out of the question to refer them to it any longer
but the czech wenzel who operated it there was a not unmusical man , and would surely not injure or misuse the instrument ; hans castorp might hand it over without misgiving
but his frantic extravagance was a definite sign of an unbal- anced mind ; it had become intolerable ; and his powerlessness to govern had followed upon his unwillingness to govern : he had merely dreamed his kingship , refusing to exercise it in any normal form
chap-fallen , i see it every day , disgust and ennui are written on your brow
involuntarily the three paused here , the young girl first , to read the mournful inscriptions ; hans castorp stood relaxed , his hands clasped before him , his eyes veiled and his mouth somewhat open , young ziemssen very self-controlled , and not only erect , but even bending a thought backward ; and both the cousins stole a glance at karen ’ s face
as if lie down ’ isn ’ t just as good a word of command as stand up ’ !
they gossiped while they undressed -- in undertones , however , for it was ten o'clock and next door mlle
it was frau else schweigestill who advanced towards the travellers with dignified tread , met them at the gate , gave a friendly ear to their wants , and made lemonade in tall glasses with long spoons
they put up with his sllall tone
he was extremely surprised when i told him that fraulein gerda had actually given me ground for hope
that is bad , bourgeois nineteenth century

for then spring is on the way again—the three-thousandth spring since the chaldeans ; and the days go on lengthening until we have come round the year , and summer begins again
she transmitted the desire of the whole family that they should come and receive the thanks due their gift ; and thus , on the next day but one , the deaconess ushered the two on tiptoe into leila ’ s apartment
to whom will you sell it , tom ?
you utter it so modestly—yet , taken with your person , it holds out such boundless possibilities
laughter , says the classic , is a sunbeam of the soul
don ’ t let them make too much of the funeral rites , don ’ t let them pay too much respect to such a simple fact as death—but without that simple fact , there would never have been either architecture nor painting , sculpture nor music , poetry nor any other art
with christian it was as with poor clothilde
oh , the thing is quite simple : christian busies himself too much with himself , with what goes on in his own insides
you insist on the incomparableness of the personal case
the humanistic grammar-school—you may call me reactionary , engineer , but in abstracto , generally speaking , you understand , i remain an adherent—
you wo not try a game , father ?
one goes off and keeps coming back , another stops long enough that he doesn ’ t need to come back
it is not a question of will-power
it was his ladies who kept up the feud now : not so much his good-natured wife as the three elderly damsels , who could not look at frau consul , or antonie , or thomas , without a spark in their eyes
you don ’ t play here ?
\ composi- tion can also use two or more series as basic inaterial , as in the double and triple fugue
but upon that darkness wherein he sought refuge from complete bewilderment , there broke the voice of herr settembrini , continuing to chant the praises of literature
do not say such things !
you must not talk like that , tom
he treads on the hand of a fallen comrade ; with his hobnailed boot he treads the hand deep into the slimy , branch-strewn ground
that 's tony , to the life , said the consul
but goodness , people do not die of a bad tooth !

even some of the more light-minded fathers of families , like justus kroger and , of course , peter dohlmann , were members , and police senator crema was here the first man at the hose
but seems to me you ’ ve made a splendid recovery , he said , shaking his head
the ladies , frau stöhr in the lead , with mesdames salomon , redisch , hessenfeld , magnus , iltis , levi , and the rest following hard upon , were taken in a variety of ways , some of them almost as badly as popoff
the man ought to be disciplined— disturbing the whole rest period with his gabble , and exciting the ladies so that it puts them back for weeks
she even visited and received natalie alone
malice , my dear sir , is the animating spirit of criticism ; and criticism is the beginning of progress and enlightenment
i am afraid i do not command the means of expression to bring my feelings and desires home to her
because i still feel so young , and still long to see life again
hofrat behrens personally instructed the novice how to sit and hold himself
only now and again there would be a sudden storm , a trifling mishap , like the following : herr stuht the tailor had made a new suit for each of the buddenbrook lads
\ uch rebellion in strict obedience is needed , much independence , much courage
naphta put in that herr settembrini was slightly disingenuous : his picture of thoth-trismegistus had a good deal of the reality smoothed away
only the neutral is free
there was some doubt whether he would then hold back his hand from the shedding of blood
this occurred at the end of his stay
a half-grown youth at the next table on the left , by his years a schoolboy , with his wrists coming out of his jacket sleeves , and thick , round eye-glasses , cut all the heaped-up food on his plate into a sort of mash , then bent over and gulped it down ; he reached with his serviette behind his glasses now and then and dried his eyes—whether it was sweat or tears he dried one could not tell
that was the gastrula , the protozoon , primeval form of all animal life , primeval form of flesh-borne beauty
it took time for the words to penetrate his consciousness
some people were slyer than foxes
these notes , that consoling and trusting offer each ether the hand ; that vveaving and winding of all things in likeness and change - of such it is , and adrian leverkuhn is its youthful naster
some seasons when the consul had business , there were long jour-neys
he misdoubted form , calling it pretence and play
have you forgotten what you learned in the schools , that god can bring good out of evil and that the occasiqn to it shall not be marred ?
a man who is capable of achievement over and above the average and expected modicum must be equipped either with a moral remoteness and single-mindedness which is rare indeed and of heroic mould , or else with an exceptionally robust vitality
he was conducting a lively correspondence with the flatland ; his resolve was ripening , his preparations drawing to a head
the occupants of the good russian table had withdrawn into a neighbouring small salon , separated from the card-room by a portière , where they formed a small and separate coterie , consisting , in addition to madame chauchat , of a languid , blond-bearded youth with a hollow chest and prominent eyeballs ; a young girl of pronounced brunette type , with a droll , original face , gold ear-rings , and wild woolly hair ; besides these , dr blumenkohl , who had joined their circle , and two other youths with drooping shoulders
she used no dialect , but enunciated clearly and with precision , stressing the consonants
all i can say is very long
and do not get irritated -- it makes for wrinkles
they went directly down to the entresol , where mamsell jungmann had laid the table and set the samo-var -- a real samovar , a present from pastor tiburtius and clara
but there was a bunch of flowers at tony 's place , the food looked inviting , and the drive had whetted her ap-petite
i can not recover , that is settled
it had been a mistake to suppose that two would be enough
slowly they went , in single file , up the narrow path that had been made in the snow , leaving the highest villas behind and below them , and watching the familiar scene unroll in its winter splendour , a little altered in perspective , and opening out to the north-west , toward the entrance of the valley
he meant it for a sort of compliment , i dare say ; but the truth is , you are a civilian—incurable

he said that the latter was characteristic of our intensely bourgeois age , our policy of molly-coddle
in freemasonry there are present a host of egyptian survivals , and there were , among the secret societies , some that called themselves eleusinian
my goodness , the sheets still have to be hemmed
on the contrary , he pointed out the high degree of significance which must be ascribed by god to this idea , when he had preferred to expose men and angels to sin rather than withhold freedom from them
as the gentlemen passed through the hall , they could hear from the landscape-room the first notes of the flute , accom-panied by the frau consul on the harmonium : an airy , charming little melody that floated sweetly through the lofty rooms
she finished , and furtively wrung her hands

he does not pause in his enthusiastic activity
i-ier mother was a parisian , a paralysed old lady , confined to her chair but full of mental energy , who had never given herself the trouble of learning german
i am merely stating our fundamental agreement with respect to the original , paradisial state of man , his freedom from law , and his unmediated relation with god , which state was lost to him by his fall
it seems to me i can not any more trust my five senses , and that i must confess disturbs me more than my cold feet and the heat in my face
you are repeating his words -- and i do not know that he would mind ; but even so i am not sure it was just the nicest thing to do
dans l ’ éternité , tu sais , on fait comme en dessinant un petit cochon : on penche la tête en arrière et on ferme les yeux
later she said she thought he would not have been allowed
he had lost a large sum of money in the affair -- but that had not been the unbearable thing about it
tony followed his gesture with her eye ; they sat , their hands lying close together on the bench , and looked into the distance
' n ' then i will be sittin ' on the sofa in a silk gownd , an ' you will be servin ' me
he had repeatedly to rest by the way , feeling the colour recede from his face , and cold sweat break out on his brow ; the wild beating of his heart took away his breath
but the tradition of the place held her in check
hans castorp felt an unwonted thrill—never before had he been so proud of his mother-tongue—yet at the same time experienced a temptation to offer up his pride on the altar of quite a different feeling—the rapture which filled him at the sound of her pretty stammerings and manglings of his speech
we met him in the person of fierr saul fitelberg , who appeared in pfeiffering one lovely day in late sudmer when i happened to be there
behrens is a regular dab at it
once more she repeated what comes next ?
they contained oxygen ; he had asked , and joachim informed him
you know , herr marcus , she said , about that man
i have always envied you when i saw you sit there and work , for it is really no work at all for you
why , certainly , herr settembrini—hans castorp hastened to abandon his forced and even peevish attitude , stop drumming on the bed-cover , and turn to his guest with friendliness , even with contrition
satisfying , but very hard
and you still have the family : cerda and me , and the buddenbrouks in broad street , and the krbgers , and therese weichbrodt , and clothilde -- that is , if clothilde will con- descend to associate with us , now that she 's become a lady of the order of st john -- it 's so very exclusive , you know !
it rained harder than ever
instead , he devoted himself for the time to the dainties that weighted down the table -- dainties such as he seldom saw the other side of the danube
my business is very flourishing -- ahem -- if i may be permitted to say so
ing the theatre season it was doubtless crowded with foreigners ; now , to our satisfaction , it was almost empty
but it is true that tony was the chief sufferer from the pious visitants
you shall see , engineer , the gayest gallants of the night , in brilliant rows advancing , he quoted , and went on in his most mocking vein , couching his gibes in sounding phrases , with a telling accompaniment of arm , shoulder , and head movements
but i ’ m not there yet !
he said : well , i am thinking of getting married , sooner or later
\ ou believe you can develop a just order out of the pure insight and reason of man , equating the just and the socially useful , and you think that out of it new political forms will come

frau salomon from amsterdam would perch on the balustrade , hard pressed on the right by the knees of the thicklipped gänser , on the left by the swedish minion—who , it appeared , was quite recovered , but extending his cure for a little space before going home
their companions appeared with no great delay on the threshold ; peeperkorn ’ s kingly head seemed narrower ; he lifted his hat as he stood in a long , rather shabby ulster , by madame chauchat ’ s side , and his lips shaped a vague form of greeting to the company in general
the next morning he announced his willingness to take part m the evening seance ; and half an hour after dinner joined the group of familiars of the uncanny , who , unconcernedly chatting , took their way down to the basement
he remained in the salon , or returned stealthily thither , and played until deep in the night
let us not forget the condition of life as of narration : that we can never see the whole picture at once—unless we propose to throw overboard all the god-conditioned forms of human knowledge

they had discovered that the process was facilitated by music ; and on these evenings the gramophone was pre-empted by the circle and carried down into the basement
i said , as lightly as possible
her birth , her childish illnesses , her first school , her boarding-school days at mademoiselle weichbrodt 's , her confirmation -- everything was carefully entered , with an almost reverent observation of facts , in the consul 's small , flowing business hand ; for was not the least of them the will and work of cod , who wonder-fully guided the destinies of the family ?
but first , a few brief explanations : the league for the organization of progress , mindful of its task of furthering human happiness—in other words , of combating human suffering by the available social methods , to the end of finally eliminating it altogether ; mindful also of the fact that this lofty task can only be accomplished by the aid of sociology , the end and aim of which is the perfect state , the league , in session at barcelona , determined upon the publication of a series of volumes bearing the general title : the sociology of suffering
this was clothilde , the daughter of a nephew of old buddenbrook who belonged to a penniless branch of the family and was in business at rostock as an estates agent
and ye could at the same time not exclude the theoretic possi- bility of spontaneous harmony between a man 's own needs and the moment , the possibility of 'rightness , of a natural harmony , j out of which one might create without a thought or any compul- sion
a man with a red beard arid brown tail-coat came in
your eyes , the master said , vainly seek to hide the fact that you are conscious of your state

sometimes julie 's brother hermann went to school at the same time with the two girls
well , that does sound most nice , he would ay when a tale was done ; but often he went to sleep with his head on the story-teller 's breast
but there was not a single white hair to be seen in her smooth red-blonde coiffure
schildknapp and i exchanged looks
said hans castorp , and flung off his covers

for such qualities , my dear chap , the inhabitants of the economic sphere do not contribute the necessary existential correspondences
but after all , a dying man has something in a way—sacred about him
and in the second monologue elements of the first are thus delightfully recalled to the mind
imagine , he talks about the earth being thirsty , and uses a fig- ure of speech like that , adrian related to me next time , in , von- der
stances in view of the times she lived in , this upsetting and under- mining social epoch , did it hold out any hope of satisfaction
but they were so close he had to slide sidewise from his seat , and then the three stood in a triangle , the centre of which was the chair
every one stood talking and laughing ; they all showed each other their presents and admired the presents of others
would he take after him , and be a drag , a conservative element ?
a physician cites a case of a twelve-year-old-girl , who fell asleep and slept thirteen years ; assuredly she did not remain thereby a twelve-year-old girl , but bloomed into ripe womanhood while she slept
but you must be sure to give it me back , after the period
you just change it
he had intended to be a priest ; but on account of his tendency to stutter and his leaning toward the good things of life he had become a pedagogue instead
they flew like lightning round and round each other , clacking all the while
the path had become level
and he suddenly gives a short groan , full of horror and affright , starts up in his chair , and acts as if he were trying to escape
but with the last word he lifted the fist that had been lying relaxed on the table , and brought it down with a crash , making our slim young hans castorp , overwrought as he was with wine and play , and the singularity of the whole scene , jump , and in startled awe look at the mighty one
it was very strange , partly painful and partly comic , to observe riedesel 's conservatism in contact with another brand of the same thing
he quenched one flame after another under the little metal cap
herr sonnenschein , with one black eye , a bleeding lacuna in the curling black locks about his brow , was led into the bureau , where he sat down , buried his face in his hands and wept bitterly
twenty-eight is free , so far as i know
in other words , they were in part the fruit of joachim ’ s presence , in part the result of hans castorp ’ s own moral compunctions ; but also , in part , they rested upon his sure intuition that social relations with frau chauchat , conventional relations , in which one made bows and addressed her as madame , and spoke french as far as possible , were not the thing at all , were neither necessary nor desirable
it would not only have tranquillized my indefinite concern , al- ways present , albeit silently ; and moreover it would have touched me deeply , for the sacrificium intellectus , which of necessity con- templation and knowledge of the other world carries with it , must be esteemed the more highly , the more powerful the intel- lect that makes it
on the one hand it is bad news , on the other grand news—and in any case a change
it was true that hanno had laughed
so much was certain , that by little and little they had now got well on in september , close on to the middle
hans castorp , still quite absorbed by that glimpse , instinctively tried to make his own eyes as large , as slowly gazing and meaningful as those of the dying man , walking on as he did so , toward the stairs , and encountering a lady who came out of a room behind him and overtook him at the landing
he half-way admitted that theology , as an empiric study , had disappointed him ; the reasons of course being to seek not in that revered science , nor with his academic teachers , but in himself
i am raging , you will
hans castorp for his part sat with bowed head , trying to reflect on what had been said and test his own understanding of it
well , well , what a long time ago that was !

respectable townsfolk - and their pensive mood rejoices in the protection of halberdiers
it stands , vholly and entirely at the service of the regime which brought us into this war , laid the continent literally at our feet and replaced the in- tellectual 's dream of a european germany with the upsetting , rather brittle reality , intolerable , so it seems to the rest of the world , of a german europe
he was rich , he told them , and an orphan
this was hans castorp , who was supposed to answer
not that , even up here , they did not make jests on the subject
the excellent management , in its sleepless concern for the happiness of its guests , had considered matters , there in the bowels of the earth , had resolved , and acted
hans castorp was aware , and had even spoken of the fact , that madame chauchat ’ s profile was not her strong point , that it was no longer quite youthful , was even a little sharp

half past nine—i say , did you get that ?
all of us up here are frightfully fed up , you can imagine , said joachim , and twisted his mouth into an expression of disgust that was as unlike him as the shoulder-shrug

however much i dislike hearing that conception of moonshine and cobwebs people call the soul ’ played off against the body , yet , within the antithesis of body and mind , the body is the evil , the devilish principle , for the body is nature , and nature—within the sphere , i repeat , of her antagonism to the mind , and to reason—is evil , mystical and evil
in every bar that one dares to think , the situation as regards technique presents itself to him as a problem
they tried another tack , invoked more powerful spells , came on the aristocratic problem , on popularity and exclusiveness
the mood of the piece in question was peculiar to itself , quite special—he suggested they should try it
what was there about the rolling up of a cloth to take to heart ?
it might be still finer , they ironically said , if only age were to judge youth and youth could only be the subject of outside observation , as though it had no share of objective mind
if it comes to exist—and i repeat that we labour with silent assiduity upon this great task—then indeed the religious creed of the freemason will be unanimous , and it will be écrasez l ’ infame !
and directly before the manœuvres he has been so on fire to go to
he had been fellow citizen and brother-in-arms to any people struggling for its liberties
i recall that as we drove and later while we took our evening meal in the cleanly hotel opposite the cloister we talked at length about the unhappy king ( why , really , unhappy ? )

it costs you nothing and you will have a lot of satisfaction from it
you make yourself a laughing-stock with your love affairs , your harlequinades , your diseases and your remedies
me either , on grounds similarly hard to justify ; and the same was true without reservation of the poet daniel zur hohe who was often present
it was fortunate , then , that the heads had their unchanging eyes upon him , that they knew how to read his face , and were ready to tide him over the hard place with new and fruitful diversions
mais va donc avec ton behrens !
one beer , six milks -- sweet milk , buttermilk , sour milk , clotted milk , herr consul ?
hans castorp laughed good-humouredly over the bundle of hay , likewise over the beautiful characters—or , rather , the drolly despairing way settembrini spoke of them
christmas eve came on apace , one day it was at hand , the next it was here
a child , at the last , it may be

tell me : you love your husband with your whole heart , do not you ?
herr gr� looked at his banker helplessly and beg ?
then slowly he retraced the path that more than a year ago he had first traversed with joachim
they do that too , then ?
he looked at it with the same avid curiosity now as then

bread of god , bread of sunshine , little pet name ; bread for the laving of man ’ s weary spirit
he perceived the lamentable failure of his occasional efforts : he knew they only strained the relations between father and son
i ca not undo my shoe-lace ; please , gerda
has it not been relaxed by an excessive flexibility ?
he put on a horn-rimmed pince-nez , the nose-piece of which rode high up on his forehead , and ordered champagne , three bottles of mumm & co , cordon rouge , extra dry , with petits fours , toothsome cone-shaped little dainties in lace frills , covered with coloured frosting and filled with chocolate and pistache cream
they received him into the club with open arms ; for , while neither business men nor scholars found him a genius , they recognized his amusing social gifts

le-brecht kr� sat up as straight as he did at the beginning ; pastor wunderlich 's face was as pale as ever , his manner as correct

the last candle burned lower and lower
but at the same time i had it in mind to connect those very qualities and charac- teristics with the abstract speculations to which i was exposed in the house of herr sextus i { ridwiss and to which i referred on an earlier page
but the great thing is that you are here
for whereas the sleeping hans castorp had more than once upbraided the organ-grinder to his face and done his utmost to drive him away because he felt him a disturbing influence , the waking one lent him an attentive ear and made an honest effort to minimize the opposition which his mentor ’ s ideas and conceptions persistently aroused in him
her hair came in disorder from under her close hat , and her face showed the pale yellow tint which it always had when her digestion took a turn for the worse

they were thinking how little they had expected such an outcome as this to their excursion
cried a voice flom the tiny audience , for the speaker could simply not get the word out , often as he had used it before , but kept on mumbling the m yes , of course , said he , released and relieved
what depiction of suffering !
dora the cd ok , about whose honesty tony had had her doubts , was busy in the dining-room

neither one nor the other , he answered him- self ; they were parallel phenomena
they had exchanged the nike salon , where they had sat at first , for the ab- bot 's room , shutting out the light with blinds and hangings , so that it was as i had known it : at first complete night to the eyes , then they learned to distinguish more or less the position of the furniture and perceived the weakly trickling shimmer of the outer light , a pallid gleam on the walls
yet it was dreadful to see how his ruin as a citizen , the judicial correction , and the three years ' imprisonment , had operated to break down his morale
the people , de-lighted at the successful outcome of the revolution , were out in the gayest mood

interesting sure enough , responded the hofrat
the amount must have been very small , continued the hofrat
jacobs could do it -- the upholsterer in fish street
beyond them still , young men were practising archery
but if other children came up to them on the mill-wall , as she sat with hanno on a bench , fraulein junginann would get up almost at once , make some excuse or other -- it was late , or there was a draught -- and take her charge away
it was not talked about ; no questions were asked of justus kroger ; but it got about that jacob had a position as travelling man in new york and was about to sail
supervision was exercised by a master in a slouch hat , who munched a ham sandwich the while
strange , strange , he murmured
if he refuses , we need not be discouraged
i am going away , she repeated , smiling with pretended surprise at his discomfiture
he grew red with pleasure , his tears seemed this time actually on the point of falling

she expressed herself in the most childish way
his manner was free and easy and like a man of the world 's , which did not fail to make a certain impression on madame permaneder ; the more so that he nearly always turned to her as he spoke
if you mounted the slope from the end of the sledge-run in the village , you could reach in some twenty minutes the picturesque spot where the wooden bridge of the path through the forest crossed above the run as it came down from the schatzalp , provided you kept to the shortest route , did not loiter about , nor pause too long to get your breath
i should like to think he was truly drawn to adrian , and that his own feeling was the source of the unerring and staggering self-confidence which finally made conquest of coldness and melancholy

you have always been a better son to our parents ; but if you really stood so much closer to them than i do , you might have absorbed a little of their christian charity
but that would be only a mercy for him , a blessed relief
he saw himself and his brother christian , walking around the garden of the meng street house , involved in a quarrel -- one of those painful , regrettable , healed discussions
the consul had to come to her de-fence
he shoved back his chair , went into the salon , and lighted several burners of the chandelier over the centre-table
the son of the house of schweigestill , gereon , the same who had introduced the new danure-spreader , a young farmer rather disobliging and curt but obviously knowing his business , awaited the guest at the little station , on the box of a trap with a high frame and stiff springs
all the guests declared they could not bear to look any more at the snow , they were sick of it ; they had had their fill in the summer-time , and now these masses and heaps and slopes and cushions of snow , day in and day out , were more than they could stand , their spirits sank under the weight of it
they talked about it in glowing terms on the bourse for a whole week
a carpet almost covering the floor , only too necessary in tinter , soon hid the worn boards ; and to the corner bench , the only seat in the room besides the savonarola chair in front of the work-table , there was added after a few days without any fastidi- ous regard for style , which was not in adrian 's line , a very deep reading- and easy-chair covered with grey velvet , from bern- heimer 's in \unich , a commendable piece , which together with its separate stool , a tabouret with a cushion , deserved the name of chaise-longue ; it took the place of a divan , and did its owner al- most two decades of service
the second week was passing ; soon two-thirds of his holiday would be gone ; the third week would no sooner begin than it would be time to think of packing
when she sang isolde 's frau minne kenntest du nicht , and marked by an energetic downward thrust of her arms the ecstatic die fackez , war 's zeines lebens licht lachend sie zu lijschen zagt ' ich nicbt , it did not lack much for me , with tears in my eyes , to have knelt before the singer as she stood tri- umphantly smiling , overwhelmed with applause
but it was hardly carducci ’ s devil you had in mind when you spoke ; for he is on the very best of terms with hard work ; whereas yours , who is afraid of work and hates it like poison , is probably the same of whom we are told that we may not hold out even the little finger to him
well , come along , let me thump you about a bit
a little girl spoke a piece , a common soldier was with difficulty prevented from reading to the end a manuscript that began dear citizens and citizenesses !
there were citizens ' papers , with the seal and crest of the free hansa town ; insurance policies ; letters inviting this or that buddenbrook to become god-father for a colleague 's child : congratulatory epistles and occasional poems
as they went into the smoking room , herr kesselmeyer said vivaciously : have you had a pleasant journey ?
you had just come
one has to bear these things
in any case , laughed hans castorp , we have it all right before our eyes
frightfully funny man , is behrens ; killingly funny , makes you die of laughing
the corner of his eyebrow went up , and his cigarette moved from one corner of his mouth to the other : his thoughts were probably with the little flower-girl with the malay face , who had lately married the son of her employer and now herself carried on the shop in fishers ' lane

thus the eating of the little book , which albrecht durer also boldly made the subject of one of his woodcuts , is taken alnst word for word from ezekiel , down to the detail that it ( or the roll , therein ianentation and mourning and woe ) in the mouth of the obediently eating one , -as as honey for sweetness
dark blue spots of congested blood on clarissa 's lovely hands and on her face indicated death by quick suffocation , the abrupt paralysis of the organs of breathing by a dose of cyanide large enough to kill a regiment

he had a long consultation with the frau senator , and then hanno was summoned and put , half undressed , through a long examination of his status praesens , as dr langhals called it , looking at his finger-nails
what did the girl say ?
and the information the consul had had , the books he had examined -- ?
for theirs was a work of supererogation ( ex supererogatione ) in that they not only combated the rebellion of the flesh ( rebellio carnis ) , which after all was incumbent upon any average healthy human reason to do , but were hostile to even an inclination toward the things of the sense , toward love of self and love of worldly things , even where these had not been directly forbidden
in the act of leaving , however , and already at the door , frau-permaneder turns
anal- ysis has necessarily the appearance of coolness , even when prac- tised in a state of profound agitation
he lil { ed to say well : well , it was lovely
there was one new-comer , a hollow-cheeked , green-complexioned young man , who had been given a place at the next table on the right with frau iltis and the ivory-skinned levi
he is a most constant wooer
and at the end he asked to have money sent : a monthly cheque of eight hundred marks would cover everything
he paid frau stöhr compliments that made the vulgar creature bridle more extravagantly than ever , and become almost senseless with affectation
for you , personally , engineer , she is beyond all doubt dangerous
trina , the cook , who had never before been anything but loyal and dutiful to her mistress , had suddenly shown clear signs of revolt
any theoretic science which is without practical application to man ’ s salvation is as such without significance , we are commanded to reject it
to the utmost of their icy ability they dabbled in the organic ; and that jonathan could never get over , nor cease his more or less disapproving but also admiring shakes of the head
he asked , as they went down the steps
the rest of the guests were scattered in different coaches , with exception of the schlaginhaufen pair , the suabian-speaking old rentier and the foriler von plausig , who together with their friends fron the op- era made the trip by car
came a sudden cry , and herr albin nodded
oh , it 's you , hanno , he said
he was nearly as old as johann buddenbrook , and dressed in much the same style except that his coat was green instead of mouse-coloured
they held her by the arms , and i rushed over to rudolf , who had been stretched out on the now empty bench
but he spent more of his time at the club than in meng street , for life there was not made any too pleasant for him
frau stöhr , fräulein engelhart , hermine kleefeld and her friend the tapir-faced girl , herr albin , the young man with the finger-nail , and perhaps others among the guests—would stand together and watch him , with the corners of their mouths drawn down , fairly chortling , whilst he , poor wight , his face aglow with the heat that from the first had never left him , with the glittering eye the gentleman rider ’ s cough had kindled , would gaze , forlornly and frantically smiling , in one certain direction
what will you have to do now ?
what a charming sight altogether , this host of shawms in their highly developed stage of technical perfection , challenging the passion of the virtuoso in all of their forms : as bucolic oboe , as cor anglais well versed in tragic ways ; the many-keyed clarinet , which can sound so ghostly in the deep chalumeau register but higher up can glean in silvery blossoming harmony , as basset horn and bass clarinet
had he not once , who always sat so erect at table , loathed and despised the banging of doors , and never , never was tempted to gnaw his fingers , because to that end maria had been given him instead , had he not once taken deep offence at the unmannerly behaviour of frau chauchat , and felt an unconquerable sense of superiority when he heard the narrow-eyed one essay to speak his mother-tongue ?
on the contrary , naphta hastened to say
a return after this parting - im- possible !
everything is a matter of ripeness and of dear time
but after all , ° was unquestionably fever , even though no higher than the earlier record
space , rolling and revolving between him and his native heath , possessed and wielded the powers we generally ascribe to time
but in such a connexion it would be paradoxical to speak of time as passing slowly ; and paradox , with reference to such a hero , we would avoid
herr benthien , the draper , a prosperous looking man , had a large group of gentlemen around him , to whom he wad circumstantially describing what had happened to his show-window
let it go hang !
he : it is that extravagant living , the only one that suffices a proud soul
at all events , here was one on whom the authorities no longer needed to keep an eye , being assured that no wild or defiant resolves were ripening in his breast
are you willing to keep office hours and observe appearances ?
the occasion was to be signalized by the presentation of the gift to the head of the establishment , which accordingly took place , in the room with the optical apparatus
teredo but one has to admit that the domestication of sex , which is evil by nature , into christian marriage was a clever makeshift
can you see the hilus glands ?
hermann hagenstrbm would hardly have been the man for the job
the cousins smiled at the deception , and for joy at the wonder before their eyes—at this timorous and lovely assumption of protective coloration , as it were , on the part of these first shy returning motions of organic life
he went so far as to ask him to orchestrate the piano reductions of single acts from operas unknown to adrian , and the conparison of that , vhich the pupil tried , who had heard and read berlioz , debussy , and the german and austriall late ro- mantics , with that which grctry or cherubini had actually done made llaster and pupil laugh
what were they so jolly about ?
but she so hung upon them , with words and looks , that it was painful to see , putting forth all her powers to hold them only a little longer—it would have been cruel not to have vouchsafed her another few minutes
and now clara 's dowry is permanently lost , and her whole inheritance besides for an indefinite period
she never saw me , and i made bold to lay my hand on her sleeve , for my mind misgave me about the state of things
the world was upside down
i scarcely need to say that adrian was remote from the beginnings of the events i shall speak of here , being aware of them only to a certain extent and that only through me , who had much more social curiosity or shall i say human sym- pathy
his brother , george , now long since the master of buchel , was five years his senior

their wet , mud-bespattered faces , framed between strap and grey-covered helmet , are flushed with exertion—perhaps too with the sight of the losses they suffered on their march through that boggy wood
amelia had a habit , at table , of moving spoons or forks to and fro in front of her eyes and repeating with a questioning intonation sotie word that had stuck in her mind
in short , as you know , betsy , i can only wish for the consummation of this match , which would be highly advantageous for the family and the firm
and , then , suddenly , abruptly , with a start , he awoke and felt as one feels on realizing , suddenly , a budding love in the heart
why should not he buy it -- you know ?
sitting very erect , he would turn the whole upper part of his body to speak to his neighbour ( with selfpossession , of course , and a little platt ) and he kept his elbows well in as he dismembered his piece of fowl , or deftly , with the appointed tool , drew the rosy flesh from a lobster ’ s shell
well , well , said tom , you can have a rest and the sea-baths
there was a birthday celebration , and he came home a little bit exalted , so to speak , and was guilty of a false step , an unseemly blunder -- 'thomas , said she , i do not understand you
this was a great pleasure
we have begun - monsignor hinterpfortner and i are no longer exceptions - to expect anything and everything from the , var technique of the anglo-saxons

his face white as a sheet , his coat spotted with blood—he might have been a murderer stealing from his crime
and then -- six glasses of milk and a glass of beer -- if i am not mistaken , herr permaneder ?
everywhere is adrian leverkiihn great in making unlike the like
he was wont to rest from these terrors and ecstasies in another number , brief , yet with a concentrated power of enchantment ; peaceful , compared with the other , an idyll , yet raffiné , shaped and turned with all the subtlety and economy of the most modern art
but outside they had probably not held their tongues ; for shortly afterwards frau schweigestill came quietly in , in her apron , , vith her smooth grey head , and stood near the door , with folded hands
something amazing , something dreadful , something at which the very actors in the scene themselves stood aghast and incredulous
then there was a woman named mathilde spiegel , dressed in the fashion of a bygone time : she wore a train trimmed with ruffles , and a fladus - a ridiculous corruption of the french flute douce , originally meaning flattery , but here used for a curious coiffure with curls and ornaments
a common word never crossed his lips ; and the most ordinary business expressions he would hiss between his clenched teeth , as if he were saying curses on you , villain , instead of some commonplace about stocks , and commissions
but he takes no offence at that
my first excursion was no great success
and yet he had an inward conviction that we ought to think about it , ought to realize what a blessed , what a well-nigh miraculous arrangement it was
the meadows were covered with silvery-grey webs
how happy she must be !
they went back along the path in the same order as they had come , through the draped , uncanny grove , to the high road and the waiting carriages
to make a new home , and a radical change in his outward life ; to pack up , to re-install himself afresh , to weed out all the accumulations of bygone years and set aside every-thing old or superfluous : all this , even in imagination , gave him feelings of freshness , newness , spotlessness , stimulation
this emmy , then , had been discovered in her room at one o ’ clock at night in company with another sufferer , a greek named polypraxios , the same whose shapely legs had attracted favourable attention the night of mardi gras—a young chemist whose father owned dye-works in the piraeus
afterwards , as the meal progressed , the hofrat made a little speech , incited thereunto by james , who unexpectedly asked him , down the whole length of the table , what was the process of physical decomposition
this industrious , solid citizen with the rough exterior and no social graces , who devoted himself with an obstinate sense of duty to his work alone -- this man was supposed to have been guilty , not once but repeatedly , of a serious fault : he was accused of , he had been indicted for , performing a business manoeuvre which was not only questionable , but directly dishonest and criminal
straight under the tongue , seven minutes , four times a day , and shut the lips well over it
that we shall soon -- we can soon see -- !
he would be so good , he was told , to have patience for a few days ; the hofrat was busy , there were operations and general examinations , suffering humanity must take precedence , that was a sound christian principle ; and as he was ostensibly in good health , he must get used to the idea that he was not number one up here , that he must stand back and await his turn
then , with a series of starts , she came to herself , blinked in her turn at the light with sleep-stiffened eyes and smiled
but it is she who sometimes visits him ; not often , once in the year for a little while
very much better than a knave
did the gentlemen know that he—the hofrat—had invented the summer season ?
but she saw that patience was her only weapon ; for it was long before her question drew out any reply
who else , i should like to know , is to speak of it today ?
what possible objection could there be ?
and did they really become him -- him , thomas buddenbrook , head of the firm of johann buddenbrook ?
good and evil , sanctification and criminal conduct , all mixed up together !
he rolled his r 's as if his palate were greased
dnly -- in the present case is not this consideration for the tradition a little exaggerated ?
in the first place , they would not let me ; and in the second place , i should never really know enough
don ’ t talk to me about literature , says he
it is settled now
and he would go on into joachim ’ s balcony
herr settembrini had no doubt that the speaker would find ways and means of reconciling his scorn of the golden age of rome with his office as teacher of latin
certainly , of course , he would hasten to remark , so that nobody might say of him that with all his elegance he was limited
mitique - there must be some peculiar and interesting psycho- logical association : i do not ask , i consider all possibilities , i frankly bring them all up , even the most fantastic
you can imagine we had much to talk about at the table , but we had left the old memories behind by the end of the soup , and went on to more serious and fascinating matters
i can imagine herr settembrini coming in suddenly and turning on the light , to let reason and convention reign—it is a weakness of his
but that is a delusion
a few details : the part of the whore of babylon , the woman on the beast , with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication , is , surprisingly enough , a most graceful coloratura of great virtuosity ; its brilliant runs blend at times with the orchestra exactly like a flute
certainly , papa , answered she
going slightly pale , and blinking , he expressed his admiration for the splendid ruby colour of his life-blood , as it mounted in the glass container
i remarlced again with unspoken arnusement the in- voluntary attention and more or less timid reverence paid to him
but on the other hand , he left the little angel ecstasies to sim- pler folk
moderate activity is all right ; but not too much craving for adventure , no coying with the bride of the storm
naphta sharply forbade settembrini to call himself an individualist , for so long as he denied the antithesis between god and nature , saw in the problem of man ’ s inward conflict no more than the struggle between individual and collective interest , and was vowed to a materialistic and bourgeois ethic , in which life became an end in itself , limited to utilitarian aims , and the moral law subserved the interest of the state
i must look it out
once at the bottom they would turn and trundle their toy sledges uphill again
why does almost everything seem to me like its ovvn parody ?
she uttered it with her shoulders lifted and her eyes rolled up
tom , she said ; and she looked at him , holding the paper with both hands , as if she hesitated to show it to him
the family went about rather subdued and did not speak much about it , with the exception of the chief actor in the affair , who , on the contrary , talked about it inexhaustibly , and was entirely in her element
you do reverence to a hollow mask
this basket had a border of head-work embroidery , done by little meta , the eight-year-old daughter , who now sat next her mother , dressed in a plain frock , her flaxen hair in a thick pigtail
as one would expect , from a man without passion !
first time , then the barber , performed their office upon our hero
inquired settembrini , who had lounged up among the other guests , hands in pockets , and now presented himself before hans castorp
can you find it in your heart to say : ' i despise you ' ?
yet each , in itself—this was the uncanny , the anti-organic , the life-denying character of them all—each of them was absolutely symmetrical , icily regular in form
first of all to show him attention and help him pass the time ; but also to be edified by the motions of the great man ’ s personality
there you have the whole thing , she was always like that
frau stöhr went about for days quite outraged on account of a loan of ten francs which she inadvisedly laid out for frau iltis at the meeting , and which the latter had forgotten to return
even so , not always , and so probably unintentionally , some loose strands hung charm- ingly down in front of the ears
she sat with her body turned to the right , staring with red , excited eyes out of the window
it was precisely the opposite , it was very physical , it was material , it could not possibly be called either holy , or pensive , or beautiful—not even mournful
in every other field you have a perception of the banal -- in music not
if you give gotthold a compensation for the house , you have started the hall rolling
and of which you owe me an explanation
what are you quarrelling about ?
i suppose there is nobody grand enough these days to occupy the whole thing
right , but as explanation does not go far enough
here was the object of his rigid devotion , whereas naphta with reprehensible looseness referred truth back to mankind itself , and declared that that was truth which advantaged man
in addition to the guests already named , i mention a few more of those present , at randolti and from mem- ory : the wealthy bullinger , leo zink , the painter , whom neither
you looked at the thick ash-blonde hair , rolled at the sides , drawn back above the little ears , and fastened on the top of the head with a broad tortoise-shell comb ; at the soft expression of her grey-blue eyes , her pretty upper lip , the fine oval and delicate colour of her face -- and you thought of three-and-twenty , perhaps ; never of thirty
he was vain , that is , not in a common , yay , but in poetic reference to the endless potential of happiness in the world , far outbidding his own power of resolution , for which he wished to keep himself young and handsome ; he was aggrieved at the tendency of his face to be prematurely wrinkled and weather-beaten
the striped brown blinds were down , the low , red-shaded lamp burned on the table , there was a faint smell of violets and fresh wash , and a delicious atmosphere of laziness and dreams
he repeated his inquisition ; and even added , of his own motion : pretty nice , what ?
in her whole insignificant fig-ure , in her every movement , there indwelt a force which was , to be sure , somewhat comic , yet exacted respect
in the mood that had come over him so unexpectedly , his goggling eyes blinked , and the bone of his neck stuck out , both more than ever ; his upper lip , with the clipped , onesided moustache , had taken on a querulous expression
he seemed not to have been listening
said he , pale in the face , but in his clear , scholarly , well-articulated , short-winded way of speaking
and the wedding day drew near
they possessed the most re-markable theories concerning inner light and intuition and the transmission of thought
you would come along and turn on the electric light and bring the young men back to the path of virtue—that ’ s what you do , isn ’ t it ?
when the service and the burial were over , and the seventy or eighty hired coaches began to roll back to town , gotthold buddenbrook asked the consul 's permission to go with him , that they might speak together in private
she had a thick pigtail , good-natured blue eyes , and a broad mecklenburg accent , and went about thinking just nothing at all on the subject
on the stair hans castorp said : that was awful
madame k�n , may i have the honour ?
and how does rosaline come to apply to the sharp-tongued , merry biron of the play such wisdom as : the blood of youth burns not with such excess as gravity 's revolt to wantonness ?

she remained some time in the water , trying to contract some illness or other—alas , she was , and remained , quite sound
he looked pale and made the impression of a man who has had a heavy blow
the senator sat quite still and looked the speaker full in the face
no slightest adverse comment upon the said table being intended by the remark !
i could recite to any child - though not nearly so well as echo did - what the neighbours had to bear froin the hullabaloo those hurdy-gurdies kept up
willingly indeed did she go to her death , with the ex- press declaration that even if she were freed she would prefer the stake , in order to escape from the po , ver of the demon , so re- pugnant had her life become to her through ler subjection to her filthy sin
there is outcry over these crimes against culture , crimes that we ourselves invoked ; hovy strange it sounds in the mouths of those vvho trod the boards of history as the heralds and bringers of a world-rejuvenating barbarism , revelling in atrocity
the senator sat down at the round table and tried to read the jokes in a volume of fliegsnde blatter , flung down the hook , and pressed the cool silver handle of his walking-stick against his cheek
he made no bones of saying that in giving herself to him now , she was buying peace only for the moment , buying the trip to strasbourg , the betrothal
the solid parts are only twenty-five per cent of the whole , and of that twenty are ordinary white of egg , protein , if you want to use a handsomer word
yes , yes , he said , and nodded
she produced an invalid table , a marvel of one-legged equilibrium , adjusted it across his bed , and hans castorp banqueted like the tailor ’ s son in the fairy-story
monsieur would be spiteful , cutting ?
one must incorporate into the system all possible techniques of variation , including those decried as artificial ; that is , the means which once helped the wouldevelop- ment ' to win its hold over the sonata

anyhow , there was no doubt that this siegismund gosch was a remarkable and learned man
i set down here what i know of this extraordinary being
there were a thick ledger and a metal inkstand and sand-holder , full of well-sharpened pencils and goose-quills
of course i will go and see after the carriage
a suffering voice said come in , and he opened the door , to find frau permaneder lying on the bed fully dressed
she pouted and shrugged her shoulders
they did , in a half-humorous way , express his highly personal and intimate animosity to the great adversary
very droll it was : singing loudly , the people had set out to shatter the revolutionary tyranny for the benefit of reactionary princely authority—and this they did in the name of freedom
but this was not all
the music pavilion , standing in a half-circle of beech-trees opposite the main building , was still empty and quiet

he even brought his wife , born st� and his three grown daughters : friederike and henriette , who were too tall and thin , and pfiffi , who was eighteen , and too short and fat
but by the fifth month she can not get about , she goes to bed and writes to her husband , out in the baltic provinces ; behrens gets a letter from him marked personal ’ and urgent ’ in a very firm hand—i saw it myself
to me , who could not believe in their belief or share their hopes , they will be brought no nearer by the present agony of their souls
she wore a long , shaggy , fur-trimmed travellingcloak , and a large hat ; she was all smiles , her arms were full of flowers , she too seemed possessed by the pleasurable excitement due to the prospect of change , if to nothing else , which was common to all those who left , whatever the circumstances of their leaving , and whether with the consent of the physicans , or in sheer desperation and at their own risk
lust go and dig up your bones again
tower , and invade the show-rooms
with stiff movements that no longer had in them anything of the charm that had been his , he had his fur mantle put about his shoulders , and laid his arm , with a careless merci , on that of the consul , who offered to accompany him home
please excuse us for keeping you waiting , kesselmeyer , said herr gr�
it was a bit complicated for me
the scene blurred more and more , it inclined the eye , gazing thus into woolly vacuity , to slumber
but ida jungmann was very reserved
home—the berghof—was the picture of an ant-hill in a panic : its little population was flinging itself , heels over head , five thousand feet downwards to the catastrophe-smitten flat-land
the record went on , came to the middle part , with skipping rhythm , the part about war and danger , gallant , god-fearing , french
but i talked a little this morning with old gosch the broker ; he did not seem dis-inclined to undertake the business
he would go down : first with the narrow-gauge road as far as landquart , then to romanshorn , then across the wide , bottomless lake , over which in the legend the rider rode , across all germany , and home
what was the sense of that ?
he tool { everything as a matter of course , without any words , as something that proceeded from him and lay in his nature , whose power of inertia and fixation on the semper idem persisted in the face of outward circumstance
he has been with god these many years
the hofrat ’ s son , knut by name , came for the holidays and lived with his father in the wing of the building ; a good-looking young man , save that his cervical vertebra was already too prominent
counting his mother 's inheritance and his share of the meng street property , he was still worth more than six hundred thousand marks

for the wood was not quite usual , it had a peculiarity which made it picturesque , exotic , even uncanny
it was the artist or half- artist world that gathered there , a house-brol { e bohemia , so to speak : , veil-bred yet free-and-easy , and amusing enough to fulfil the expectations that had caused the frau senator to move from bremen to the southern capital
and they will go on ; they will go on to the end , tom
then came the following episode
then it is not surprising that herr settembrini does not love to be reminded of the golden age of his order
i ’ ve been observing for some days that you thought you had
belshazzar , king of babylon , and that sort of thing
yet even to-day , among the ignorant , the mushroom passed for an aphrodisiac
i , as a numismatist , feel myself entirely incompetent in this situation
he wrote that he deeply regretted what had happened , but that he respected antonie 's wishes , as he saw that he and she had never hit it off
we ’ ve philosophized a lot of late , he and i and naphta
he took two big steps backward , bent his torso to one side , pointed with his fore-finger to the carpet and said in an awful voice : antonie !
you would do well , sir , to leave the good name of my house to me
her voice had the characteristic huskiness , but was sympathetic
they drove between the first houses , passed the church , and rolled along the front close to the water and up to a pretty little bouse , the verandah of which was overhung with vines
the spectators sat in small tribunes , or pressed upon the narrow path that had been shovelled alongside the course ; or thronged the wooden bridges which spanned it , watching the sleds that from time to time whizzed beneath
since my parents ' death we have kept on all three maids , not counting mamsell jungmann
in good old ger- man words , as ehrenfried kumpf would say , you have given it to me straight , without any mealy-mouthing
yes , we were privileged to look at your paintings , i remember the whole thing so well
but , as i say , you have been diligent , you have done your best -- and whoever does his best -- ; you may sit down
he asked after a while
these so-called reformers of humanity did indeed take the words purification and sanctification in their mouths , but what they really meant and intended was the emasculation , the phlebotomy of life
the reappearance of the templars , indeed , means nothing else than the entrance of such conceptions , the presence of irrational ferments in a world given over to rational-utilitarian ideas of social improvement
he doesn ’ t like to have people get out of it
and with their eyes he beheld the picture just as they saw it : below , an aging man , worn out and crotchety , sat at his window in the office ; above , his beautiful wife made music with her lover
from hamburg to davos is twenty hours—that is , by train
there was another brother too , named moritz , but he was sickly and did his lessons at home
ss 'them in the singular
that was here in this house , where he was born , in front of the middle dining-room window , and old pastor hezekiel was still alive
he inclined to believe in the permanence of the particular state or circumstances in which he for the moment found himself ; prized it for that very quality , and was not bent on change
the wonder-box seemed to seethe : it poured out the chimes of bells , harp glissandos , the crashing of trumpets , the long rolling of drums
in fact there was no doctor present , not among all those concert-goers , though doctors are usually music-lovers , so many of them being ] evvs
but the boy should not let himself be robbed
having thus made a free space for what he was about to say , let me , he went on , let me repeat , that i am far from reproaching this italian gentleman with any actual offence against the rules of chivalry
we must proceed to extraction , he said , after a while , and turned still paler
well , then , some time ago , it was , i got a glimpse behind the scenes—purely by chance—and i remember it as if it were yesterday
he made no effort to deceive even himself ; and of all the dull , confused , and rambling thoughts that filled his mind he clung to only one : the single , despairing thought that thomas bud den-brook , at forty-three years , was an old , worn-out man
we will mal { e it a saturday - so far as i know you have no classes on saturday this semester
the congress sat for a week , with banquets and festivities
a closed carriage , its top glistening with wet , its wheels clogged with mud , was before the door
he said that—all of it ?
he had continued to live in the old consul ’ s roomy villa in harvestehuder way , though he had been a husband and father for some years , having taken a wife from his own social sphere , of his own highly civilized and elegant type , with the same soft , quick , pointedly polite manner of speech
the pale , dark mexican mother begged them , with a few incoherent words , and chiefly by means of a pathetic gesture of invitation , to come and receive in person the thanks of her son—son seul et dernier fils , qui allait mourir aussi
for example , the boy teddy was discovered , one day—not one single day , of course , but only rather indefinitely from which day— to be a boy no longer
how painful , after an intellectual conversation , to have to go about with your mind so stirred up
thus we spent many a sun- day afternoon in the good time of year at the farm , where the town-dwellers gratefully partook of the good cheer of the coun- tryside with which frau leverktihn regaled them : the grainy dark bread with fresh butter , the golden honey in the comb , the
rejection , renunciation , disdain , vere not incapacity , nor uninstructedness , nor evidence of poverty
and she learned from his own lips that he had dade the journey thither on her account
to do this gives me the needed reassurance , still needed even as it was at the time when i was present with horror , amaze , consternation , and pride , at its birth - an experience that i suppose was due to my loving devotion to its author but ac- tually went beyond my mental capacities , so that i trembled and was carried away
he entered a yellow-brown house in mill street and went up to the first storey , where a brass plate on the door said , brecht , dentist
according to him , he had not closed an eye , his parched throat making him start up every five minutes from his pillow
we live up here , next door to the dying , close to misery and suffering ; and not only we act as though we had nothing to do with it , but it is all carefully arranged in order to spare us and prevent our coming into contact with it , or seeing anything at all—they will take away the gentleman rider while we are at breakfast or tea—and that i find immoral
her father continued to probe her with his eyes
he had begun of late to grow a little stout , the single sign of age in his carefully preserved exterior , and his cheeks , behind the pointed protruding ends of his moustaches , looked rounder than they used ; but it was a pale and sallow roundness , with-out blood or life
he did not know the lady , he said ; but he did not , in his turn , ask who she was , nor did edelmann give any explanation of his question , other than merely by saying : at all events , you have ( or meister has ) no warmer admirer than she
can you see spots on your plate , herr settembrini ?
where , then , were the guests , he asked , and his cousin answered : in the rest-cure
but your theo- logian in grain , your arrant wily-pie who speculates on specula- tion because he has speculation in his blood already from the fa- ther 's side - there must be foul work an he did not belong to the dive !
we know that wind
he could not say enough to display the genuine cult of the real and by no means abstractly universal , hence also not almighty and all-present god of the people as a magic technique , a manipulation of dynamic forces , physically not without its risks , in which mishaps might easily oc- cur , catastrophic short circuits due to lllistal { es and failures
eva is very sweet to me , and her husband , herr niederpaur , the brewery superintendent , is an agreeable man
ah , ida , i think so much about the past these days : about the time when criinlich first appeared , and the scenes he made me -- scan-dalous , ida ! -- and then about travemiinde and the schwarz-kopfs -- she spoke slowly , and her eyes rested for a while dreamily on a darn in erica 's stocking
hans castorp was right in referring to them , as he did , with bated breath
christmas , like other holidays in the course of the year , served them for a fulcrum , or a vaulting-pole , with which to leap over empty intervening spaces
no , he would have no news of her , so long as they were separated by the mystery of time and space
you keep trying to find an explanation for them , an emotion to account for them , a feeling of joy or pain , which would , so to speak , justify them
but how well you put it !
eyes at the same time , but the desire to laugh is irresistible - i have always had to laugh , most damnably , at the most mysterious and impressive phenomena
no , to speak frankly , i don ’ t find it so overpowering , said hans castorp
and the extent to which it offered points of departure could be seen from the circumstance that the lecturer had lately talked about botany— to be precise , about mushrooms
he could heighten the play , by playing with forms out of which , as he well knew , life has disappeared
at the back , his hat over his brows , sat the stranger , beside clavdia
no one dreamed he would continue ; with embarrassed smiles they watched this futile activity , thinking every moment it would cease
and he waited for , expected something , without asking himself what
he must have felt the need of sharing his heavy responsibility with some one , not much matter who , because he realized that the end was inevitable
it needs some kind of down-to-earth , empirical content or application or confirmation , some practice in obedience to god
you talk about humanity just like settembrini
the priest , all too familiar with this kind of mischief , and men being tampered with in their best strength , went to the higher authorities with klopf- geissel 's confession
on these oc-casions the three miss buddenbrooka from broad street loved to turn the conversation to tony 's former marriage and to dart sharp glances at each other while they egged madame griinlirh on to use strong language
i am my own master !
he had pre-empted the child for his scientific use , held sittings with her in his analytical oubliette , hypnotized her , it was reported , in an effort to arouse and discipline her slumbering potentialities , to make researches into her previous psychic life
and dr krokowski went on to speak of a mushroom , famous in classical antiquity and since , on account of its form and the powers ascribed to it—a fungus in whose latin name the epithet impudicus occurred ; and which in its form was suggestive of love , in its odour of death
ida gave a joyous shriek and answered with some polish gibberish
then you must take hold and lift four times
found him not very artistic
pale , trembling , too ex-hausted to think about what had happened , he closed his eyes and sank back in lethargy
yes , mademoiselle will see , she will pick up here fast enough , the housewife said
she is upstairs in her room asleep , frau schwarzkopf said with feeling
but you are so partial
men want something different , you know
his shoulders shook with laughter
you would be invited out every evening
the top of his chest of drawers was covered with combs , brushes , and toilet preparations for hair and beard ; while within it was the supply of body linen of all possible kinds , which was constantly changed , washed , worn out , and renewed
it was born strong and active , while josephine buried her blood-less face deeper in the pillows and passed away
yet they persisted into later life , as the elements of a perfectly conscious memory-picture , which defied expression or analysis , but was none the less positive for all that
you showed us the portrait you made of frau chauchat , simply first-class treatment of the skin—i must say i was very much struck by it
yesterday i had a long talk with gr�
breathless they told him they had something quite abnormal for him , an omniscient , a girl with voices
but i will remind him that through liturgy and her history music plays very strongly into the theological ; more practically and artistically , in- deed , than into the mathematical and physical , or into acoustics
he compromised himself and made a laugh-able spectacle -- laughable , precisely because what he did was actually so harmless , so impossible to take seriously
a morning came when the thermometer in hans castorp ’ s room registered ° , the next morning it was only °
the pretexts she gave to little johann would have led him to believe that all his con- temporaries were either scrofulous of full of evil humours , and that he himself was a solitary exception ; which did not tend to increase his already deficient confidence and ease of manner
he took him into dark little warehouse offices to confer with super-intendents
this courtier , a former cavalry colonel , who had been appointed to his present post simply and solely because it had been well known that he played piano a little ( hovv many centuries ago it seems , that one could become a general-intendant solely because one was noble and played tbe piano a little !
but how about you ?
il faut avouer , que tu es un petit rêveur assez curieux
he sat down on the table , keeping her hand in his , and went on : listen , anna ; we will be sensible to-day , wo not we ?
every pot stands on its own bottom
so much for the present about the daughters , with whom adrian came into relations as housemates
the truth is : in a certain point , in puncto puncti as young people like to say , i formed in the company a somewhat comic excep- tion and fell so to speak out of the frame ; namely , in my quality and way of life as a benedict , which paid tribute to what we half excusingly , half glorifyingly called nature
the words came , round , clear-cut , and as though newly minted , from his mobile lips , he tasted his own wellturned , dexterous , biting phrases with obvious and contagious relish , and seemed to be far too clearheaded and self-possessed ever to mis-speak
nobody 's face was beaming with joy , there was no lively conversation
it was easy for him to understand and respect hans castorp ’ s reserve—the more in that he shared it , even feeling his own position to be more difficult than the other ’ s
it would not be the truth if i should say no
a shiver ran over him , then several , one after the other
in a postscript he offered to make immediate restitution of the dowry
they achieved their ambition , and were re-spected by their stupider and lazier colleagues
by your own theory , you must be yourself more ailing than you look , you are so obviously possessed of esprit
no one could now stop him
the validity of the church ’ s teaching on the subject of science , which can be summed up in the phrase of saint augustine : credo , ut intellegam : i believe , in order that i may understand , is absolutely incontrovertible
all others bring debasement and degradation in their train , even when not directed to that end
these were masculine evenings , with the beer-glass on the floor beside the chair , a cigar in the mouth , and frequent bursts of talk , strange , dry interruptions in the middle of the language of music ; tapping of the bow and counting back of the bars when the players got out , which was almost always the fault of the singing- master
he had done so of his own motion , without telling anyone , on a solitary walk he took down to the platz while joachim was occupied with the weekly weighing or injection
i ( defiant , do not answer )
hans castorp ’ s hair and nails grew too , grew rather fast
the facial expression becomes dull , the mouth stands open , the eyes are without life
but what is to become of the reval agreement , ludovico , if your progressive turks are successful ?
once hans castorp had remarked this , he could not forbear corroborating it again and again
fräulein levi said she was willing to sleep with frau stöhr , for that abject creature confessed she was too frightened to go to bed alone
and the lion roared
knew how to extract from the pressure obviously resting on him
dr faustus fatigue , the capacity for disgust - all that was perfectly calculated to make a profession of the talent bound up with it
it was a horrid sight
hans castorp found that charming—most edifying
he washed his eyes and hands , brushed his hair , put his clothing to rights , and met joachim outside in the corridor
six candles burned in a candelabrum on the slender sewing-table beside her , and the chandelier was un-lighted
can he never be ready on time ?
you go about feeling ghastly , he said , turning to his brother and wrinkling up his nose
the father laid less stress on their intrinsic value than upon the general ability of which they gave evidence
i-ie put together his thoughts on theory and published them as a preface to the book of the turtle dove
what objection could be brought against a daily regimen like that , which so blandly took acquiescence for granted ?
he persisted in his sincere and respectful if also rather forward sympathy for this man on the grand scale , regardless of his partnership in the travelling-trunks of the woman of whom once , on a carnival night , hans castorp had borrowed a lead-pencil
he un-doubtedly had a few verses in his pocket for the present oc-casion
at least he clothed his discomfort in words which recognized the simplicity , good taste , and informality of our af- fair , the absence of customs and curtsyings as he put it
they shrugged their shoulders and gave it out as their view that it took two to play at such games , and that it was unlikely anything had happened against the will of either participant
the senator was dying
but what will you have ?
the extended summer trip which had once been customary with the buddenbrooks had now been given up for some years
herr settembrini ’ s question , and its delivery , were prodigious
but the drops will be hanging on the trees outside -- we can drink coffee in the verandah
do you know how you look ?
this is it , this is it !
if you were ill the last time , you could have had help in that part ; besides , if the first part dealt with the condition before the tribulation , and the second part with the tribulation itself , you could have told by counting on your fingers that the third part must deal with the con-dition after the tribulation !
how could she enter into joachim ’ s turbulent emotions , due in part to the sensation that he was come home , which for the moment outweighed all else , and in part to the stimulus of the incomparably light , empty , yet kindling air he was once breathing ?
will you permit me—not a word
maybe yelling commands in the service set up a locus minoris resistentiæ there
a hint lay in his suggestion that they might telegraph and let the parents know
he must soon have seen that he did not fit in very well ; but he concealed the fact under an increased assurance of manner , while the frau consul , uncle justus , and the senator -- though hardly the broad street bud den-brooks -- practised a tactful complaisance toward the socially awkward , hard-working official
in white flannel trousers and blue blazer , he would come back late from his treatment , neat and military ; would enter the dining-room , make his little bow , courteous and composed , in excuse of his tardiness , and sit down to his meal , which was specially prepared , for he no longer ate the regular food , on account of the danger of choking ; he received minces and broths
but she did not come : she was dead
i ca not be anything
on their heels came the parents of frau consul kr� , the lumber-dealer overdieck and his wife , a fond old pair who still addressed each other in public with nicknames from the days of their early love
the listeners almost died of laughter at his falsetto parlando , at the contrast between the deep voice and the tongue-splitting facility with which it rendered the words
space , like time , engenders forgetfulness ; but it does so by setting us bodily free from our surroundings and giving us back our primitive , unattached state
his trousers , of beautiful and lasting english stuff , flapped about his crooked emaciated legs
in sucll talk , with which he teased and irritated me , there was much that was merely imitative
hans castorp would shift his hands to behind his head , and reply to all he was asked , smiling in his turn
he advanced his head like a steer , with staring , bloodshot watery eves i won ’ t have it , he bellowed
never did a work come like that
just as real virtuosity in an actor shows up more brilliantly in a poor piece
i need do nothing more , i don ’ t count , i can laugh at the whole thing
hans castorp listened to herr settembrini out of a sense of duty and fairness , in the idea of hearing both sides ; with the best of intentions he tested the latter ’ s views on the subject of the republic , reason and the bello stile
copernicus will go down before ptolemy
thus might he return
you are thinking of the earthquake of messina
but whc-n tony , as chance offered , tried to come bark to the subject , he wrapped himself in silence , the more forbidding because of his inward mortification over having given way -- his inward bitterness at being , as he felt , feeble and inadequate to the situation in hand
classicism- yes , it is not sophisticated at all , but it is great
this was a stage higher than the mill
taking in this sense too , great as the whole piece itself , the fare- well of the sonata form
grouped and arranged itself in astonishingly precise and varied figures and arabesques
he gesticulated , he tore open his shirt to offer his yellow breast to the stroke of fate ; and continued thus , until an attack of coughing , which forced a thread of red foam to his lips , quenched his harangue and gave the cousins an excuse to go out , on tiptoe
he repeated them , softly , trying to reproduce the guttural , rustically formal syllables of the mountain tongue , as he climbed another stretch higher , above the hut
even so , there came an evening when joachim might behold his cousin the centre of a group composed of hermine kleefeld , gänser , rasmussen , and the youth of the monocle and the finger-nail , making an impromptu speech on the subject of frau chauchat ’ s peculiar and exotic facial structure , and betraying himself by his unsteady voice and the excited glitter of his eyes , until his listeners exchanged glances , nudged each other , and tittered
she was small as a child , with a long , oldish face—a dwarf , he realized with a start
dr faustus he gave this sense of the comic free rein , recal ] ing droll types among pupils and teachers , or describing his last cultural expedi- tion and some small-town opera performance , whose improvisa- tions could not fail to be a source of mirth , though without det- riment to the seriousness of the work performed
the genius , in the course of the conversation we have repeated , and elsewhere , called hans castorp a joli bourgeois au petit endroit humide , which might in some sense be considered a translation of the settembrinian epithet life ’ s delicate child ; and the question thus was , which constitutes of the mingled essence of his being would prove the stronger , the bourgeois or the other
i have so many worries ; everything is so hard for me
he taught the natural siicnces , but his own field was mathematics , in which subject he had the reputation of being an original thinker
he crossed one-leg over the other and slowly turned the pages of the notebook , reading dates and entries here and there , written in his own hand , and thanking the lord afresh as he saw how in every time of need and danger he had stretched out his hand to aid
in view of its historic charm that would be in the highest degree regret- table
and how tolerant you always are towards an idea !
will she say it to me , when i get to know her , do you think ?
yes , yes , he said abruptly , and his tone was rather mocking , an undisturbed night 's rest is a very good thing
a round table , its slender legs decorated with fine lines of gilding , stood , not in front of the sofa , but by the wall oppo-site the little harmonium , on which lay a flute-case ; some stiff arm-chairs were ranged in a row round the walls ; there was a sewing-table by the window , and a flimsy ornamental writing-desk laden with knick-knacks
perhaps i have , let me see
he ascribed it to atavistic memory , a blood heritage , that he very often dreamed of riding ; he was uncommonly convincing when he showed us how natural it , vas for him to hold the reins in the left hand and pat the horse 's neck with the right
they consoled themselves , to some extent , with the little weaknesses of the old frau consul and frau permaneder
she took the card , got out her sewing-glasses , and read it
we ca not all be alike
the scale was in the air again
she moved dumbly about the house , she laughed no more , she lost her appetite
the previous winter had done fairly well in that respect , but it had been as nothing compared to this one
for the time everything was at an end ; there would be no more emotional alarums , no more strain on the heart-muscles
oh , well , after all , there is some sort of difference
what an immense honour for me !
he came down the brehmenbühl , along the edge of the forest , and was in the dorf by half past five
nobody but jews have such puny figures
he played instrumental works by brahms and bruck- ner , schubert , robert schumann ; then by the later and the latest , tchaikovsky , borodin , and rimsky-i ( orsakov ; by anton dvoralc , berlioz , cesar franck , and chabrier , constantly challenging his pupil 's power of imagination with loud explanations , to give or- chestral body and soul to the insubstantial piano version : cello cantilena !
well , i am a jew , you know , fitelberg is undeniably a jewish name
he was a soldier
she could ad-just herself with ease and cheerfulness to any situation
i do not mean getting drunk : i mean the feeling you have the next day -- the after-effects
to make matters worse , it was a fish dish that had just been handed , and there was ground for fear that popoff , in his spasm , might choke on a bone
hans castorp was rather relieved than otherwise at this state of affairs ; for the pledge he had drunk with clavdia chauchat ’ s protector made him difficulties , in general conversation , of the same kind he had to deal with in the case of frau chauchat herself , namely the avoidance of the formal mode of address—as though , as peeperkorn said , they had eaten a philippina together
it was , as always , an imrompar-able expression of dissolute , impudent , lazy good-nature
written a third movement to ope i i i
i don ’ t know many , he responded , letting his hands flap finlike before his breast , and those i do i can ’ t tell , i ’ m so tired all the time
to them , before i leave the subject , i must certainly devote a few words ; they often affect one like at once a mockery and a glorication of the fen- damcn : : : al , a painfully reminiscent ironic treatment of tonalit
i get so tired of things
those were the genes , the living germs , bioblasts , biophores—lying there in the frosty night , hans castorp rejoiced to make acquaintance with them by name
the deepest silence reigned
and set him up as my vicar on earth !
but that was simply be- cause for the most part they delighted in a purely chordal texture of phrase , and their way of treating the polyphonic style had been miserably weakened by their regard for the harnnic factor , for the relation of consonance and dissonance
and it is true that this part of our story might , like an earlier chapter , bear the caption a newcomer
in fact -- what was it we were dickering over then ?
are we forced to live within the smallest limits we can ?
to explore and lay open all the windings of his emotions would keep us far too long ; suffice it to say that his observation of the mannheimer gave our poor young friend enough to think on and to suffer
or was he of more than one mind whether he should await the autumn up here or resolve on unlawful departure ?
that wasn ’ t the first time either , he said to himself , as though the thought were reassuring
therein , precisely , was the impropriety
but a changed idea , is that still an idea ?
he asked incensed , supporting himself belligerently on his cub
but now , he went on with his most charming manner , our warmest thanks -- cerda 's too -- for all your trouble , you good snul
the knoterichs had taken over inez rodde , now rich and settled and well wadded against life , into their own social circle from the little group vvho had attended her mother 's evenings
one asks oneself , had it not been better the other way about , settembrini went on ; you enjoying the kisses by yourself , and the rest-cure with captain miklosich— tehee !
hanno had , among his schoolmates , no intimates save nntj
i will do it !
then , to divert herself , she made a trip to zürich—there had been no other reason for her going , save simply to amuse herself—she had amused herself to her heart ’ s content , but found herself overtaken by the need to be filled up again and entrusted the business to a physician where she was
but when the frau consul looked at her , she could not deny that , despite the stately dowry and clara 's domestic prowess , it would not be easy to marry her off
in this case the sinners were also held together by a definite philosophy
i lay before the reader a testimony to my good faith in that i give space to the theory that i make difficulties because i secretly shrink from the tasl { which , urged by love and duty , i have undertaken
there was much in the world , much of the future , that seemed worth knowing , yet it was so difficult to choose
another minute -- there came hermann alone , swinging his lunch-box by the strap and smacking his lips
and yet she would say it , say once and for all , that it was twenty-eight fishsauces she could make
i was in despair , as you may imagine , over the trick my unreliable health had played me
the spirit of a world-famed violinist played as though behind veils a romance by rubinstein , to a piano accompaniment that sounded thin and cold , like a spinet
you can ’ t judge from the first day !
and our discussion comes to an end at the right moment , for here we are , settembrini said , and pointed out to the cousins with his stick the cottage before whose gate they had paused
extraordinary—displays great— in revenge , they looked at each other , pantomimed despair , angled for hans castorp ’ s glance ; but he refused to be drawn
for my part , my mind is made up
she heard it , and retorted by calling him a turkey-cock and bidding him keep his filthy jokes to himself
we were speaking of tolerance ; it is surely superfluous for me to emphasize that far from mere toleration , i feel for protestantism , as the historical opponent of the enslavement of knowledge , the most profound admiration
certain things are no longer possible
herr settembrini walked from the humanistic folding-desk in the little window , where he had been standing , up to the table , nearer his pupil , who was sitting on the cot against the wall , his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands
for herr settembrini belonged to the francophile party in his own country , which was not surprising when one recalled that his grandfather had compared the six days of the july revolution to the six days of the creation , and seen that they were as good
well , how is everything , my dear tony -- all right ?
schalleen , as hans castorp knew , had not only packed his presents , but bought them , after consultation with the uncles
herr settembrini was silent
what they heard had happened long ago , almost a hundred years
still , leaders have arisen , who like myself , who am a son of humanism , saw in this dictatorship the ultimate that can or may be laid upon humanity and moved their vvorld to a life-and-death struggle against it
but now , thanks to the development of hygiene and the increase in personal security , a natural death was the rule , a violent one the exception ; modern man had come to think of repose , after exhaustion of his powers , as not at all dreadful , but normal and even desirable
on the bier , i say to you beforehand , you will always find it lying on its face , and though you turn it five times you will ever find it on its face
you have such a kind , sympathetic cousin over there , went on the hofrat , motioning with his head in joachim ’ s direction and balancing himself on his heels
she praised the idea unreservedly
bble - the classicists made themselves thoroughly merry over it
a few days later she brought him , not information about the young russian , but a fresh and startling piece of news
crimson-faced , bare-headed , overcoatless , he stood at the edge of the platform as the train rolled in , beneath his relative ’ s carriage window , and told him to come on out , for he was here
the surf is seething ; wave after wave , with high , hollow sound , rears up , rebounds , and runs with a silken rustle out over the flat strand : here one , there one , and more beyond , out on the bar
and when one gets one 's wish too late , or works too hard for it , it comes already weighted with all sorts of small vexatious drawbacks -- with all the dust of reality upon it , that one did not reckon with in fancy
and the consul poured him a glass of the brown foaming porter , which he was accustomed to drink himself at midday
tired isn ’ t the word for it
dr faustus christian king , and which produced theologians like bossuet and pascal ?
he led hans castorp by the arm before the rows of dark plates on the wall , and turned on a light behind them
but perhaps i may be pardoned for letting him appear once more
after a few paces , settembrini said—having brought his head and neck to a natural posture once more : you must not be surprised to hear this gentleman and me indulging in long disputations
there , on the third landing of the wooded terrace , sat the principal members of those affiliated families , at two tables shoved close together , eating and talking with the greatest gusto
they drove up in the same sleigh to house berghof , and supped together in the restaurant
you have a crib in your book , he said as he name up
if certain musical features of the writing peculiar to adrian had not indicated the author , one could scarcely be- lieve that the same mind brought forth both
\y own weak- ness in this : field , which was only tolerably made good by joyful application in philology , made me realize that excellence in per- formance is naturally conditioned by sympathy with the subject and thus it was a real boon to me to see this condition - at least here - fulfilled by my friend too
the record had not run out before elly shuddered violently
his heart stood stock-still , it seemed not to beat
perhaps they took it as a whim , a rhetorical flourish ; it went something like this : esteemed , in especial dear and beloved brethren and sisters
he lived now the life of a private gentleman ; but , being rather ashamed of the fact , he always pretended to be overwhelmed with work
yet they were elegant too , even strikingly so ; indeed , despite writing-table and bookshelves the room hardly had a masculine look
and we did not get to paris
the horses , all four of them sturdy , glossy , well-fed beasts , with a blaze on each forehead , covered the excellent road at a steady pace
enthusiasm for size , being overwhelmed by size - that is no doubt a mental pleasure ; but it is only possible in connections which a human being can grasp
she was choosing a pot of flowers , examining , smelling , criticizing , chattering , and constantly obliged to wipe her mouth with her handkerchief
yes , self-conquest—that might well be the essence of triumph over this love , this soul-enchantment that bore such sinister fruit !
splendid , splendid , my dear jean
e song was already in progress ; when the tune
but the way it looks just here , in this light , in this connec- tion , something that has always been there may be new , new- alive , one might say ; original and unique
hia whole nose wrinkled as he spoke

the affair has spun itself out
my god , it is the revolution !
are the men here freer , more brotherly , more equal than in prussia ?
naphta and settembrini disputed over it a good deal without coming to any conclusion
'twere stolen from thine own opera !
but these later criticisms , levelled against pretence and play , in other words against form itself , seemed to indicate such an extension of the kingdom of the banal , of the no longer permissible , that it threat- ened to swallow up art itself
the inscriptions bore names from every quarter of the earth , they were in english or russian—or other slavic tongues—also german , portuguese , and more
but he drowned out the voice with his own , and herr settembrini , flinging up his hand with a swing of the arm—a gesture common in his own country , whose meaning it would be hard to put into words—and giving vent to a long-drawn eh—h !
it had been people of herr settembrini ’ s kidney , the doubters and critics , who had made the observation , and brought about the inquisition , which superseded the old naïve procedure
the guests were rnostly people in the finan- cial and business world
the a , which , forcing the resolution into g sharp , leads over from b major to e major , led him on , and so via the l { eys of a , d , and g he came to c ma jor and to the flat keys , as he demonstrated to me that on each one of the twelve notes of the chromatic scale one could build a fresh major or minor scale
the national state is the temporal principle , which you would like to ascribe to the evil one
make a few jokes !
no , twenty-eight , hans castorp said
a mild and pensive feeling stole about his heart
always at your jokes—but do sit down
he had come back once more to his mother 's house , and had a room on the corridor of the first storey
thirteen essays ( out of print ) joseph and his brothers i joseph and his brothers ( the tales of jacob ) ii
but the sweet , exalted splendour of the music had borne him away upon its wings
it is not right , it is not right , gerda , said old fraulein weichbrodt , perhaps for the hundredth time
body talked with somebody else , preserving all the social forms , while his mind was entirely absent , fixed on another person at whom he was looking
for hans castorp ’ s part , he straightway resolved to be present , in the first place out of courtesy , but also with unconcealed curiosity as to what he should hear
there was a quality of the perverse in the insatiability with which it was produced and revelled in : there was a sort of cynical despair ; there was a longing for joy , a yielding to desire , in the way the last drop of sweetness was , as it were , , extracted from the melody , till exhaustion , disgust , and satiety supervened
i have a right to dispose of my own property as i choose !
she sighed and shivered as the answer came
numerous local groups have been established in the various countries ; it is expected that they will exert an edifying and enlightening influence by means of discussion evenings and appropriate sunday observances
the thought is dear to me , i prize it , and in ex- change for that certainty i accept the terrors of the titne in which i myself continue to live on
am coming at once with erica
everything else is twaddle
the general rest-hall seemed to be full ; talking and laughter went on below
the softening , the effeminizing and falsifi- cation , the new interpretation put on the old and genuine po- lyphony understood as a combined sounding of various voices into the harmonic-chordal , had already begun in the sixteenth century , and people like palestrina , the two gabrielis , and our good or- lando di lasso here on the spot had already played their shanleful part in it
but there was an instrument - that is to say , a musical means of realization - through which music , while becolning audible to the sense of hearing , did so in a half-unsensuous , an almost abstract way , audible , that is , in a way peculiarly suited to its intellectual nature
he must study , i think -- he is witty and brilliant
a great art , so our reporter said in closing , which , as it were aloof from time and tine 's great course , could develop a little pri- vate history of this kind , and by forgotten side-paths lead to such exceptional beautitudes
yes , the movement becomes general , you flow away , so to speak—remember all that water !
we might even have been gratified , on the plain ground that a thorough-going sympathy with the experiences of our hero is precisely what we wish to arouse , and he , hans castorp , was himself not clear upon the point in question , no , nor had been for a very long time—a fact that has conditioned his romantic adventures up here , to an extent which has made of them , in more than one sense , a time-romance
nepomuk wanted to know how old the little spirit was when he was im- prisoned and then how old when he was freed , after twelve years
my beloved husband expressed in his final arrangements the wish that after his death you would put your loyal and well-tried powers at the service of the firm , not as an outsider but as partner
they stopped at a small station
her wish that it should be dissolved must be justified , to the mind of any reasonable person ; and her determination not to return to munich was entirely unshakable
the consul looked about him : every face was long and gloomy
he was a master tailor , and his wife bought and sold old clothes , and thus moved in the best circles of society
and , on the other hand , it was something in the highest degree fleeting and tenuous ; a thought , nay , a dream , the frightful , infinitely alluring dream of a young man whose unspoken , unconscious questioning of the universe has received no answer save a hollow silence
never shall i forget a scene in the living-room at buchel when we chanced to sit there together , the four of us : mother and son , kretschmar and i eisbeth was in tau { with the musician , who was puffing and blowing with his impediment ; it was a mere chat , of which adrian was certainly not the subject
that is the best after all
in town they said that the old man , before he left his house in winter warmed not only his coat and hat , but his walking-dtick as well
he was himself hastening his own end
morten made an entertaining companion , though his opinions were often dogmatic , not to say heated
the alien , fantastic nature of the deep-sea life , which seemed no longer to belong to the same planet vith us , was a point of de- parture
your poor sister has had a hard time
i do not say : for it is great , because there is such a thing as sophisticated greatness ; but this is at bottom much more intimate
we had spoken of it at table
in vain the girl implored him - on her knees at last - to spare her , to release her , not to make her pay for her peace with the betrayal of the man who loved her , whose love she returned
herr settembrini ’ s voice was full of mild resignation , it even trembled
in any case , barbel had fixed and restricted her heinz - not by means of any devil 's hocus-pocus but by the charm she had for him and the will by which she held him as by a spell against other temptations
my dear sir , settembrini answered him , there is a good deal up here that is positively mediaeval , as you express it
very well , proceed , then , said the senator , and shut his eyes more tightly
let it once dualistically isolate death , and death will become , in actual fact , actu , by this mental act of will , you understand me , a power in itself , the power opposed to life , the inimical principle , the great temptation ; whose kingdom is the kingdom of the flesh
but now i could see why schwerdtfeger kept his head mostly turned to the right so that i saw only his rather too blunt profile
for we do not set up as the young man ’ s encomiast , and prefer to leave room for the other view : namely , that his work stood somewhat in the way of his unclouded enjoyment of his maria mancini
hastily he sought to muster the words , the sentence structure
if only your mother 's family would hang on to their groschen a little belter !
held in the same plane with the ground , it was black and opaque ; but lifted against the light , it revealed matter for a humanistic eye : the transparent reproduction of the human form , the bony framework of the ribs , the outline of the heart , the arch of the diaphragm , the bellows that were the lungs ; together with the shoulder and upper-armbones , all shrouded in a dim and vaporous envelope of flesh—that flesh which once , in carnival week , hans castorp had so madly tasted
a soldier , and brave
and remember , when you were last with us , he went on , and hans castorp remarked that he did not use the form of address common to the civilized west—you promised to make visible to our mortal eyes some dear departed , whether brother soul or sister soul , whose name should be given to you by our circle
at the moment i feel quite indifferent to both of them-now i am here and y'ou have something to tell me
edhin krokowski ’ s lectures had in the swift passage of the years taken an unexpected turn
but what if it does the opposite ?
you have the right to , though
the frightened woman , with her scanty hair awry over her brow , her partly toothless gums , ran across to the main building and in half-choked words told frau schweigestill ; that experienced soul followed her with a manservant
he was settled , established
why should i behave as though i had not already , long ago and repeatedly thought of that strict schoolmaster and beginner in the art of song , at ephrata across the sea ?
he left his skis at the grocer ’ s , rested a little in herr settembrini ’ s attic cell , and told him how the storm had overtaken him in the mountains
i can assure my readers that i paid great attention to his archaic style and allusions , wbich he had always been given to but now even more frequently , or should i say ofttimes , came into his letters and even his speech
some distance outside the town , nearly as far as the first outlying village , lay a small farm , a tiny , almost valueless property without even a name
with which he passed round the glass partition into his loggia , where stood his own reclining-chair and side-table
it was almost like a professional visit—but gratis , you know—sine pecunia
he said : to me ?
well , and how have you spent your day , the first of your sojourn in this gay resort ?
and while the capital has grown smaller , the running expenses have not ; for the whole business is established on a certain scale , which it costs about so much to maintain
you are ruining him -- that 's buddenbr ddks it , is it ?
erica was allowed to sit next her grandmother , and ida sat up straight on a chair and began to knit
if one sat in an adjoining room and did not see the instrument , it seemed not otherwise than as though the artist stood in the salon in his own person , notes in hand , and sang
it ’ s against the rules to cry in public—they might all start !
the poor youth was still young ; he had never got over his schoolboy shyness
laying his hands upon the painting to unhook it , he eagerly began : yes , yes indeed , that is all very important
in a near-by trattoria they took their dinner at charge of a ltionthly sum
was he not in painful arrest from the hour of his birth ?
on another , less childish plane we would need people like him , just as his flock had need of him then : we need a system-master , a teacher of the objective and or- ganization , with enough genius to unite the old-established , the archaic , , vith the revolutionary
not long after he left , joachim would appear ready dressed , to greet his cousin , inquire after his seven o ’ clock temperature , and communicate his own
he spoke of an unfortunate occurrence , of suspicions that had proved justified , of the medical opinion that it would be best for him to remain where he was for a part , perhaps for all of the winter , since cases like his often proved more obstinate than those that began more alarmingly and it was clearly advisable to go after the infection energetically and root it out once for all
good lord , don ’ t the manœuvres come every year—and surely you know how time flies up here
hans castorp talked on awhile , feverishly
it seems to be hell in advance , which is already offered me on earth
such a christian young man !
in the yard was a tree , also rather in the way and preserved for sentimental reasons -not a lime tree , but an elm
one was an old-german dining-room , the other a living- and working-room , with woollen carpets , bookshelves and sofa , and a writing-table above which hung a pair of crossed swords and a student ’ s cap
i am going to ask you another time ; there is no hurry ; it has really nothing to do with me ; it is only curiosity
she proudly related the buddenbrook history , from the rostock tailor on ; and when she read out the old festival verses : industry and beauty chaste see we linked in marriage band : venus anadyomene , and cunning vulcan 's busy hand she looked at tom and [ } erda and let her tongue play over her lips
thomas agrees with me now , too , she went on ; for where will christian be better off than in his own father 's business , in tom 's business ?
i disagree with my late father on this point , the consul said
as for the witnesses : well , weinschenk 's own staff wo not be any too friendly to him , i am afraid
- a small rentier was another such freak ; he had a bulbous purple nose , and a big seal ring on his forefin- ger
they crossed the foot-bridge over the gorge , where the waterfall hung stiff and silent
thus he quarrelled with his lot and was an aggrieved man , a grunbler , visiting his unsuccessful career on his o , vn fanily 's head
here are helmet , sabre , and hanger—away , away , away with him , let him be off , let him be off , off to the barracks !
he was like something out of an en-chanted forest ; like grimm 's fairy tales , which ida read aloud to him
it happened with clara on just such an expedition
the holidays came , and there was not much trouble over the report , whirh had to be presented for papa to read , even at christmas-lime
for inasmuch as our weak human hearts are prone to forget thy priceless gift of the sweet , blessed jesus and so on for three pages
now , however , he had others
the senator was probably aware that he was robbing the child of the last remnant of his self-control
the one change due to the passage of time was an outward one
after conscientious destruction of the library , and leaving a time-bomb behind in the post-office , we made our exit with our heads high
so that is how it happens , hans castorp said
she was strangely excited this evening -- why , mother , you are fairly trembling , the senator said when he came in with gerda and hanno
a very large sum
thus they remained in silence a long time , while the sea sent up to them its soft enchanting whis-pers tony suddenly felt herself one with morten in a great , vague yearning comprehension of this portentous some-thing which he called freedom
they say he wears a corset—but that is little to the point
that is axiomatic , any court of honour would tell you the same , i swear to god they would
the mystery of life ?
names were suggested and rejected , others came up and were sifted out
but the other side was not so easy to come at
when you hear the will read , you will see just how much you are your own master !
c ’ est pourquoi je vais risquer un petit changement d ’ air
do you care to recall what it was ?
do i want to shed her blood ?
i know he includes the punishment in the sin and saturates it therewith so that one can- not be distinguished from the other and happiness and punish- ment are the same
the old man affected to be quite unmoved as he took the sealed blue paper
i thought it was different with you
for as she charmed me , so she bewitched me and forgave me in love - so i was initiate , and the promise confirmed
i feel as though one should callout to him , as to all those who are no longer with us and 'were not with us when it began : lucky you !
certainly , so far as my powers go , and wherever i have any influence
this resthetic interpreta- tion , however conveniently offered , was not tenable
are you here alone ?
the tram was full , two gentlemen stood clinging to straps at the rear
and i recall the cow- girl hanne , whose bosoms flapped as she walked and whose bare feet were always caked with dung
now , at least , on his bench by the rushing water , he had no more nose-bleeding— that was a thing of the past
she 's a good girl -- genuine good stuff
it has happened in my presence that during such a scene she left the drawing-room with flushed cheeks and shut herself in her room , at whose door after a quarter of an hour , as she had probably hoped and expected , rudolf knocked to ask why she had gone away
the approach of the final examinations demanded a decision , the election of a faculty , and he declared his choice : declared it in answer to his uncle , who raised his brows and said bravo !
in the years between and they had four children born to them : rosa , ezekiel , raimund , and nepomuk , pretty creatures all of them , and nepomuk , the youngest , was an angel
man , he went on to say , was the measure of things
now , as then , his heart could be seen hammering against his side
mynheer peeperkorn , at mention of the knife , had shifted his position in the bed , with a quick motion to one side , turning his face toward his guest , and looking him piercingly in the eye
for i did not , as i should have done , connect it with conversations i had with him at this time , or rather he had with me , when he gave me , quite circumstantially , with great anima- tion , accounts of studies and researches in fields very remote from my curiosity or my scientific comprehension : thrilling enrich- ments , that is , of his lcnowledge of nature and the cosmos
were the gods wishful to destroy him , when they moved him to embark on this foolhardy analysis of vice ?
to look at the relations between things must be the best thing , after all
he could court her , look at her to desire her , covet her as a christian wife , as we theologians say with justified pride at swin- dling the devil out of the carnal concomitant and making a sacra- ment of it , the sacrament of christian marriage
the senator led the two gentlemen out through the dining-room
ver did they procede from fatigue due to effort , but from satiety , from cold boredom , and , dear master and friend , sith i no longer am a young bachelor springing from branch to branch but have married me with one plot and one profession , it has truly gone hevyli indeed with me
lovely and pleasant it was to see the older ones show the younger , curly-locked novices , how to span the bow and take aim ; draw with them , and laughing support them staggering back from the push of the arrow as it leaped from the bow
this was what , as he fancifully put it , his familiar friend mr akercocke told him to do and demanded of him
furthermore , as our utmost effort can not conceive a final limit either to time or in space , we have settled to think of them as eternal and infinite—apparently in the hope that if this is not very successful , at least it will be more so than the other
it is reress , and we have mill six minutes
listen , son -- take my advice : do not think too much about such things -- theatre , and that sort of thing
but there really is not room to dance
fie saw , lastly , me , when i went to spend the week-end
but in being , the man is as he has wished to be , and as , until his last breath , he has never ceased to wish to be
he passed away last night , the consul said ,
it was a good shot
i remember that i used the word teasingly in talk with my friend ; remember too how he turned away with the odd short laugh pe- culiar to him , as though he wot ; lld have pretended not to hear
to which the uncle replied : pardon me , and hastily replaced the picture on its easel
they did not talk much ; uttered the phrases proper to the daily routine , and little else
but they learned that peeperkorn thought otherwise
the company began to rise from table , to move about , to pay visits
quite early , soon after my appointment at kaisersaschern , i married : need for regularity and desire for a proper establish- ment in life led me to the step
' a house divided against itself will fall
i do not say that mother would actually insist on it -- when there is a dispute over anything she usually avoids it and says 'assez !
then in a clap i am stricl { en by a cutting cold , even as though i sat in a winter-warm room and a , vindovv had blo , vn open to wards the frost
not with the thou , not old fellow , or man , by which forms they had addressed each other their lives long
he plunged the gaze of his brown , exotic eyes deep into ellen brand ’ s blue ones , and ran his hand down over her shoulder and arm , stroking her gently
after at most a year , when my military service should be finished , , ve would come together , one place or another
how full of dignity the young man ’ s head , with the little beard thrust upward , had lain upon his pillow !
et puis , said hans castorp , si je t ’ avais parlé plus tôt , il m ’ aurait fallu te dire vous ’
they strolled out to the noble domain , viewed the dunghill , the vegetables , the fowls , dogs , and guinea-pigs , and even went into thr house , where in a long low room on the ground floor , count eber-hard sat in defiant isolation , reading at a clumsy table , lie ; asked crossly what they wanted
for at least an hour he amused adrian and me and made us laugh ; and then , with his business unaccomplished - in so far as there had been anything so con- crete as business about it - he departed with complete equanimity
what i ask you is , have you resolved , bravely and joyfully , to lake up your burden ?
he had taken charge of the bank at first , but soon turned it over to herr albin and was understood to say that the charge of it hindered his unfettered enjoyment
i am sure he will enjoy it , betsy
the guests exchanged volumes from the loan-library down in the platz ; now and again there would be a book for which everybody scrambled , even the condescending old inhabitants reaching out their hands with ill-concealed eagerness
then came the day when the divorce was pronounced ; when the last formalities were gone through , and tony asked thomas for the family papers and set down this last event with her own hand
they were all startled ; favourably , yet with some alarm
it will be perfectly agreeable tn me , herr senator , if you come in to-morrow or next day , at whatever hour you like , and we can go on with the operation
out of the earth , i might better say , for the little one said it , ex- pressing his joy that heaven gave the firsty earff a drink last night '
the record took up the play at the second act , in the spanish tavern , in crude moorish architecture , a shawl-draped , roomy cellar like the floor of a barn
very funny , very amusing
is time a function of space ?
i won ’ t say that i make him out altogether , yet , but if we meet him often perhaps we shall ; i don ’ t think it at all unlikely we may learn something from the acquaintance with him
not at all , answered lebrecht kroger severely
ah , one did not speak out with gc-rda , one did not call her to account
ah , yes , where should we be without you ?
hp swallowed once and said , we have cornelius nepos , some accounts to copy , french grammar , the rivers of north amer-ica , german theme-correcting -- he stopped and felt provoked with himself ; he could not remember any more , and wished he had said and and let his voice fall , it sounded so abrupt and unfinished
it is a fact , in , vhich a profoundly observant friendship has instructed me , that the proudest intellectuality stands in the most immediate relation of all to the animal , to naked instinct , is given over most ithamelessly to it ; hence the anxiety that a person like me must suffer through a nature like adrian 's - hence too my conviction that the accursed adventure of which he had v/ritten vas in its essence frightfully symbolic
you do love him madly ?
the music stopped , so also the conversation
there were no limits to the subject—but they could not go on for ever
i really know more of them than you do
but the standard-bearer , the standard-bearer ?
the hall was done in that modern style which knows how to give just the right touch of individuality to something in reality very simple
but those are only our feelings ; they are not actual objections
for four hundred years all great music has found its satisfaction in pretending that this unity has been accomplished without a break - it has pleased itself with confusing the conventional universal law to which it is subject with its own peculiar concern
hans castorp smoked , frau chauchat as well ; the latter russian cigarettes with a mouthpiece , from a lacquered box with a troika going full speed on the lid , which lay to hand on the table before her
and yet it ’ s quite pretty up here ; i leave it to you if it isn ’ t , ziemssen , what ?
you must excuse my speaking of such a thing , but it reminds me of the conserve jars that our housekeeper in hamburg—schalleen , we call her , without any miss or mrs—keeps in her larder
but in the sense of freedom , goodness , esprit , then it is great , we can freely apply it to our talk about peeperkorn and the care and pain he causes you
she had died , he thought , fulfilling the holy duty of a woman : ' 'the love i bore to her would have passed over in all its tenderness to her child , he said to himself
her freckled right hand , loosely closed with the thumb uppermost , she held in front of her and waved it to and fro on the wrist , as though to say : come , make haste , don ’ t attend to what i say , but say what you have to and let me be off !
a human voice welled out from the casket , a masculine voice at once soft and powerful , with orchestral accompaniment
hans castorp had learned something of the plot , knew the main lines of the tragic fate of radames , amneris , and aida ; and when he heard it from his casket could understand well enough what they said
any further journey was for the time impossible
the frau consul left this unanswered
naphta , who regularly took his tea here , had ordered wine and cake , obviously a reminiscence from his student days
behrens a très exactement rendu ta peau , oh , vraiment très fidèlement
then morten sat on the rocks
but that is no better than measuring space by time , a thing only very unscientific people do
this bargain once struck , he turned out to talk not unentertainingly of his experiences in the life from which his illness had withdrawn him
christian buddenbrook , proprietor of the firm of h c f purmeister and company of hamburg , came into his brother 's living-room , holding in his hand his modish grey hat and his walking-stick with the nun 's bust

eighty-two , said the consul , leaning forward
did you say that ?
how much is it ?
the name kai had given dr wulicke was known only to himself and hanno , and they took the greatest pains not to let any of the others overhear it , for they could not possibly understand
her husband 's income was more and more reduced by the fall of the exchange , in some circles so desired and promoted
i see that she wears no ring , no wedding-ring , he said
on practical as well as on ideal grounds , mankind was now about to redress it
is there another discipline at 'whose mere name we feel ourselves in such a degree set bacl { into the past , into the sixteenth , the twelfth century ?
such turns of phrase had come in the past only from the mouth of the consul
her face was as long , straight , and expressionless as ever , her hair as smooth'and ash-coloured , her nose as straight , but full of large pores and getting thick at the end
good lord in heaven , what a thing it is , that the flesh can crave the flesh like that , simply because it is not its own flesh , but belongs to another soul—how strange , and yet , when you come to look at it , how unassuming , how friendly , how almost apologetic !
why should i go fishing in troubled waters ?
to a genuine sacrifice two valuations and qualitative ingredients belong : that of the thing and that of the sacrifice
his friend , and mine too , was the yard dog , suso
the whole family was there
it was impossible for him to hear his own voice , still more for the others to catch a syllable of what he let transpire without its in the least transpiring
the lean , light blonde was in her seat , and spooned up yogurt as though it formed her sole article of diet
she was responsive to your feeling , murmured peeperkorn , with wry lips
but the majority sat at the small , white tables on the covered platform , while the more frivolous spirits , finding it too prim to sit upon chairs , encamped on the stone steps that led down into the garden , where they presently gave evidence of their high spirits
around it there gathered in these days , besides the parents , only little clara , npw ten years old , mamsell jung-mann , and clothilde , as humble , lean , and hungry as ever
but it was bound to come
from the first he possessed the eudden-brook hand , broad , a little too short , but finely articulated , and his nose was precisely the nose of his father and great-grandfather , though the nostrils would probably remain more delicate
they were now walking on the city pavement , the main street , obviously , of an international centre
lvlake haste , adrian , and decide
the cloud over his eyes showed that he was suffer- ing from headache
but chancing to turn away his eyes a minute , he looked back to find him vanished
the barometer has fallen a little , but the sky is still the most staring blue
with bent head and cautious breathing he managed to get under way ; but even thus forearmed , the slowness of his progress and the difficulty of seeing and breathing dismayed him
the prognosis was extraordinarily favourable , there was not the slightest risk about the procedure , so in any case it could do no harm to try it
the girl- you do not like the word - the woman , then , marie - i am not indifferent to her either ; and when i say not indifferent , even that is not quite the right way to put it
but the beginning and the end , birth and death , we do not experience ; they have no subjective character , they fall entirely in the category of objective events , and that ’ s that
he wrote it , no doubt , with his eye on beethoven 's ninth , as its counterpart in a most mel- ancholy sense of the word
the weather was cool , he sat in his overcoat , with a rug about him , and his hands were cold
our defeat was now only a matter of time , and of cost to the foe
indeed , hans castorp definitely , wilfully purposed that she should know something , or even a good deal
hans castorp asked , severely
tiber-tius does not need to live so very long , perhaps , and the money would come back after he dies
a quarter before eight , she answered , pointing with a thin , red , rheumatic-looking hand at the clock on the wall you must get along , hanno
hans castorp answered in the affirmative
in the old days the classical course had been thought of as an end in itself , to be pursued at one 's ease , with a sense of joyous idealism , but now the leading conceptions were authority , duty , power , service , the career ; the categorical imperative of our philosopher kant was inscribed upon the banner which drr \vulicke in every official speech unfurled to the breeze
she was well read , accustomed to articulate her inner life in speech ; as a girl she had even attempted verse
they had to be covered up and ignored

i know what i have to do : in public , i shall act as if i had nothing whatever to do with the affair
it was the principle by which one stood or fell , the absolute of the time ; it was , so to speak , its own justification
there might be some among the bedridden and moribund ; but the only one visible was a hollow-cheeked business man , said to come from cuxhaven , who had been sitting for two weeks at frau iltis ’ s table
this gallows humour of his made his company just the right thing for our recluse
please do not be angry , tony , he said
but tom wants it
his presence en- hances the dignity of the occasion -- and , beyond a question , this occasion is worthy of every dignity !
his head roared , his eyelids were like lead , his heart went like a set of kettledrums , and he began to torture himself with the suspicion that pretty marusja , who was bending over her plate covering her face with the hand that wore the ruby ring , was laughing at him—though he had taken enormous pains not to give occasion for laughter
going on to invoke the usual blessings on their metabolisms , while he prevented their rising from their seats , as they would have done in his honour
hans castorp had never once thought of it
conscious of being the focus of all eyes , she kept her own discreetly cast down ; yet now and again she could not resist letting them stray over the assembly , in which she noted the presence of julchen mbllendorpf , born hagen-strb am , and her husband
but there had been weimar , and donaueschingen , aside from the swiss performances of leverkiihn 's youthful worl { s : it took no extraordinary intuition to guess that here was something to prize and to promote
there is one strange thing about the piece : cast in three move- ments , it has no key-signature , but , if i may so express myself , three tonalities are built into it : b-flat major , c major , and d ma- jor , of which , as a musician can see , the d major forms a sort of secondary dominant , the b-flat major a sub dominant , while the c major keeps the strict middle

in short , whatever the deed might be , it was in any case a poor way of making one ’ s meaning clear ; as also it contributed little toward the clarification of intellectual problems

next the bathing-woman was interrogated , who denied it stoutly
he did the rinsing and pencilling , and then the senator went
he uttered his views frankly and cheerfully , tubbing his hands like a man whose mind is free from care , and leaning back sidewise against the arm of his chair
and now get back where you belong
of course you do , tom ; goodness gracious , yes !
she knew she was being looked at , and her pribislav eyes shifted their gaze nervously , almost squinting
we must forgive and forget -- havengeance is mine , saith the lord
that is the point
it is all arranged
it annoyed him to be in such bad form , and with the self-consciousness of youth he read signs of indulgent amusement in the warmth of the assistant ’ s manner
the two living buddenbrooks had in their turn their own idiosyncrasies
but it is a good thing he does , for it is her illness grants it to her—and whoever falls into our situation will do well to follow his example , and not complain , either of the past or of the future
i feel that it matters so little whether one is trained upon an instrument , and so much whether one knows something about music
it took an hour of such work to cover one meadow

these words leverklihn makes his testis , the witness , the narrator , announce in a spectral melody , built up of perfect fourths and diminished fifths , and set above pedal harmonies alien to the key ; they then form the text of that boldly archaic responsoriu'lz , which they unforgettably repeat by two four-part choruses in contrary motion
he rowed alone and slowly over the quiet waters , gazing to right and left at a scene fantastic as any dream
i know everything pretty well , my good friend ; i have an inventory already in my pocket
this pleasure resort , she said
dr mantelsack 's mood was so good that he simply selected one of his favourites , without troubling in the least about whose turn it was
the tree in the dining-room burned , crackled , and dispensed its fragrance , waking the minds and hearts of the guests to a realization of the day
it was she 'who , while playing the part of exemplary housewife and mother , managed the affair , manipulated and concealed the daily artifices and the double life , which naturally gnav/ed at her nerves and terrified her by threatening the precarious loveliaess of her looks : for instance , it deepened the two furrows between her blond bro , vs until she looked almost maniacal
within my heart it slips and raptures fill me—
they looked like snow—more snow—as though there were pressing demand for it !
the craci { , and tien the little arms pressed closer to the sides , the grinding spasm , cruel to see but perhaps no longer felt , twisted the little limbs
hans castorp felt only contempt for the revolted lover and expressed it by a shoulder-shrug
that is your character
he spoke of the small vexations and rewards of the service , of the wonderfully satisfying comradeship , of the sheepish loyalty of his bursch , of funny occurrences on the parade-ground and in instruction ; of inspection , of love-feasts
but one can not say that adrian met the little boy half-way
what was all this ?
think how he urged in the assembly the union of the hamburg diligences with the postal service ; and how in he forced the senate by continuous pressure to join the german-austrian postal union !
when you saw them together you felt that here was a rapidly aging man , already a little heavy , with his young wife at his side
but now i trembled at the thought that his chastity since then , since that embrace , since his passing contagion and the loss of his physicians , sprang no longer from the ethos of purity but from the pathos of impurity
ah , and the catastrophes , by virtue of which it thinks to manifest its vitality , the ever-delayed spectacular triumphs at which it is preparing to assist , and thinks one day to celebrate !

how often , in the course of the century , would there be a demand for such a house ?
the listeners heaved each a deep sigh—they had been holding their breaths during herr settembrini ’ s great replication
and the sympathicus caused his heart , hans castorp ’ s heart , to thump , in such a way that it was impossible to breathe except in gasps ; and shivers ran over him , due to the functioning of the sebaceous glands , which , with the hair follicles , erected themselves
i can only repeat that you must do what ynu think best
perhaps it would be well to make cautious application of that wisdom to the present case
he realized that he was talking to himself , and not too sensibly—for which he took himself to task , and then continued on purpose , though his lips were so stiff he could not shape the labials , and so did without them , as he had on a certain other occasion that came to his mind
self-control and personal reserve are both lacking in the same way
so hans castorp took up again his strange position vis-à-vis to elly ; the white light gave place to rosy twilight , the music began again , the pumping motions ; this time it was hans castorp who announced trance
hans castorp asked with drawn brows
well , my dear reuter , he was saying as he entered , what do you say—shall we break the neck of another bottle ?
and , moreover , i must admire the extent of your con-sideration
he paused by the table and turned toward his sister , drumming lightly on the surface with his bent forefinger as he said : i will tell you a little story , my dear tony , which will illustrate my attitude toward this affair
he folded his pince-nez and put it into his pocket , buttoned up his coat , and began to walk up and down the room with firm and rapid strides , which studiously betrayed no sign that he was giving the subject any further consideration
when did you come ?
no , the same appetite was evinced by the silent , gloomy ones as well , those who in the pauses between courses leaned their heads on their hands and stared before them
i can add this quite calmly , since i share with no small part of our population , even those hardest hit and homeless , the feel- ing that we are only getting what we gave , and even if we must suffer more frightfully than we have sinned , we shall only hear in our ears that he who sows the , vind must reap the whirlwind
that is what excites curiosity , and you have not , long as you have been squatting there , given space to the ques- tion in all your talk
the name does not come well to my ears , said the consul , quickly and harshly
it is not your way to linger with the finished work
that only means he is a better business man and a cleverer politician than i am -- there 's no reason at all for you to laugh in that scornful way -- but to come back to the house
then he fell again to musing , and the rapidity with which he drew the ends of his moustaches through his fingers was in remarkable contrast to the vacant fixity of his gaze
the banker sat opposite the host , the consul presided on the long side of the table
with us fat is only about five per cent of the body weight , in females it is one sixteenth of the whole
she was a plump child with short blonde hair , in a funny , shapeless , knitted frock of pale blue wool

despite all he could say , the gloomy disaffection gained ground , threats of unlicensed departure were the order of the day , were even put into execution , without regard for the warning afforded by the melancholy return of frau salomon to the fold , now a life member , her tedious but not serious case having taken that turn by reason of her self-willed visit to her wet and windy amsterdam
it said : oh , mademoiselles !
in such a case , the consul argued , he must accommodate himself to the surrender of whatever sum was necessary
the couple behind were quiet too , but their quietness was only apparent , for in reality tony and her bavarian guest were conversing in subdued and intimate tones
but this was not all
leaning forward , hands between knees , looking by turn at his hands and his mouth
the publication will in every case take as its norm the dignity and happiness of mankind , and seek to indicate the measures and remedies calculated to remove the cause of each deviation
she came from the baltic provinces somewhere—lymphatic , anæmic , but probably some more serious trouble as well
many of the guests had their hands curved behind their ears ; some even held the hand in the air half-way thither , as though arrested midway in the gesture by the strength of their concentration
she had not listened , not outside , not at the door , truly , truly she had not !
ing , adrian was busy with the conposition of some songs and lieder , german and foreign , or rather , english
but after the meal they spoke of it , and joachim freed his mind on the subject of that damned female who had put the thing in his head with her silly question and somehow or other set a spell on him
quite a taking little dodge—but as a matter of fact , the epicanthus can be traced back to an atavistic vestige—it ’ s a developmental arrest
the great confusion played havoc , moreover , with emotional conceptions , or states of consciousness like still and again ; and this was one of the very most gruesome , bewildering , uncanny features of the case

they were attacked by inflammation , the neighbouring blood-vessels suffered by contagion
they saw his kingly features move in speech , the mouth form words , which were as soundless as though spoken into empty , etherless space
but oh , dear , tony -- if you do not like him , and if he wo not make you happy -- ida , i know life , and i am not a little goose any more

and then you abuse your poor old father in the coarsest way rather than give up a few thousand thaler so he deigns to look down upon me as a business man , does he ?
she tastes like papier mâché , i do assure you—precisely as when one has a spoilt digestion
she was entirely without private means and dependent upon unfeeling relatives—once , in fact , they had taken her away , since she was sure to die in any case ; and only at the hofrat ’ s intercession did they send her back
to see the world as cleft into two opposing poles—that is spirit
you were afraid of death , and you stopped up here
at this ida jungmann actually shivered and changed colour
you call that of course ’ ; but if one once loses hold of the fact that it is of course , it is quite frightening , you feel like hanging on to something
at the same time there were now re- leased in her certain still keen desires of an unexhaustible and probably never satisfied love of life , in some humanly warmer sphere
and how many times had he answered it : in strong and purposeful hours with one answer , in weak and discouraged ones with another !
he held toward this chimerical goal , that often quite vanished in mist , and took an exhausting climb against the wind before it was reached ; finally drew near it—to discover , with what staggering astonishment and horror may be imagined , that it was only the hay-hut with the weighted roof , to which , after all his striving , by all his devious paths , he had come back
joachim expressed disapproval of the expenditure
it is the half-articulate art , the dubious , the irresponsible , the insensible
i myself , speaking as one who early submitted his own head and heart to the phenomenon of adrian 's cool and bafflingly self-contained ex- istence , have i the smallest right to mock at the fascination which his aloneness , the nonconformity of his life , exerted upon these women ?
there you have the pillars of the liberal world-republic

there was a lady sitting at his table , named frau stöhr , the wife of a cannstadt musician ; a rather serious case , she was , and the most ignorant creature he had ever seen

to which the person asked must reply : no , i ’ ve never seen the devil with a nightcap on , and then repeat the question in his turn , and so on
they degraded hilti to the status of a patient , shut him up in his castle by the lake , unscrewed the door-knobs and barred the windows
yes , what strange things do happen
the cousins were aghast
it would appear , then , that under conditions of bewilderment man is likely to under- rather than over-estimate time
they were silent for some way ; but the silence spoke of naphta , and hans castorp could wait
well , god bless us all !
refectory—oh , i say , that is good !
and here it was
when she looked him straight in the eyes—like that—she found his rather blurred and flickering ; and he looked , as he lay , not as though everything were in the best of order with him , she herself would hardly give him a clean bill of health

he was moved by his transports to a course that only the very violence of emotion could pursue
nothing was to be heard but a measured , peaceful sound which meant that the boy was raking the gravelled paths of the kurgarden below , and the buzzing of a fly that had got between the blind and the window and was storming the pane -- you could see his shadow shooting about in long zigzag lines
yes , yes , said the senator , making a gesture of repulsion with his hand
to the astonishment of the staff , the senator now often left his work during office hours , to pace up and down in the garden with his hands behind his back , or to work about , raking the gravel paths , tying up the rose-bushes , or dredging mud out of the fountain
we even confess that it is without great concern we leave the question open
it was as if he were addressing his remarks to god or to his own soul

yes ; i am glad you have come
no , don ’ t worry , i ’ ve forgotten all of it , answered hans castorp , the whole complex

the extraordinary man 's resolve was swiftly formed
but first he was to recite to papa a poem painfully learned by heart , with ida jungmann 's help , in the little balcony on the second floor
and yet hans castorp loved this snowy world
are you really thinking of visiting the man ?
you will see everybody gather round peeperkorn , and herr naphta will be sitting there alone with his cleverness and his city of god , though he may be uttering such penetrating wisdom that it pierces through marrow and cucumber , as behrens says—

sons-in-law are always rogues , said frau permaneder , in a hollow voice

christian , however , rue- fully remarked that he had not much faith in the prescription ; and consul kroger had no need of it
but one of the sentries suddenly heard a short , discreet whistle from within the building
what a splendid morning !
in any case there had to be cuts
then there were storms so violent as to prevent one ’ s sitting on the balcony for the driven snow which blew in , in such quantity as to cover floor and chair with a thick mantle

or put it the other way round : the special case behaving as though it were identical with the prescribed and familiar formula

quick , get a wagon and fetch grabow , tony repeated breathlessly
but you did not see him

they did not mention the visit to lauro ’ s bedside ; even to themselves they refrained from comment on his behaviour

he loved and 'vas loved by a maiden named barbel , only daughter of a widowed sexton , and 'wished to marry her , but the young couple 's desire tilet 'with her father 's opposition , for klopfgeissel was poor , and the sexton insisted on a considerable setting-up in life , and that he should be a master in his trade before he gave him his daughter
he , naphta , was well aware that man ’ s inner conflict based upon the antagonism between the sensible and the supra-sensible ; it was he , not settembrini , who represented the true , the mystical individualism
on top of the fountain ( she continued reading ) there is a madonna , and sometimes she is crowned with a wreath , and the common people come with rose garlands and kneel down and pray -- which looks very pretty , but it is written : go into your chamber
he made a brief effort , rolling his eyes about , to awaken sympathy in the company for the misery in his side ; went early to the club ; and came back to supper , which was held after the prescribed traditions
and it was this : as soon as he began to think of his mortal end not as an in-definite remote event , almost a contingency , but as something near and tangible for which it behoved him to prepare , he began to investigate himself , to examine his relations to death and questions of another world
cried frau permaneder , enchanted
an indefinite ache is felt in all the bones
and naphta , without looking at him , or relaxing his contained manner , apparently could not refrain from saying , low and bitingly : i am glad to see that despite your enthusiasm for freedom and progress , you have some feeling for serious things
oh , un-cle , she replied , with amiable simplicity , to the old man 's gibe , which did not in the least disconcert her
he stood by and lent a hand , grasping the figure under the shoulders and helping carry it over to the coffin , upon whose coverlet and tasselled cushions joachim presently lay ensconced high and solemnly , among candelabra provided by the house
but it is not the most precious thing in life , thomas -- no , before god , it is not
still in the most fragile health , he worked ten hours a day and more , broken only by a short pause at midday and now and then a walk round the pond or up the hill , brief excursions more like flight than recreation

i was talking this afternoon with gosch the broker , a wonderful man , looking at everything with the eyes of a poet and writer

of course it belongs to all of us , to you and me , and christian -- and , queerly enough , to pastor tiburtius too

and so were the other faces about them

one could hardly see that he had risen ; he was one of the small and forward ones

i was ready to put up with the social revolution - yes , to agree to it - which would arise from such comradery
when the waves of tribulation went over him once more he would think of the sea and of the kurgarden , and of the sound made by the little waves , coming hither out of the mysterious slumbering distance
asked the old lady , after a pause
this they all knew beforehand—hans castorp even blurted out something of the sort , after his fashion , as they sat and waited

the comparison is not pertinent—for our hero was no wehsal
his pointed chin rose almost up to his nose , his face expressed the most desperate resolution ; his grey hair streamed dis-tractedly over brow and temples ; his head was so drawn in between his shoulders that he really almost achieved his am-bition of looking like a dwarf -- and he rapped out : you behold me resolved to speak to the people
the broad echoing passage-way below was paved with great square flagstones
he paused , however , near the door
was not the idea of a material world existing by and for itself the most laughable of all selfcontradictions ?

herr stengel appeared in his sunday wig and his tallest choker , bristling with lead-pencils like lance-heads , and they sat on the sofa in the landscape-room , while christian hid in the dining-room and listened
he knew the business , and it was a light , agreeable job , in which a man could be his own master , write now and then in a note-book , and make thirty thaler by turning over his hand
i could tell as soon as i saw you—he spoke now directly to the young man—that you were a layman ; there ’ s something civilian and comfortable about you , not like our sabre-rattling corporal here !
hans castorp recognized the traditional phenomenon with a certain grim satisfaction—and even slapped his thigh in astonishment at this punctual general law fulfilling itself in his particular case
for since these people are actors , they must have a gift , and the gift itself is beyond cleverness and stupidity , it is after all a value
as antonie appeared , babette exclaimed something that sounded like jesus , mary , and jo-seph ! -- and jesus , mary , and joseph !

they were really quite right : it was an admitted fact that hanno -- this was the nickname adopted by the frau senator for her son -- at a time when he was able to call all the members of his family by name with fair correctness , was incapable of pronouncing the names friederike , henriette , and pfiffi so that any one could understand what he said
they walked awhile in silence , until joachim asked : well , how do you like the people up here ?
ah , what an apt phrase !
she had heard it with her owl ears
two or three times in the afternoon it looked as though the sun were coming out ; and a few acquaintances from town appeared -- people who enjoyed a holiday away from their families : senator dr gieseke , christian 's friend , and consul peter dohlmann , who looked very ill indeed , and was killing himself with hunyadi-janos water
not even the delicate tinkling of the music-box would he hear ; at once uttered his tortured 'nuff , 'nuff !

it was decided that little erica should go to munich too , this being her mother 's wish , to which her betrothed warmly agreed
when the consul read these he could never quite forego a little smile ; for , notwithstanding all the real pain they showed , he heard an undertone of almost comic pride , and he knew that tony buddenbrook , as madame gr� or as madame permaneder , was and would remain a child

it was true that corporal punishment was on the decline in certain countries which considered themselves in the van of progress : but the belief that such a decline was a sign of enlightenment became only the more comic the longer it persisted
and he had felt to some extent responsible for the turn adrian 's life had taken , because it had been he who had moved him to the swiss journey and thus brought about the meeting with marie
he had a hard struggle to free himself—but the inner compulsion proved stronger

it won ’ t insult this simple wine to drink it out of an ordinary tumbler— he poured out the wine , with hans castorp ’ s help , as his hand trembled slightly , and drank thirstily , as though it had been water
you are aware , of course , that there is only one sort of revolt against nature which may be called honourable ; that which revolts in the name of human beauty and human dignity
you will understand my anxiety , he said
they heard something charming : a pure , bell-like sound , coming from the bottom of the room and flowing sweetly , sensuously , with indescribably tender effect , on the sudden silence
hans castorp , all flushed and depleted from taxing his brains in the cold , shaky as to his capacity for clear expression , hot and cold with his own audacity , heard himself babble that always since a child he had pictured death to himself as wearing a starched ruff , or at least a sort of half-uniform , with a stand-up collar , while life , on the other hand , wore an ordinary collar
it is inexcusable that you are still here
her name was semlinger
then it was that , thus reproved , hans castorp had taken—and expressed—a resolve : he would visit their departed comrade , and discharge the last duty of silent respect toward his remains

then the con- versation split up and exhausted itself in disjointed speculation on the signs , if any , that this might come to pass

the minute-hand on time ’ s clock had moved one space further on : not one of the large spaces , not one which measured the centuries or the decades ; it was only the year that had been shoved forward by one figure ; though hans castorp had been up here not a whole year yet , but scarcely more than half a one , it had jerked itself on , as does the minute-hand of certain large clocks , which only register by five minutes at a time ; and was now pointing motionless , awaiting the moment to move forward again

you are a child , tony , a child , said he in a discouraged , almost pleading tone
did i beguile myself , or he me , that it was cold , so i might quake and thereby certify myself that he was there , i-limself in person ?
those eyes , under their long-lashed lids , blend the light blue of the father 's and the brown of the mother 's iris into a pale , indefinite , 'changeful golden-brown ; but bluish shadows lie in the deep corners on both sides of the nose , and these give the little face , which is hardly yet a face at all , an aged look not suited to its four weeks of existence
dld you ever see him , herr pastor ?
he was rather piqued by this expression of opinion
a normally constructed minister-presi- dent can govern a modern federated state even if the king is too sensitive to stand the sight of his and his colleagues ' faces
wouldamnable influences , the consul quoted
it could not deny inevitable growth ; but it took refuge in the sphere of the mythical and timeless , the simultaneous and abiding , wherein the saviour 's form as a grown man is no contradiction to the babe in the \ther 's arms which he also is ; which he always is , always before his worshipping saints lifting his little hand in the sign of the cross
l for suffering , and an exaggerated self-pity
thus now hans castorp was privileged to behold the good joachim—but with the aid and under the auspices of physical science ; and by his cousin ’ s express permission , so that it was quite legitimate and without gruesome significance
he , vas at a disadvantage because he , vas not in love : i never have loved her , i admit it openly , i alwa : rs just had friendly and brotherly feelings for her , and that i let myself in vith her like this and the stupid thing drags on because she clings to it , that is just a matter of duty and decency on diy side
likely , now , he ventured , likely , now , ye have taken a d silly fright , and are too damned scared of marriage ever to try it again -- hey , frau gr� ?
tony 's black frock gave her figure a maidenly slimness
whereas we , on the contrary—
to alter these shocking conditions , to which habit and ignorance had rendered those who saw them callous - for instance the indescribable filth of the village street , the utter lack of sanitation in the dwelling-hovels - would have amounted to a revolutionary deed , to which no single individual , certainly not a woman , could bring herself
hans castorp ironically asked his cousin , on the third day
now and then they flickered in a draught and dispersed a faint smell of wax over the table
pardon me , you were going to enlighten me further
but i swear to you , i pledge you my word of honour as a man , that i would carry you in my arms , that as my wife you would lack nothing , that you would live in hamburg a life alto-gether worthy of you -- tony sprang up
there were years in which we children of the dungeon dreamed of a hymn of exultation , a fidelio , a ninth symphony , to celebrate the dawn of a freed ger- many - freed by herself
frau permaneder was quite aware of the dignity , the repre-sentative bearing , which she owed to herself and the commu-nity in this hour
be quiet now ; it 's my turn
without that subcutaneous cell structure of ours , we should all be nothing but fungoid growths
you ’ ve learned something since you ’ ve been up here
it seemed that the two-year theological episode in halle had not weakened his bond with music or been any actual interruption to his preoccupation with it
she forbade her neighbour to use such words about clavdia ’ s profile
but first i must not fail to shed some light upon te personal condition of its creator , a man now fo
c ’ est ton cousin à qui tu penses en disant des choses étranges comme ça ?
just as much as in bach
they entered by slippery steps into a cellar-like vault with an earthen floor , which was used as a granary and provided with a rope for hauling up the sacks
i assume our gentleman will already have ordered them to put to the horses
very good , ziemssen , be off with you !
he sat down comfortably opposite the billiard-players , who leaned upon their rues across the tables
why you have it , i don ’ t know
what concerns you not , meddle not with !
don ’ t worry , we rest for an hour again before dinner , and then after it until four o ’ clock
listen , pf� would like to have you take him , if you will be so good
and it is like that at every company , before every expedition
not in the least , said adrian
his weariness rushed over him with renewed force at the thought
i forbid it , do you hear ?
you led up to a climax
truly , in his own physical person he was contaminate ; yet what mattered that , since his mind was untainted and sound—and quite competent to bring confusion to his priestly opponent in any discussion touching the body , or to laugh him to scorn over the soul ?
oh , now i am so new up here , i am still rather bewildered—you can imagine
the road to travem�irst crosses the ferry and then goes straight ahead
frau stöhr , for all her stupidity and ill breeding , was unquestionably worse off than he—not to mention dr blumenkohl
and though i hadn ’ t thought of it in that light , i may say that i agree with you , now that you mention it
while the rest drank their coifee he played the voilin , like a gipsy , passionately , with abandonment -- and with what dexterity !
such an idea would never have entered tony 's head of itself ; but since he said it , she believed it , and her feeling for him had thereby grown warmer and ten-derer
it is the last blow
and finally there were adrian and rudiger
one might , if one chose , describe it as deliberate rebarbarization
she did not even know the lady to speak to , nor could she boast a single common acquaintance
in my recollection they showed strong resemblance to ancient oriental writings , for instance the old aramaic ductus
he could not , so he told its author , express how it tool
he thought little or nothing of this
of course , when one heard the hofrat talk , one might easily conclude he had fever
that is a requisite , i suppose
little johann came out of his room , down the gallery steps , and across the corridor , on his way to ida jungmann 's room
your offer coin-cides with my motherly plans for my daughter ; and you on your side have not chosen badly -- that i can assure you
is that fair , i ask—or i would if i did not know that it is not a matter of justice at all—
so much for the moment as a description of nepo schnei- dewein , or echo as everybody , following his example , straight- way called him
how foolish all that was !
it is a metaphysical en- dowment , an essential factor , a structure , a conditioning
and between two wars , little johann played
hanno had grown sturdier in the past year ; but , despite his blue sailor suit , he still looked a little strange in the play-ground of the school , by contrast with the blond scandina-vian type that predominated there
joachim too looked rather uncomfortable , and settembrini lifted his eyebrows and said not a word , with an air of waiting politely for the end of his speech
she had slept very badly , and in the night she rang for ida jung-mann , who now slept in the back room of the entresol
he had a way of running one hand in between the buttons of his half-open undress coat and of sit-ting with his head supported on the back of his hand
what do you mean , tom ?
there is not a glory of the flesh i would not offer her , castorp , if it were only a matter of the body , not of the countenance , if it were not her accursed soul that will have none of me , without which i should have no longing for her body—that is the devil ’ s treadmill in which i eternally go round and round
in one breath , or rather in one breathlessness , he wrote down the three pieces , anyone of which would have been enough to make menlrable the year of its production ; actually he began with the draft of the trio on the very day on which he finished the lento of the quartet , which he composed last
by next morning the storm had ceased
it would impress anybody—couldn ’ t help it
i will wait for him here
when the nevvs comes that her sinful brother-husband is dead she breaks out in the remarkacle lament : gone is my hope , gone is my strength , my only brother , my second i !
\ y hand trembles as i vvrite ; but in quiet , collected words i will say what i know , always consoled to a certain extent by the thought to which i gave utterance above , the idea of choice , the thought that something obtained here like a bond of love , which lent to the coming together of the precious youth and that un- happy creature a gleam of soul though of course this consola- tion is inseparable from the other thought , so much more dread- ful , that love and poison here once and for ever became a frightful unity of experience ; the mythological unity embodied in the arrow it does look as though in the poor thing 's mind something an- swered the feeling which the youth brought to her no doubt she remembered that fleeting visit her approach , that caressing of his cheek with her bare arm , might have been the humble and tender expression of her receptivity for all that distinguished him
that is nothing , says behrens , her lung is perfectly satisfactory
let us sit here , and look on , as though in a dream
it is acquired root-treatment , he said to me
but even so , tom
but you have the right end of it after all , let me tell you
the disputant not only contradicted each other , they contradicted themselves
it would be a senseless thing to do , you admit it yourself , don ’ t you ?
it showed by irnplication that precedence belonged far more to the community ; that truth had the community as its goal , and that whoever would share in the conmunity must be pre- pared to scrap considerable elements of truth and science and line up for the sacrificiu intellectus '
but what ’ s the use of it ?
they had got up meantime to the berghof
but one day an indefinable malady had suddenly made itself felt -- at first in the form of a slight intestinal catarrh , for which dr crabow prescribed a mild diet of pigeon and french bread
at christmas time herr criinliuh appeared , to spend christmas in the buddenbrook family circle and also to take part in the celebration at the krbgers '
but even that be- came him , as did the curling lips that could whistle in so masterly a fashion
but a demonstrable hypothesis !
did we get into this wagon to discuss that subject ? -- dh , yes , i suppose you are right
and they knew in meng street , and at the club -- yes , the whole town knew -- who was responsible
joachim in particular felt relieved and enlightened by this explanation of his cousin ’ s startling curiosity ; it was in fact more on his account than on the hofrat ’ s that hans castorp had offered it
what is the physical being of man ?
gerda buddenbrook and the eccentric young officer met each other , naturally , in the world of music
at bottom , christian had said , at bottom every business man was a rascal
her digestion was obviously worse in these days
then he lifted the glass once more , and spilled half its contents , draining the remainder furiously at a gulp
his face , with the black almond-shaped eyes , displayed a slight grimace as he did so , but whether this happened in the effort to see more clearly or for other causes , he did not permit it to appear
or at least something very like that
he had a glass eye , which imparted a rather stony expression to his bearded face and belied his character , for he was of a lively and liberal frame and loved nothing better than play- ing the gallant with prima donnas and soubrettes in his drawing- room
we have mentioned the clairvoyante greataunt , of whom a melancholy tradition had come down
'that 's enouph , tony , the senator said softly
though in and for itself it went against ine too
he swept sister leandra with an icy stare , and seated himself in the chair which they placed for him by the bedside
but they might roll and seethe , weep and exult , foam up and enfold each other , as unnaturally as they liked !
but with a sort of horror at himself he saw it coming , that if he made this discipline his own , bound himself over , identified himself with it , he would very soon be disillusioned , bored ; get as sick and tired of it as though he had ladled it in with a cooking-spoon ( this gro- tesque simile also i recall literally )
he felt no unpleasant sensation , the blood-letting had had a soothing effect , but he found himself in a state of extraordinarily reduced vitality , so that when he exhaled the air , he felt no need to draw it in again , and lay there moveless , for the space of several quiet heart-beats , before taking another slow and superficial breath
mexican , you know ; doesn ’ t know a word of german and hardly any french , just a few scraps
his father so arranged it , and , though hanno was afraid , he made not a syllable of objection
settembrini says it is the law of love of one ’ s kind ; that sounds like his ancestor , the carbonaro
then the bril clanged loudly , and the pupils began to stream through the entrances into the building
how often had the normal day of the berghof renewed itself , since the faroff time when hans castorp lay and grumbled within himself because dr krokowski described an arc about him and left him on one side !
they helped him lift his unwieldy body from table , gave him the support of their arms , and he walked with wide steps between them bedwards , his mighty head sunk on his lifted shoulder
nothing worth listening to , herr settembrini
they knew that in the last day all our beloved gone before us to god will come with song and salvation to fetch us home
this is what i mean by the necessity for the terror
i refer , so far as the church is concerned , to the love-feast , the sacramental enjoyment of body and blood ; as for the lodge—
our prison , so wide and yet so narrow , so suffocatingly full of foul air , will some day open
they are a body of troops calculated as sufficient , even after great losses , to attack and carry a position and greet their triumph with a thousand-voiced huzza—not counting the stragglers that fall out by the way
often and often i thought of it , when the jacobin-puritan vir tue jargon , which four years long had disputed the , var propa- ganda of the agreed peace , became the current language of vic- tory
he sat in his place , cold , remote , and lofty , and answered the information that the carriage would be around at once by saying scornfully , in a voice that trembled more with bitter-ness than age : then the mob permits me to go home ?
as his master did not move or turn round or make any sign , the hump-backed apprentice shifted from one foot to the other , then made his outlandish scrape again and went down the back stairs
he would laugh at people who are much greater and better , and—more hu—man than himself and his—his ami bavard de la méditerranée , son maître et grand parleur— put together
i never have felt myself as firm as a rock , and my parents , both of them , dying so young—for i have been doubly orphaned from youth up , you know— herr settembrini described a single gesture , with head , hand , and shoulders
somebody , of course , ought to say : fire !
i believe i still do
last night there had been pineapple punch , and they had made part of a happy family circle
and with their united powers they knew hovv to set science in a light of such comic impotence that even the beautiful princes , in their childlike way , were bril- liantly entertained
this principle i intend to keep sacred , now as in the past , though one is sometimes forced to entertain a doubt , on con-templating the operations of people who seem to get on better without it
i ’ ve even thrown in a portrait or so
tell me , could i ?
he is a patriot , you must know , a democratic patriot
he said he found hans castorp looking very fit indeed , thanks to a stay that had been so much longer than anyone anticipated , and this being the case he supposed his nephew would travel down with him when he left
karen karstedt was not yet so far on as to display the self-deception that marks the last stage
he looked down at the floor , and spoke in a voice devoid of expression
well , and i assure you that the count altered his tune at once
i have read with pleasure the news of your meeting with christian in amsterdam
then josephus would be restored to his proper form and return to his kingdom , in which kai and hanno would be appointed to high offices
i was thinking of the hard times we were having
yes , those spirit lips , so close to her ear that they were like a caress , and tickled a little , making her smile , had whispered her what to do
all this was an exquisite activity to hans castorp ; he enjoyed the fragrant breath of the plants ; the soft warmth of the shop , after the cold outside , made his eyes fill with tears
tragic joy , triumphant sadness that was what made our ancestors leap and exult around the leaping flames : they did so as an act of homage to the madness of the circle , to an eternity without duration , in which everything recurs—in sheer despair , if you like
in short , i feel a sense of oppression—and for some reason or other , my cigar this morning hasn ’ t the right taste , something that as good as never happens to me , or only when i am seriously upset—and to-day it is like leather
its ambition is to make one believe that it is not made , but born , like pallas athene in full fig and embossed armonr from jupiter 's head
quant à moi , tu sais , j ’ aime la liberté avant tout et notamment celle de choisir mon domicile
well , give us your report card , the hofrat answered to joachim ’ s apologies , and took the fever chart out of his hand
clarissa hoped to succeed
but his body would have it otherwise
he felt a relief , which however bore within it the seeds of fresh disquiet , when he saw that hans castorp paid no heed , though he must have noticed the incident , but passed it over with an unconcern which was not so much tact , consideration , or courtesy , as it was the purest indifference , an uncanny invulnerability or complaisance , as though he had long ceased to notice or to feel surprise at such occurrences
i could call him out here no , you are right , jean ; it is better to wait , said madame buddenbrook
have i ever hated life -- pure , strong , relentless life ?
till , not to say on a lie , and were not only more and more challenged from
on the other hand he sketched for us the enchanting pleasure which even the visual picture of a score by mozart afforded to the practised eye ; the clarity of the texture , the beautiful disposition of the instrumen- tal groups , the ingenious and varied writing of the melodic line
it finished off with whist and music
now he has commanded his soldiery to drown in a sea of blood the attack on berlin and to shoot every officer who speaks of sur- render
he permitted only codeine
he asked dr krokowski
i was detained by business
the column was perceptibly lengthened ; it stood several of the black strokes above normal
i had been playing this afternoon , and felt a little queer
in speaking of rudolf 's inconstant nature - as one has to speak of it - one runs a risk of saying too much
i caught him at all that by mere chance , and even then he spoke mockingly of them before he made the above admissions
from him they learned the reason why the child 's skin was so pale and his strength so inadequate
she turned on him a pair of great distressed eyes , which slowly filled with tears as she said softly : no , morten , you should not think that of me -- you must not think that of me
peeperkorn ’ s manner was courtesy itself
it ’ s a fact—it is very lively !
then , with a voice that sounded as though he had just burnt his throat with hot grog , i am a simple sort of a man , and do not know much about landlubber 's tricks and skin games ; but if you mean , maybe , that -- well , sir , you can just set it down right away that you have got on the wrong tack , and are making a pretty bad miscalculation about my fatherly hopes
at length the little man uttered the single word : 'nuft
the consul 's wife smiled , well pleased
never once was the departed one shown looking directly ahead of her toward the observer
good god , it was the heart , it was joachim ’ s honour-loving heart , that hans castorp saw !
i flatter myself that in my dealings with these gentry i have not usually made the impression of a morally in-ferior exploiter ; to tell the truth , the boot has sometimes been on the other foot -- i have run across men who were far less scrupulous than i am !
he talks so , somehow
thus was the reluctant debtor outwitted , and at least this phase of the matter settled
look cut : he will flirt with you
when he turned round again , his sun-tanned visage showed an even darker shade
i still envy rudiger for having been the first to read aloud this tale to our friend , in the abbot 's room ; although i confess that if it had been myself the effect might not have been the same
you do not need to worry , tony , my child , she would say
the frau consul smiled forbearingly
her peevish face looked scarlet above her neck-ruche , and tiny purple veins showed in the cheeks
how well you do that !
she thus celebrates , he said , her cosmic aptitude for allegory ; for those elements were , as it were , the first and simplest materials of the world , a parallelism of which a phi- losophizing artist of a day not long gone by - it was wagner again of whom he spoke - had shrewdly , perhaps with somewhat too mechanical , too ingenious cleverness , made use , in that in his cosmogonic myth of the ring he made the basic elements of music one with those of the world
he , the infallible parent , had put the decision into her hands : he had confessed , almost humbly , to a sense of guilt
this house is a pearl , certainly a pearl -- ' if you can compare anything so large wilh anything so small , ha , ha !
his good-natured moustaches worked violently up and down
his wife , born langhals , wielded her lorgnon ; and , as usual , her hair stood up untidily all over her head
he shrieked , and stepped away from me again as though back to the cross
you see , i am spreading out my magic cloak
it was cer- tainly an element of our public life in the first half of the decade
the ladies were madame chauchat and marusja
then why should my heart be pounding like this ?
after the consul had received congratulatory handshakes on his success , he went up to his father-in-law
and that other , perhaps more intense , but strangely inarticulate language , that of tones - if one nay so designate music - does not seem to me to be included in the pedagogic- humanistic sphere , although i well know that in greel { education and altogether in the public life of the polis it played an ancillary role
he walked on his left side expressly ; and when there came a little rise to surmount , would help his cousin , who had grown by now unsteady on his feet ; would put his arm across his shoulder ; overcoming his shyness , would even leave it there a while , until joachim shook it off pettishly and said : don ’ t , it looks silly—as if we were drunk , coming along like that
speaking generally , it was altogether possible that her relations with the russian visitor had a disinterested and harmless character
hence the phrase perinde ac si cadaver , scoffed settembrini
i go into it in these pages because what happened did to some extent touch the life and destiny of my hero , adrian lever- klihn ; yes , in one of them , to my actual knowledge , he was in- volved and active in an obscure and fatal 'way
but i wanted to say something else : i wanted to point out the singular interchange which often takes place between the voices and the orchestra
his dis- like of his own very germanness ( it was that , indeed , which drew him to the anglicist and anglolnaniac schildknapp ) took the two disparate forms of a cocoonlike withdrawal from the world and an inward need of world-wideness
she turned to hans castorp
the music -- it was beginning again ; an idiotic racket , meant to be a galop , with the drum and cymbals marking a rhythm in which the other instruments all joined either ahead yf or behind time ; a naive , insistent , intolerable hullabaloo of snarling , crashing , and feebly piping noises , punctuated by the silly tootling of the piccolo
but between whiles he was silent ; we shall not say self-absorbed , for his attention was presumably directed outwards , though upon a single point
he responded little else than certainly , of course to the doctor ’ s blithe and hearty greeting , and was relieved when his nephew left him , passing by the balcony from joachim ’ s room to his own , after bidding him good-night and saying he would fetch him for eight o ’ clock breakfast
she stood there , in her paper cap , and looked him up and down , with a smile that betrayed no trace of pity , nor any concern for the ravages written on his brow
and the consul did feel the cold , felt it persistently , though his head was hot
then the spasm would relax in a merry , apologetic smile and things would run on again in almost uncanny fluency , for a while
one simply must draw the line somewhere !
up on the schatzalp there is a man , a greek peasant , an agent had him sent here from arcadia , he has galloping consumption , there isn ’ t the dimmest hope for him
after which tony 's husband , like most of the friends whom he met around the table in the hofbrau house , to play cards and drink his regular three litres of beer , limited his activities to the raising of rents in his capacity of landlord , and to an un-disturbed cutting of coupons
sometimes he entertained the company , not too badly , with his cello , accompanied by his wife , who came from germany and had once been a singer
his death agony was sore , for unlike his son , hans lorenz castorp had been a man of tough constitution , and firmly rooted in life
worse than i am -- come , that 's too much !
she would have a good home , where she could bathe and be in the fresh air and get clear in her mind
not that i wasn ’ t in a funk as well , because i was—i was just one large blue funk all over
this was now in its sixth year , and gradually coming to be no longer so much a cure as a fixed condition of existence , a residence for life in rarefied atmosphere , coloured by some activity as latin master in the davos gymnasium for slightly tubercular boys
ida sat down beside her , with her needle and the stocking drawn over the darner again in her hand , and bent over them the smooth grey head and the indefatigable bright brown eyes , do you think he is going to propose to-morrow ?
i am sick of it , that 's all
she was leaning back in her chair , with drooping wrists and finger-tips poised on the table-edge , her head bent on one shoulder , her eyebrows raised , her little mouth drawn down so that it looked even smaller , with a tiny smile that had something both silly and sly about it , and gazing into space with vacant , childlike blue eyes
loudly , behind his brother 's back he censured this pro- vocative licence and would not be talked round by his sister 's soothing words , to the effect that the advocate was a full-blooded man , in danger of a heat stroke , which made light clothing a necessity to him
but for the sake of her bourgeois security she took part in the festivities of a community which was just one great art- society , and this it was emperilled the security she sought
when he told his partner of the poppt-nrade matter , herr marcus had for the first time in his life been angry with him , and had washed his hands of the whole affair
say , rather , to the context
he spoke with enthusiasm of the theme , which gave opportunity to set the lout and natural alongside the conic sublime and make both ridiculous in each oter
they were so many and moved so rapidly that the changeful , flickering light on the staircase came in time to hurt the eyes
anyhow the occasion served to inform us , to our mo mentary surprise , that rudi , in his earlier life , had had an opera tion that cost him one of his kidneys
the senator measured the room throughout its length , and then stood at one of the windows and looked down into the garden
that it approaches , that it long since became inevitable : of that i can not believe anybody still cherishes the smallest doubt
in the way he had when some point of view was complete
/ take it too seriously ?
in such remarks there was always as much contempt as envy
thomas , my son , come here a minute , said johann bud-denbrook , taking his great bunch of keys from his trousers pocket
fetch your rescuer an ice and engage her for the next waltz !
tilda is already busy in the kitchen , went on the consul , and i should have been long since at work myself , if your mother and i had not been speaking seriously about a mat-ter that concerns our little daughter
then the bell rang , and they went up
our young people passed through the entrance and the crowd that , seated in ascending tiers , surrounded the course on three sides ; they found places for themselves , and sat down to look on
they played a movement of haydn , some pages of mozart , a sonata of beethoven
he would ask , the glasses of his spectacles flashing
phidias , or that other chap with the mosaic ending to his name , would have stuck up their noses at her style of physiognomy—hullo , where are you going with the ham ?
he even drew upon himself a rebuke from settembrini , for saying he thought the current conception in error which would have it that a philosophical credulity and belief that all is for the best is the mark of a sound nature , as pessimism and cynicism are of morbidity
chest trouble is the last thing one would accuse her of
in short , the woman had become deeply offensive to me after i knew and saw what she let herself in for
she leaned back , crossed one leg lightly over the other , and stared into space
mankind will soon perceive that it is not the task of true science to run after godless understanding ; but to reject utterly all that is harmful , yes , even all that ideally speaking is without significance , in favour of instinct , measure , choice
so is he growing up -- but jean !
you ca not stand it , you give way
not in cocaine , not in opium , not in vice as such does the viciousness lie
the gentleman , with a movement of decision , laid his hat and stick on the lid of the harmonium
but hans castorp good-naturedly took cognizance of settembrini ’ s point of view and tested by it his own inner experiences ; from which self-examination it principally appeared that the waking man has an advantage over the sleeping and dreaming one
he had a voice pure as a bell , that went straight to the heart
above are the bed , bath , and dressing-rooms and the servants ' quarters
sometimes , in those four years , he sat with me in the evening and read the paper
did kurz , the merchant , in bakers ' alley , who gets three or four votes at every election , will sit quaking at home on the fatal day , and listen to the shouting , but he will not be elected this time either
hans castorp kept his eye on it as he walked up and down waiting for his cousin
yes , it was high time you came home ; the climate over there would have killed you in the end
last night , between half past nine and ten , i was taking a little exercise in the garden ; i looked up at the row of balconies ; there was your light gleaming through the dark ; you were performing your cure , led by the dictates of duty and reason
and though he did not spare herr settembrini the pain of finding naphta ’ s gibes worth hearing , he had to admit that these were latterly going beyond all bounds and often enough overstepping the border-line of mental sanity
on the outside of it was written , in an oval border surrounded by red flowers and a profusion of gilt flourishes : on the occasion of my friendly participation in a delightful house-warming party given by the buddenbrook family
but here it became clear that his own powers would never take him over the stretch between him and the berghof ; and accordingly , as there was no tram and he saw no carriages for hire , he hailed a driver going toward the dorf with a load of empty boxes and asked permission to climb into his wagon
but after pronouncing this aesthetic judgment he lay silent in his deck-chair , not thinking of anything more suitable to sing in its place
fie set two poems by i ( eats , ode to a nightingale and the shorter ode on i\lelancholy with a string-quartet acconlpaniment , which indeed left far behind and below it the traditional conception of an accompaniment
that should have been a kind of reassurance to me ; indeed , it was that , for it went against me to imagine him as a candidate for the office of preacher or pastor , or even as councillor of the con- sistory or other high office
what language do you speak ?
indeed , i had scarcely set my pen in motion when there escaped it a word which privately gave me a certain embarrassment
for the whole form was aware that he gave way to the feeling of the moment , whatever that might happen to be , with-out the slightest restraint
do i want to kill her ?
have a good time—morning— morning— krokowski joined him as he sailed off down the hall , swinging his arms palms backward , directing to right and left the question about sleeping well , which was answered on all sides in the affirmative
and what did i tell you ?
there is at bottom only one prob- lem in the world , and this is its name
great physical changes had taken place since the mother ’ s coming
you mean he will refuse on account of the seventeen thou-sand marks current
if certain insinuations on herr settembrini ’ s part had angered hans castorp , the annoyance was quite unjustified , as also his feeling that the schoolmaster had been spying on him
ha ha , ha ha !
i implore you again : think what you are doing
i take it , he responded , that you use the word not as a com- pliment , but in a descriptive and critical way , as you should
it is , it is—engineer , said herr settembrini in a low voice , coming close to the young man as he addressed him , don ’ t you know there is something frightful in the way you fling the months about ?
so far as i am concerned , you can go
fie could say of a man nothing worse than that he thought and taught like a flatulent furriner
it was thus very daring of settembrini , who surely must have more command of the language than anyone else , not only never to appear , but to refer to the entertainment in most disparaging terms
assument pennas ut aqailæ ’ — voltaire himself approved of a war for civilization , and advised frederick to fight turkey
as for me , i felt sure that the peculiar tension between i { retsch- mar and adrian 's mother had reference to adrian ; i divined this because in the silent struggle that went on i stood in my own feeling between the two parties , inclining now to the one and now to the other
what had she meant by her look ?
in three or four months you ought to be as fit as a fiddle
i do not feel in the least like joking , adri - because in the first place it goes to my heart and makes me feel solemn , the role you assign to me in your life , and even before posterity
frau permaneder paused in the midst of her business , like one paralyzed
has he really insulted me ?
but hans castorp sensed rather than saw this , owing to the distance
i did so with pedagogic restraint , with a view to reducing the situation to the everyday , and determined not to be sentimental
the surface of the lying snow began to thaw , grew soft and porous
glad you think it ’ s like her
the tracl { round the sphere , of which there had been talk in those tor- turingly clever conversations at kridwiss 's , this track , on which regress and progress , the old and the new , past and future , be- came one - i saw it all realized here , in a regression full of mod- ern novelty , going back beyond bach 's and handel 's harmonic art to the remoter past of true polyphony
and if i don ’ t arrive , it will be some time before they notice it , you may be sure of that
it made a great impression on me , to see him fresh from such exacting and splendid work , in which he is so much the master
it ’ s plain why you never became a priest , joli jésuite à la petite tache humide !
dr krokowski greeted the new inmate with a jovial and robust heartiness , as who should say that with him all formality was superfluous , and only jocund mutual confidence in place
a loose bodice of soft dark silk , with satin rc-vcrs and flat lace epaulettes , gave her pretty bosom an enchanting look of softness and fulness
he : what , ne'er a word but mum ?
had not a researcher once , audaciously fanciful , referred to the beasts of the milky way , cosmic monsters whose flesh , bone , and brain were built up out of solar systems ?

but life has destroyed my faith in men
he had always been subject to feverish catarrh , and one day he actually spat blood ; whereupon he had been rushed off to davos , heels over head , to his great distress and affliction , for he had just then arrived within sight of the goal of all his hopes
nobody knew it this morning
yet the final result of his considerations was the desire to take his daugh-ter and her child home with him and let driinlich go his own way
overnight the guest has become the comrade
it may be that these grotesque memories are unworthy of in- clusion here - : am inclined to believe it
wait , said hans castorp
her second dowry , the eighteen thousand thaler so magnanimously returned by herr permaneder , lay waiting for erica ; and directly frau antonie 's practiced glanre marked the budding tenderness between her daughter and the director , she began to trouble heaven with a prayer that herr weinschenk might be led to visit them
it ’ s incredible—who would have believed it ?
they reached the courtyard and began to stroll up and down across the wet red tiles , among school companions of all ages and sizes
you are developing a theology there , in which you ascribe to man a highly honourable , if perhaps rather a one-sided religious function
but the classic adage : look before you leap h
yes , she found words for everything ; she gave full expression to all the accumulated disgust of her munich years
how did we come to speak of her ? —yes , herr hofrat , i remember as thought it was yesterday , how we met you in the garden , or , rather , you met us , for we were sitting on a bench—i could show you the very bench , to-day , that we were sitting on—we were sitting and smoking
hans castorp grieved for his cousin , reading in his eyes his pain at the approaching parting
in his two-fold guise
the senator stopped mechanically in his walk , asked mechanically about the concert and the spanish virtuoso , and said he was ready to go to bed
before the tribunal of reason , conscience , and common sense it could make no claims to be heard ; principally , of course , because when all was said and done , frau chauchat was an ailing woman , feeble , fevered , and tainted within ; her physical condition had much to do with the questionable life she led , as also with hans castorp ’ s instinctive reservations
for a chord combination that kretschmar rejected at first sight as being doubt- ful and awkward finally seemed to him more characteristic than what he himself had in mind , and at the next meeting he declared that he would like to take over adrian 's idea
our ecclesiastic here will tell you that the world of the medio evo is not complete when franciscan mysticism is not counterbalanced by the opposite pole of thomistic cognition
we are not satisfied wi ' things as they be
it was mid-april , two and a half years later
elly , it seemed , in her trance had promised to materialize the spirit of any departed person the circle chose
herr wiedemann , bleeding and frothing , his face brutish with rage , displayed a phenomenon hans castorp had never before seen and had always supposed a figure of speech : his hair stood on end
fie pointed out to him a middle part that came to nothing , a bass that did not move
i feel like that too
we shall see that no dressing-gown and no silver bread-basket gets away
i think it would be better to put off the party
it was a lusty , not too gentle race , that of these comrades of hanno and kai among whom they walked up and down
it scarcely needs saying that our good-bye was outwardly cool and reserved

he said there 's foul work in- stead of there 's something wrong
well , isn ’ t it a pleasure resort , then ?
i love to go out there in the summer and walk in the undergrowth ; it would quite spoil the place to trim and prune its free natural beauty
he submitted some of them forthwith : the ever-present possibility that justice might err and judicial murder be committed ; the hope of reformation , which it was never possible to disregard ; the biblical injunction vengeance is mine
this man was so nervous that he jumped every time he heard a sudden noise behind him ; and tony delighted in making him jump every time she set eyes on him

but when the day comes , you will be as moved as all the rest of us
experience has forced ne to ponder this problem so anxiously , so urgently , that at tilnes , frightful to say , it has seemed to me that i should be driven beyond my proper and becoming level of thought , and myself experience an impure heightening of my natural gifts
and now he strongly reminded me of the elder leverktihn 's musing mania for speculating the elements
how often in my strained observation of adrian 's ac- tivity i was forced to remember the early impressions we boys had got from that voluble stutterer , his teacher , with his antithe- sis of harmonic subjectivity and polyphonic objectivity !
ladies and gentlemen , the dutchman said , and lifted his sea-captain ’ s hand , with its nails like lance-heads , in entreaty and monition
so they got me in at last
i am no swell -- i do not care about scraping money to-gether
the furniture -- you have taken everything into consideration of course -- the things that belong to us , i mean to erica and me and the little one , they remain here with us ?
he had a cigarette in his mouth , and his hands in his trouser pockets ; and stood so to watch the lively little old russian lady , as she , with her lean grand-niece and two other ladies , took their seats in a carriage
the consul stared at her amazed

only the non-fictional is still permissible , the unplayed , the un- disguised and untransfigured expression of suffering in its actual moment its impotence and extremity are so ingrained that no seeming play with them is any'lenger allowed
this demand was entirely foreign to the young man ’ s nature—so much so that he himself was disagreeably impressed as he heard himself make it
johann conrad beissel had been born of very poor parents at eberbach in the palatinate and early orphaned
you say that so ironically—with the right kind of irony , of course , that can not for a moment be misunderstood , the direct and classic device of oratory—you see , i remember the things you say

in this wise the duration of the main rest period was finally reduced to no more than an hour ; and even this hour was lopped off at its latter end , elided , as it were
ll they meant was : sehen sie dasl and he looked just like them
surely , surely , hans castorp said
a young female , lying outstretched , drawing with one hand her flowered robe high between her breasts , reached with the other in the air after a twig bearing fruit and leaves , which a second , a slender-hipped creature , erect at her head , was playfully withholding
every vacant seat in the senate must , according to the constitution , be filled within four weeks
such a result was as far as possible from frau ziemssen ’ s intention
the family likenesses wrre abundantly clear , even now
they passed the avenue that led id the little town , and rolled along thp front
he is asleep , she said
yes , he knew it was largely the promptings of conscience to which he hearkened ; to be precise , the promptings of a conscience not altogether easy—as he sat listening to the italian , one leg crossed over the other , drawing at his maria mancini ; or when the three of them climbed the hill from the english quarter
hans castorp was ready , now as ever , of his own free will to lend an ear to settembrini ’ s teachings , and by way of experiment to be influenced by them
he had carefully avoided unfavourable conditions of atmospheric pressure , and left it to uncle james to stultify himself ; yet an apoplexy carried him off after all ; and a telegram , couched in brief but feeling terms—feeling more for the departed than for the recipient of the wire—was one day brought to hans castorp where he lay in his excellent chair
her large mouth drooped tragically at one corner
he said softly : four years -- tony 's tears ceased suddenly
christian , sitting a little to one side , conned the second oration of cicero against catiline
but i quickly forgave him as we went on , and i heard the llving musical diction given to the parable in the purgatorio of the man who carries a light on his back at night , which does not light him but lights up the path of those coming after

now he came lounging through the garden , wearing a check tail-coat , instead of his smock , and his stiff hat on the back of his head
thus he had grown used to his silent and remote relation to pribislav hippe , and considered it a regular feature of his life ; loved the emotions it brought in its train , the suspense as to whether he was likely to meet him that day , whether pribislav would pass close by him , even look at him ; loved the subtle and wordless satisfaction imparted by his secret , loved even the disappointments inseparable from it—the greatest of which was pribislav ’ s absence from school
this was on account of the mi- graine , which from then on hindered him in the little preparation he had to do
i did not fail , then , in friendly good will , even though i was prevented by nature from understanding in the sense of fellow- feeling
more than i ever was in all my life !
but if he shudders when he hears life 's voice , if the memory of that vanished scene and the sound of that lusty summons make him shake his head , make him put out his hand to ward it off as he flies forward in the way of escape that has opened to him -- then it is clear that the patient will die
hans castorp , like so many others , experienced it—always with drawn and frowning brows , for this particular form of debauch is never a merry one
joachim knew it already : it had been in full blast when he arrived the year before—but hans castorp rather dreaded it , however well he felt himself equipped
would you , as my friend , want me to spend the rest of my life in this cloister ?
but if , he sang , god should call him to himself , then would he look down protectingly on thee—meaning the singer ’ s sister , as hans castorp was perfectly aware , yet the word thrilled him to the depths , and his emotion prolonged itself as the hero sang , to a mighty choral accompaniment :
gerda had grown tall and splendid
that was the way his destiny was to be ful-filled he acted under the pressure of inexorable ne-cessity
after a while he added : ai though people ever heard what had been heard then !
from the win- terreise , with the perfectly heart-breaking stanza beginning : hab ' ja doch nichts begangen dass ich menschen sollte scheu ' n
then it is well at least if the master guesses and un- derstands the hidden leanings of the youth ; he may even be ironic on the score of them if he takes care not to stand in the way of their development
already the last week in july
he went on to speak of the crows ’ -eye tree of the coromandel coast , from the orange-yellow berries of which—the crows ’ eyes—was extracted the most powerful alkaloid of all , strychnine
but in fact , the torture was an invention of the human reason
hans castorp waited , blinking , his lungs distended
one ends , i said undeterred , by denying the works of god ; one becomes the advocate of nothing
he had , as he spoke , the feeling of a man who finds himself slipping , but for the moment contrives to keep his feet
presently dr blumenkohl came back in the same unobtrusive way , took his place , and went on eating
looking at her he could quite credit the malapropisms joachim told of
he attended one of dr krokowski ’ s conférences—that he should stop away was unthinkable
the child is not to have a governess
when one of the pupils played a prank , she would laugh so heartily that she nearly cried , and then sesemi would rap on the table and call out nelly !
a bell rang in the midst of the music , and the crowd would burst out now and again with shouts of encouragement and applause

he explained certain de-tails of the procedure -- the examination of witnesses had now been interrupted by the christmas recess -- condemned the very obvious bias of the president , dr philander , and poured scorn on the attitude which the public prosecutor , dr hagenstriim , thought it proper to assume toward himself and the witnesses for the defence
i know nothing more stirring than the end , where it is as though there were tongues of flame from all four sides , a combination of runs and trills which gives the im- pression of a whole orchestra
that is an answer , at least , he said , turning to naphta again
at the door of the salnn he paused a moment for a glance into the mirror to order his cravat , and to refresh himself with a whiff of the eau-de-cologne on his handkerchief
said clara , looking out of the window and into the gossip 's glass
i leave it an open question whether dr edelmann himself , or only that associate editor of the anbruch who was a countryman of hers , could boast of her acquaintance
if they understood him aright , he considered the use of tobacco one of those over-refined enjoyments the cultivation of which robbed of their majesty the simpler pleasures of life—those gifts and claims to which our power of feeling was even at best scarcely equal
and he had favourites in his treasure-house , certain vocal and instrumental numbers which he never tired of hearing
but irony that is not for a moment equivocal ’ —what kind of irony would that be , i should like to ask , if i may make so bold as to put in my oar ?
we must wait and see what comes of it
and he ran the edge of his hand lightly over the bare neck and shoulders , the skin of which , especially by contrast with the exaggerated red of the face , was very white , as though seldom exposed
but no one gave the signal
death and love—no , i can not make a poem of them , they don ’ t go together
sorenson expressed it : she has a certain something about her !
thomas buddenbrook had played now and then through-out his life with an inclination to catholicism
and anyhow , you will want money sent
and then she told her story
and listened to the talk about weddings and trousseaux and bridal journeys
not only that he repeatedly went too far in his frankness about his relations with inez - but also he went too far in another direction , culpably and impishly too far , betrayed by the darkness , i might say , if the notion of any betrayal is in place and one ought not to speak instead of an impudent intru- sion of familiarity upon solitude
how is it possible ?
you have spoken to your pupils here of the bloody deeds of the church , her chastisements and her intolerance ; very foolishly so , for it stands to reason that the zeal of the godly can not be pacifistic in character—gregory himself said : cursed be the man who holds back his sword from the shedding of blood
he might have taken the large bronze plaque that stood on the etagere , but he seized instead a thin painted vase with flowers that stood next it , and threw it on the ground so that it smashed into a thousand bits
it went against his grain to eat butter served in the piece instead of in little fluted balls
the usual group of spectators stood about : frau iltis with her steriletto , the ivory levi , the inordinate popoff and his wife
and this is our son , he said
she said it to institoris , too , the suitor , when he behaved with something less than alacrity in his gallantries , or was slo , v in the uptake
what now happens to this mild utterance , rhythmically , harmonically , contrapuntally , to this pen- sive , subdued formulation , with what its master blesses and to what condemns it , into what black nights and dazzling flashes , crystal spheres wherein coldness and heat , repose and ecstasy are one and the same , he flings it down and lifts it up , all that one may well call vast , strange , extravagantly magnificent , without thereby giving it a name , because it is quite truly nameless ; and with la- bouring hands l { retschmar played us all those enormous transfor- mations , singing at the same time with the greatest violence : dim-dada !
and the frau consul could not resist stretching out her hand to their guest with her sweeping gesture , palm upward , while the bracelets gave a little jingle
it is coming out
as he finished , the plettenpudding was nearly consumed , and the malmsey nearing its end ; and then , to a universal , long-drawn ah-h !
he went with his cousin , rather bent and stiff in the knees , like a man bowed to the earth with fatigue
the longer the less 'till you be able and willing to let your- self in for contritio , sithence the extravagant life you will lead is a great indulgence , out of the which a man does not so simply find the way back into the good safe average
i should lose half the money i put into it
much in love with everything - just everything - made of notes not to burn to introduce to a pupil who knew how to listen as adrian did this world of shapes and figures , inexhaustibly rich in styles , national characteristics , traditional values , and charms of personality , historic and individual variations of the ideal beauty
they looked , most of them , like northerners , there might be hamburgers among them ; and hans castorp felt very shy of meeting his fellow townsmen
his father was a literary man too , you know , and , i believe , his grandfather
yes , said broker gratjens , it 's sad , when you think of the madness that led to their ruin
hans castorp and joachim ziemssen thanked him most warmly for all he had said , and mounted the berghof steps , while herr settembrini betook himself once more to his humanistic writing-desk , in the storey above naphta ’ s silken cell
' a kind papa , a worthy man
we knew nothing precise about what was occupying him , now that that music of the cosmos had appeared in print from schott 's sons in \ainz , under the same arrangerrlents as the brentano songs
he was as frightful in his smiles as in his anger
very good , very good indeed
you have waited this long
we say of time that it passes
but ferge , as second , and the neutral hans castorp , were beside themselves , and the latter fell heavily upon the wretched wehsal
when he went shopping with a lady he might point to something and say : well , i would not spend any money on that
you would always rather just have me bury myself out here , so i should never see a living soul
it fell silently , through air that was moderately cold , perhaps ten to fifteen degrees of frost
and on all these lying masses more snow fell , day in , day out
how does it depress you ?
hermann hagenstrbm was not the man to vote in the assembly for the application of large sums of money to preserve and restore the town 's mediaeval monuments
they will clutch their children to them when she approaches , to save them from the evil eye
ideas , my friend , are a bad lot , they have hot cheeks , they make your own burn too , in none too lovesome a way
and now at last , at last , he was off for the flat-land , for home and his regiment !
after that , settembrini took the floor—and well he knew how to avail himself of it
of these earlier owners , who died at about this time , i have little memory
he hissed when he talked , but his manners were cold and businesslike , and nothing betrayed the emotions of his soul
i have the honour , ma dame
the uncanny air of futility , or even a sort of sinister crackbrainedness , which hung about it was due to the addled fanaticism with which the former artist pursued and supported an economic idea , about which he was obviously so little serious that he made not the smallest effort to put it into execution
despite my dissimilar feelings i could but grant her a cultural sympathy
in the place where the four voices of the altar order the letting loose of the four avenging angels , who mow down rider and steed , emperor and pope , and a third of mankind , how terrifying is the effect of the trombone glissandos which here represent the theme !
her husband the brewer purported to have profited personally by a perusal , but regretted that his wife should have taken up that sort of thing , because such reading spoiled the women and gave them immodest ideas
i see i shall have to put on thinner clothes
in reality it had no end , it went on deep into the night , on and on , with bipolar position and historically conscious analysis , with extra-temporal qualities , ontological natural- ism , logical dialectic , and practical dialectic : painstaking , shoreless , learned , tailing off into nothing - that is , into slumber , to which our leader baworinski recommended us , for in the morning - as it already almost was - we should be due for an early start
we must repeat that , as for us , we have been speaking only of the lawful licence of a holiday , of fantasies born of leisure , of which the wellconducted mind wearies as quickly as a vigorous man does of lying in the warm sand
like the bathing cabins at the kur , and its walls were scribbled over with mottoes , initials , hearts and rhymes
the pity the well person felt for the sick—a pity that almost amounted to awe , because the well person could not imagine how he himself could possibly bear such suffering—was very greatly exaggerated
yes , they had all had to come : mbllendorpfs , kistcnmakcrs , langhals , dverdiecks -- before tony buddenbrook left her parental roof for ever , they had all gathered here , to offer her , despite driinlich , despite per-maneder , despite hugo weinschenk , their sympathy and condolences
a russian wave is rolling up ; it has taken vitebsk and now threatens l\linsk , the capital of white russia , after whose fall , so our whispering news service tells us , there will be no longer any stopping them in the east either
he was not too much inclined to believe implicitly all settembrini said ; he considered him too much of a windbag for that
but it is he
no , papa -- how can you say such a thing ?
his uniform-coat stood open over the usual white waistcoat
i every trace of care or disquiet had vanished'from madame buddenbrook 's face
now and then his mouth had to come to the rescue and fly open for a deep breath
i cite the propositions of molinos
what was monday to him ?
and i know father would not have done it -- cod forbid !
leverkghn , exchanged a word , vith anybody on the subject
but i observed that it made me unsteady , hare-brained , and in-capable -- and control , equilibrium , is , at least for me , the im-portant thing
yet obviously it came from an a , ved and astonished heart
heaven be praised , the corridors were empty
the bow-window was filled with palms
hans castorp , his head full of far-reaching associations , having to do for instance with the lame concierge , and that lady who had gone about for a week holding her ear , and need not have troubled herself , would have liked to put more questions
they all laughed again at this , through their noses , without a sign of feeling
sometimes it was the bark of the root that contained the principle , as was the case with a certain creeper growing in the malay archipelago , called strychnos tieuté , from which the natives prepared the upasradsha , by adding snake-venom
after everybody laughed , as if they agreed with me , there sat this hagenstrom and brought out with ridiculous solemnity , tor my part -- ' stu-pid fool !
the discovery had been made through the jealousy of another young girl , a friend of emmy , who had found her way to emmy ’ s room by the same route the greek had taken—namely , across the balconies ; and , distracted by her jealous rage , had made great outcry , so that everybody came running , and the scandal became known to the sparrows on the house-tops
probably she had risen too early
- the wine-merchant stood up and listened , with his mouth full of smoke
deaths in the family usually induce a religious mood
the people have certainly never done so
frau permaneder opened the door and called out good-bye !
pretty large concerns you occupy yourself with , nights when you do your cure
you do not want to know anything of each other
a quarter past two will pass for half past , will even pass for three , on the theory that it is already well on the way toward it
this treatment was directed towards the desperately violent acidity from which the patient suffered , and which klirbis , vas inclined to ascribe at least in part to nervous causes - that is , to a central influence , the brain , which here for the first time began to play a role in his diagnostic speculations
but our beis- sel is not after all any very striking example of it
none of that mattered now ; for death , with arbitrary and incomprehensible partiality , had singled him out , and taken him up , and given him an awe-some dignity and importance
there was a long pause
he could not have seen it , in fact ; everything swam before his eyes in the white mist , obliterating all contours
nay , more : the individual , of his own free will , would expose himself without a thought
yes , father leverkiihn was a dreamer and speculator , and i have already said that his taste for research - if one can speak of research instead of mere dreamy contemplation - always leaned in a certain direction - namely , the mystical or an intuitive half- mystical , into which , as it seems to me , human thinking in pur- suit of nature is almost of necessity led
her name is marusja , with your kind permission—it is the same as marie
frau stöhr , her broom under her arm and her hands on her knees , laughed like the charwoman she impersonated
and now this too -- this is the last straw -- the very last
my god , i was sick at my stomach
he drew out of the pocket of his jacket the end of a narrow gaily-striped rib-bun , and looked with a mixture of expectation and triumph into tony 's eyes
i , for one , have never in my life come across a perfectly healthy human being
the works of this preat roman orator make pretty difficult reading , eh ?
this was read by the munich dean on whom i called to get consent for the church service so intensely desired by the frau senator
the assembly listened respectfully
he was not here , he said , on their account ; he was not here to enjoy life , and to put up with his sojourn in the measure in which it furnished him agreeable change and diversion
dr anton cieszynski and stefan von rosinski , in connexion with the occurrences of the th of march , — , had after mature consideration come to the conclusion that the taking of the judicial steps which they recommended against m kasimir japoll for the calumny and detraction uttered against his wife jadwiga would afford him no satisfaction whatever , since
it is pleasanter out there
i had the enclosed letter and ring just now from griinlich , and my head aches fearfully from excitement
it was , he said , the most unstable , the most unreliable of man ’ s instincts , the most prone of its very essence to error and fatal perversion
let us assume that you spend another thirty francs for tips , if you are decent and like to have friendly faces about you
he watched his mother and herr pfu'hl with large quiet eyes ; and thus , so early , he became aware of music as an extraordinarily serious , important , and profound thing in life
oh , what a scare -- yes , tony said , she 's probably broken something again
they left ; hans castorp , going out behind joachim , looked over his shoulder
let us be accurate
hans castorp politely found that truly remarkable
he le- gitimacy of the state resided , he said , in its elevation , its sover- eignty , which thus existed independent of the valuations of indi- viduals , because it - very much in contrast to the shufhings of the contrat social- was there before the individual
gercla buddenbrook , frau permaneder , [ christian , and little johann sat under the big gas-lamp around the centre-table in the living-room , and worked industriously until far on into the evening
he played characteristic passages and a few complete scene se- quences : the first act , including the scene outside armado 's house , and several later numbers which he had partly anticipated : in particular biron 's monologues , which he had had especially in mind from the first , the one in verse at the end of the third act , as well as the prose one in the fourth : they have pitched a toil , i am toiling in a pitch - pitch that defiles ; which , while always preserving the atmosphere of the comic and grotesque , expresses musically still better than the first the deep and genuine despair of the young man over his surrender to the suspect black beauty , his raging abandonment of self-mockery : by the lord , this love is as mad as ajax ; it kills sheep ; it kills me , i a sheep : this partly because the swift-moving , unjointed , ejaculatory prose , with its many plays on words , inspired the composer to invent musical accents of quite peculiar fantasticality ; partly , also , because in music the repetition of the significant and already familiar , the suggestive or subtle invention , always makes the strongest and most speaking impression
you were making music
i don ’ t recall having tasted—oh , yes , once in my life i had pomegranate juice and soda ; it was too sweet
and more than that , it is profoundly contradictory that a man should have , as leverklihn did , some feeling for the human eye , which after all speaks only to the eye , and yet refuse to perceive the outer world through that organ
the standard is being lowered , he said
games were begun at two green extension-tables : at the one , dominoes ; at the other , bridge , and here only the young folk played , among them hermine kleefeld and herr albin
and what acoustic panic results from the repeated drum-glissandos , an effect made possible on the chro- matic or machine drum by changing the tuning to various pitches during the drum-roll
but he was delicate and nervous , suffered from his sympathetic nerve , in his solar plexus , from which so many anx- ieties and early fears of death proceed , and , vas an habitue of a sanatorium for the wealthy in l\eran
everything pattered , streamed , rushed , foamed
for there is no doubt that their triumph and the his- torical sanction to regulate this world according to their beastly will would have destroyed his life-work and his immortality
but what about that other kind of hubris , which perishes in a wanton trifling with the forces of unreason and hostility to the human race ?
dear , good nelly , what a child she is !
madame kethelsen now occupied the first storey of the house on the mill brink , and she herself the ground floor , and there they lived alone
for she looked at him , :vhile i was working myself up , as though she were listen- ing to him and not to me
he was a broad , stocky man with a red face , sea-blue eyes , and a bristling grizzled beard that ran fan-shaped from one ear to the other
it was done in front of that structure on the other side of which hofrat behrens had been standing when they entered
if the position had really been what he said , if it were true that the horrible thing was actually an invention of the human reason , that only showed how grievously she always needed sustaining and enlightening , and how little ground the instinct-worshippers had for their fear that things could ever be too much directed by reason on this earth !
he screamed , and began pounding with his fists on the table , till the dishes rang
we assume that a connexion subsists between the outer rind of the cerebrum and the vascular centre in the medulla
but for an artist nothing is easier , even if he is only standing in the vestibule to fame , i mean the sensational appeal
your cousin ’ s is a good and simple nature , most worthy of respect ; exposed to no intellectual perils , the sort that gives a schoolmaster not one anxious moment
and he looked sidelong at his cousin
i am not allowed , joachim answered
tony wept afresh ; and covering her eyes with both hands , in which she held the batiste handkerchief , she sobbed out : oh , what are you asking me , papa ?
and yet there is something else - some of us fear it at moments which seem to us criminal , but others quite frankly and steadily - something we fear more than german defeat , and that is german victory
here , i will give you a simple antiseptic—it may do you good , and she took a small packet out of the leather bag that hung from her girdle
he had a view of the square , the medixval city hall , the gothic marienkirche , whose domed towers were connected by a sort of bridge of sighs ; the separate red tower , a very re- markable structure , also in gothic style ; the statue of roland and the bronze statue of handel
horrible , he said suddenly , and a visible shudder ran over him as he got up
there is so much building , and the suburbs are spreading out , and we are able to have good streets and restore the old monuments out of our great period
he talks of youth con- descendingly too , as though he were not young himself ; as though he were incapable of including himself and fitting in ; as far as humility goes he knows very little about it
i hope you will enjoy it , he would finish in a dying voice , and quit the table , well knowing that joy would certainly not be their portion either
one day , after confirmation-class , i heard pastor prinpshpim tell somebody that one must just give me up , be-cause i romp of a derayed family
what i do is to prepare these pages for a time when the conditions for public interest vill be quite different , and certainly much more favour- able ; when curiosity about the details of so thrilling an existence , however well or ill presented , , viii be more eager and less fas- tidious
a tiny hole must be cut in it at once -- there was a peep-hole in the curtain at the theatre
in these forms , said the speaker , the subjective and the coventional assumed a new rela- tionship , conditioned by death
with his eyes red , his moustaches ruffled , his handkerchief in his hand , his coat wide open , hot and beside himself , he went out of the door and slammed it behind him
hans castorp hastened to do so , without looking round
lina , the maid-servant , came running through the hall and burst so suddenly into the room that ida jungmann called out sharply : i say , what do you mean -- ?
he has to content hirdself with deutsch-and that is a jewish nane , oh la , la
it was in high sum-
then thank ye kindly , and god be with ye , he said—the tears came to his eyes as he smiled and with that he would have been off , but instead sat suddenly down again with his hat and stick in his hand , being forced to the realization that his knees would not support him
do you still remember ?
our best respects to you , buddenbrook -- i repeat , our best respects !
there is no contradiction
but precisely about human- ity did schleppfuss speak , just that - of course in the sense of the classic centuries of belief on whose spiritual constitution he based his psychological discussion
all these raga-muffinly tricks tony buddenbrook was guilty of -- indeed , she seemed to perform them with the best conscience in the world
where are the young folk off to ?
even clara burst out laughing
i never can understand how anybody can not smoke—it deprives a man of the best part of life , so to speak—or at least of a first-class pleasure
the italian went on , without pausing for breath
the longest period of separation followed thereupon : the years when after a short stay in munich he was in italy with his friend the silesian schildknapp
hans castorp , laying aside traditional reserve , lightly touched with his lips the icy forehead of that which once was joachim ; and though conscious still of mistrustful sentiments toward the man behind the scenes , yet submissively followed louisa ziemssen from the room
the consul listened as long as he could
you under-stand -- the thing is this : in short , they have reached a point where hagenstrom demands immediate arrest or else a bond of twenty-five thousand marks
i must tell you of them when i see you ; otherwise i should kill myself writing
this it was which lent freemasonry a new brilliance and charm , and explains the great number of recruits to it at that period of its history
probably he would have loved her much more passionately with the fish-tail she was born with than with those extremely painful legs
his voice , when he greeted gerda buddenbrook , was low and hollow , as though a bite were stuck in his throat : good morning , honoured lady !
there were those who wanted to make him healthy , to make him go back to nature , when , the truth was , he never had been natural
settembrini doesn ’ t care for her , and certainly she has her unpleasant side
the concerts will suffer a decided loss of personal appeal
he was much drawn to his uncle , even in the first two weeks ; b ) t the rime i got there it was plain that he clung espe- cially to adrian and wanted to be with him
the room lay in yellow daylight that came in thrnugii the striped blind
hans castorp had the more ground for horror , in that he himself fell a temporary victim to the plague—was , indeed , one of the severest cases
some navvies ' , in the service of the consul , took off their caps
the content of his dream entirely changed , and he stood trying to shoulder settembrini away from the spot where they stood , the italian smiling in his subtle , mocking way , under the full , upward-curving moustaches—and it was precisely this smile which hans castorp found so injurious
you are fond of anecdote—i could serve your turn
but had he suspected in what direction leo naphta would have altered his intentions beforehand , or at the decisive moment , not even the prevailing temper , of which all this was the outcome , could have driven him to let the affair go on
he sat with his brother on the back seat of the high , ungainly old coach , one short leg crossed over the other -- and , wonderful to relate , he was gentle and conciliatory
i write it down in a mood of self-defence ; and another emotion seizes me : the memory of that pandemonium of laughter , of hell- ish merriment which , brief but horrible , forms the end of the first part of the apocalypse
he sat in the dining-hall with the seven tables when there came a great crashing of glass as the verandah door banged , and madame chauchat entered in a white sweater , one hand in her pocket , the other at the back of her head
the head was roguishly on a side , the still open lips wreathed in wickedly suggestive smiles , the sybaritic little dimple appeared in one cheek—he was again the dancing priest , and jerked his head as before , mockingly , in the direction of so much cerebration , as they heard him say : ah , yes , yes , absolutely !
wehsal all at once began to weep bitterly , from some unplumbed depth of wretchedness
so much of our hans ’ s table-mates
nothing can come of me , that is perfectly sure
twilight was falling as they came up to the ocean temple , for the autumn was far advanced
the rest is not my affair
they will precisely fit the fact if i say that your way of misleading unsettled youth , of dissipating and undermining his moral and intellectual powers , is infamous , and can not receive a stronger chastisement than it merits
then quiet again -- and suspense
frau permaneder stood there , very erect , her shoul-ders elevated , her black-bordered handkerchief between her folded hands ; and her pride in the chief role which it fell to her lot to perform was so great as sometimes entirely to ob-scure her grief
that is what i would call 'strict composition
for the present , she repeated , running her tongue over her upper lip
i an looking , he wrote to me , i keep asking round about and hankering for news of a place bur- ied from and untroubled by the \\rorld , , vhere i could hold speech alone , with my life , my destiny
whether there were people going driving ( certain expeditions had in fact been undertaken , among others by the half-lung club , which had gone in a body to clavadel )
as for the plate , its far greater antiquity could be read on the inside : the date was engraved there in ornamental figures , framed in curly engraved lines executed in the modern manner of the period , florid and capricious devices and arabesques that were something between star and flower
who , deuce take it , had all that time to waste ?
i am damned , and there is no pity for me for that i destroy all and every beforehand by speculation
i doubt if it is a question of sheer chance
as i said , for days they might keep the child from him , be- cause he was busy , or perhaps a headache shut him away in si- lence and darkness
he received his piece of money with gratitude , none the less
the humanist was put out
one of them , rooted in the steep bank at the side of the torrent , thrust itself aslant into the picture , with bizarre effect
val quarters in the cathedral were a good half of the time taken up with talks on philosophy and poetry
scientific exactitude forbade them to think of any such arbitrary going in and out
it was a mystery how much good and nourishing food that poor clothilde could absorb daily without any result whatever !
it would not be hard to imagine the existence of creatures , perhaps upon smaller planets than ours , practising a miniature time-economy , in whose brief span the brisk tripping gait of our second-hand would possess the tenacious spatial economy of our hand that marks the hours
from early on we had an eye on you , on your quick , arrogant head , your mighty ingenium and
there was a dull taste in her mouth , and she felt so weak that she made no effort to dry the slow , hot tears that kept rising every minute
at length , as no one else seemed able to settle , hans castorp , with his finger on the glass , supporting his cheek on his fist , said he would like to know what was to be the actual length of his stay up here , instead of the three weeks originally fixed
peeperkorn ’ s gestures were conclusive , peremptory
there is something so awfully sprightly about him !
he was standing with his sleeves pushed back before the roomy wash-hand-basin , the taps of which shone in the electric light , and gave hardly a glance at the white metal bed with its fresh coverlet
that was hard for all concerned ; the gentlemen could understand how hard it was , for one who came from cultured surroundings and had the delicacy of feeling of the upper classes
the inclu- sion of expression in the general appeasement is the innermost principle of musical pretence
the condition is as regular as it is pathetic , this forgetful , credulous self-deception , that attacks even masculine spirits at the hour when the lethal process nears its culmination
it came from the fact that in his neighbourhood steril-
never in all his life had hans castorp heard the word uttered so many times on end as he was hearing it now
hanno gentled , tamed , and en-nobled kai , who loved him tenderly , admired his white hands , and , for his sake , let ida jungmann wash his own with soap and a nail-brush
but the ruling powers , in their penuriousness , had the fire go out directly it stopped snowing—an idiotic rule , an insult to human intelligence
they avoided each other , and for weeks exchanged not a single word
would be a thousand pities if one did not do everything to open to this young scholar the way to the heights of knowledge
the young man set to work in his loggia , clad in one of the light summer suits he had brought up with him when he came—another sign that his first year was rounding out its course
inez 's consent , however , which she - on psycho- logical or shall i say material grounds , that is to say for common- sense reasons - had always been more or less ready to give , had been the readier because clarissa , toward the end of the previous year , had left munich and entered on her first engagement in celle on the aller , so that her sister was left alone with a mother of , vhose bohemian leanings , tame as they , vere , she disapproved
dh , you wait ; i sha not come short
the old lady trembled and locked out of the window whenever she heard a wagon
slept right well , did you ?
did i not knovv , like her , that shudder at the spiritual vacuity which reigned in the average gathering , in glaring contrast to the fever- ish excitement induced by the wine , the music , and the under- currents of human relations ?
that is no reproach , tony , the consul said sternly
yesterday we had sorrel and currants , but i wish i had not , for permaneder objected so much to the sorrel -- he picked the currants out with a fork -- that he would not speak to me the whole afternoon , but just growled ; and i can tell you , mother , that life is not so easy
institoris might assert that only human beings with strong and brutal in- stincts could create great works ; and inez would protes
he now prescribed l { arlsbad effervescent salts and a diet of the smallest possible volume , so that the fare consisted of ahnost nothing but tender meat
i do not see why you fail to recognize that
elsbeth spoke to her son , in the still melodious voice which all her life long she had refrained from song
was it to her , tony buddenbrook , that all this was happening ?
but that ’ s all worth hearing
yes , my dear sir !
he had not heeded the silent entry of the tenth month , but he was arrested by its appeal to the senses , this glowing heat that concealed the frost within and beneath it
the czech wenzel , who had introduced an enlivening variation by closing the gramophone and striking up very expertly on his guitar , laid that instrument aside
in adrian 's place - but there is really no sense in putting myself in his place ; i would not have tolerated some of the things rudi said
it was eleven o'clock in the morning
this style , this technique , he said , admitted no note , not one , which did not fulfil its thematic function in the whole struc- ture - there was no longer any free note
we hadn ’ t mentioned it
he sat now with his lips closed , his hands folded in his lap , one leg in its check trouser flung over the other , slightly swinging the foot , which he regarded with an austere expression
the consul read it , letting the long ends of his moustache run through his fingers
lieutenant joachim , laughing and excited , burst upon his cousin in the evening rest-cure
popinet had had nightmares again last night -- ah , quel horreur !
it came to pass that he heard from her own lips the tragic formula ; and being forearmed , preserved a suitable demeanour and was satisfied with himself afterwards
they fell out , exasperation on religious and philosophical grounds ensued and grew more and more embittered ; the upright cleric had everything to endure from the irritability , captiousness , scepticism , and cutting dialectic of young leo
for his part , indeed , he had an enig- matic smile on his lips , a smile that vas far from confirming me as his representative
indeed , to give expression to all that we suspect or divine , we think it not unlikely that hans castorp hearkened to herr settembrini ’ s discourse in order to get from his own conscience an indulgence which otherwise might not have been forthcoming
they passed along the row of tables , the hofrat letting fall a pleasantry at nearly every one , till a wave of merriment followed in his wake ; and so down the steps among the young folk , the female element of which straightway trooped up sidling and becking about dr krokowski , while the hofrat honoured the sabbath by performing a stunt with his bootlaces before the gentlemen ’ s eyes
his hat rolled a little way off down the road ; his fur coat was wet with mud and slush ; his hands , in their white kid gloves , lay outstretched in a puddle
will you have some wine ?
dh , probably not , the consul said thoughtfully , not ad-dressing anybody in particular
but you do not blame me -- ?
very early , and in close correspondence with his own averageness , the philis- tine established his personal standards of reasonable behaviour
yes , uncle justus , i thought it was better
herr permaneder let the chance slip and confined himself to laying the blame on herr criinlich , with such violence that his very chin-whiskers bristled
his nose sat like a tiny flat button in his face , his rheek-bones stood out , and his grey eyes , usually drawn close together and blinking about rather stupidly , could at certain moments widen quite extraordinarily , and get larger and larger , pro-truding more and more until they almost sprang out of their sockets
but after all , it seemed , the physician had nothing particular in mind when he asked the question
what is to happen now ?
while i stood profoundly moved at the door
the town was a bishopric in the tenth century , and again from the beginning of the twelfth to the fourteenth
more than that , the news should be to you no news
a violent gust of wind whistled between the houses , lashed the window-panes with rain , and howled down the chimney
and then where can we go ?
he shook his head , and pointed several times with violence toward the ground
you are right , ida
the situation is not quite clear ; for the dilatory muscles which are presumably set in action by the vasomotor nerves haven ’ t yet been demonstrated in relation to the blood-vessels
here i lie ; can you find it in your heart to say to me : ' i despise you -- i am leaving you ' ?
the possibility of—of a twenty-ninth of february could only be ascribed to feminine receptivity on the basis of the man ’ s choice already made
it is a regular death-bed , a common death-bed
these are conscientious scruples which—
the greeting he had exchanged with clavdia chauchat had overcome the mortifying depression ; it was at bottom the consciousness of this which had lain at the root of hans castorp ’ s gratification
then she went bathing in the lake—it was the beginning of may ; we were having frost at night ; the water was not precisely ice-cold , say a few degrees above
may we set it down on the credit side of hans castorp ’ s account , that he had been strengthened in his vicious time-economy , his baleful traffic with eternity , by seeing that all his cousin ’ s zeal , called doggedness by a certain melancholy blusterer , had but the more surely brought him to a fatal end ?
he took him on business expeditions down to the harbour and let him stand by on the quay while he spoke to the dockers in a mixture of danish and dialect or gave orders to the men who with hollow , long-drawn cries were hauling up the sacks to the granary floor
but in the evening—ah , in the evening there were festivities in the hall and the reception-rooms , in the course of which—but we alone know to what , thanks to hans castorp ’ s enterprising spirit , these carnival gaieties led up in their course ; and we do not mean to let our knowledge betray us into indiscretion
from the alphabet to syntax and grammar , from the progression of numbers and the first rules to the rule of three and simple sums in proportion , from the memorizing of little poems ( and there was no memorizing , the verses were straight- way and with the utmost precision grasped and possessed ) to the written setting down of his own train of thought on themes out of the geography - it was always the same : adrian gave it his ear , then turned round with an air that seemed to say : yes , good , so much is clear , all right , go on !
yes , of course , hans castorp said
poor little show-window , in which only a few pots of onions stood on a green glass slab
he continued and said :
but was-servogel grunted louder than ever , and a handful of peas went rattling against the window and bounced back into the room
i can still hear you say it , and i thought then that you were right , for i was elected senator , and was fortunate in my business , and this house seemed to spring up out of the ground
of course , it is probably immoral of me that i can not very well attend to what you say to me about morality for being so happy that we are sitting here as we once did , and then never again , even since you came back
one might think so
when frau permaneder opened the dining-room door in passing , to call a good night to her brother in the living-room , she saw that the whole storey was lighted up , and that thomas was walking up and down with his hands behind his back
it may be helpful to you if i tell you that at your age , both in antwerp and bergen , i formed a habit of making myself useful and agreeable to my principals ; and this was of the greatest service to me
five million subscribers , it was calculated , would in the course of twenty years deliver a quantity of old newspaper valued at the enormous sum of million marks ; of which two-thirds might be reckoned off to the new subscriptions , which would thus pay for themselves , the other third , amounting to about a million marks , remaining to be devoted to humanitarian projects , such as financing free establishments for tuberculous patients , encouraging struggling talent , and so on
it will be perfect , she said
she was a thick-set country-bred creature , with coarse lips and fat red cheeks
thomas was not in the mood to think about it
then he suddenly felt the blood rushing to his face as he recalled another memory , from farther back in the past
he wears a black coat -- an old one of the consul 's -- greased leather top-boots , and a blue woollen scarf round his neck
perhaps i am not masculine at all—certainly i am not in the sense which i tend to call social , i don ’ t exactly know why
it is comprehensible that johann buddenbr oak 's first im-pulse was to refuse his son-in-law any considerable payment
your cousin ’ s a different sort , quite another pair of shoes
and he held your brother by the coat and begged to be allowed to stop at home -- dh , my brother took him , did he ? -- yea , that is a hard moment , ida
he burst out laughing , in a high , half-smothered titter , in his glee at being able to make fun of the catechism
doctor gieseke , said tony
it was like the bursting of a dam -- an assertion of desperate integrity ; something elemen-tal , a force of nature , that brooked no restraint
and he consented to be present at a spiritualistic sitting , a tabletipping , glass-moving game which they had determined to undertake with ellen brand , behind dr krokowski ’ s back , and in defiance of his jealous prohibition
but that was no proper uniform he wore
you are certainly right about that , tom , said frau permaneder , letting fall her work and looking at her brother sidewise , past her glasses but not through them
he could see nothing , but he struggled , he came forward
the beech groves came in sight
he only laughed scornfully as he went off , and in a few minutes returned with the revolver in his hand
said frau gr� , folding her ffands in her lap and gazing up at the ceiling
and even with the first rumour of the old man 's death , the great question had at once sprung up : who was to succeed him ?
and his heart began to thump
he sat up and lighted the bedside candle
it was my duty , my friend , replied the consul
as for adrian , he answered in the negative the question put by the viennese
on the evening when i first had the pleasure of making your acquaintance , he said , beginning in a singsong tone , and letting his voice fall at the end , as though embarked on a long recitative , we had a little celebration , sat very late eating and drinking and making merry , and then , in an elevated mood , of spirit free and unrestrained , arm in arm we sought our beds
of the scandalous courses of that royal personage the whole neighbourhood still talked ; but rhadamanthus had shut his eye—both eyes , in fact—and behaved every inch a hofrat
the entresol has three rooms , he explained -- the breakfast-room , my parents ' sleeping-chamber , and a third room which is seldom used
they went down after tea to the basement for the monthly examination
the lively old maid was also invited to meng street on occasion to partake of a haunch of venison or a stuffed goose
they all thought for a while of this strange thing , and then suddenly frau permaneder burst into tears
and all of them , even herr settembrini , felt how fortunate it was that they had come in two sleighs

in- vitations were declined by the faithful landlady on the telephone , or even remained unansvvered
but we are not indulging in flights of fancy
there are impressions which , unimportant as they seem to the reason , work on in the subconscious mind and there exercise a decisive influence
christian would by himself never have found out the book ; but he was impressionable and accessible to every influence ; so he also read it , found it wonderful , and described his reactions with all possible de-tail
frau permaneder quickly looked him over and summed him up
one particular dream , however , hans castorp dreamed twice over during the night , both times in precisely the same form , the second time toward morning
the chances and changes of life itself would have called up in them no other reaction
he would open his eyes and look with eager pleasure at the old-fashioned furniture of the cleanly little room
in the long vacation of and still from kaisersaschern , i , with my young bride , visited adrian and schildknapp in the nest they had found in thr sabine hills
you know , betsy , there is another thing i ca not emphasize often enough : in these last years we have not been doing any too brilliantly
how would it be if we were to go out and take a little walk ?
why that particular one ?
you are right , young man , or , rather , you mean it well
again , how involved were the relations between the various members of our group !
dh , tom , i do not feel much like chatting pleasantly about trifles !
hanno sat still a moment , his rhin on his breast , his hands in his lap
he wore his sinewy throat uncovered and had no love for city clothes , which did not suit his looks , particularly not his hands , those powerful , browned and parched , rather freckled hands , one of which grasped the crook of his stick when he went into the vil- lage to town meeting
and now came on , as come it must , what hans castorp had never thought to experience : the winter of the place , the winter of these high altitudes
for liars and lickspittles mixed us a poison draught and took away our senses
white blood-corpuscles were attracted to the seat of the evil ; the breakingdown proceeded apace ; and meanwhile the soluble toxins released by the bacteria had already poisoned the nerve-centres , the entire organization was in a state of high fever , and staggered—so to speak with heaving bosom—toward dissolution
he is hardly even a relative !
but why do i talk so much about elegant society and its itches ?
as though circumstances which to herr albin were but an opportunity to enjoy the boundless advantages of shame , were to the young officer a source of chagrin and self-contempt
his father strongly reprehended them
well , young un , i must get on
i would not even suppress my suspicion , held on psychological grounds , that i actually seek digressions and cir- cumlocutions , or at least welcome with alacrity any occasion for such , because i am afraid of what is coming
see you at breakfast !
but frau permanrder was not listening
but their conviction , endorsed by the governing power of the state , had shattered his selfesteem to such a degree that he could not look anybody in the face
dull-eyed and breathless , he stood at the table , collected his despairing senses with a jerk , and began to put together the books he was likely to need to-day , murmuring in an anguished voice : religion , latin , chenb istry , and shuffling together the wretched ink-spotted papei volumes
of course i made no use of the medical attendance , he said , but that was my own affair
he rubbed one hand over the piano 's polished surface , gave a shy look at the company , and , somewhat emboldened by the gentle looks of grand-mamma and aunt tony , brought out , in a low , almost a hard voice : the shepherd 's sunday hymn , by uhlanj
then he too stood and wept , tears ran down his cheeks , like those that had smarted the skin of the english officer of marines : those clear drops flowing in such bitter abundance every hour of our day all over our world , till in sheer poetic justice we have named the earth we live in after them ; that alkaline , salty gland-secretion , which is pressed from our system by the nervous stress of acute pain , whether physical or mental
young and good-looking , according to all accounts , the schoolmistress answered ; she could not say from her own observation
herr settembrini , i am only a student as yet , i am just beginning
also there was active in halle at that time an outstanding latinist , i-ieinrich osiander , at whose feet i ardently desired to sit ; and more than that , as i heard from adrian , the course in church history given by professor hans kegel , dd , included an extraordinary amount of material for a student of profane history , which i wished to avail myself of , as i intended to elect history as my subsidiary course
but if the method is beyond him , if he has not enough gift , he will learn absolutely nothing
so far as it came into practical consideration with him , it was regulated by a healthy sense of the fitness of things , which made him as little likely to discuss it as he was to talk about other functional indecencies of which we are all aware , by which our life is conditioned , but on the subject of which we yet preserve bienséance
but there is little or nothing else im-ported
i would just as lief quit , said christian
he took leave of joachim in a spirit of enterprise , when his cousin addressed himself , after breakfast , to the usual round as far as the bench by the watercourse ; then , swinging his walking-stick , he took his own way down the road
he saw what i was looking at and took away the slip of paper with fie on a gentleman and brother !
these announcements were no sooner sent out than the old man refused to set foot in the office ; and his apathy so in-creased that it took only the most trifling cold to send him to bed , one march day two months after the death of his wife
there is a female arm , you can tell by its delicacy
for , after all , three weeks , twenty-one days , is a considerable stretch of time , too long , at least , for one to see the end at the beginning
if hans castorp was aware of these sentiments they could hardly escape his charmer ’ s feminine intuition
or else , not very differently from the pastor : ah , dear little one , little blessed one !
hans castorp sometimes pondered over the literary things the italian had said about illness and despair—which he had found incomprehensible , or at least pretended to himself to find them so
it turned out that this woman had been present , mingling unobtrusively in the audience wherever people had been bold enough to perform any of adri- an 's music : in lubeck , at the much-ridiculed premiere of his opera ; in zurich , in weimar , in prague
everything went according to custom and arrangement , tony brought out a hearty yes , and herr gr� gave his little ahem , beforehand , to clear his throat
i made use of the very evident stimulus of your presence to stir him up to the point of saying his last word on a certain subject
he made a face as if he were on the bourse and somebody had made him a doubtful proposition
the metal casket was hermetically sealed and covered with flowers , the candles burned in their silver holders , the house filled with people , and , surrounded by mourners from near and far , pastor pringsheim stood at the head of the coffin in upright majesty , his impressive head resting upon his ruff as on a dish
we amount to something even without the 'senator
sometimes i find christian a little strange , said madame griinliuh to her brother thomas ,
sold me time too , four and twenty years , boundless to the eye , and promised too great things and much fire under the cauldron , to the end that not withstanding i should be capable of the work although it were too hard and my head too shrewd and mocking thereto
but to the cousins ludovico settembrini talked of himself and his early life ; whether on the walks they took together , or during the evening in the salon , or perhaps , in the dining-room itself , after a meal , when most of the patients had left and the three sat together at their end of the table , while the waitresses cleared away and hans castorp smoked his maria mancini , which in the third week had regained a little of its savour
all went as before
even christian was disinclined to talk or joke
and your cousin , monsieur ?
to say good-bye to adrian , whose personal detachment from the whole scene was the most understandable thing in the world to me , i went out to pfeiffering , whence the son of the house , gereon , had already departed with several horses far his base
there would be no tread upon the ceiling , not even a chair would move -- simply a soundless , speechless , deceiving , secret silence

dr faustus a folio bearing the name of hippocrates
hans castorp thrust out his head among ten others , filling the little open windowframe
he paused at the window and looked out into the early dusk
but she took it up in earnest , whereupon he considered the matter seriously and agreed to make a trial
her face expressed nothing but ill-nature and ignorance
what human beings have fought for and stormed citadels , what the ecstatics exultantly an- nounced - that is not to be
but his son did not meet his glance : the long , gold-brown laches lay deep , deep upon the delicate bluish shadows beneath his eyes
our desires and our performance are conditioned by certain needs of our nervous systems which are very hard to define in words
we must be forbearing ; yet in these things a frivolous feeling of fascination is very much to be regretted
you only need to touch the blade ; it goes into your flesh like cutting butter
der kleine herr friedemann [ little herr friedemann ]
leave me , my son
herr ballerstedt had left the room , and his place was taken by a small , weak enervated little man who stood straight and severe on the platform
he must thus have made the discovery that music afforded possibilities for the extension and realization of the kingdom of the spirit , in a way of which young herr ludwig never dreamed
imagine your not seeing that at all
asked herr settembrini , strolling up to the cousins ’ table , toothpick in mouth
it is the row that goes beforehand that i hate !
you would be obliging me very much by this friendly serv- ice , he ended , with a curious formality
your diviningrod twitches , and knocks
his uncle , nikolaus leverklihn , his father 's brother , a respected citizen of kaisersaschern , de- clared himself ready to receive the lad into his house
tony was naturally often in the society of her town friends , or drawn into some assembly or boating party
he stood at the bedside between his sister and his sister-in-law ; with his bald head , his sunken cheeks , his drooping moustaches , and his huge beaked nose , he stood there on his bertt legs , looking a little like an interrogation-point , and gazed with his little round deep eyes into his brother 's face , as it lay so silent , so cold , so detached and inaccessible
the marriage was solemnized in the columned hall , as on that other occasion when it was frau criinlirh who wore the myrtle
here i break off , chagrined by a sense of my artistic shortcom- ings and lack of self-control
he had heard the news of the sen-ator 's stroke in the club , which he had left at once
he pretended hardly to have read it
our young man was sitting on a painted garden chair , with his back against the wall , talking with his cousin , whom he had forced , against his will , to come outside ; in front of him ; by the balustrade , frau chauchat stood smoking with her table-mates
and now i must go ; please excuse me -- i am busy -- but herr gr� stood in front of her
or you always hear about it soon enough !
or else you are not worthy the friendship he feels for you
'you are conversing ' -- when we were not at all
i see you know your own mind , and so much is certainly true , that it is your affair and not mine
he is no beau , god knows
these temporary gains had been confirmed in possession , in union ; in so far as possession and union were possible in duality , in so far as a broodilg femininity could secure them
it almost seemed as if the laugh were at his expense , as if they were laughing at him
but to get this one expressed , one could only say straight out that pieter peeperkorn , with his kingly mask , and bitter , irregular mouth , was both , now this , now that ; both seemed to fit him and to neutralize each other when one looked at him—both this and that , the one and the other
and that story about the girl that went bathing in the lake , the one they gave the silent sister ’ to take her temperature with—i have often laughed at it , all by myself
this , of course , was after second breakfast , for otherwise the daily programme left no time sufficient to go down into the platz
last night it was almost °—that was your arrival
in the distance they could see the rigging of a ship
there was no troop of poor retainers to receive shoes and woollen underwear , and there were no choir-boys , when they assembled in fishers ' lane on the twenty-fourth
i\iust not my hand tremble , must i not feel cold in the pit of my
he even said the divel 's sow , the pope , and was in every way an intolerable boor , although a great man
but , of course , both times the men were to blame !
now there was no doubt at all that , despite reminders from his mother , he connected vvith my appearance no memories whatever
she had gone with her husband and children to most of the large din-ners given in the town , and presided no whit less elegantly than her daughter-in-law when the buddenbrooks themselves entertained
fourteenth century , answered naphta
for to be man was to be ailing
madame , my companion , has no great opinion of him—you may have seen
the tapestries in this room had a sky-blue background , against which , between slender columns , white figures of gods and goddesses stood out with plastic effect
it can not last long
pfiihl , she would say , be reasonable , take the thing calmly
how it strengthened my devotion to him , mingling , vith it - can one understand why ?
he went on to speak of the lymphatic tubes and absorbent vessels ; described the secretion of the breast milk , which collected lymph from legs , abdomen , and breast , one arm , and one side of the head ; described the very delicately constructed filters called lymphatic glands which were placed at certain points in the lymphatic system , in the neck , the arm-pit , and the elbow-joint , the hollow under the knee , and other soft and intimate parts of the body
they are satisfied with the condition of her lung
business man he had been , he was so no more , he was nothing more in the world , but he was still an anti-semite
let us leave out the formalities , said the consul
if father could only see this -- it is just dreadful that he can not !
there are shops and people , and one can buy what one needs
yes , it is—and its charm lies in its very abandon
that devil on two sticks in there has handed mine out to me already , herr settembrini said , and carried his hand to the side pocket of the inevitable pilot coat
deep creases furrowed his blond brows , and his face was contorted as he turned to reply to his neighbour
the position of the sun was hard to recognize , veiled as it was in haze
how is he ? -- god wo not let the worst happen , i know
they had been considering fiissen and neu-schwanstein
he : alas , no , i regret not to be able to gratify you
and thus , in the tumult , in the rain , in the dusk , vanishes out ot our sight
with the facile curiosity of inquiring youth on its travels , he had studied this new demon , yes , had even discovered in himself an alarming aptitude , in common with the rest of the world up here , to pay him extensive homage
anyhow , he , rudolf , had no reason to be sympathetic , fur rudiger had been rather rude to him
in a word , he took the approaching visit with utter composure ; announced it to hofrat behrens and the management , engaged a room—joachim ’ s , it being still vacant—and on the next day but one , at the hour of his own arrival , towards eight o ’ clock—it was already dark—drove in the same uncomfortable vehicle in which he had seen joachim off , down to station dorf , to meet the envoy from the flat-land , who had come to spy out the land
but i only happened to mention it
they are now approach- ing the centre of berlin
i am on my way to brecht
after twenty paces he felt nauseated
said thomas buddenbrook , almost aloud , and buddenbrook felt his breast shaken with inward sobs
for i have dreamed it out to the end , i have come to my goal
the little town of waldshut , devoid of interest or charm , lies on the garmisch-partenl { irchen line , an hour from munich
but we must not suppose that he consciously practised on his uncle with the strange properties of the place
she clamoured , do you know me ?
it would be a good thing if you would open the window on your side , said herr kroger
he nodded as he did so , not with his head but with his whole torso , and said between his teeth : si , si , si , like herr settembrini
and , apropos : your sister needs rest , especially at night , and mamsell severin has not time to give her all the rest she needs
speak more low , he begged , whispering to show them how
is it not playne to you that the conscious speculation on the charm which great guilt exercises on goodness makes the act of mercy to the utter- most unpossible to it ?
the homeward journey was a quiet one , if only out of respect for the slumbering tantchen
even she , she assured them , had been only temporarily affected , only a slight and superficial case , when she was quite a young girl
as he finished , joachim would return , and it might be as late as half past two before the latter went into his loggia , and the hush of the main rest period fell upon the berghof
you came back to me with him ?
ferge professed his respect for the choke-pear , and the whole silent activity
after which he had to listen , with a mixture of enjoyment and impatience , to a rejoinder from herr coach , which lasted some two hours , during which the broker sounded , as it were , all the registers of his character
she was filled with reverence for herself : the familiar feeling of personal importance possessed her , heightened by all she had been reading : she felt thrilled and shuddery
he was dressed in an open frock-coat of soft grey material , which he habitually settled at the waist with his short-fingered , wrinkled hand
for hans castorp loved like music the sound of rushing water—perhaps he loved it even more
and finally he gave it all up -- he left it all to god
business ability is one thing -- but it is not everything
of course he had brought flo , vers
her first conversation with adrian had been a gratifying
he was and remained her attached friend for many years
what a way is that to address a lady whom one hardly knows !
of course , it hurt , and the involun-tary answer was the right one -- look !
all this is the sheerest commonplace ; but the commonplace becomes remarkable when it springs from remarkable soil
the little man rounded his r 's on his tongue ; he paused between syllables ; he accompanied his words , in a way i have never seen before in a child , with vague but expressive explana- tory ges
but the frau consul made more demands upon herself than upon her children
was it as certain , then , as it had seemed to him yesterday that he would be called up in latin and chemistry ?
then he began to play again , but broke off suddenly and became serious , as though a mask had fallen over his features
i grieve to have incurred your displeasure
from the middle of the ceiling hung the well-cut model of a ship under full sail
joachim paid scant honour to the meal
contrary to what you say , your system seems to me more calculated to dissolve human reason in magic
these chains of trills !
the cement that bound them together was - as the reader is already prepared to hear - morphine
i\any found it chilling , even repellent and revolting , and these were the better , if not the
yes , he nodded , with a certain amazed recognition , he is pretty far along
hans castorp did not know this—or rather , he did not know that joachim knew it ; as for himself , he knew it well enough , did this venturesome spirit , this delicate nursling of life , this schoolmaster ’ s plague !
only that one winter , after his re- turn from italy , did i live at any distance from him , for at easter i had got my position at the freising academy , our family 's catholic connection being useful in this respect
i fainted ; i had three faintingfits one after the other , a green , a brown , and a violet
his opponent , naphta retorted , displayed no lack of the same qualities
let us call them the si : lister possibilities of luman nature in general that here colne to light
settembrini looked at him , a melancholy gleam in his dark eye
his early infancy was a struggle for life , and his family was in constant anxiety
you know no end of stories
and thrice he smites , and thrice his blows deal death , before him fly his foes… ’
on the box next the coachman sat the malayan valet , a yellow little man with a fur collar to his overcoat , and a bowler hat
yet he straightway felt her eyes upon him , turned , and gazed so ardently that she smiled and looked away
and what he said was but an expression of the strength of that prevailing temper , whose tool and underling herr settembrini ’ s fine understanding had become
we all know them ; their emotional inanity ran true to type
but herr hofrat , how long do you mean that i— ?
when they were joined by a k ferge and wehsal , which often happened , they formed a group of six , and before this considerable audience the two opposed spirits carried on an endless duel , which we could not reproduce in any fullness without losing ourselves , as it did daily , in an infinitude of despair
this , he said , was a priceless evening , so festive , so out of the ordinary
nearly as bad as in , the year of the great flood in st petersburg
the dining-room was nearly full , though the winter season did not actually begin until october
the bed curtains were flung back , the down quilt was underneath her back , and a medicine bottle stood on the night-table
it dught not to be possible for me to have such a thought in my mind , i know ; but you leave me nothing else to think , tony
he advocated the bringing of light into the unconscious mind and explained how the abnormality was metamorphosed into the conscious emotion ; he urged them to have confidence ; he promised relief
for it is in accordance with these laws that time seems to us just as long , or just as short , that it expands or contracts precisely in the way , and to the extent , that it did for young hans castorp , our hero , whom our narrative now finds visited with such an unexpected blow from the hand of fate
so much is certain , that we have been up here years
oh , said joachim , i hear it every day , you don ’ t need to describe it to me
for despite his keepsake , the macabre trophy he wore next his heart , he leaned upon herr settembrini , set great store by his character and opinions ; and the thought of being cast off would have weighed upon his spirit more heavily than that remembered boyish feeling of being left behind at school and not counting any more , of enjoying , like herr albin , the boundless advantages of his shameful state
and as a matter of fact—i say taking it just as a matter of fact , he repeated , pressing his forefinger so hard against his nose that he bent the end of it quite round , it is motion , isn ’ t it , motion in space ?
kai 's face burned , and he cast down his eyes
but about death—no one who came back from it could tell you anything , because we don ’ t realize it
a walk followed , to warm oneself up , along the beach to sea-gull rock or ocean temple , a little lunch by the beach-chair ; then the time came to go up to one 's room for an hour 's rest , before making a toilette for the table-d'hote
in actual fact i have sometimes pondered ways and means of sending these pages to america , in order that they might first be laid before the public in an english translation
i only had a glimpse of her hat , but it looked frightfully bad taste
virginis , in my peterstrasse , where i found forthwith fresh from the station , on the next way into the town , fitting lodging and accommodation
un po ’ di ragione sa !
the frau consul mentioned the disastrous fire which had swept hamburg in may of the year
and it was nothing but his own inward weakness and despair that broke out in this scene before mother and sister
the provocation to vice proceeding from the sacrosanct was the essential thing about it , it was the thing itself , betrayed for instance in the characterization by apostates of the virgin as the fat woman , or by extraordinarily vulgar interpolations , abominable filthinesses , which the devil made them mutter to themselves at the celebration of the \ ass
consul bud-denbrook stood with his hands in his trousers pockets and listened to their footsteps as they died away down the empty , damp , dimly-lighted street
i perceive that freemasonry has something quite military and jesuitical about it
prospects that made the heart of young hans castorp leap and contract , yet without actually issuing in action ; for against their doing so lay certain obstacles of a nature partly military , partly civil
but all this confusion must be reconciled ; and if you don ’ t think so , why then you are dividing the world up into two hostile camps , which , i may tell you , is a grievous error , most reprehensible
i had to laugh , in all my frozenness , at his metamorphosis into the old familiar
nobody could be-l ; rvp it , just living a couple of weeks at piippenrade
between times he had that look , first here and then suddenly there
johann buddenbrook did not even look at him
i listen with involuntary pleasure , young man , to your fluent little phrases
he glanced slantwise upward , and blinked
many of the audience were upset by this , for now they had lost their means of conveyance to the station
again , would the impossible by then have become any more possible ?
the fever was too much for his shaken heart , and in five days , notwithstanding all dr heidekind ’ s care , he died
but v\till that diminish its im- portance , or dim the glory which in private belongs to it ?
then , seeing a new face , she paused and waited , nodding gently as they came up to her ; obviously she found it of importance to learn if the stranger was acquainted with her sad case , and to hear what he would say about it
there were hours when he grew confused , no longer realized his condition , and spoke of an early return to the colours , spoke even of the autumn manœuvres , which he imagined were still going on
it was thursday , the day on which all the members of the family living in town assembled every second week , by esta-blished custom
frau stöhr found his remarks équivoque and unfeeling : she rose under protest to the toast , and as the other tables were being emptied , they followed the general movement toward the drawing-rooms
paper caps were mounted ; they , like the trumpets , were to be had of the concierge
then what lovely apparitions of the springtime revealed themselves !
his charmer came regularly late to meals ; he did the same , with intent to waylay her
despite his scornful repudiation of the idea that he might lie down and be covered up with hexagonal symmetricality , something within him maundered on , sense or no sense : told him that the feeling of duty which bade him fight against insidious sensory appeasements was a purely ethical reaction , representing the sordid bourgeois view of life , irreligion , philistinism ; while the desire , nay , craving , to lie down and rest , whispered him in the guise of a comparison between this storm and a sand-storm on the desert , before which the arab flings himself down and draws his burnous over his head
oh , let us not be indiscreet !
you left it to the drones to make , and rightly
a complicated process , laughed the italian
cried edmund pfiihl , hen edmund pf�he organist of st mary 's , as he strode up and down the salon with great activity , while gerda , smiling , her head on her hand , sat at the piano ; and hanno listened from a big chair , his hands clasped round his knees
when you as madame so-and-so finally vanish into your proper sphere , one is left to sit on the rocks all the rest of one 's life
disquieted by an indefinite something , either emanating from his nephew , or caused by his own unsettlement after the long journey , james looked about him , not able to descry much of the landscape ; he drew in a deep breath of the strange air , exhaled it , and pronounced it magnificent
but you can ’ t call that slight fever , joachim said
at bottom , and boldly confessed , the desire does not exist ; it is a misapprehension precisely as impossible as the thing itself , as we should soon see if nature once let it happen
imagine , my feet are cold all the way up to my knees
so he began to live : brooded over by his father 's reserved tenderness , clothed nnd nurtured under his mother 's watchful eye ; prayed over by aunt antonie , presented with tops and hobby-horses by the frau consul and uncle justus ; and when his charming little perambulator appeared on the streets , it was looked after with interest and expectation
the company had urged anton karlowitsch ferge to regale them with the story of the pleura-shock ; but his tongue was too thick , he could not manage it , and honourably avowed his incapacity , which was greeted by the company as occasion for another drink
the crown broke off , herr senator
i only married you for your uddenbrooks money ; and it was not nearly enough , so you may as well go home
and this kesselmeyer -- he was going to get a shock too
when adrian 's father opened certain books with illustrations in colour of exotic lepidoptera and sea creatures , we looked at
naphta had been listening
times are changing , wenzel , and we have many responsi-bilities toward the new age
dr krokowski stopped with joachim two or three minutes ; then he went on down the row of balconies , and hans castorp heard his cousin say that it was time to get up and make ready for tea
i can explain it to you as we go
i no- tice i begin to forget them ( he was twenty-nine at the time )
she gains the house at the corner of bakers ' street , she rings the alarm-bell at the vestibule-door -- fire , murder , thieves ! -- she shouts at the maid who opens : they are coming , kathrin , they are coming , takes the stairs , and storms into the living-room
so when this young girl -- she was then only twenty -- had come back with his children from a visit to western prussia , as a sort of charity-child , the old man had made his son a scene for the act of piety , in which he spoke hardly anything but french and low german
asked his uncle , letting pass the rest of the child 's metaphorical language
pressed , without effort or break , smooth as though prepared for the press , with faindy ironical turns of phrase ; and he spoke not from the platform but somewhere at one side , half-sitting on the balustrade , the ends of his fingers interlaced in his lap , with the thumbs spread out , and his parted little beard moving up and down
this year the buddenbrooks took no holiday during chris-tian 's and clara 's vacation
the meal was as faultlessly prepared as it was abundant
at that dr krokowski ’ s smile burst forth triumphant ; he shook the young man ’ s hand afresh and cried briskly : well , sleep well , herr castorp , and rejoice in the fullness of your perfect health ; sleep well , and auf wiedersehen !
she screwed up her brown eyes and stood her knife and fork upright on the table and moved them back and forth
his teeth had been particularly bad , and had been the cause of many painful illnesses and difficulties
i did not understand the allu- sion until i recalled that at cracow , in the sixteenth century , courses were publicly given in magic
we have left it to him to describe the unlooked-for guest , and he has not come badly off—we could scarcely add anything essential to the picture
a general chilling of your life and your re- lations to men lies in the nature of things - rather it lies already in your nature ; in feith we lay upon you nothing ne '' '' , the little ones make nothing new and strange out of you , they only ingeni- ously strengthen and exaggerate all that you already arc
he held it toward the light ; it proved to be a photographic negative
for you must know that when a soul is drawn violently to evil , its gaze is ven- omous and like to a basilisk , and chiefly for children
and the bell would soon ring
still , it was in a way a break , the end of one chapter , the beginning of another ; and if he seemed not to be conscious of the fact , i was , with a certain pang , , veil aware of it
the company will excuse me , he said ; i have some work down at the pilot-house
yet during the two and a half days , vhich i once spent with him and adrian at buchel , i observed in her bearing towards the organist a certain reserve and restraint , held in check but not quite done away by her native friendliness
then he went ; but the day after the arrival of the great man , the patient died
she would never be able to write home to announce new ventures and new successes
the meaning of the word varies ?
a piece of gross insubordination
a little mountain air at kreuth , a little seashore at glucksberg or travemiinde -- but they do not seem to work
joachim warmly agreed , as he saw his cousin was in earnest in his desire and his project
the gentlemen on 'change nodded at each other
for the pres-ent i have nothing to add
several times he restlessly shifted his position , even went into the reading-room to listen from there ; then took up his stand close to behrens , with his hands behind his back , and an enigmatic expression on his face , fixing the casket with his eye , and observing the simple operation of it
things any more ; for he had the ark conveyed as the philistines did , by wagon instead of on bearing-poles according to the weil- founded prescript of the pentateuch
it weighed upon her
our relations—or , rather , my relation to her was never the social one ; i can only say of it that its beginnings are shrouded in darkness
good , he answered , and rose
for his cousin to speak to frau chauchat was almost the same as his doing it himself—and yet how altogether different !
but it is not a fit subject for discussion
the school became a state within a state , in which not only the masters but the pupils regarded themselves as officials , whose main concern was the advancement they could make , and who must therefore take care to stand well with the authori-ties
they are also open at the base , of course , and communicate with the excretory duct of the bulb , which runs into the ivory middle part
mes respects , monsieur le professeur
our smallest unit is the month
cher maitre , he began , with a smile , rattling off his speech with a harsh accent but uncommon fluency : comme je suis heureux , comme je suis emu de vous trouver !
that ’ s the practice i ’ ve had , joachim answered , holding the thermometer between his teeth in order to speak
and you , who put such large words to such empty uses , don ’ t forget that you sometimes reproach me for being rhetorical
all hands , it was plain , took pains to observe sunday and distinguish it from the rest of the week , management and guest seconding each other in their efforts to this end
oh , answered joachim , it isn ’ t so out of the question , more ’ s the pity
the dowry of hia oldest daughter , indeed , was gone , and the losses which the firm had suffered in the bremen failure in had been h heavy blow
if god should summon me away ,
she stood upon the threshold , humped and tiny , her old hands clasped before her childish bosom , the green silk cap-ribbons falling over her fragile shoulders
they spent the evening of the twenty-fourth at the senator 's house , without the old krb'gers and without the misses buddenbrook ; for the old children 's day had now ceased to exist , and thomas buddenbrook did not feel like making presents to everybody who used to attend the frau consul 's celrbration
where , in heaven ’ s name , had the holiday gone ?
dr faustus understanding its opposite - at least not before it has been ex- plained to him
the landscape , rather severe and sparse , though brightly sunny , looked like a framed painting as viewed through the arch of the loggia
shaggyhaired goats leaped from ledge to ledge of the rocks , while the young goatherd , wearing perched on his brown curls a little hat with the brim turned up behind , stood watching them from a height , one hand on his hip , the other holding the long staff on which he leaned
he showed us the system of fingering on the clarinet and the seven-holed bas- soon with its twelve closed and four open keys , vvhose sound blends so readily with that of the horns ; instructed us about the compass of the instruments , the way to play them and more such matters
and enjoy , all else excelling ,
his face changed , his molions relaxed
in order to get some reply from the old man he went on to talk about the revolution in lively tones
it had been thought blameworthy , in the germany of that time , to send a boy to school unless he was to be a priest ; and this popular-aristocratic scorn of the literary arts was always the sign of fundamental nobility of soul ; the literary person , true son of humanism and bourgeoisiedom , could always , certainly , read and write—whereas the noble , the soldier , and the people never could , or barely—but he could do and understand nothing else in all the wide world , being nothing but a latinistic windbag , who had power over language , but left life to people who were fit for it
and then covers the corpse with kisses from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head , so that her knights , unpleasantly impressed vith such exaggerated grief , see themselves constrained to tear their sovereign lady away from the dead
that is the last thing in the world i should expect of him , and we can rely on him too in a business way , for i really think he makes a good deal with nappe at the niederpaur brewery
for now he need not feel that it so beat of its own accord , without sense or reason or any reference to his non-corporeal part
his sister stood looking on indulgently : clearly she had ex- pected nothing different , being used to see everyone fall in love with the youngest of the family
i have read that question sonlewhere , i anl not sure precisely where , but in some very prominent place
i know now what you mean
i mean , of course , the ceterum renseo of my dear father : the custams union
i shall stop here , said gerda , and sank with a deep breath into the reclining chair beside one of the beds
he had not failed to cover them
i have not only the old scars that come from my school-days , but the fresh places that give me my fever
adrian seldom failed the afternoon municipal concerts in piazza colonna
but i knew or feared that the till tomorrow would not be adhered to : that after i left he would sit down and work out what had so unsummoned flashed into his mind as we talked
the precision of the characterization showed objectivity and poise ; it dislodged the schoolmistress from her position
fie would not like to have rudolf in- vite them , but rather laid stress on doing it himself , though even so not too directly
as a mature woman who knew life and was no longer a silly innocent , she found herself unable to believe in their irreproachable sanctity
herr gr� looked at him blinking , with unconcealed mistrust
directly the head went out , the guests sat down to cards , the russians occupying , as usual , the small salon
they did so cautiously , for most of them were unmusical , as a tone now and then betrayed
in the adagio the violin sang like an angel ; but gerda took the instrument from her chin with a dissatisfied air , looked at it in irritation , and said it was not in tune
adam weishaupt formed his secret benevolent order entirely upon the model of the society of jesus
but i can not listen— have you my x-ray portrait ?
the bud-denbrook ladies from broad street also came ; and their love of truth compelled them to say , as usual , that erica grim huh was not growing well and that she looked more than ever like her wretched father
thick in the distance , next the wooded slopes , but in the foreground a mere sprinkling at most ; the stretches of discoloured and winter-killed grass were dappled or sprigged with white
the balkan federation will go through , engineer , all the information i receive points that way
what was one day , taken for instance from the moment one sat down to the midday meal to the same moment fourand-twenty hours afterwards ?
it happened quite simply that he had been summoned , one wednesday , from the first rest period , to go down to the basement and be weighed by the bathing-master
suddenly frau permaneder flushed deeply
he had traditions , his name was old and good , they would certainly have to reckon with him one day , as a political factor
dne arm rested nn her father 's knee , the hand hanging down limply
also several gentlemen -- senator mb willendorpf , doctor overdieck , consul kistenmaker , gosch the broker , c f kbppen , and herr marcus in the office , have asked to be remembered
they walked towards the klammerweiher and round its banks
herr modersohn blinked afresh
and tact was needed
my memory preserves pregnant and disquieting images of this time : i see us , the roddes , the knoterichs perhaps , and myself , after a particularly brilliant performance of a tchaikovsky symphony in the zapfenstosser concert hall , standing in the crowd in one of the front rows and applauding
open the window , tilda
whenever it was mentioned , the old frau consul discreetly averted her light eyes
it will be seen that we mean to say everything that may be said in hans castorp ’ s favour , yet without fulsomeness , not making him out as better , or worse , than he was
was he sound again ?
tom talked with the pilot-captain about the wullenwewer , now undergoing re-pairs in the town
let me tell you for the last time that , if you can not bring yourself to recognize the justice of my claims , i shall no longer be able to respect you as a christian , a parent , or a man of business
it was practised by the most civilized nations
go on sleeping , so you will look fresh and pretty
and how many months did the chief knock you down for ?
hen this has to happen
grandfather could command nine hundred thousand marks in his best time ; and we have made great efforts since then , and had successes , and made fine coups here and there
the senator planned to transfer the business offices to his new building , which would , of course , leave empty the ground floor of the house in meng street
hans castorp felt no surprise to see that she was puzzled , even a little put out , by joachim ’ s liveliness , his rapid breathing and headlong talk , which were probably foreign to his manner either at home or on the journey , besides giving the lie to his actual condition
he said : i try to introduce a little logic into the debate , and you answer me with lofty sentiments
in others , the male parent reached with his arm down the gullet of the female to deposit the semen within her ; after which , bitten off and spat out , it ran away by itself upon its fingers , to the confusion of scientists , who for long had given it greek and latin names as an independent form of life
i would like to die , kai !
yes , you can say that because you are a soldier , and your existence is purely formal
he laughed and said again : come along out , it ’ s all right !
and now i hear herr settembrini is a mason !
hotels and pensions , amply equipped with covered verandahs , balconies , and reclining-halls , lay on both sides of their way , also private houses with rooms to let
settembrini listened , and nodded ; nodded after hans castorp had come to an end , for the present , of his pronouncement and fallen silent
but what are you about down here ?
but for me it is too abstract
their glance was unsteady and flickering
there was nothing to them
nobody—he had simply assumed it , with such tranquil certitude as to render absurd the bare idea of not being present , which , accordingly , james hastened to disclaim with a quick certainly , of course , as though anxious to show he had never for a moment considered it
such things ought not to be ; yet one can not wish not to have them
then coming out of the farming region into that of mostly graz- ing land , to follo , v the storied , beech- and pine-covered ridge road , the rennsteig , which , with its view deep down into the werra valley , stretches from the frankenwald to eisenach on the horse !
what spoke in them , what gloriously triumphed in them , was a technique amounting to an ascetic religion , a technique elevated to a lofty sacrament , to an absolute end in itself
oh , mon vieux -- he 's always the same , is not he , betsy ?
and it was of fatherly authority that the young man now felt an uneasy need
her nerves are upset
my brain feels quite dead now
thus must every upright man speak
the happy board did not hesitate to pre- scribe to justice , which had to say the last , vord and pronounce the judgment , the same self-abnegation which they themselves practised
he called it an outrage , frightening harmless strangers like that , piping at them with her pneumothorax !
rather the remarkable and profoundly significant thing was that though the human being , both male and female , was endowed , vith sex , and although the localization of tj : le d
settembrini cried with ardour , and enlarged upon the cult of the word , the art of eloquence , which he called the triumph of the human genius
he went devotedly to early mass , and took part in the sunday service with a fervour which must have been gratifying to his priestly teachers
he came upon them organically , logically , legitimately—that fact can not be overemphasized
what is there in notes themselves , that is altogether new ?
he laid out his little garden after virgil ’ s own plan—and all that he said was sane and beautiful
for a long time hans castorp had silently reckoned with the possibility of an advance from the flat-land , and even been fairly sure what personal shape it would take
from pranzo he stalked off with a sour countenance , down the street at dario 's side to the farmers and philistines , and i stopped by myself
the corridor made a bend at the point where the stairs mounted to the second storey , and then went on to the back stairs , where there was another , a side entrance into the dining-room
naturally , he could not fail here to come into contact with persons suffering from the disability of which he was free ; and so it came to a scene , at which hans castorp was present , and which will serve us as further illustration of our theme
then he flung himself into his chair , and drew out his keepsake , his treasure , that consisted , this time , not of a few reddish-brown shavings , but a thin glass plate , which must be held toward the light to see anything on it
you say nothing save things that are in ine and come out of me but not out of you
even if the act of confession aroused nothing but disgust , and involved great humiliation , still it insured a moment of intimate contact with the beloved object
his eyes were larger than usual and he carried on with her a long and gentle conversation , in the course of which they both stood still , and clara , with a serious , calm voice said her yes
behrens will finally have to make up his mind to the injections , to get rid of my infection ; my temperature sticks at ° to four , five , six , and even seven
oh , please , please not !
he and his wife had a way of taking each other 's side like this , out of sheer politeness
dazed and grievously afflicted i went up into the fatal room
but i may say that almost song for song they follo , ved my own wish and expectations
others had eyeballs projecting on stalks ; probably in order to perceive at the greatest possible distance the faintest gleaill of light meant to lure or warn
voigt has a great deal of taste
ah , what all i have seen in these days ! -- the pinakothek and [ ) the glyptothek and the hofbrauhaus and the court theatre and the churches , and quantities of other things !
of the mediterranean , naples , sicily , he knew nothing
she did well , and thrice well , to chastise as unlawful all unconditioned striving after the pure ’ knowledge of things—such striving , that is , as is without reference to the spiritual , without bearing on man ’ s salvation ; for it is this unconditioned , this a-philosophical natural science that always has led and ever will lead men into darkness
the sen-ator 's bemired clothing hung over a chair
will you have some tea ?
only a few lines remained when the servant came through the garden at four o'clock to call him to dinner
tall and broad , he bent toward his neighbour ; paused and maintained a marvellously expressive silence
it is not to be , goodness , joy , hope , that was not to be , it would be taken back , it must be taken back !
thus she spoke ; and , finishing , sank back exhausted in her chair and stared again out of the window
such an interim form of liv- ing , the entry of city folk , brain workers , into the primitive coun- tryside and back to mother earth , with the knowledge , after all , that we must - or might - soon return to our usual and natu- ral sphere of middle-class comfort : such voluntary screwing down and simplification has easily , almost necessarily something artificial , patronizing , dilettante about it ; of this we were humor- ously aware , and knew too that it was the cause of the good- natured , teasing grin with which many a peasant measured us on our request for his hayloft
not all the snow would melt : on the heights to the south , and on the north in the rocky ravines of the rhatikon , some would still remain , and through the summer months more was sure to fall , though it would scarcely lie
but it was high time he came , in any case , behrens says—well , and since then the mother goes about—whenever she is not sitting with them—and if you speak to her , she just says : tous les deux !
he walked so comme il faut , so much as he had always been ; he greeted people with his wonted courtliness , he set store , as always , by his outward appearance and bienséance—and he belonged to the earth
joachim , who laid deliberate stress on such occasions , had decorated his place with a few flowers ; but there was no great ceremony about the greetings of the other guests , these were almost what they would have been after a separation of three hours instead of three weeks
gerda , sitting with her embroidery or her book , just beyond the portieres , followed the course of the lessons
my thoughts took me far back in our , in his past
for is it mere hypochondria to say to oneself that everything german , even the german mind and spirit , german thought , the german w ord , is involved in this scandalous exposure and made subject to the same distrust ?
let them look , i look with them
curtains , yellow with smoke , hung before the window , on whose panes the rain beat unceasingly
to adrian , spen- gler made clever politenesses about the brentano song cycle , which he had bought and studied at the piano
his nose was of the same shape , above his grizzled moustaches
this oft-repeated phrase set the key for all the running comment with which he accompanied his production of gesture—gesture that by now , in all conscience , had grown more than a little burlesque
he was a better man than herr jonathan or teary trieschke
i flung up my hands , i know , when he came into the management
it seemed to me that he really did drag one foot , but people disputed it ; i could not al- ways be sure of it when i saw him walk , and would rather ascribe my impression to a subconscious association with his name
nobody understood metabolism , nobody understood the true inwardness of the functioning of the nervous system
and the organist began to play
he made a vigorous ges-ture and drew himself more erect than before
it is easy to say that a modem theologian takes him symbolically
i am completely discouraged
but then , to avoid giving pause before a miracle—for life that built itself up out of , and fell in decay into , the same sort of matter as inorganic nature , would have been , happening of itself , miraculous—they were driven to believe in a spontaneous generation—that is , in the emergence of the organic from the inorganic—which was just as much of a miracle
have you made up your mind yet about the material for the wedding-dress , tony ?
in this disk here are the six cartridges
it would not do
well , what do you say to that ?
hans castorp lent him one of his camel ’ shair rugs , in addition to james ’ s own plaid ; he himself found one cover quite enough this fine autumn weather
no one knew the actual point whence it sprang , where it kindled itself
sledges would skid and upset , rolling their riders into the snow—and the onlookers would take photographs of the scene
until another time , then !
you ’ ll have to make that a little clearer
he heard another voice , a deep , cold voice , saying : i ’ ve seen him a long time
one ’ s not allowed to choose one ’ s table-mates—that would lead to goodness knows what !
hans castorp , in his simplicity , would sometimes take part
you know what you must do and what leave undone , and that 's an end of it
get along with you !
it happened that at the table with adrian sat the old schlaginhaufens , jeanette scheurl , schildknapp , my wife and myself
the frau consul answered only with sobs
you spoke of a sphere of practical activity , where you were intending to enter shortly on certain duties
and then holger the spirit began to poetize , and kept it up , copiously , circumstantially , without pausing for thought , for dear knows how long
for my cousin here , it would be unprofessional to discuss politics ; and as for me , i willingly forgo the privilege
then , seriously , if perhaps a little perfunctorily , thank you very much , my dear family
influences from not far off gave him strength
during this exposition , the consul had turned his back on his brother , and stood with his hands in his pockets , describing figures on the floor with his foot
but the enterprise of experimenting on nature , of teasing her into manifestations , tempting her , in the sense of laying bare her , vorkings by experiment ; that all this had quite close relations with witch- craft , yes , belonged in that realm and , vas itself a work of the tempter , such was the conviction of earlier epochs
youthful thirst for adventure , inpatience to be off , were naively mingled with satisfaction at an early re- lease from school
he went upstairs , where fraulein clementine had some luncheon ready for him , washed , and ate
becoming conscious had asserted itself against the world , whether or no the latter had not been quite undecided for recognition
on the ground floor , vas a restaurant , then a piano warehouse ; the doctor 's house occupied part of the upper storey , a porcelain shield with his name on it being downstairs in the lobby
and that was the difference between religion and morality—he was aware that he had put it very badly
but it was just this keeping everybody in ignorance of his mortification , his hatred , his powerlessness , that was so cruelly hard !
you would have to see the minuscule grandezza of his bear- ing as he imitated the two quaint little gentlemen meeting each other on the beach :
as long as division yielded organic units possessing the properties of life—assimilation and reproduction—no limits were set to it
would i sit here if i were constituted a moral judge over you ?
his mood was obviously good , and a wave of relief ran through the classroom
come , let me have it ; we will lean it against the wall
tony started up indignantly and made a movement to flee into the next room
yes , there is a crib in it
because your companion and i can exchange no kisses on the brow , hans castorp responded
the patient raves no longer : who can say whether his spirit is sunk in empty night or whether it lingers , remote from the flesh , in far , deep , quiet dreams , of which he gives no sound and no sign ?
bout a year arter i received in naumburg the letter i quoted froill adrian ; soillcwhat more than a year , that is , after his arrival in ijeipzig and that first sight of the city of which the letter tells
true , kaisersaschern lies in the midst of the na- tive home of the reformation , in the heart of lutherland
the catastrophe will and must come—it advances on every hand and in every way
a protecting deity , an egeria , a soul-mate ?
prometheus too was guilty of hubris— and his torture on the scythian cliffs was from our point of view a holy martyrdom
even riekchen severin was looking insulted at the bottom of the table , and old consul kroger ivas the single one of the company who gave even a subdued snort
this breathless moment of absolute calm came without warning , like some unexpected , soundless , awful event
it is probable that he was merely indulging himself in the regal luxury of being thus supported and piloted ; presumably he could have gone by himself
frankly , it took me some tine to understand that on the one hand , indeed , the church did not \ish to see her- self put on one side ; but on the other she was not ready to give her parting blessing to a declared suicide , however honourable a one
hans castorp and joachim ziemssen , arrayed in white trousers and blue blazers , were sitting in the garden after dinner
his breath came shorter , he began to cough , hans castorp , with his eyes on his goal , and his breathing apparatus apparently in splendid trim , gave little heed ; and joachim , having recognized the situation for what it was , drew his brows together and kept step for step , feeling it out of the question to let his cousin go on alone
for the enemy , aware of their advance , have concentrated a barrage of shrapnel and large-calibre grenades upon the way they must come ; it crashed among them in the wood , and howling , flaming , splashing , lashed the wide ploughed land
there is nothing left but to pity and shrug one ’ s shoulders
let him come here if he dares
what can you have to say against the body ?
somebody there to be chloroformed , and he has just been eating bean salad
i feel so sorry -- i understand so well , you know
my dear sir , he said , with the greatest of pleasure
oh , herr consul , god forbid !
as they went along the corridors hans castorp said to his cousin : confess that it was a good idea of mine
the snow-white cloth of woven damask on the round table had an embroidered green runner across it , laid with gold-bordered porcelain so translucent that it gleamed like mother-of-pearl
i know it by heart
i took the place next the coachman and schildknapp made good his threat of being dragged on skis behind us - the driver had brought a pair
she put out her hand and tipped her head on one side
yes , i confess that in my simple human
tony related the good progress of the little erica , and christian wrote eagerly of his life and doings in london
don pizarro , in enormous puffed sleeves , was striking a permanent and awesome attitude , and the minister , in black velvet , approached from behind with hasty strides , to turn all to happiness
and by his own fault , one must admit
that would have meant denying to the
i did not invite you
we can ’ t deny that you had a weakness that way ; we make no bones of it , even if it is as good as cured now , and it may easily be that it runs a little in the family , as behrens suggested
we wander— wander—watching the tongues of foam lick upward toward our feet and sink back again
for the time element in music is single
to-morrow we must certainly get you a pair of rugs
the heat was turned on
and when the high official had turned to go , he had turned round again and with tears behind his gold glasses had pressed her hand again with the words : thank you , thank you , for your understanding and good- ness , but he meant understanding for the bowed-down parents , not for the girl
element of its exterior surface amiability ; and which one must take from it , tear from it , to have it alone , utterly alone , alone in the most final sense of the word
the naiad , the halmstadt , the friederike ( jverdieck -- why , if you know those , my son , at least that 's soiiething !
hans castorp did not keep inward count of the time , as does the man who husbands it , notes its passing , divides and tells and labels its units
there he lay , and dictated to his attendant letters that betrayed extreme depression
i ’ ve just come from an unequal duel with saw and scalpel—great thing , you know , resection of ribs
it ’ s so in the majority of cases , at bottom—i know what death is , i am an old retainer of his ; and believe me , he ’ s overrated
here i will follow on with a letter i had from him two months after i entered the service at naumburg
it is as though some-thing had begun to slip -- as though i have not the firm grip i had on events -- what is success ?
hans castorp thought it a disinterested horror , yet with something too of a personal kind , something that touched the kingly creature near : fear , perhaps , but not of any mean or narrow sort ; that was very like panic flickering up momentarily in the eyes
let him stop up here a bit , look about him and get used to things , he would change his tune
and now , good appetite , and a good morning
with outraged virtue and dignity she would call by name all those persons who had played havoc with her life and , in consequence , with the prestige of the buddenbrook family ; the list had grown long with time : teary trietschke !
what you mean by it all is to sh
the dreary , tossing sea was covered far and wide with foam
the whole occurrence , however , took a peculiar cast , offensive even beyond the horror of it , through an association of ideas due to dr krokowski ’ s latest lecture
well , do you think i can depend on that ?
theie was a half-circle of potted plants , arranged alternately with high silver candelabra ; and against the dark green leaves gleamed from a black pedestal the marble copy of thorwaldsen 's christ , which belonged in the corridor outside
he said , with a sad head-shake
let us change the subject
permit me to put another question , or rather , with your kind permission , make a suggestion
there 's nothing good to be looked for from christian , and i am finished
she spoke of the free and frank dis-cussion which the constitution ordains must be held over each name upon the list of candidates , and vivaciously wished she might be present when hermann hagenstrom 's character was being pulled to pieces !
the ladies ’ palpitation and cold extremities , the forced hilarity of the men , arose from their knowledge that they were come together in the night to embark on an unclean traffic with their own natures , a fearsome prying into unfamiliar regions of themselves , and that they were awaiting the appearance of those illusory or halfrealities which we call magic
she was admitted into the salon , where thomas buddenbrook lay upon his bier
he slipped into it and assumed an air of having been here from the beginning
the clock strikes twelve ,
no need here to hang the head , here is no cant nor sanctimoniousness , nothing but the blithe and manly spirit of disinterested research
item , she has much of the laboratory and the insistent ac- tivity of the alchemists and nigromancers of yore , which also stood in the sign of theology , but at the same time in that of emancipation and apostasy ; it , vas apostasy , not from the feith , that was never possible , but in the feith ; for apostasy is an act of feith and everything is and happens in god , most of all the falling from him
alone with his cousin , hans castorp heaved a sigh
i owe that to my family and the firm , she added earnestly
then frau per-maneder breathed such a heavy sigh that it sounded like a sob
no doubt hans castorp , were he wishful to do so , could without any great trouble have reckoned himself into certainty ; just as the reader can , in case all this vagueness and involvedness are repugnant to his healthy sense
it was not meant for people who went out in the snow and got lost and night-bound in the mountains
your tales cf the whip-cracking and sprjnging to order , the curry- combing and spit-and-polish , have made us heartily to laugh : above all that one of the under-officer , vhich even as he planes
he said we should sitty down and so we did , with the manikin between us in the grass , and looked at his picture-book vith him
his father , of whom he spoke with respect , obviously with the feeling that he was now remote enough from his native scene to view it with impartial benevolence , had been the village schochet , or slaughterer—a calling different indeed from that of the gentile butcher , who was labourer and tradesman , whereas leo ’ s father was an official , and the holder of a spiritual office
and since , in order to remain within the moral code , such a man had always to correct justice in the second sense by justice in the first , where then was the absolute , the radical , in the conception ?
he shows an unpretentious façade , and behind it gives free rein to tastes— such as a prince of the church—
directly the doctors had left the scene , the word had gone round for a dance , already the tables were being pushed back ; spies were posted at the doors of the writing- and music-rooms , with orders to give the sign in case the old man , krokowski , or the oberin should show themselves
he went about with that dry flush on his face and hummed continually under his breath—being in a state of mind when music particularly appeals
the sufferer 's words dragged , perhaps unconsciously , and he moved his lips so idly that what he said was badly articulated
ever since i came up
everybody has that kind of vanity ; do not you think so ?
opposite her sat a chattering french girl who looked like a negress , with huge
i was still happier over the altogether successful shaping of the address , only nine lines long , of the poet to his allegorical song , which speaks so darkly and difficultly , with no prospect of its hidden sense being understanded of the , vorld
he asked , after silence had reigned some two minutes
but however genuine his fear of the elements , he refused to take premature flight ; his being scarcely the sportman ’ s attitude , who only meddles with the elements so long as he knows himself their master , takes all precautions , and prudently yields when he must—whereas what went on in hans castorp ’ s soul can only be described by the one word challenge
so james broke off , and to his nephew ’ s further , mildly interested query answered : oh , nothing
no , thomas , you simply ca not understand what a splendid creature she is -- and healthy -- she is as healthy -- !
yes , the sleeping-sack , hans castorp said
now look at the skin—the epidermis
a nice , amusing young man—but what was the result ?
i repeat , it is astounding
he stood there near the figure of thorwaldsen 's christ and wrung his hands before his face or spread them out in blessing ; while below in the street , before the house door , beneath a white wintry sky , stood the hearse drawn by four black horses , with the other carriages in a long row behind it
those were comparatively dull hours , and the tedious kegel could by no means vie with kumpf
the window was down , the afternoon grew cool , and he , a tender product of the sheltered life , had turned up the collar of his fashionably cut , silk-lined summer overcoat
the richest children were pointed out , the prettiest and those from well-known families : there were the little daughter of a dutch multi-millionaire , the son of a prussian prince , and a twelve-year-old lad who bore the name of a champagne known the world over
and i should say that discretion plays some role in the affair too
it had been standing here , in immovable dignity , while she had thought of it as a dream worthy only to be forgotten
joachim made a right-about turn
i beg your pardon , i will ask another question ; i ’ ll put it more simply and generally
and mynheer peeperkorn came to the point
whereupon the young man laughed , blushed again , and looked at tony 's plate
a drive bordered with chestnut trees went from the garden gate up to the ter-race ; and on either side of the gate a gilt-topped lantern was burning brightly
a door was slammed—it was the one on the left , leading into the hall , and someone had let it fall shut , or even banged it , a thing he detested ; he had never been able to endure it
i have already spoken of adrian 's inner cosmopolitanism
and when she tries to dissimulate , she is incomparable
tony was speechless with envy and humiliation
that is strong language , ida , but that was really the truth of it
he held these offices in high regard
the kind i mean consists in making a good use of favours received
the volumes were heavy , unhandy
before tea was finished drinking , up above and down below , it was well on the way toward five o ’ clock ; and by the time joachim returned from his third daily round and looked in on his cousin , it would be near enough to six to reduce the remaining rest period to no more than a single hour—reckoned always in round numbers
upon my word , one has only to speak of her to make you blush !
but hold—you need a bag , a fur sack !
for twice such a turn had come , in his dream and fantasy , as had made him start up—once from horror , and again for rapture
but so long as this is the case , heinricy , you can not expect to make any improvement , and so i warn you
this was all that was lacking to set the crown upon the whole
this undress threw into even greater relief the splendid humanity of his head on the pillow ; in it he looked more remote than ever from the conventional and middle-class , suggesting on the one hand the homme du peuple , on the other a portrait-bust
was it that he missed the orange perfume ?
hans castorp felt how very odd indeed the word sounded in the mouth of sharp , skinny little naphta
just tell me that , if you can
psychology - god warrant us , do you still hold with it ?
it covered his cheeks and left his chin and lips free
now between these keys the work plays most ingeniously , so that for most of the time none of them clearly comes into force but is only indicated by its propor- tional share in the general sound-complex
and laughing , confused , in the excitement of arrival and meeting , hans castorp
there is a difference
he made him ac-quainted with his own nearest friends on exchange and en-tertained him in every way
faustus the idea that i had fufilled my duty to my fatherland and would do better to serve in myoid place the caust ; of education
he determined to shut himself up to-morrow and give a performance all by himself , and already in fancy he heard his little figures singing : for he was approaching the theatre by way of his music
dn the thirtieth of may he went to rostock , whence he drove in a hired wagon out to the country
i ( retort angrily ) : no
it was capable of healing certain diseases which were latent in every human being , though its first effects were strongly favourable to these , and by dint of a general organic compulsion , upwards and outwards , made them come to the surface , brought them , as it were , to a triumphant outburst—beg pardon—triumphant ? —yes ; had he never felt that an outbreak of disease had something jolly about it , an outburst of physical gratification ?
take your cousin and put him to bed
his housemate and antagonist was no better off
the hangman 's helper in a flowing jacket and a codpiece pours the boiling oil over the back of my neck from a long-handled ladle , as i duly and devoutly squat

he ca not go away without speaking to you and your mamma , and if you did not want him , you should have sent him away before now
she realized who i was , looked at me , and burst out : 'farewell , farewell !
but herr albin had already come out to go up to his room : very young and lanky , with a rosy , childish face , and little strips of side-whisker close to his ears
you have there ensenbles which begin as speaking choruses and only by stages , by the way of the most extraordinary transitions , turn into the richest vocal music ; then choruses which pass through all the stages from graded whisper- ings , antiphonal speech , and humming up to the most polyphonic song - accompanied by sounds which begin as inere noise , like tom-toms and thundering gongs , savage , fanatical , ritual , and end by arriving at the purest music
they had him between them , and he turned his head to assent first to one and then to the other ; now and again he stood stock-still on the path , tipping his body back from the waist and gesturing with his fur-lined glove as he made some quite inadequate contribution to the talk
we are international- but we are pro- german , like nobody else in the world , simply because we ca not help perceiving the role of germany and judaism on earth
we must look about among the world-famous conductors to interpret - we shall not need to look long
herr weinschenk 's visits followed each other in quick succession , and by january -- january of the year -- he permitted himself to make a brief and manly offer for erica crunlich ' a hand
my sympathetic readers and friends : let me go on with my tale
i will try , in as small space as possible , to sketch the essential of these experiences , which our host rightly found enormously im- portant and which daniel zur hohe accompanied with his stere- otyped oh yes , yes , yes , not so bad , yes , certainly , one may say so , even when it did not exactly go so far as the plundering of the world by the tough and dedicated soldiery of cbristus n- perator maximus
then there were cavaliers of herr albin ’ s kidney , monocled youths of seventeen , a spectacled , rosyfaced young dutchman with a mania for collecting postage stamps ; certain greeks , with pomaded hair and almond-shaped eyes , inclined to overreach at table ; and a pair of young dandies who were nicknamed max and moritz , and bore a great reputation for breaking out of bounds
in july he was as sound as a berry , weeks long
while the departure of the civilian hans castorp became impossible precisely because he had to wait for clavdia chauchat , whose return , as yet , was not even thought of
for instance , frau salomon from amsterdam , despite the pleasure she got from displaying her lace underwear at examinations , despite the fact that she was not improving , but getting steadily worse , took an entirely mad and illegitimate leave for the flat-land
and so some wind has blown you all the way up here ?
you can see the tree line almost everywhere , it is very sharply defined ; the fir-trees leave off , and after that there is absolutely nothing but bare rock
best thanks for your trouble , herr senator , he said
his hand trembled , he was plainly in a nervous state
words of twelve letters , cer- tain combinations and interrelations of the twelve semitones , series of notes from which a piece and an the movements of a w
baroque easy-chairs with little pads on the arms were , grouped about a small metal-bound table , and behind it stood a baroque sofa with velvet cushions
timm clutched his brow , rolled up his eyes , sighed winrtilv , and said with a dazed smile : i get all mixed up , herr doctor , when you stand so close to me
i ’ ve sometimes asked myself if i ought not to have become a clergyman—in a certain way it wouldn ’ t have suited me so badly—i hope i didn ’ t make any mistake in my french ?
during the meal her mother had told her that thomas was aware of her expected arrival ; and she did not seem particularly anxious to meet him
white traces lingered after every storm in the crannies of the rocky rhätikon , the chain that seemed to guard the end of the valley , and the distant monarchs to the south were always in snow
he thanked me in the words , spoken so far as i could hear without humour : well , you see , it is a good thing after all to have reliable friends
and yet there were troubles which had , at times , the power to lame his courage for hours , weaken his elasticity , and depress his mood
i had that amount of consideration , yes
dreamily , the glass spelled out the word tranquil
tony , your position is not comme il faut , remarked the frau consul
you are quite right in assuming i don ’ t know the work of that pope—i take it innocent iii was a pope ?
it would be as though one held a single note or chord for a whole hour , and called it music
guard marguerite within thy shelt ’ ring care !
he varies , the consul said drily
since then he encompassed in his reveries this nervous , exceedingly reserved lady , to whom he had not even been presented : he lifted his jesuit hat to her , on the street , to her great surprise , and treated her to a pantomime of cringing treachery , gloating over her the while in his thoughts as a tiger might over his trainer
i can speak openly with you
man is intoxicated by his desire , woman demands and expects to be intoxicated by it
his youthful moustaches , colourless as the hair which covered his long head , were scarcely visible ; and he had a complexion to match , a tint like translucent porcelain , which grew pink on the slightest provocation
his feet looked large , his legs very thin , they seemed to be bound or wound as for the business of sport more than war
but christian went on , his eyes wandering back and forth
i won ’ t call it a focus of softening , but it is certainly a moist spot , and if you go down below and begin to carry on , why , you ’ ll have the whole lobe at the devil before you can say jack robinson
i must have got stiff from lying ; i shall be better as i move about
are you pleased with ida ?
he repeated ; and he made a vague , awkward , fervent gesture outward and down-ward , not toward the side where the coast of mecklenburg narrowed the bay , but in the direction of the open sea , whose rippling blue , green , yellow , and grey stripes rolled as far as eye could see out to the misty horizon
i started at the word
toward the end of the month the valley lay deep in snow ; but then it thawed , just as certain experienced or weather-sensitive among the guests had prophesied it would : frau stöhr , the ivory levi , but equally the widow hessenfeld , smelt and felt it simultaneously , before ever the smallest little cloud showed itself over the top of the granite formation to the south
they were favourable only for skiing
and up there to the right of the schwarzhorn , that tooth-shaped peak , there is a glacier—can ’ t you see the blue ?
his eyes had been quite dead before
it was so easy , so safe , to tease poor , limited , modest , lean and hungry clothilde , that , harmless though it was , he felt it rather beneath him
you ca not play it twice -- with all due respect , my dear fellow , and my highest re-gards
you see i make it all myself , it tastes twice as good—did you think it was ambrosia ?
i did eat more than usual for breakfast , but that can not be the reason , for she usually tastes particularly good after a too hearty meal
he is a good lad , betsy , a lad of principle , but -- after he had failed twice in the examination , it seemed best -- he did not like the law himself , and the position in the post-office at wismar is quite suitable
tall , broad-shouldered , long-legged , nar-
we are giving the classical gifts of life their due , staggering in their honour
master-builders and builders on a building
joachim could never have done so—good joachim , who saw the whole affair now in its true light , after the false one hans castorp had first cast upon it ; saw how the wool had been pulled over his eyes ; and with a murmured recognition applied himself to help look at the painting
and he favoured them with some repulsive details of his condition , to which christian listened with dreadful interest , wrinkling his nose as far as it could go and countering with a brief and forcible-account of his misery
for beyond that portal , in the council room , in fourteen arm-chairs arranged in a semicircle sit the electors , who have been chosen from the senate and the assembly and await the proposals of the voting chambers
didn ’ t aristotle place in the individual the reality of universal ideas ?

behrens studied the spots and the lines , the black festoon in the intercostal space ; while hans castorp gazed without wearying at joachim ’ s graveyard shape and bony tenement , this lean memento mori , this scaffolding for mortal flesh to hang on
his hair , pale brown and very soft , began to grow rapidly , and fell waving over the shoulders of his full , pinafore-like frocks
it was a beneficent pause , relaxed , and filled with peaceful satisfaction in respect of work already accomplished
it means angel of death
it was joachim who came back to it ; for hans castorp , moved by native tact and delicacy , seemed to wish to forget it up to the last moment
he was a young man of not very independent judgments , and glad to be encouraged in certain feelings he had , upon which both reason and conscience united to frown
no , they were not all brown : two of the ladies were , on the contrary , distinctly pale ; one of them thin as a lath , and ivory-white of complexion , the other shorter and plump , disfigured by freckles
a trembling ran through her , she sighed , the upper part of her body sank forward so that her forehead rested against hans castorp ’ s , and her arms , together with those of her guardians , began to make extraordinary pumping motions to and fro
and we are shrinking shadows by the way-side , shamed by the security of our shadowdom , and noways minded to indulge in any rodomontade ; merely led hither by the spirit of our narrative , merely to see again , among those running , stumbling , drum-mustered grey comrades that swarm out of yonder wood , one we know ; merely to look once more in the simple face of our one-time fellow of so many years , the genial sinner whose voice we know so well , before we lose him from our sight
the man whose strength is unexhausted climbs boldly up into the lofty multiplicity of the mountain heights
the cigarettes , those biting little trifles with the yellow mouthpiece , were tom 's passion
he stood and watched her laugh as she spoke , precisely as pribislav hippe had laughed as he spoke , that time in the school yard : she opened her mouth rather wide , and her slanting , grey-green eyes narrowed themselves to slits above the cheek-bones
three times daily , at least , she passionately embraced her future sister-in-law
after an introductory c , it puts a c sharp before the d , so that it no longer scans heav-en 's blue , mead-owland , but o-thou heaven 's blue , green-est meadowland , fare-thee well for aye , and this added c sharp is the most moving , consolatory , pa- thetically reconciling thing in the world
the human body— yes , i ’ ve always had an uncommon turn for it
here it would have been in place for our two male visitors to take off their hats , had they had any on
i was already thinking of all these things when at the beginning of this work i made an exception to my general profession of friendliness towards the jewish people , confessing that i had run across some pretty annoying specimens , and the name of the scholar breisacher slipped prematurely from my pen
they went back to their guests
he had made this observation when he had visited asylums for the insane
in brahms as a song-writer my friend valued above all else the peculiarly new and austere style in the four serious songs written for bible texts , especially the religious beauty of tod , wie bitter hist du !
it is very damp and foggy
her upper lip had the most touching expression
he filled her glass , also his neighbour ’ s and his own , ordered three more bottles , and clicked glasses with wehsal and frau magnus the inly wasted one ; they two seeming to stand in most need of enlivenment
on exchange he had been meeting measuring side-looks out of jovial , mocking old eyes , that seemed to be saying so you are taking it on , my son !
we are sunk enough here , aren ’ t we , lieutenant ?
old dog in the manger !
i will sit here awhile and smoke my cigar in the regular way
hermine kleefeld , as well as herr albin and captain miklosich , played fantastic rôles—the last carried off frau stöhr in his fury , and was pierced through and through with a lance by lawyer paravant
is that a reason for embarras , in a sphere where there reigns unlimited freedon from prejudice ?
he , thomas buddenbrook , as a business man , was taking advantage of the market -- and he would , by god , when he sold , know how to do the same
the truth was that his very destiny had been marked by stages , adventures , insights , and these flung up in his mind suitable themes for his stock-taking activities , and these , in their turn , ripened him into an intuitional critic of this sphere , of this its absolutely exquisite image , and his love of it
so 't is ; yes , they do say so
and had not the establishment of the morning star been , precisely , a military academy , the pupils of which were drilled by divisions in military and spiritual decorum , a mingling , so to speak , of stand-up collar and spanish ruff ?
the latter was sitting , for the time , alone on her side of the table , for the other three places were free
ripe for home ’ again
edmund pfu'hl was an organist of no small repute , whose reputation for contrapuntal learning was not confined within the walls of his native town
what made him say that ?
the conversation paused for a while on the subject of the approaching wedding
young man , he said , positively
our readers may remember the greedy schoolboy in the round spectacles , who sat at frau salomon ’ s table and had a habit of cutting up all the food on his plate into a sort of mess , and gulping it down , now and again wiping his eyes with his serviette behind his heavy spectacle-lenses
and as settembrini brought it out , he flung his small , yellow-skinned right hand in the air , as though proposing a toast
as the year ] drew to a close , something frightful indeed happened
he had his hands behind his back and a smile on his intelligent face
are you waiting for ah official invitation from gr� ?
as the regular performance of a task it l { ept me busy and filled the years vvhich vvould have been still harder to bear in idleness
three great lorries were being driven through , one close behind another , piled high with full corn sacks , with the firm name written on them in big black letters
the thirteen brentano songs are also to be regarded in this light
but i must devote a few words to another figure among our teachers ; the equivocal nature of this man intrigued me , so that i remember him better than all the rest
he pressed her to find out new and interesting facts about madame chauchat ’ s personal affairs , her origin , her husband , her age , the particulars of her illness
in his country they cultivate good relations with the english balkan committee
she held conferences with various people about the funeral , which must of course be conducted in the most re-fined manner
this was what brought nepomuk schneidewein to pfeiffering
blatant self-confidence lured everyone on to try his hand
all i want to say is that our objections - if they are meant as objec- tions - would not count against the fulfilment of the old , the ever repeated demand to take hold and make order , and to resolve the magic essence of music into human reason
i have my eyes in my head and see how things are ; i am not a stupid goose any more , i am a divorced woman -- and i am made to feel it , that 's certain
for you have not done that -- with me -- i swear it
and now , on a sudden , there remained of it no more than a miserable three or four days , nothing worth mentioning
so while these youthful lips meet in their russian kiss , let us darken our little stage and change the scene
in the morning he went to the office at about the same time as thomas , and sat opposite his brother and herr marcus in a revolving arm-chair like theirs
he had what he had
did not the very fact that he was sitting at the bad russian table witness a certain abandon ?
he came to her rescue and launched out once more upon the old story
thank you so much , professor naphta
between them there had appeared , lifting his top hat , a gentleman of scarcely medium height , with one light eyebrow higher than the other and the pointed ends of his moustaches extending beyond his pallid cheeks
his voice sounded weak and tearful with suppressed laughter
yes , they were mostly empty , replied the hostess
he asked in a lower , well-nigh reproachful tone
the atmosphere up here is so international
i hate it , as you know ; i have no respect for it -- here the consul began to laugh , leaning back in the sofa with a piece of bread and herb cheese in his hand
the curtains of the three large windows were still drawn , and the gas was burning in the chandelier with a soft hissing noise
baku—in some german baths , in spain
thus adrian describej hill to me and thus i see him
i found that unconsciously i had fonned quite decided opinions
it was nearly six o'clock
he understood only now and then what they were saying , and the music itself was mostly far above his childish understanding
but all that is an old story , he said
what will become of you if you go on like that ?
as long as i am alive it wo not happen
this is not just a machine , he went on , taking a needle out of one of the gay little metal boxes ranged on the table , and fitting it into the holder , it ’ s a stradivarius , a guarneri ; with a resonance , a vibration—dernier raffinemang , polyhymnia patent , look here in the inside of the lid
tell me one thing , tom : would not it be like a nightmare to you ?
we are all weak creatures with sinful hearts , and when they begin to look down on me for a poor worldling i laugh in their faces
i know what you would say : that the views you represent are not , of necessity , your own ; that you have only chanced upon that one of all the possible ones there are , as it were , in the air , and you try it on , without personal responsibility
hanno 's feeling for his teacher was one of boundless gratitude and devotion
- i do not mean they were my personal choice , nor will the reader find them so
and i , on the other hand , assert that the question of freedom—the question of cities , to put it more concretely—has always been a highly ethical question , and is historically bound up with the inhuman degeneration of commercial morality , with all the horrors of modern industrialism and speculation , and with the devilish domination of money and finance
say -- you know franz , the ramsau franz , he had his name-day to-day , and we are all half-seas over
hans castorp was in his loggia , studying a plant which , now that the astronomical summer had begun , and the days were shortening , flourished luxuriantly in many places : the columbine or aquilegia , of the ranunculus family , which grew in clumps , with long stalks bearing the blue , violet , or reddish-brown blossoms , and spreading herbaceous foliage
yes , he said , joachim would find there had been changes in the population of the berghof , there were new people , but on the other hand , some that had gone away were come back again
i say , that ’ s pretty steep , he cried
ncipated her from the sphere of a small-town speciaeti and piping and brought her into contact , vith the great , voric !
christian would look at her with his nose all wrinkled up , as if to say are not you ashamed of yourself ?
she became gradually transparent , soon she was only visible as an ascending current of warm air , then not visible at all , so that ellen ’ s path was clear
and here are the tele-grams , tom , the first ones to come -- the personal ones of course ; the others have been sent to the offire
let us hope she recovered her strength when she went back to her husband
' n ' then , adds the buddenbrook partisan , did not the burgomaster his own self stan ' godfeyther to his son ?
he fell upon his face , beneath which , presently , a little pool of blood began to form
still so early that i had on that same day looked over almost the whole to , vn in the first flush of arrival- this time really with a guide , to wit the porter who fetched my portmanteo from the station ; hence at the last the farce and foolery of which i spalce and may still reherse
as papa said the other day , they are the coming people ; while the m�ndorpfs , for example -- and one ca not deny that the hagenstrbms are clever
but let 's go up
do wet the compress again
birds of paradise , i tell you , and regularly out for adventure
he answered as no one had expected him to answer -- not dr gieseke , nor the frau consul , not thomas , nor antonie herself
these were such singular times
and it lasted—with interludes of single resplendent days—all through the month , and on into september
adrian laughed - not , of course , out of sur- prise
i won ’ t go so far as to say that the whole natural order of things , for instance the size of the earth , the time it takes to revolve on its axis and about the sun , the division between day and night , summer and winter—in short , the whole cosmic rhythm , if you like to call it that— was especially arranged for our use and behoof ; that would be cheek , i suppose , and simple-minded into the bargain
war , echoed settembrini , war , my dear sir , has been forced before now to serve the cause of progress ; as you will grant if you will recall certain events in the history of your favourite epoch—i mean the period of the crusades
precisely this it was that frightened hans castorp ; for frightened he was , in the same sense as when , in the consulting-room , he had looked from joachim ’ s nude body with panic-stricken searching up to his eyes—only that then the grounds of his fear had been pity and concern , whereas here something quite different was in play
except for the first greeting , he had had no opportunity to speak with christian , but he had looked at him , during the service , and noted that he seemed unusually serious , and even more restless than common : in the course of pastor pringsheim 's discourse he had left the room for several minutes
and thus it was , in this connexion , that the learned gentlemen , speaking with his drawling , typically eastern cadence , and his softly mouthed r , came upon the subject of botany ; that is to say , upon the subject of mushrooms
you are a woman , you see , so you take everything personally
peeperkorn summoned the dwarf and in his most impressive manner ordered wine—white chablis of , three bottles for a start—and dessert , whatever pâtisseries and dried fruits were to be had
and bruckner 's opinion of brahms was very low
and who knows , yet , how much you are doing for him ?
asked herr kesselmeyer , looking at him through his glasses , with his nose wrinkled up
he was accordingly gratified to learn that grandfather settembrini had not underestimated the importance of such matters
water roared in the abysses on the right ; on the left , among rocks , dark fir-trees aspired toward a stonegrey sky
at the festival in baden , in co-operation with hans platner 's famous marionette theatre , they gave all five pieces of the gesta ranorun - an experience ravishing the feelings to and fro between pious emotion and laugh- ter as never before
people who passed him noticed that his eyes were watering and that he held his mouth sh'ut in a peculiar cautious way ; it was twisted a little to one side , and one could see by the musrles of his cheeks and temples that he was clenching his jaw
was not he himself used to lie long hours out of doors , in snow and frost , by night as well as day ?
his face grew slowly red -- such a dark red that his beard looked pale-yellow by contrast
that ’ s too absurd for words
oh , you , with your cassandra prophecies !
hans castorp set himself against it—or at least he tried , only to discover , in affright , that even he was powerless to do so
his thoughts , whenever he paused in his address , obvi- ously made him inaccessible to them
his lowest stage was in the mill , the second on the ploughed field , the third , and most commendable—don ’ t listen , settembrini ! —was upon the bed of repose
at seven o ’ clock next morning , the sun showed no sign of making an appearance above the mountain ; yet day was dawning , difficultly , in a reek of mist , as hans castorp , after a restless night , left the berghof to go to the rendezvous
shall we be friends , shall we make a league—not against but for him ?
finally it was a fact that the whole development of music in gerlnany strove towards the word-tone drama of wagner and therein found its goal
the moon stood high and small between fleecy clouds , and the little fountain splashed in the stillness over the over-hanging boughs of the walnut tree
after that he went often
vvell , lnstitoris did not shriek , on the contrary he spoke rather softly , , vith a lisp , even , vhen he celebrated the italian l : tenaissance as a time that reeked of blood and beauty
the weaknesses of my character are beyond question
they are to be had everywhere here , joachim said , even in shops where you would least expect it
as regards the disinfection , they must show a neat profit there , they never could have used ten francs ’ worth of hco to smoke the american woman out
his natural , un- concealed , and amusingly parodied fear of not getting enough to eat was irresistibly comic ; with goggling eyes he chewed a tongue sandwich in imitation of a starving man
but it is his own fault , the consul almost shouted , and then , with a glance at the dining-room door , lowered his voice
oh , yes , you must
what i heard , what i took in , is quite irrelevant
i am a woman steeled by adversity ; i have learned to bear the truth
since he came back for good , she seems to have taken to him
settembrini took the other from ferge ’ s hand
sometimes , when he took counsel with himself on the possibilities of a shift , he had , during these years , considered choosing mathe- matics , in which , when he was at school , he had always found '-good entertainment ( his very words )
and tool { it for a gift , with the bearing of one who had certainly said he would not give money for it
do you mean what you say ?
that , vas feeling : despite everything it tempted me to give his hand a stolen pressure
if it were just a visit to amsterdam that you were thinking of -- but to leave us for ever -- !
the dressmaker confessed to the same temperature , but she on the contrary felt excited , tense , and restless , as though some important event were about to happen , which was certainly not the case ; the excitation was purely physical , quite without emotional grounds
an odd man , and of great personal weight , though incoherent
yes , i vvould go so far as to reckon , vith the possibility that i-ielmut himself knevl the truth : a certain admixture of cul- tured decency , deprecating and regretful toleration , and -love of peace , speal { s for the supposition , and it does happen far from seldom that society takes the spouse for the only blind one , while he thinks that except for limself no one knows anything
the flesh , ladies and gentlemen , is—not another word
principles and premises re-mained unclear , and his mind , unpractised in such readings , was not able to follow certain trains of thought
at the schwarzkopf a ' ?
and what i am calling your attention to is the fact , which i observe with indignation , that you are still dividing the world up into opposing factions
it was a great success , not least for rudi himself
and that mazurka—or whatever her name is—seemed rather silly to me
it would neither please nor displease him -- he would simply be mildly surprised , that is all
i depend upon you
this meant in a way a de- parture from the abstract universal letter-script , not bound up with speech ; in a way a return to the word-writing of earlier peo- ples
followed by a troop of guests , two singular figures entered
they were present at all these scenes ; space was annihilated , the clock put back , the then and there played on by music and transformed into a juggling , scurrying now and here
the voice dwelt on the word human—dreamily , fanatically ; and accented arrogance on the final syllable
voltaire ’ s attitude was that of a worthy descendant of those old gauls that shot their arrows against the heavens
for it was plain that when one set about it like that , one could go pretty far without shocking anybody
the munich i speak of is the munich of the late regency , with only four years between it and the war , whose issue was to turn its pleasantness to morbidness and produce in it one sad and gro- tesque manifestation after another ; this capital city of beautiful vistas , where political problems confined themselves to a capri- cious opposition between a half-separatist folk-catholicism and the lively liberalism professed by the supporters of the reich ; munich , with its parade concerts in the feldherrenhalle , its art shops , its palaces of decorative crafts , its recurring exhibitions , its bauern-balls in carnival time , its seasonal marzhrliu carouses and week-long monster fair on the oktoberwiese , 'where a stout and lusty folkishness , now long since corrupted by modern mass methods , celebrated its saturnalia ; munich , , vith its residuary wagnerism , its esoteric coteries performing their resthetic devo- tions behind the siegestor ; its bohemia , well bedded down in pub- lic approval and fundamentally easy-going
in the evening , after he had drunk his beer , hans castorp felt heavier in the limbs and more chilled and exhausted than on the day before ; toward nine o ’ clock he bade his cousin good-night , drew his plumeau up to his chin , and slept like the dead
you are still a very young girl , you know
he does not hate anybody
but he was silent
one comes , even if one is an im- presario , first of all to salute a great man
scious being , ichthyosaurus-being , was no good , and today one must consciously not be wanting , one must assert one 's specific form of life with an articulate feeling of self
the military always has to reckon on coming to grip with death , just as the clergy has
that was a piece of majestic tomfoolery—when one is moved one can say things that sound crass and irreverent , but are after all more solemn than the conventional religious formulas
he could see now that this had been very reasonable advice ; settembrini had been wrong to sneer at it as he had—settembrini , with his republic and his bello stile
'what do i care about your damned fiddle ?
they refuse themselves to our understanding , and will , painfully enough , continue to do so
his trousers were of an indefinite grey-green colour and too short
the chairs cost twenty-five marks apiece
or , more probably , for what profession are you preparing yourself ?
that is— he said
indeed he seemed not far from a sudden determination to fling his paper upon the chair he sat in , to escape by the hall door and exchange the empty gaieties of the salon for the frosty solitude of his balcony , and the society of his maria
't is all about they , -- now
will you sub- stantiate the report of your stupidity and wear a bell even as a cat , that you will base business and promise on so elastic , so en- snaring a concept as love ?
lust of the flesh
he had probably come hither to get more money out of his mother , besides the passage money his father sent him
surpassingly brilliant , in the grand sty ie , he presented the mythology of music at the same time with that of the world ; in that he bound the ltiusic to the things and made them express themselves in music , he created an apparatus of sen-
the hofrat , as he examined , continued to let fall remarks , in resigned and dreary tones—for he was such a master of auscultation that he could listen to a man ’ s inside , dictate what he heard to his assistant , and talk about something else all the time
this death , which could at no time have moved him greatly , and after the lapse of years could scarcely move him at all , meant the sundering of yet another bond with the life below ; gave to what he rightly called his freedom the final seal
and there could be on earth nothing more tender than the next number he chose : a duet from a modern italian opera , a simple , heartfelt mingling of emotion between two beings , one part taken by the world-famous tenor who was so well represented in the albums , the other by a crystal-clear and sweet little soprano voice ; nothing more lovely than his da mi il braccio , mia piccina and the simple , sweet , succinct little melodic phrase in which she replies
for long before i dal- lied with the poison butterfly , my froward soul in high mind and arrogance was on the way to satan though my goal stood in doubt ; and from youth up i worked towards him , as you must know , indeed , that man is made for hell or blessedness , made and foredestined , and i was born for hell
he rows the messengers to the stone of penance and they cry up to it : gregory , thou man of god , come down to us from the stone , for god wills for thee to be set up for his vicar upon earth !
in his wizened red hand he holds a bunch of pale-coloured roses , which are a little past their best , and slowly shed their petals on the carpet
hans castorp expressed it : a cigar like that is alive—it breathes
when it was over , the cousins walked down to the platz ; joachim seemed preoccupied ; hans castorp was in an agony of snuffles and cleared his rasping throat continually
the two clasped hands through the open window
yes , you bought me a glass of lemonade from the next booth
then the senator got up from his chair , which fiete drew away behind him , and went with shuffling steps into his office to get a cigar
thus he grumbled on , and could endure to grumble , for had he not maria ?
clavdia brushed hans castorp ’ s table with the folds of her new gown , and crossed the room to where young gänser and the kleefeld were sitting
but mamsell jungmann only replied , you will see , child
rickchen severin , ida jungmann 's successor , who now reigned over the frau consul 's household and managed the servants , had a peasant 's instinct for hard facts
as they left the last houses behind , tony bent forward to look at the lighthouse ; then she leaned back and closed her tired and burning eyes
thoughts like these , un-christmaslike though they were , troubled everybody in the room
the desperate dance , in which thy fortunes are caught up , will last yet many a sinful year ; we should not care to set a high stake on thy life by the time it ends
his reddish-blond hair was grown so thin that nearly all the cranium was bare
it , vas easy to say that it came from the devil
rudolf as bishop of olmiitz was to take place , could not possibly be kept to
peter d�ann nearly fell over with laughing when he saw christian with the bouquet
if we had a little frost , or snow , now -- but rain , filth -- very , very unpleasant
he asks , and winks
but he was mindful of them ; i could not shake off the conviction
i know you are poking fun at me
says the one labourer to the other
one sees now that it did not happen so soon
so , courteous and beloved brothers and sisters , have i borne me , and let nigromantia , carmina , incantatio , veneficium , and what names so ever be all my aim and striving
he might say it with his head thrown back , his nose wrinkled up , mouth wide open , hands swishing about in the air , with a long-drawn-out , nasal , metallic sound , like a chinese gong ; or he might , with still funnier effect , toss it out , gently , en passant ; or with any one of a thousand different shades of tone and meaning
during those days of stifling expectation , when the nerves of europe were on the rack , hans castorp did not see herr settembrini
once in a while a big flounder gave such a desperate leap that he sprang right off his slab and fell down upon the slippery pavement , among all the refuse , and had to be picked up and severely admonished by his possessor
if it should be the case that your feelings did not bind you indis-solubly to your husband -- she looked at him with uncomprehending , tear-streaming eyes
the balcony ran across the house and was divided into small separate compartments by opaque glass partitions , which did not quite reach to the balustrade
there is in all this monstrousness nothing that could appeal to the likes of me as goodness , beauty , greatness ; and i shall never un- derstand the glory-to-god mental attitude which certain tem- peraments assume when they contemplate the works of god , meaning by the phrase the physics of the universe
she held a large cup in both tiny hands , entirely concealing her face , and drank her milk with little sighs of satisfaction
thus they came upon the subject of torture—introduced by wehsal , to whom , it seemed , it made a particular appeal
could any one help it , i ask you , tom ?
it gradually came about that chris-tian freed himself largely from the constraint of office hours
but what was lliat to him ?
but it was not alone this lack of formality and absence of distinctions that made her feel strange and unsympathetic
it too had probably come into the house through the offices of the keen-nosed rosenstiel : it was the ecstatic nar- rative of viechthiid of magdeburg
rudi took his stand on the interpretation , not so much popular as bourgeois and official , that the king was completely crackers as he put it
it is a good long journey from munich !
i am sweating somewhat , he said
but tony and morten spent the afternoon in a distant spot , at the edge of the yellow loam , where the waves hurled their spray as far up as sea-gull rock
it was a feat , and he could perform it
the revival of ritual music from a profane epoch has its dangers
they make quite a joke of it
i saw it at our first meeting
dr faustus the opportunity for comparison and study
but from the very first day after our marriage you have sat with me only in the evening , and that only to read the paper
worth dwelling upon , communing with in the depths of one ’ s—in order to—understand me , my child : as a term of endearment—the pet name
as i told you , he is personally poor ; that is to say , without possessions
without the cholesterin , it is hard to imagine touching the human skin at all
she came to him
but listen , professor , it seems to me then , he has no occasion to stick at the terrorism in my cousin ’ s profession
you know how shrewd and resourceful i am
he refrained from saying that he had been up here since a good deal longer than yesterday
the dizzying problem of identities grew grander in its scale
under certain conditions , human heads , faces , full-length phantoms manifested themselves before the eyes of the experimenters , even within certain limits entered into contact with them
the fresh morning bloom disappeared from her cheek , and she even grew a little pale
look at that , for instance
the sky was blue , with a few light floating clouds in it , silvered by the rays of the sun , the strength of which was indeed not so great but that the stove was already going , behind the polished screen in the landscape-room
he was nervous ; visibly started when he saw the cousins , and seemed embarrassed over the necessity of passing them
shall i confess that , privately and apart from the his- torical point of view , i felt a deep , intimately personal shame ?
thus he betrayed the direction of his plans for a profession : it turned out ( i pur- posely repeat the expression i used to describe the moment when by a chance word he betrayed his religious inner life ) , it turned out that he intended to study theology
why , even the lamps are not lighted
risks were taken now and then
they talked for another quarter-hour while hans castorp unpacked his night and toilet things , smoking a large , mild cigarette the while
it would probably be better to paint her from memory , instead of having her sit
to his earlier reports he added that joachim had now taken to his bed ; that he had said nothing , but the wish to have his mother by him could be read in his eyes , and hofrat behrens agreed that it would be well
fragnents of grown-up language came too : if he had not remembered something , he said it had slipped his mind
german make , you know , we do them far and away better than anybody else
for some while , for purposes of comparison , he tapped by turns on the lefthand side near the collar-bone , and then somewhat lower down
it must be clever , witty , and effective , must at one and the same time wound him to the quick and impress him tremendously
the return of the pencil was of the simplest formality , quite after hans castorp ’ s heart— indeed , he prided himself on it no little , in the vainglorious state his intimacy with hippe produced
this lower lip came out rather strong and full under the short , slightly drooping moustache , with a smile which made a most charming harmony with the blue eyes , a little severe , but a little smiling too , their gaze half absent and half shy
she departed in anguish and despair , deaf to all the consolations her parents could give
looking back upon the school life now ending ,
the young men in their turn thanked their host and took their leave , urged by naphta to come again
he is already old—yes ; but even so , i could well understand how you as a woman could love him madly
did the soul go to heaven im-mediately after death , or did bliss first begin with the resur-rection of the flesh ?
he himself declared his health to be perfect , magnificent ; and one could read in his eyes the , creative energy with which he daily arose to his task
others were fishing , lying prone on a jut of rock , waggling one leg in the air , holding the line out over the water , approaching their heads in talk
here , suddently , the consul , to his own great surprise and chagrin , burst out laughing
that prince who gave behrens his title always did it , they say
let us go together , our way is the same : the path on the right that shall lead to the halls of the mightiest dis ’ —ah , virgil , virgil !
they and the writing-table or , rather , roll-top desk , which stood between the windows , were of carved mahogany ; the glass doors of the bookcases were lined with green silk
there were for instance monkish figures , the invention of popular fantasy , who , quite in the spirit of luther , had set up wine , women , and song in opposition to the ascetic idea
he said it aloud and snorted through his nose , bent over , sobbed , and could not control himself
i was sure that you , as a literary man— settembrini put out his hand , laid his head on one side , and closed his eyes
and this also was confirmed by the chorus amid an ever-increasing tumult
true , the sundays , particularly the fortnightly one with the concert—it was the second hans castorp had spent in this situation—gave him a fixed point
i recall that we paused by the cow trough , took a few steps away from the path and looked into it , with the reflection of the setting sun in our faces
he kissed her again , on the lips and the eyes

clarissa , she said , loved her profession and did not falter in pursuit of it , despite a certain coldness on the part of the public , carping critics , and the impertinent cruelty of this or that producer who tried to distract her by calling tempo , tempo !
it is , if i am not mistaken—look , ladies and gentlemen , look , my child
we , the bourgeoisie -- the third estate , as we have been called -- we recognize only that nobility which con-sists of merit ; we refuse to admit any longer the rights of the indolent aristocracy , we repudiate the class distinctions of the present day , we desire that all men should be free and equal , that no person shall be subject to another , but all subject to the law
is it not well done that our language has but one word for all kinds of love , from the holiest to the most lustfully fleshly ?

i-ie was also a good fellow and an artist , and the fact that adrian and he were later actually per du and called each other by their first names i should like not to regard as a cheap triumph of schwerdtfeger 's mania for pleas- ing people , but rather to refer it to his honestly recognizing the value of this extraordinary human being
frau stöhr became almost hysterical
herr modersohn pulled up the chair with trembling hands , and the director sat down beside the dais
do you think that jealousy dwells in the height and not also , , in 'the depths ?
but he does not see them , this fat man with the snub nose !
frau permaneder 's dignity became majestic , and the smile of the misses buddenbrook more and more pointed
he added after a pause : i should not like to be going with it
he did not even consider going to the courts with it
that might have been rough on all of our corns !
he answered and answered wildly -- the quarrel reached a height far greater than the one that had signalized herr permaneder ?
my words , i say , betray a state of mind in anguished conflict between a pal- pitating impulse to communicate and a profound distrust of lly own adequacy

when you postulate independent being for individuals , when you transfer the essence of things from the universal to the particular phenomenon , which thomas aquinas and bonaventura , as good aristotelians , did , then you destroy all unity between the world and the highest idea ; you place the world outside of god and make god transcendent
of the caricature of humanism not adrian but shake- speare was guilty , and from shakespeare too come the ideas wrenched out of their order in which the conceptions culture and barbarism play such a singular role
and there was a stink—the shock went to my sense of smell and i got an awful stench of hydrogen sulphide , the way it must smell in the bad place ; with all that i heard myself laughing as i went off—not the way a human being laughs—it was the most indecent , ghastly kind of laughing i ever heard

but the distinction was not such a simple one to make
in short , it might even be said that such an excursion was more fitting , morally spoken , than many another , than the cinematograph or the bob-sleigh races , for example—and surely it was no more than proper to make those lying up there a visit once in a way , as a comradely attention , provided one did not regard it as in the same class with an ordinary walk or excursion to a point of interest
i will not assert that i have understood all your involved german ideas ; but it sounds human and good , and you are good , a good young man

it would seem perfectly weird to me
after all , his father 's second marriage had been of much the same kind
there is a letter which adrian at about the time of the bullinger dinner wrote to schwerdtfeger , who should of course have destroyed it but which , partly out of sentiment , partly as a trophy he did in fact preserve
we may hope that the reasonable frau ziemssen drew comfort therefrom ; his assurances , at least , were in a very large degree justified by the event

his contemplation of its inner aspect was bound up in the young man ’ s mind with a host of problems and discriminations , not of a kind the good joachim had need to concern himself with , but for which hans castorp had come to feel as a civilian responsible
he has sunk down in the bed , with his knees wide apart
i remember this conversation most vividly
at five o'clock frau permaneder let herself be carried away by her feelings , and committed an indiscretion
for at that depth light has codle to an end ; or rather , a new , un- known , irrelevant , vorld here begins , irrto which adrian with his guide , vent down to nearly fourteen times that depth , some thirty-six hundred feet , and there remained for half an hour , al- most every molllent painfully awarc that a pressure of five hun- dred thousand tons rested upon their shelter

he was grown strong and sturdy , and his manly clothes made him look still older
in this building lights were beginning to show
so much for tonight about the national sanction
it took place in the break between the last two periods , a history and a drawing hour for hans castorp ’ s form ; the pupils were walking up and down , or standing about in groups , or lounging against the glazed abutments of the school-building wall
then he too went away—to tell truth , hans castorp was not sorry to see the backs of them both , the narrow-eyed one and the pedagogue ; he could the better devote himself to the singing , and draw comfort from the reflection that all over the world , even in the most extraordinary places , music was made—very likely even on polar expeditions

since the previous morning they had not spoken of what lay before them , and silently now they moved down the corridor together
he attended lectures in philosophy and the history of music ; read and t : xcerpted in the

i could not help marking my farewell by ' calling him by name - his first name , as was natural to me , but he did not follow suit
he smoked his pipe , talked in his curious dialect , and displayed an inexhaustible power of sitting still
hans castorp , indeed , had so much food for thought in the events of the past three weeks , so much to ponder in his present state and what might come of it , that although two bound volumes of an illustrated periodical from the berghof library lay upon his night-table , he had no need to resort to them
hans castorp sat near the open door to the music-room , with his back to the portières , on a chair that happened to be standing there , a plush-covered chair in renaissance style , with a high straight back , and no arms
he had his father 's deep-set blue observant eyes , though their expression was perhaps more dreamy ; but his features were clearer-cut and more serious , his nose was prominent and aquiline , and his cheeks , half-covered with a fair curling beard , were not so plump as the old man 's

kaisersaschern harboured more than one such specimen ; the most popular , most teased and feared was cellar-lise , so called because she lived in a basement in little brassfounder 's alley - an old woman whose figure had so assimilated itself to popular prejudice that even the most unaf- fected could feel an archaic shudder at meeting her , especially when the children were after her and she was putting them to : flight by spitting curses
and now and then his breast heaved as he caught his breath and was seized with his bronchial cough

winged by his genius for flirtation , and , as i fully believe , all unconscious that in substituting his own wooing for adrian 's , his declaration of love remained bound up with an offer of marriage which of his own motion , considering his nature , would never have entered his flirtatious head
now , if that keeps on a year or two , and all goes well , the lung gets healed
the sound of voices met the consul and his companion a they entered through the narrow door
i beg your pardon ?
but i also think that a pre- cise account is no longer useful or desirable
the servants had more respect for her than for any one else in the family ; it was she who held the services morning and evening now , for the consul could not read aloud without getting a feeling of oppression in the head
but they had done well to don overcoats , driving would be cool
he wants nothing , buys nothing , and gives nothing away
but really one might ask if this were just the right time for so many large words
imperceptibly that leaf had turned

all the gentlemen turned a moment to press the hands of the sons and brother of the dead once more
a sudden noisc'behind him made him start and turn around
he whispered ; then his eyes overflowed , he saw no more
i will not pretend to being more sharp-sighted than i am
without adrian we covered the first hour through the flat and frozen countryside , beguiling the time with sandwiches and red wine brought by my wife
the other trees of the region , whether towering or stunted , were evergreen pines and firs , invincible against the assaults of this irregular winter , which might scatter its snow-storms through all the months of the year : only the many-shaded , rust-red tone that lay over the forest gave notice , despite the glowing sunshine , of a declining year
so that is why you called him padre !
his large nose screwed into countless tiny wrinkles
his nerves were terribly affected by the sleepless night he had spent
here on the left side , the lower jaw
goodness , how fast they got through
the cracks in this door were carefully stopped with cotton-wool , and there was nothing to be seen through its panes but the whitish-grey mist beyond
no , all that is not quite right
with all due reserve it must be asked whether a man who himself belongs among the ailing can give himself to the cure or care of others as can a man who is himself entirely sound
pushing and shoving -- entirely without courtesy or elegance
he communicated with the husband , and a plea of mutual incompatibility was set up as ground for the divorce
but when you get silent : when somebody says something and you are suddenly dumb , and withdraw your-self , quite elegant and remote , and repulse people like a wall and leave the other fellow to his shame , without any chance of justifying himself -- !
after all , did they not in a sense belong to the family loo ?
but so far there are only the acoustic indications ; real diagnostic certainty we shall only arrive at when i am about again , and the x-ray and photography have taken place
consul d�ann cried out , in his broadest accent
are you subject to them ?
he : let that be
and so , when the year was almost half gone , in the month of may , leverklihn , by various means , invited a company to pfeif- fering , all his friends and acquaintances , even some , , , horn he knew but little or not at all , a good many people , as many as thirty : partly by written cards , partly through me , and again by sonle of those invited passing on the invitation to others
if you asked her , she would turn this way and that way , and consider -- but she would find nobody
i admit that you can ’ t talk about his cleverness
he did not , indeed , appear at the early meals of the day , but took them , in company with madame chauchat , in their salon , as they often did of late
by the new year he would be promoted to a subalternship—and sent a photograph of himself in the uniform of an officer
you once got permission from father -- why , tom , said christian reflectively , i would really rather study
but he has a sparse whisker , you could almost count the hairs ; and his eyes are very small and pale , hardly any colour to them at all
i suppose they are very respectable affairs—except possibly they get a little drunk , but nothing like what it is at the corps-students ’ —
green shades diffused the light over the three rows of desks
servant , mademoiselle , he said , as he carefully lifted tony from the caleche
oh , it is so sad , so hard !
erica rejoiced at every crow she saw ; and ida jungmann , wearing her mackintosh and carrying her umbrella , as she al-ways did even in the most settled weather , rejoiced with her like a good governess who shares not only outwardly but in-wardly in the childish emotions of her charge
but after such a day , when he had not seen echo , he liked to go when the child was put to bed , softly , hardly seen , to his
and there they found his lifeless body , the mouth still full of half-masticated cake , the crumbs upon his coat and upon the wretched table
likewise the parents , retired major gerngross and wife , were touched and pleased ; and since it was impossible , for them , as complete strangers , to guess the givers , fräulein schildknecht could not—she confessed it— refrain from revealing the cousins ’ identity
he was an eccentric , hardly ever seen by anybody , busy on his dunghill with his dogs , his chickens , and his vegetable-patch : a large man in top-boots , with a green frie/e jacket
vvhen he went to work , he would no longer be free
yet again , when he came to speak of the unification and universal well-being of the liberated peoples , there mingled a sound—he neither knew nor willed it , of course—as of the rushing pinions of eagles
but it ’ s a pity you won ’ t be here in the winter—you ’ re stopping only eight weeks , i hear ?
as far as i am concerned , i can manage
there was the morning inquiry , as to whether he had slept well , itself purely rhetorical and summary ; and that aside , the hofrat did not address him with any particularity ; while adriatica von mylendonk—she had , at the time of which we write , a stye in a perfect state of maturity—did so seldom , in fact scarcely ever
but this very alternation of vagueness and clarity , of dull incompre-hension with sudden bursts of light , kept him enthralled and breathless , and the hours vanished without his looking up from his book or changing his position in his chair
cause it seemed a strange thing for him to do
some-times , entirely by accident , perhaps on a walk with the family , he would go into a mill for a chat with the miller , who would feel himself much honoured by the visit ; and quite en passant , in the best of moods , he would conclude a good bargain
his classes were much too entertaining
no , here i must really corroborate herr settembrini , hans castorp mixed in the dispute , which he had been following as they went , regarding attentively each speaker in turn , with his head on one side
one accepts part payment to convince oneself for the time of a debtor 's ability to pay
but she lost no time in selling me an excellent thermometer ; if you would like to convince yourself , you can ; it is there on the wash-hand-stand
in order to do so , hovvever , one would have to preserve for them while ascending the same tremendous atmospheric pressure they were used to and adapted to in their environment - the same that rested on our diving-bell - a disturbing thought
then he mustered his english to inquire of his neighbour on the right what sort of tea she was drinking ( it was made of rose-hips ) and if it tasted good , which she almost passionately affirmed ; then he watched people coming and going in the room ; the first breakfast , it appeared , was not regarded as a regular meal , in any strict sense
it may be that , it can only injure it , unless by simply speaking with it , and so lingering it out
what did herr settembrini think about delusions ; which were a mixture of actuality and dream , perhaps less strange in nature than to our crude , everyday processes of thought ?
but at the middle of the month he had crocked up again , and complained bitterly of his luck
it was most agreeable to hear him
hans castorp put a dash of cognac in his , to make it more palatable
it was a type of face which in this instance , far from seeming an abnormality , was distinctly pleasing , though odd enough to have won for him the nickname of the kirghiz among his schoolmates
a gloomy irony lay , i believe , in his , vords
of which i have never seen - though in all conscience that does not mean much , since the present writer is little versed in the precious material things of this world
madame kethelsen was about forty-eight years old
the old couple had given up their bedroom to the frau consul for the time being , to make things easier for the servants , and were sleeping in the unused room in the en-tresol
what remains with me is chagrin - and the knowledge that i deserve to be whipped

the rain did not stop
how was it justifiable for them to leave people in such uncertainty ?
and with joachim it was the same
between the hands , half-shrouded in their lace cuffs , their visibly cold , dead fingers artfully arranged to simulate life , was stuck an ivory cross
kai came up to him and put his arm across his shoulders

thus , or in some such way as in these sinister dreams , can the narrative go to work with time ; in some such way can time be dealt with in a tale
she whistled from somewhere inside , and looked at him with her silly , half-shut eyes—it was an extraordinarily unpleasant whistle , harsh and penetrating , yet hollow-sounding ; a long-drawn-out note , falling at the end , like the sound made by those rubber pigs one buys at fairs , that give out the air in a wailing key as they collapse
vrsel leverkuhn had already begun to take them on
not in the least
they lie in the raw-throated north and seem to have been a sort of compensa- tion for the rawness
he did not doubt but the matter could be settled to the satisfaction of everybody concerned
the buddenbrook ladies marked the look
that was why he was against the claims of modesty which were always put forward by those disadvantaged by nature , and declared that only good-for-nothings are modest
on the other hand , the contentual time of a story can shrink its actual time out of all measure
the reform and revision of the lodges which then took place was in the direction of strict observance in a definitely irrational and mystical , magical-alchemical sense , to which the scottish rite owes its existence
but dear me , hans castorp could carry his own coat , couldn ’ t he—and much preferred to ; he had only let the poor creature take it now and then out of sheer good feeling
and after adolf todtenhaupt , another pupil , who was but moderately prepared , and did not even know what patula , jovis arbore meant , had been railed on , buddenbrook had to say it
he probably had it made after his own design
but frau chauchat— tut , she won ’ t , won ’ t she ?
it is certainly a desperate situation , and the religious man asks hilllself whether the world really is the single work of a be- nevolent god and not rather a combined effort , i will not say with whom
joachim availed himself of his fur sack , and was not deterred from the service of the cure ; but hans castorp took refuge in his room , pushed up a chair to the hot pipes , and remained there , looking with frequent head-shakings at the enormity outside
he laughed with his mouth open , in spasms , without a trace of scorn , even good-naturedly , looking at the consul as though he were in-viting him to join in the fun
and all the time the man himself must have , if i may say so—you get such a surprise when you first enter his room and see all that silk— ah , yes , smiled settembrini , the taste is very characteristic of him
the snow blew inside his collar and melted down his back
scarcely daring to venture , but following an inner compulsion , he passed behind the statuary , and through the double row of columns beyond
behrens is a cynic himself—but he ’ s a great old bird after all , an old corps-student
but not for long
but one has to live -- so now there are notes and other debts -- five thousand thaler
they laughed over these erudite jests , and looked at hans castorp , who laughed back , raising his glass to his virgil
may i beg for admission into this charmed circle ?
he gave his short laugh
it comprehends all hermetics , all alchemy , it is nothing else than the receptacle , the well-guarded crystal retort wherein the material is compressed to its final transformation and purification
indeed , she had small ground to be cheerful ; for the way she debased herself was a sorry sight
he turned -- he would not hear any more -- he opened the door
dr faustus the railway line to the village of the passion play is for most of the distance the same as the garmisch-partenkirchen line , only branching off at the end
the enchanting turn , which we would not touch too nearly in bold words , comes on the phrases upon its branches fair , a message in my ear , yet ever in my breast ; and each time the tenor rendered them , in his clear , warm voice , with his excellent breathing-technique , with the suggestion of a sob , arid so much sensitive , beauty-loving intelligence , the listener felt his heart gripped in undreamed-of fashion ; with an effect the singer knew how to heighten by head-tones of extraordinary ardour on the lines i found my solace there , and for rest and peace are here
when you go home to supper , you feel thoroughly satisfied -- satisfied in every limb
and now the shimmering chorus of the brasses , from the trim trumpet , visible symbol of the clear call , the sprightly song , the melting cantilena , through that darling of the romantics , the vo- luted valve-horn , the slender and powerful trombone , and the cornet-a-pistons , to the weighty bass tuba
good-morning , he greeted her , i hope you slept well and dreamed of your charmer ?
then he catches a fish , in whose belly he finds the key once sunk in the depths of the sea
are you vexed with me ?
she is bathing her doll -- of course , not in real water ; i mean-� she is a wax-doll , she only -- of course
then he was silent , gazing at them all ; and finally , with a last murmured strange !
he still gazed somnambulantly , but his brows were gathered
only later did i learn to understand the composition of the spring festival as what it was : a plea to god , an atonement for sin , a work of attritio cordis , composed , as i realized with shudders , under the threat of that visitor insisting that he was really visible

nearly everybody seemed in good spirits , probably on no other grounds than that they were in numerous company and had no immediate cares
my first visit to him was very telling
the man who used to come and sit on his sofa and nod at him in the twilight had happily not recurred of late
of course , it was scarcely like a real orchestra playing in the room
thomas , to whom such orders were familiar , ran off and soon came bark with the two bottles , covered with dust and cobwebs ; and the little dessert-glasses were filled with sweet , golden-yellow malmsey from these unsightly receptacles
as for the name of the lively little old lady , joachim , as long as he had been up here , did not know it
but there is a sort of irony about it , after all -- irony ?
no , in the genuine religion of a genujne fo ] k such co ] ourless theologi- ca ] conceptions as sin and punishment never occurred , in their merely ethical causal connection
and now , just as if no one else were here -- you remember ?

he and his sons got up and shook hands with the stranger
they have already overflowed the level , rain-lashed land ; the high road , the field road , the boggy ploughed land ; we shadows stand amid and among them

and all this hans castorp let pass , with perfect equanimity , as much as to say that it was all regular and true to form
he was taken from us , that strangely seraphic little being was taken from this earth - oh , my god , why should i seek soft words for the harshest , most incomprehensible cruelty i have ever witnessed ?

why not take your revenge ?
madame buddenbrook put her hand on her daughter-in-law 's arm and looked down at her lap with a giggle
he looked across to the landscape-room , as though the real grandmamma might appear there the next minute
began the consul again , picking out and fastening his small , deep-set eyes upon a bow-legged young labourer of about two-and-twenty , with his cap in his hand and his mouth full of bread , standing in front of the steps
hardly a night passed that little johann did not start up in bed , wringing his hands with every mark of un- bearable anguish , and crying out piteously for help , as though some one were trying to choke him or some other awful thing were happening
his round at this time lay not through the corridor , but along the balconies , and he had come through the open door of the loggia with an effect of having flown through the air
many that the gentlemen whistled through their teeth and the ladies cheered as well as they could for amazement
somewhat later settembrini appeared on the terrace
he talked to them about biopsychical projections of subconscious complexes into the objective ; about transactions of which the medial constitution , the somnambulic state , was to be regarded as the source ; and which one might speak of as objectivated dream-concepts , in so far as they confirmed an ideoplastic property of nature , a power , which under certain conditions appertained to thought , of drawing substance to itself , and clothing itself in temporary reality
he looked at his cousin , who kept his eyes cast down ; then he said : you take my words far too literally , herr settembrini
but despite all that , he knew he had a gentleman before him : the stranger ’ s easy , even charming pose and cultured expression left no doubt of that
the principle of the hollow cylinder was illustrated in the structure of the tubular bones , in such a way that the static demands were satisfied with the precise minimum of solid structure
the outraged feelings of amneris at this priestly severity had to be imagined , for here the record broke off
it was only too natural that they should not enjoy seeing these things so com- petently and carelessly dismissed
he felt a sure intuition that the moment was come to break the ban
yes , i will play -- i suppose -- though i ought not
this poor creature had perceived that , thanks to his sensibility in the matter of slamming doors , a certain emotional attitude toward the russian lady was come to subsist in her young neighbour ’ s mind

and consul hagenstrbm appeared in meng street , accom parried by herr gosch , who held his jesuit hat in his hand , crouched over like a conspirator , and peered past the maid into the landscape-room even while he handed her his card

he made up for this by his stolen commerce with the schoolmistress at table , when he would sit supporting his chin after the manner of old hans lorenz , and tax the spinster with her weakness for the charming invalid , until her face positively flamed

on the wall opposite the door were several tall hat-racks with hats and coats
they were to dine with gerda , as likewise were the krogers , the weinschenks , and the three misses buddenbrook from broad stieet , while the senator , willy-nilly , must be present at the dinner in the ratskeller
then you can not imagine the annoyance and disappointment it is for anyone like me , who have smoked from my youth up , and taken such pleasure in it
if i am to sum up the whole impression : it is as though one were lured from a firm and famil- iar setting-out into ever remoter regions - everything comes con- trary to expectation
herr andreas pringsheim , pastor marianus , succeeded thus young to the headship of st mary 's after old rolling 's sudden death
hans castorp remained silent , and nobody spoke in his place
but it seems to me that in the first place you must get out a little , have a little change , and brighten up a bit
she keeps giggling and stuffing her handkerchief in her mouth
on the contrary , joachim ’ s rash departure did—in honesty—offer his cousin a support , now , before the impossible should become utterly so , a guide and companion on a path which of himself he would never , never find again
then they could take mine , and i could find something larger for myself
then again they would spend long hours together ; taking walks hand in hand as far as the little one could go , strolling in friendly silence or chatting in echo 's little language , through the countryside lush with the season in which he had come and sv/eet with scents of lilac , alder-bush , and jasmine

it spelled out something very queer , which none of them succeeded in fathoming , it made the word , or the syllable go , and then the word slanting and then something about hans castorp ’ s room
such was the story that consul peter d�ann told at the club that night ; it flew about the town like lightning , and reached the ears of the head master , who asked for an audi-ence with consul buddenbrook
i am basted properly , like a roast , a hell-roast ; it is worth seeing , and you are invited to mingle with the deeply interested persons behind the barrier , the magistrates , the invited public , partly in turbans and partly in good old-german caps with hats on top of them
he entered and was greeted by marie with surprise and pleasure ; she was about to inform her aunt when he told her , to her increasing if obviously not unpleasant astonish- ment , that her aunt knew he was here and would come in after he had spoken with herself on a weighty and wonderful theme
i say no more
every pull is a disappointment , there is no sense in forcing it
consul dbhlmann added a lewd witticism , with the result that all the gentlemen laughed once more , through their noses

perhaps she was distressed by his stutter , which just for that reason got worse in her presence and in direct conversation with her

hans castorp later recalled that madame chauchat was wearing that day a goldenyellow sweater , with large buttons and embroidered pockets

he had filled her too full !
he spent hours in linking up , in the smallest possible space , chords that together contained all the notes of the chro- matic scale , without their being chromatically side-slipped and without producing harshnesses in their progression

she held her hand out to him ; and lo !

the consul came at six o'clock
and there was a time when you preferred novels and poetry and all that
joachim sought for a reply
the latter , of course , james assured her
he did not give any details of his industry with mr richardson of threadneedle street
ursula had thought of adrian
i thought , he said in a low , confidential voice , and turned to me suddenly , taking a step forwards and looking at me with a lost , forlorn gaze i shall never forget , i thought he would concede this much , after all , maybe just this ; but no , where should he learn mercy , who is without any bowels of compassion ?

she had in her boudoir a whole tableful of photographs of european celebrities , gratefully dedicated to the reiff hospitality
the evening before , the last evening he was about , hans castorp saw him talking to marusja , marusja of the ready laugh , the orange-scented handkerchief , the bosom fair to outward eye
i-ie had good prospects of being called one day to the university , of becoming professor , member of the academy and so on ; especially when he , a bachelor from a solid wiirzburg family , in expectancy of a good inheritance , should have enhanced his dignity by setting up a household of his own where he could gather society about him
look , it is curious - that is , of course , there is nothing curious about it , but when you make it out the first time for yourself it is curious how it all hangs together and leads round in a circle
herr ballerstedt had been too often associated with hanno 's uncle christian in all too purely human affairs , id make him inclined to conflict with johann in an official capacity
it finished with cheese straws and bon-bons , to which the guests added coffee and liqueurs

do you see a way to do that ?
as for the last , he liked to make fun of people who are constantly having a little change , constantly getting brown and strong - and nobody knew for what
he ran over with friendliness and displayed great tact in chatting with the frau consul and thomas , a� well as with gerda and tony , and even with little erica

crresus entertained some fifteen guests at seven-o'clock dinner ; he kept open house , with a trained staff , and a lady housekeeper who presided with affectedly elegant manners and obviously would have liked to marry

for a mo- ment i had listened , standing at the door , but not quite liking this i went forward and asked him what he was doing
do not venture to measure what it would mean if in this our uniquely frightful extrenity the dam should break , as it is on the point of doing , and there were no nlore hold against the boundless hatred that we have fanned to flame among the peoples round us !
so it is decided
in the allegro con fuoco the polyphony is given free rein in long lines
but your attitude toward suffering can be a european attitude ; it should not be the oriental , which in its soft abandonment inclines so readily to seek this spot
and the cold , rejoined the hofrat , where does that come from ?
in all the town there was no pleasanter topic of con-versation
it drove him on , in hanno 's presence , to self-assertion
and still , in those eyes , especially when they gave a side glance , as they often did , there was that timid and defensive look ; while the mouth closed with the old , woebegone expression which he had had even as a baby , or went slightly crooked when he explored the recesses of his mouth for a defective tooth
she dismissed the cousins with thanks and expressions of friendliness , which could not but touch them , considering her distressed state , and the bill for oxygen her departed husband had left behind him
youths were at work with horses , running hand on halter alongside their whinnying , head-tossing charges ; pulling the refractory ones on a long rein , or else , seated bareback , striking the flanks of their mounts with naked heels , to drive them into the sea
it is remarkable what charm this modest yet picturesque corner
mortal thinker , influential down the millennia , to whose mediation and sense of history vve owe our knowledge of the pythagorean conception of the world !
for the earlier selections , we may flatter ourselves , perhaps , that we have been able to communicate to the reader some understanding , more or less precise , of hans castorp ’ s intimate emotional participation in the chosen numbers of his nightly programme
it was a harmless little stone , the size of a hen 's egg , flung by the hand of some chris snut or heine voss to cele-brate the revolution ; certainly not with any bad intent , and probably not directed toward the carriage at all
the worst , the actually torturing thing , was the silence
but in a few minutes his eyes had roved from the printed page , and he sat for a long time without changing his position , gazing straight ahead of him between the portieres into the darkness of the salon
we want freedom , morten said
the rack , the pincers , the screws and tongs you saw in these chambers of torment and martyrdom represented the effort of a childish and deluded fancy to emulate what it piously believed to be the sufferings of the eternally damned
when , from the point of view of those up here , he considered life as lived down in the flat-land , it seemed somehow queer and unnatural
) , i bayed like a wolf , and i can still remember how glad everybody was when it got looser
progress , up to now , had had to do , in hans castorp ’ s mind , with such things as the nineteenthcentury development of cranes and lifting-tackle
with the intention of detracting from its weight , and so causing it to be forgotten - or more correctly , probably , to make it , out of pride , look as though that were the idea ; for i do not believe the intention existed that i , the reader , should overlook the core of the letter
soon after the holidays herr gr� went back to ham-burg , for his flourishing business demanded his personal at-tention ; and the buddenbrooks agreed with him that tony had had time enough before the betrothal to make his ac-quaintance the question of a house was quickly arranged
he had succeeded to the headship of the school after the death , soon after , of the genial and benevolent old gentleman under whose guidance hanno 's father and uncle had pursued their studirs
listen to the obsolete chord ; even by itself alone it stands for a technical general position which contradicts the actual
in its simplified form the melody is sung straight through ; whereas in the original art-song , the key changes to minor in the second of the eight-line stanzas , changes back again with beautiful effect to major in the fifth line ; is dramatically resolved in the following bitter blasts and facing the tempest ; and returns again only with the last four lines of the third stanza , which are repeated to finish out the melody
and as i have never forgotten it or the knowledgeable old codger who coined it , i think it must be counted to his honour by the posterity he invoked as witness against his spineless and torpid fellow-critics
i myself had seen the good child with adrian in the abbot 's room : he reclined in the bernheim chaise-longue while she sat very stiff-backed in the savonarola chair at the table and in touchingly plaintive , painfully high-ger- man schoolgirl accents read aloud out of a discoloured old card- board volume
thus he could take in the child- like solemnity and esoteric mystery of the magic flute , the for-
an immortal soul- but why ?
look here , have you seen my picture-gallery ?
soual democracy is at the door !
she raised her arms and let them drop , and then she fell on her knees at her mother 's side , burying her face in the folds of her gown and sobbing bitterly
severin ! -- what filoux , all of them , thomas !
that would be witty , rather than humorous , naphta retorted
you only want to have spirit synonymous with democratic progress
this had not at all altered with the years
as a business man , believe me , i am better informed than the diplomats , and the fear that we should lose independence and freedom of action is simply laughable in this case
at this point a darkening of hans castorp ’ s brows made wehsal desist , though it had more reference to the presence of the good-natured ferge , with his shrinking from the higher flights of conversation , than to any moral censorship on the part of our hero
i heard your name once or twice -- you heard my name ?
he walked down here with me
when they met someone he would put out his
my dear betsy , he said -- and he spoke as deliberately as possible , to gain time to muster his excuses -- do you think we need a man-servant ?
he often looked pale , and that not only on days when the hereditary migraine laid him low
i actually want to—
he sauntered over to his nephew 's place , with a diamond ring on his finger , a present from his mother ; and his pleasure in the toy theatre was as unaffected as hanno 's own
then he leaned back his head and closed his eyes
went through the audience , and one lady , radbruch the publisher 's wife , was encouraged by zur hohe 's words to say : one thinks one is hearing poetry
morten shouted , quite insulted
but you mean well , you mean much better , and more to my mind , than that knife-edged little jesuit and terrorist , apologist of the inquisition and the knout , with his round eye-glasses—though he is nearly always right when you and he come to grips over my paltry soul , like god and the devil in the mediæval legends
i know you mean a person can ’ t be proper with the devil supporting him from behind—but what i mean is , is he proper as a jesuit ?
yet with the sense of it i was entirely in sympathy
he was entirely estranged from his young wife , she lacked the fundamental conception , and she gave up trying to get it
was he walking by the sea , the philosopher to whom this thought first came , walking by the sea , with the faint bitterness of eternity upon his lips ?
clavdia chauchat had exchanged the customary sweater for a frock with a hint of the fanciful about it , suggesting a national costume—russian peasant , or balkan , perhaps bulgarian ; a light-coloured , flowing , and girdled arrangement , embroidered , and set with tiny tinsel ornaments
he had—that is , the house possessed among its volumes of records—a certain song , from gounod ’ s faust , valentine ’ s prayer , baritone with orchestral accompaniment , very appealing
you ’ re going to see some things you ’ ve never dreamed of—just wait
it tastes vile , but i know it ’ s good , and that will have to do me for to-day
herr gr� , betsy -- a friend of mine and a keen man of business
the water was running !
scarcely did it leave him time to follow with the pen the haunting and hunting inspirations which gave him no rest , which made hiln their slave
you are telling the truth
to work at his play , to play at his work , to bend an ambition that was half-earnest , half-whimsical , toward the accomplishment of aims that even to himself possessed but a symbolic value -- for such blithe scepticism and such an enlightened spirit of compromise , a great deal of vitality is necessary , as well as a sense of humour
ast one but oftener two or three
it was a lady who was passing through the room ; a woman , or rather girl , of middle height , in a white sweater and coloured skirt , her reddish-blond hair wound in braids about her head
because i ca not get anything else
here and there were new buildings , but also open spaces , which preserved a view toward the valley meadows
he felt for his watch ; his numbed fingers could scarcely find and draw it from his pocket
and wilh-oul more ado , having perceived the mood of the hour , he proceeded to accentuate it
but old johann did not weep
hp was re-ally feeling more or less miserable , and they would probably remain till there was a little improvement
listen to which a man in extreme agony of soul had called to- gether his fellow-men - an act of fantastic good faith , moreover , for one 's fellow-men are not meant or made to face such truth otherwise than with cold shivers and with the conclusion that , when it vvas no longer possible to regard it as poetry , they very soon unanimously and audibly came to about it
angrily i ask : can not you away with this nuisance , this icy draught ?
one , two , three , and you have finished with the whole stupid thing
and her soul will have absolutely nothing to do with mine , nor her body either , and thence come , oh , god , the torments i suffer , and therefore is my desire condemned to shame , and my body must mortify itself for ever
monic than its o wn , which speedily shattered , consumed , and extinguished it
the torture was recommended to reason , as a means to an end , the end of bringing out the indispensable confession
the father , herr hagen-str�had married a wife from hamburg , with thick , heavy black hair and larger diamonds in her ears than any one had ever seen before
the frau consul called after him
the stamp of old-world , underground neurosis which i have been describing , the mark and psychological temper of such a town , betrays itself in kaisersaschem by the many originals , eccentrics , and harmlessly half-mad folk who live within its walls and , like the old buildings , belong to the picture
the union , to be frank , could hardly be called a love-match
that is madame chauchat , she said
was it one of those so mightily
all at once everything was still
i am a bit fastidious
but it had become the rule for cerda , little juhann , and fraulein jungmann to spend the holidays at the kurhouse , in travemiinde , for the sake of hanno 's health
out of the question , cried hans castorp
a teacher is the personi- fied conscience of the pupil , confirming him in his doubt , ex- plaining his dis
no , thank goodness , his head was turned in the other direction , and he seemed to be preaching in general to all the faithful
i shan ’ t lie out on the balcony at night , hans castorp declared
you are darning , ida -- funny , i ca not imagine you doing anything else
the third day brought the blessed release
somewhere in the thick of the graves , near the heart of the acre , lay a small , flat , levelled place , the length of a man , between two rounded mounds with wreaths of everlasting hanging on their headstones
she wore her 'at as rakish as could be
she looked wonderful as she played , and although i have no notion of violin playing , i know that she knew how to sing upon her instrument ( a real stradivarius ) so that the tears nearly came into my eyes

her tendency to the macabre and bizarre made her interesting to the masculine world which paid her homage
good lord , thomas , mother could not have any actual right -- but i saw it from her point of view , and had consideration for that , as long as she lived
frau consul budd en brook , she that was a stiiwing , uncle gotlhold 's widow , passed away
altogether , out of pride she held with superiority , looked out for it , and showed herself highly surprised when she thought it did not get its due
did you see the strands ?
hans castorp was alone among four walls with his wonder-box ; with the florid performance of this truncated little coffin of violin-wood , this small dull-black temple , before the open double doors of which he sat with his hands folded in his lap , his head on one side , his mouth open , and let the harmonies flow over him
as if hans castorp had been intending to handle it carelessly or keep it after the hour !
and , in short , one can not , by their very nature , speak of these impressions otherwise than vaguely and confusedly
senator buddenbrdok followed the two gentlemen , old dr grabow and young dr langhals , out of the frau consul 's bed-chamber into the breakfast-room and closed the door
his partner , herr bur-meester , had died quite suddenly of an apoplectic stroke , in the spring of the year
the cross-bearer and the acolyte hesitated , and couldn ’ t get in
he did not hasten to let adrian know the result of his visit , overjoyed as he was to have saved his own face by the honest admission that he was not himself indif- ferent to her
for- eign commissions inspect those incredible photographs every- where displayed , and tell their countrymen that what they have seen surpasses in horribleness anything the human imagination can conceive
as it is , the cry is smothered in our throats ; like i ( ing claudius 's prayer , it can never to heaven go
i am going to die , he said to himself
the snow-laden firs , dark-green to blackness , went marching up the sides of the valley , and beneath them the snow lay soft like down pillows
for it was clear that the deviations and idiosyncrasies presented by his everyday appearance were due to incomplete , perhaps even unsuccessful adaptation ; they were the not quite eradicable vestiges of grandfather ’ s pure and genuine form
for it was all only a confirmation of what he had always known
she had cherished him fondly , read him fairy stories , and told him about the uncle who died of hiccoughs
just now , for instance , i am on my way to visit my overfilled
not any thin ' to do , dear frau senator , said frau schweige- still , one finger on her cheek , shaking her head , at sight of the half- sitting , half-lying figure
justus is certainly a charming personality , but business is not his strong point , and he has had bad luck too
'there comes fike dahlbeck , said senator gieseke
this was a fixed postulate , with which they must for the present reckon
to judge from the shadows that drove across the sky-light there must be clouds in the sky
a man of the world , just singed by our flame , weary , mildly interesting , no more
it appears that the debate in the chambers will not die down ; the struggle is so bitter that up to now not one single unanimous choice has been put before the council -- otherwise the burgomaster would at once announce an election
it drew to itself all the elements which were weary of the rationalistic twaddle of the century , and thirsting for a stronger draught of life

my poor lad , she thought , as she watched him and his cousin abandoned to mirth , telling each other a hundred anecdotes , asking each other a hundred questions , throwing themselves back in their chairs with peals of laughter
we all take care to say what will be pleasant to hear
and undertook to pierce him with her eye
i wonder if you really wanted anything different ?
soon or late , division must yield units which , even though in composition , were not organized , and which mediated between life and absence of life ; molecular groups , which represented the transition between vitalized organization and mere chemistry
as sole adornment she wore below the neck ruche a chain made of old silver coins
since i willl here , i replied , i will come with you
one day she happened to meet on the street frau consul julchen mollendorpf , born hagenstrom , into whose face she looked with a challenging , triumphant glance ; it actually dawned upon frau mbllendorpf that she had better speak first , and she did
he recalled the monday of two weeks ago , and his solitary walk , which had done him so little good ; and committed himself to the view that it was that walk which had revolutionized his system and brought to the surface the latent infection
i am not in the mood for it
a hungarian student played spirited gipsy waltzes on his fiddle ; and hofrat behrens , who chanced to be present for a quarter-hour with dr krokowski , got somebody to play the melody of the pilgrims ’ chorus on the bass notes of the piano , while he himself operated in a skipping movement with a brush over the treble , and parodied the violin counterpoint
but there are so many of them , swarming on—they can survive a bloodletting and still come on in hosts
not only from jeanette scheurl did suggestions like the last proceed , but also from the general-intendant , excellency von riedesel , whose patronage of the old instrument and old music did not indeed , as with kranich , stem from scholarly or antiquar- ian interest , but was purely conservative in its origin , a great dif ference of course
tony had moved with erica into the rooms in the second storey which her parents had occupied in the time of the elder buddenbrooks
and the time he had fixed was already past
surely that must mean—
moreover , in consequence of his father ’ s taking another position , pribislav left the school and the city ; but that was all one to hans castorp ; he had already forgotten him before he went
in his condition he could do nothing sharper than to act as though he had a slight case of tuberculosis pulmonum—it was always present anyhow
thanks to the exertions of the soloist , who gave all that he had to its execution , the piece fully asserted both its fascination and its intellectual appeal
the fanatical worship of this worthless trifle , this scrap of melody , this brief , childish harmonic invention only a bar and a half in le-ngth , had about it something stupid and gross , and at the same time something ascetic and religious -- something that contained the essence of faith and renunciation
tell me , did you ever know a single one of them ?
for this time it is not a question of a brilliant match , but just one that will make good the other one
they spoke in low tones , so that joachim , despite the fact that the glass partition only half separated them , could not make out what they said—indeed , made not the slightest effort to do so
no , he is a dear good man , and a great friend of the family and all that -- but he is no great light
ho saw herr brecht , with the forceps in his sleeve , bend over him , and noticed that little beads were standing out on his bald brow , and that his mouth was twisted
why did the donl { ey have to tell ?
what sort of theatrical ending is that , johann ?
no one from then henceforward heard anything from him
vorl { of the soul , in a court of appeal interceding , mediating , itself instinct with poetry ; where spirit and desire interpenetrate and appease each other in a way not quite free from illusion ; it is a stratum of life peculiarly informed with sentiment , in , vhich , i confess , my own humanity feels at ease , but which is not for i ; tronger tastes
then , as the shameless disturbance did not stop , she had with trembling hands kindled a light , had left her bed , thrilling with horror , repulsion , and despair , had opened the door and hurried out on to the landing in her slippers , the light in her hand -- to the top of the ladder that went straight up from the house door to the first storey
and he got up , pushed back his chair , and turned toward the door
but then , voe to hirn !
naphta had flung his fur cloak on the ground , so that its mink lining showed
own age and only in a later one receive historic honour
we have to let him instruct and correct
and that , sometimes , it shows no spots although there is something there ?
hans castorp looked at her , with his chin in his collar , like his grandfather—it was laughable to see how like the old man he looked
in the first plane , i have never done any business with herr von maiboom , and this would be a rather strange way to begin
in certain islands east of dutch new guinea , youths and maidens prepared a love charm from the bark of a tree—it was probably poisonous , like the manzanilla tree , or the antiaris toxicaria , the deadly upas-tree of java , which could poison the air round with its steam and fatally stupefy man and beast
the ecclesiastical policy of indulgence practised by the spirit he designated as love—this to refute the nihilism of the ascetic principle
but there was not a white hair in the smooth coiffure beneath the mourning cap
look at his heart , and the hofrat lifted his huge hand again from his thigh and pointed with his forefinger at the pulsating shadow
thus in my friend 's musical fabric a five- to six-note series , beginning with b and ending on e flat , \\lith a shifting e and a between , is found strikingly often , a basic figure of peculiarly nostalgic character , which in differing harmonic and rhythmic garb , is given now to this part no , v to that , often in its inversion , as it were turned on its axis , so that while the intervals remain the sanle , the sequence of the notes is altered
many false conceptions are held concerning the nature of tedium
you find him so ?
i have held your signatures as long as johann buddenbrook was good -- in the meantime i could write up the interest on the capital and increase the per cent
more plainly than ever this characteristic came out during my visit and to me , i can not say why , it was as though the touch me not !
the others called him the socialist , because the social was his passion
as he paused , after that , hans castorp asked , affecting surprise : against what ?
and now herr settembrini stood here in the suddenly illuminated room—hans castorp , who had raised himself on his elbow and turned blinking toward the door , recognized him and flushed
i put in the form of a question what is nothing more than the description of a condition that has its explanation in the thing it- self as well as in its artistic and formal aspect
what was going on ?
you must not imagine they are in despair over my defection
my shop , as we students said , was in the hansastrasse , a narrow lane behind the church of st moritz , which might well have run its anach- ronistic course in kaisersaschern
even his burning face , his trembling limbs , the peculiar and half-intoxicated mingled sensations of excitement and fatigue were pleasurable , reminding him as they did of that familiar feeling induced by the sea air , which could sting one like whips , and yet was so laden with sleepy essences
you are quite right , he said
and i love erica very much , although griin-lich says i am not fond of children
no , c ’ est vraiment une bonne âme , a simple nature , not exposed to intellectual dangers , tu sais
it is uncommonly kind of you—i must ask myself if i really—that is , if there is anything—
mazurka ’ is capital , he said

tell me first what freedom is , he went on
suous simultaneity - most magnificent and heavy with meaning , if a bit too clever after all , in comparison with certain revelations of the elemental in the art of the pure musicians , beethoven and bach ; for example , in the prelude to the cello suite of the latter - also an e-flat major piece , built up in primitive triads
they exchanged experiences upon the best way to keep cigars—particularly imported ones
the wall before him , studded with single groups of trees , was steep , but looked as though one might wind to the right and get round it by climbing a little way up the slope
yes , joachim said , i must go lie down
when the moral courage to make decisions and distinctions between reality and deception degenerates to that point , then there is an end of life , of judgment , of the creative deed : the process of decay sets in , moral scepsis , and does its deadly work
and here , at the source and fount so to speak , with two specialists in the house—it would have been very strange— of course , of course
it is really beautiful to be an artist
they had a glimpse into the tiny sleeping-chamber , merely a short and narrow bedstead in the corner under the sloping roof , and a small drugget on the floor beside it ; then they turned again to the study , which was no less sparsely furnished , but orderly to the point of formality , or even frigid
one day she might relate that frau salomon was wearing the most costly lace underwear in preparation for her examination , and prided herself very much upon her appearance before the physicians on these occasions
i found in him no understanding for my un- easiness
to hans castorp , this was an experience like the one with wiedemann ’ s hair
christian mocked herr gr� so cleverly that they all had to laugh , even the consul
then the youth sat down at the round table , resting his elbow on it , and seemed , without noticing his mother , wlio was sitting at the dark window mending stockings , to busy himself with the wretched news-sheet which had nothing in it except the an-nouncements of the silver wedding of consul su-and-su
no , that is certainly news to me
the world , this narrow , lofty , isolated world up here , looked now well wadded and upholstered indeed : no pillar or post but wore its white cap ; the steps up to the entrance of the berghof had turned into an inclined plane ; heavy cushions , in the drollest shapes , weighed down the branches of the scotch firs—now and then one slid off and raised up a cloud of powdery white dust in its fall
our friend , two months deep in his second year , had been given a new place by the management at a near-by table , diagonally to his old one , between that and the good russian table
and keep an eye on my father
in such matters he was accustomed to command , and the weight of his personality would always have been decisive , even if he had not been , as he was , master and mover of the expedition
i am afraid so , herr sc noter
oh , good heavens , because i could not endure him , she cried out in a passion
and still i did not know whether i should give the preference to these fantasies on the light in light or to the introspective , more- thought-than-seen pieces - those where all is rejected questioning , wrestling with the unfathomable , where doubt springs at the foot of truth and even the cherub who looks into god 's depths measures not the gulf of the everlasting resolve
for vvhat mall-invented one should she choose , to ex- press herself in ?
he had never heard of the ecclesiastical conception of indulgence , under which was to be classified one of the sacraments of the church—namely , marriage , not in itself an absolute good , like the other sacraments , but only a protection against sin , countenanced in order to set bounds to sensual desire ; that the ascetic principle , the ideal of complete chastity , might be upheld , without at the same time opposing an unpolitic harshness to the flesh ?
i heard that up in the woods , and i shall remember it all my life
that date , of course , is the point , , , here i now stand in my actual writing and not the one up to which my narrative has pro-

popinet had gone to bed to dream of burglars
and hardly had the back-building been demolished when a new , neat , and airy structure rose in its place , which fronted on bakers ' alley and was intended for shops and warehouses
you are already twenty , and you have still a good many tricks of the trade to get used to , quite hard enough to stimulate you
he seemed to see hofrat behrens walking down the garden path , with bent knees and arms hanging stiffly in front of him , adapting his long and somehow solitary-looking stride to the time of distant march-music
for his part , he thought well of the idea , he thought there would be boundless happiness in the experience
what sort of voluntarism is this you are giving vent to ?

dr faustus such a meaning was always to be deduced from enigmatic sayings , and keen-eared piety always heard it in them

how tre-mendously strong the stork must be , to carry all that !
then he folded his hands upon the winebespotted sheet , and laid his head on the left shoulder , the one toward his guest , with the effect that his face was lightly turned away
not at all , answered joachim , shrugging again
\tv ould you like to retain the capitalist system , deutschlin , asked arzt - because it keeps alive the memory of the insecurity of human life ?
a high-shouldered functionary , a brisk intermediate some-thing between a waiter and a major-domo , had in charge the outward ordering of the solemnity
where love of wisdom lifts itself to contemplation of the highest essence , the source of being , the study of god and the things of god , there , one might say , is the peak of scientific dignity , the highest and noblest sphere of knowledrre , the apex of all thinking ; to the inspired intellect its most exalted goal is here set
quite simply ; since the relation to infinity of any size you chose to postulate was as zero
everyone can see we are talking about her and that you have said something to make me get red
behrens jerked his head in the direction of the salon , and hans castorp followed him thither
he took up a bottle of white wine that had a little silver stag on the stopper ; and with one of his fastidious , elegant motions , he held it on its side and examined the label
let me assure you that mankind is about to find its way back to this point of view
it was the same thing , he said , with the change-over of music from monody to part-music , to harmony , which people liked to think of as cultural progress , when actually it had been just an acquisition of barbarism
i have known people like teary trieschke , and i was married to bendix gr� , and i know the dissipated creatures there are here in this town
that might perhaps alarm me , the more because there was about the 'widened gaze a fixity - or shall i say it was a stare ?
it was the existence of the actually impossible-to-exist , of a half-sweet , half-painful balancing , or scarcely balancing , in this restricted and feverish process of decay and renewal , upon the point of existence
it was too late for coffee , in any case
she loved her palms , they gave so much elegance to the room
it is the same with all families

they addressed themselves to the glass with the extreme of courtesy
gr� , she said more quietly , why do you smile and talk about our ameans ' ?
it takes two to make a divorce , my child

a lament of such gigantic dimensions is , i say , of necessity an expressive work , a work of expression , and therewith it is a work of liberation ; just as the earlier music , to which it links itself across the centuries , sought to be a liberation of ex : eression
in case of a sec-ond marriage of my dearly loved older daughter antonie , in view of the fact that eighty thousand marks have already been applied to her first marriage , the sum of seventeen thou-sand thaler current must not be exceeded
naphta and settembrini , for instance , had copies sent them , which hans castorp saw in their hands , and remarked , to his surprise , that they too perused them with bitter concentration
she went out into the verandah , looking , in her while pique frock , perfectly fresh , and in the gayest of tempers
hans castorp was not up here to be company for joachim , he was a patient himself
we look at it , our humanistic-æsthetic eye pictures it among scenes far other than these : we see these youths watering horses on a sunny arm of the sea ; roving with the beloved one along the strand , the lover ’ s lips to the ear of the yielding bride ; in happiest rivalry bending the bow
a beer and cheese -- but herr dieckmann could not understand him , and began with great fluency : everything we have , herr consul : crabs , shrimps , all sorts of sausages , all sorts of cheese , smoked eel , smoked salmon , smoked sturgeon -- fine , dieckmann ; give us what you have
christian did not deny it ; he merely gazed aimlessly about
what are you saying ?
settembrini , asked for suggestions , proposed that they give the hofrat a newly projected encyclopædic work called the sociology of suffering ; but he found only one person to agree with him , a book-dealer who sat at hermine kleefeld ’ s table
psycho-analytic treatment , by the most modern methods was called attention to by means of spaced type
that was certainly a very important nerve you happened to hit on , herr hofrat , he said
or they would make general remarks on the subject of the undignified vanity of dyeing one 's hair
herr grunlich 's face was all mottled with red ; but he had dressed carefully in a respectable-looking black coat and pea-green trousers like those in which he had made his first visits in meng street

it was raining now , and the snow in the streets had turned to a slush that spattered as they walked
well , he had pulled himself together , and had revirwed the whole situation ; had reassured , reinforced , made head
he read about the struggles of zeus before he arrived at the headship of the gods ; and every now and then he listened into the other room , where they were going at length into the future of poor aunt clothilde
you kept urging me
but to judge from the way you have just characterized herr von maiboom and his prospects , i should say there can be nu security in his case
inflammation of the lungs then ?
hans castorp felt rather hurt to have krokowski circle round and leave him out—even though a tête-à-tête with the gentleman was something he was far from hankering after
i hardly think , she told herr pfiihl , that he is suited for solo work ; and on the whole i am glad , for it has its bad side apart from the dependence of the soloist upon his ac-companist , which can be very serious too ; -- if i did not have you , for instance ! -- there is always the danger of yielding to more or less complete virtuosity
there was little outward sign of the excitement that reigned everywhere : the streets were quiet , and people
truly the time flew
we betook our- selves to the nike room
hans castorp regarded the picture on his knee
the pupil who was then reciting interrupted himself ; even herr modersohn got up and listened
when he had done , he leaned back against his down quilt , with the magic table cleared before him , and looked into the growing dusk , to-day ’ s dusk , yet scarcely distinguishable from the dusk of yesterday or last week
yes , friederike chimed in
anyhow he denied being embarrassed by the comparison
but in the end she hit upon another plan and communicated it to her table-mates , to their great delight : she had the management refund her the ten francs and insert it in frau iltis ’ s weekly bill

the latter was very beautiful , of simple and elegant form , in the severe taste of the early nineteenth century
joachim agreed , and they acquired two camel ’ s-hair rugs like his own , in a fine and well-stocked shop in the english quarter
yes , that 's it , she said gratefully
for a long lime now , there had been dessert only on sundays
tom was lounging in an easy-chair beside her smoking his cigarette , while clara and clothilde sat opposite each other at the window
it went fast , and he was next in turn
besides it all , there was the field in which later was to lie his own particular interest : the confusion of the yards , the mammoth bodies of great ships , asiatic and african liners , lying in dry-dock , keel and propeller bare , supported by props as thick as tree-trunks , lying there in monstrous helplessness , swarmed over by troops of men like dwarfs , scouring , whitewashing , hammering ; there were the roofed-over ways , wrapped in wreaths of smoke-like mist , holding the towering frames of rising ships , among which moved the engineers , blueprint and loading scale in hand , directing the work-people
herr settembrini saw that all chance of conversation , of a human interchange of ideas , would be out of the question , and flung up his hand with a gesture of resigned despair
but to come now , like this -- my dear child , i beg your pardon , but it was -- foolish
for whom , indeed , should he have taken pains ?
on this piece of land the senator thought to build his house ; and he surveyed it with a speculative eye v/hen he passed the spot on his way to the harbour
you should see her teeth when she laughs
but now that the monstrous national perversion which then held the continent , and more than the continent , in its grip , has celebrated its orgies down to the bitter end ; now that its prime movers have had themselves poisoned by their physi- cians , drenched with petrol and set on fire , that nothing of them might remain - now , i say , it might be possible to thinl { of the publication of my labour of love
he repealed it stupidly
rather rude and familiar , seems to me

tell me , why were you so quiet thursday afternoon at dinner , if i may ask ?
it turned out that these growths were entirely unorganic in their origin ; they existed by virtue of chemicals from the apothe- cary 's shop , the blessed messengers
i too turned disapprovingly towards the speaker , though privately i was grateful for what he said
the most important matter is still out-standing , my dear wenzel
but i find one ought to be grateful up here for a bit of music
it would have been culpable inhumanity to deny that an impure soul could produce by a mere look , whether deliberate or not , physically harmful effects in others , for instance in little children , whose tender substance was especially suscepti- ble to the poison of such an eye
he must have a lot of money , so we can furnish elegantly
some of the bystanders , who understood the matter better , began to laugh rudely and heartily ; and although few even heard carl 's answer , the laughter spread until the whole crowd of republicans stood shaking good-naturedly
at least so thought hans castorp , as with the others he waited in the greatest suspense to hear in what form love driven below the surface would reappear
only once—and then only for a moment—had he ever seen grandfather as he was here represented , on the occasion of a procession to the rathaus
and then , thermometer in mouth , with sack and pack , he went to lie down , while hans castorp began at once to wash and change for dinner—which was rather less than an hour away
in his mind was a picture which he longed to reproduce : it was a picture of hanno ' a great-grandfather , whom he himself had known as a boy : a clear-sighted man , jovial , simple , sturdy , humorous -- why could not little johann grow up like that ?
this motive , and no momentary fad—no , nor yet any native love of bodily exertion—was what impelled him to learn the use of skis

then he shook hands with consul kroger and sat down at the table with herr marcus opposite him
that is a magnificent commission , just in your line , i should think
what you mean to say is that i should leave for home ?
joachim , at this , searched his face in some alarm
his little deep eves were wide open and surrounded by red rims down to the cheek-bones , as his father 's used to be in anger
hans castorp saw here the opportunity to carry out his plan with the pot of flowers and the good wishes for speedy recovery
he makes funny motions with his head , like a bird , and talks all the time , so i call him the magpie , but gr� has forbidden b u d d e m b r o o k s me to say that , because magpies steal , and heir kesselmeyer is an honourable man
she wore rouge too , but was not immoral , being far too witless ; she merely rambled through the streets with her nose in the air , accompanied by pug dogs with satin saddle-cloths
when christian was at the club , the frau consul and ida jungmann sat at four o'clock dinner alone at the round table , in which there was now not a single extra leaf
obviously the elelnent of sin , of sensua ] ity , of evil lust altogether , is conjured away out of marriage - for lust is certainly
but twenty or thirty were scarcely the eighth part of the riches that lay asking to be enjoyed
joachim deserted—deserted to the colours—funny , but it can be done
herr weinschenk had not the faintest resemblance to herr permaneder ; and he was dif-ferentiated frnm bendix gr� by his position as an oldestablished official with a fixed salary -- which , of course , did not preclude a further career
after the fish followed an excellent meat dish , with garnishings , then a separate vegetable course , then roast fowl , a pudding , not inferior to yesterday evening ’ s , and lastly cheese and fruit
not content with that , she must go back into the th century , to the oldest buddrnbrook of whom there was knowledge , to the one who was councillor in grahau , and the roslork tailor who had been very well off ' and had so many rhildren , living and dead
i will confess to you that ever since zurich she has been very much in my mind , quite seri- ously , so that it is hard to bear the thought of the meeting as a mere episode , after which she will go away and i may never see
on his eighth birthday , april th , , hanno played before the assembled family a fantasy of his own romposition
lord , herr consul , i say we wants a republic ; that 's wat i be savin '
that 's the first thing

i must have another try
dr krokowski had issued a strict prohibition against any further experimentation on the part of the laity upon fräulein brand ’ s mysterious gifts
f or a while after helmut left , as it were while he was within hearing , we spoke of indifferent things
the snow came silently down
accordingly , at this hour they assembled before the portal of the berghof—hans castorp , ferge and wehsal
he sighed , as if he did not wish to say more , and was silent
pietism , by virtue of its overemotional na- ture , would indeed make a sharp division between piety and sci- ence , and assert that no movement , no change in the scientific picture , can have any influence on faith
i do hope you are enjoying the soup , heir pastor , she said several times
instead her awakened femininity turned straightway to another man , towards whom thus far she had consciously felt only tranquil sisterly feel- ings - and now others had been released in her
true , by the destruction of our cities from the air , germany has long since be- come a theatre of war ; but it still remains for it to become so in the most actual sense , a sense that we can not and may not con- ceive

there might be a postcard there for one of us
get along now , into the caboose with you—march !
thomas stalked along with the calm-ness of despair
the night was the harder half of the day , for hans castorp woke often , and lay not seldom hours awake ; either because his slightly abnormal temperature kept him stimulated , or because his horizontal manner of life , detracted from the power , or the desire , to sleep
hans castorp gave vent to several heart-felt curses—of which his lips were too stiff to pronounce the labials
or when she becomes aware with whom she lives in tender wedded love , and says to him : my sweet son , thou art my only child , thou art my spouse and lord , thou art mine and my brother 's son , my sweet child , and thou my god , why hast thou let me be born !
did the paralysis of the sweat-secretions depend upon contraction of the skin ?
as the serum was prepared from hans castorp ’ s own blood , the inoculation with it could introduce into his system no deterrent not already present there
when i was driving from the station this afternoon , i passed nielsen the porter , and he took off his hat and made me a deep bow , and i bowed back to him -- not arrogantly , not a bit -- i waved my hand , just the way father used to
she is spirit herself
these munich trams , painted in the bavarian light-blue , are heavily built and either for that reason or some characteristic of the subsoil make considerable noise
at least , you must know there are twelve of them , three for each season , the ascending and the declining year , the circle of constellations through which the sun passes
did the way they put him off with his gaffky number drive him to the verge of despair ?
impossible that madame chauchat should know nothing of the threads that were weaving between her and a certain table
but you know what will happen : if we ask him , he will send the child a heavy gold service and refuse to be thanked for it !
these names wore for him the nimbus of conservative author- ity , and here they were being assigned to the realm of modernistic disintegration
she scolded him , but she was proud to have him express so freely in her presence the views and opinions which she knew he concealed from his parents
it tasted and smelled of chloroform
a little business , my dear lady , with the brewery at walkmill
it was some time after this that they took up karen karstedt ; and both hans castorp and joachim felt peculiarly drawn to her
if there were a son , gr� would keep him -- another time she said : i have thought a great deal about the four years of my marriage , father
but does not some one rely any longer on his estimable herr pa -- no hints , either
mynheer sat with his jaw dropped and his hands palm upward on the carriage rug spread across his and madame ’ s knees
it was a rather short oval , this face , with somewhat pointed chin , a not very regular nose , slightly flat and a little tilted , and a tranquil mouth , neither voluptuous nor severe
he stopped , he blinked his lashes free of water drops , knocked off the snow that like a coat of mail was sheathing his body in front—and it struck him that progress , under the circumstances , was more than anyone could expect
it doesn ’ t mean much , as behrens always says ; he told me at the last regular examination it would take another half year , pretty certainly
even at a distance , he began making obsequious gestures with his broad-brimmed grey hat , and as he drew near he took one last very long step , and arrived describing a half-circle with the upper part of his body , by this means bowing to them all at once
that was the sunday , and the monday
ami there may well up in him something like a feeling of shame for a neglected duty ; a sense of renewed energy , courage , and hope ; he may recognize a bond existing still between him and that stirring , colourful , callous existence which he thought he had left so far behind him
settembrini smiled , fanning himself with the magazine , which he still held in his hand
i only need to make a few payments and advances here and there to get on my feet again and restore confidence
i ’ m perfectly worn out with laughing , he said , and breathed through his mouth
the 'way the music strives upward out of the difficulties , the artful confusion , the mingled distresses of its first part to the tender light of the final cry and there is touchingly resolved - all that i straightway found admirable and did not hide my delighted approbation
but he was not merely a man of honour either , people nlis- took him when they thought so , a shallow amoroso and man of pleasure : that was loathsome
he turned away and made as much noise as possible while he concluded his toilet
but the italian courteously bade them both not to disturb themselves , and made them sit down again , while he maintained his easy pose before them
tiut it was aberration to assert that god permitted evil on account of the good ; for nothing was to be considered good except it corre- sponded to the idea good in itself , and not by accident
he would not confess it -- he was himself aghast at the fact , and would pettishly deny it when the subject was mentioned
as social events my productions rank next after the premieres of diaghilev 's ballet russe - if they do rank after them
it made gooseflesh and shivers run over her
there , engineer , you have the hostility the intellect feels against nature , its proud mistrust , its high-hearted insistence upon the right to criticize her and her evil , reason-denying power

i know you are a maiden cherished and sheltered by the most loving care
a black-clad gentleman sat at a tiny table and served the soup out of a silver tureen
how well , for instance , we talked , going home after n onnenmacher 's class , about that im-

on the day after mother 's death , you propose to display your lack of filial feeling by -- only because the subject came up
even to alter the direction of his gaze he was obliged to conquer a great disinclination ; and , added to all this , the hateful burning in his face had reached the same height as yesterday , his cheeks felt puffy with heat , he breathed with difficulty ; his heart pounded dully , like a hammer muffled in cloth
's a good bit of truth in that , herr se noter
a week later he said to him : well , shall we work together , young man ?
with misgiving we examined the card , which gave us all the informa- tion we needed ; it read : saul fitelberg
and conversely , a full and interesting content can put wings to the hour and the day ; yet it will lend to the general passage of time a weightiness , a breadth and solidity which cause the eventful years to flow far more slowly than those poor , bare , empty ones over which the wind passes and they are gone
that sort of thing may happen again -- to speak frankly , i am afraid it will
\ ; ve had to win , and ours was the hard trade of triumph
very interesting , said hans castorp
at tea all the various beverages were served which it is possible to serve at that meal
he had been sitting there , hardly speaking , wrapped in his cloak , his hands in his lap and his cigarette in the corner of his mouth
i could avoid it , of course , i could keep with the others all the time and not let him get near me

i promise to have proper regard for the circumstances , and the—personalities
for the wounds of the body not only emphasized its sunken state , they also corresponded in the most edifying manner to the envenomed corruption of the soul , and thereby gave rise to emotions of true spiritual satisfaction : whereas blooming health was a misleading phenomenon , insulting to the conscience of man and requiring to be counteracted by an attitude of debasement and humility before physical infirmity , which was infinitely beneficial to the soul
t ake him , monster !
thus december passed , and at the beginning of the year ' the wedding was celebrated
was all he said , nodding slowly at the girl and then turning back to gaze again
armgard herself sent me an invitation ( very fine , with a gilt edge ) , and also a letter in which she expresses herself as enchanted with her bridegroom
he went on to criticize the proprietors of all the other sanatoria in the place , praising their acquisitive talents with mordant sarcasm

who had introduced them was not afterwards easy to decide ; certainly it had not been elly brand , yet they had begun since her arrival
with powdered cheeks , in his scotch-thread drawers and red morocco slippers , he walked out on the balcony , drying his hands
he , vanted to make this much clear , he went on
for by his art the person of the beloved is elevated , froin art the emotions ever draw fresh food , when the artist 's own individual- ity is associated with the joys his art purveys
sometimes they played chess on hans castorp ’ s magic table ; joachim had brought a set of chess-men from below
not everybody gave her this opportunity , it is true
consul buddenbrook refused at first to ask him
she cried , with disproportionate joy , for she had really understood him
yet—he probably can ’ t help himself—he forces her to look westward for expansion , stirs up slumbering rivalries between st petersburg and vienna—
that would bring happiness , beyond a doubt
finally , in order to leave nothing unanswered , herr ludovico might be assured that he , the speaker , did his duty by the small civilian task which herr settembrini had been so kind as to mention , with all due reservatio mentalis ; though there was indeed a certain irony in his conforming to the standards of a classic and rhetorical educational system , whose survival the most optimistic observer could not predicate for more than a few decades
will you gainsay that you studied the best of the arts and sciences also only as specialist and amateur ?
i think he knew more or less what his partner was doing , and what the slate of affairs was at the warehouse
joachim said , and laughed curtly

his air of preoccupation was simply enormous as he uttered a stealthy look out and hastily withdrew
therese weichbrodt was a well-read , almost a liter-ary woman

the bridge of the nose was thin and finely hooked , the unbearded part of the cheeks under the cheekbones shadowed and even rather gaunt
there are a past grand master , a knight of the east , a grand high-priest—the thirtyfirst degree is called noble prince of the royal mysteries
as he covered his cheeks with scented lather and drew over them the blade of his silver-plated safety , he recalled his confused dreams and shook his head indulgently over so much nonsense , with the superior feeling a man has when shaving himself in the clear light of reason
what i perhaps most profoundly admire is the mastery with which the problem of sound-combination is solved
and in stronger and hardier hours he had blushed for his own weakness , for his own distress and sleepless nights , for his revulsion and disgust at the hateful and shameless harsh-ness of life !
it was a delegation of granary labourers , who camp straddling in like bears , the corners of their mouths drawn down with befitting solemnity and their caps in their hands
before the honeymoon was over she had had a blow so unforeseen , so unexpected , so incompre-hensible , that it took away all her joy in life
another time , his life had been saved from danger by water , when he had gone to bergen , as a young man
hope was no more
but you misunderstand me , the convulsion of nature to which i refer is not modern
lactantius , who was chosen by constantine the great as tutor to his son , put the position very clearly when he asked in so many words what heavenly bliss he could attain by knowing the sources of the nile , or the twaddle of the physicists anent the heavenly bodies
on the contrary , he belonged to those llen , vho prefer ill marriage to have all the economic power in their hands and to have their wives dependent on them
but when he saw tony 's frightened face he got down again and went on in a wheedling tone : good , good , say no more , antonie
she was well aware of her responsibilities toward the family and the firm , and she was proud of them
i would like to know whether epochs that possessed culture knew the word at an , or used it
on the right it was bounded by the curve of the mecklenburg coast ; but before her it stretched on and on till its blue and green streaks mingled with the misty horizon
the first elemen-tary difficulties were hardly got over when he began to theorize , in a simple way , with graphic illustrations , and to give his pupil the foundations of the theory of harmony
but one single pace forward , and the wind sliced at him like a scythe , and drove him back to the shelter of the wall
the night has fallen , our loved one may return any moment , and a meeting between you just now would perhaps not be quite well-advised
in my view we should de- mand something more

the winter drifts had wasted away , they were gone , save for vestiges here and there ; and the green slopes , the open paths , tempted the spirit to rove
luckily there was a vacant seat in the corner , near the door
adrian answered : oh , good !
so it is hard to measure the actual situation
the stiffened and perfumed mustaches , the meticulously shaven checks and chin , and the careful hair-dressing which sedulously hid a beginning thinness
there will always be men who are justified in this interest in themselves , this detailed observation of their own emotions ; poets who can express with clarity and beauty their privileged inner life , and thereby enrich the emotional world of other people
they are good enough to frame
then he kissed the little creature on the brow and said softly : god bless you !
it was then that two friends and professional colleagues visited him one afternoon and found an alarming state of things
there were hermine kleefeld , and herr albin—who carried about a great flowered box of chocolates , and offered them to all the guests , he himself eating none , but with a benevolent , paternal air smoking gold-tipped cigarettes ; there were the thick-lipped youth who belonged to the half-lung club , the thin and ivory-coloured fräulein levi , an ash-blond young man who answered to the name of rasmussen and carried his hands breast-high , with the wrists relaxed , like a pair of flippers ; frau salomon from amsterdam , a woman of full bodily habit , in a red frock , who had attached herself to the group of young folk ; the tall , thin-haired young man who could play out of the midsummer night ’ s dream sat on the step behind her , his arms about his bony knees , and gazed steadfastly down on the tanned back of her neck
yes , yes , laughed adrian , nodding , and they went into the house , into the pipe-tobacco air , and up to the upper storey , along the , vhite , damp-smelling walls , where the goodwife showed him his bedroom with the gay clothes-press and the high-piled white bed
now let us join the others
as it drew toward its end , the newly wedded pair disappeared , to begin their wedding journey , which was to include visits to several large cities
it begins with now let us all thank cod , goes over into the adaptation of offen-bach 's la belle helene , and winds up with a pot-pourri of folk-songs -- quite an extensive programme !
hardly wait for the music to begin again
after this affair , naturally , the friend-ship was about at an end
i smoked them with my coffee , he said , and thought no more of ’ it
the party held together for another hour , partly because they were all too leadenfooted and befuddled to rise , partly because this method of spending the hours of the night appealed to them by its novelty ; partly by the weight of peeperkorn ’ s personality , and the blasting example of peter and his brethren , to which they all shamed to yield
have you ever had a desire to commit murder ?
i shall fall dead at the news -- you will see !
he did not recall in all his experience so acceptable an easy-chair
dr krokowski did it by adopting a mingled terminology , partly poetic and partly erudite ; ruthlessly scientific , yet with a vibrating , singsong delivery , which impressed young hans castorp as being unsuitable , but may have been the reason why the ladies looked flushed and the gentlemen flicked their ears to make them hear better
young dr langhala was bending over him , changing a bloody bandage for a fresh one , which he dipped into a basin at the bedside
ida jungmann had gone to look after the linen for the guest-room

he is an angel , now , corrected sesemi
clara was a pious , ignorant woman , mother

the result of the enormous authority that lay in his hands was that he grew more and more arbitrary and moody -- he was even capable of making a joke and then visiting with his wrath anybody who dared to laugh

and you , herr buddenbrook , are reading -- ?
and if not , so much the worse
settembrini compressed his lips , and hans castorp hastened to say that , as for his own attitude , it was of course entirely non-partisan ; he only meant that he had enjoyed hearing what naphta had to say about the deepest desire of youth
well , that doesn ’ t happen between one day and the next ; we ’ re not magicians
what made you think of it ?
call me sesemi , child , she said on the first day to tony buddenbrook , kissing her briefly , with a sound as of a small explosion , on the forehead
it comes near being told at the place where for the first time there is mention of the porter ; then it is dropped again
what has become false , worn-out cliche , the canon decides
they were not alone
i do not say it is possible -- i only say i wish it were
the truth was that the breakfast beer , as a rule only mildly obfuscating to the young man ’ s sense , had this time completely stupefied and befuddled him
well , what affair was that of mine ?
he quizzed frau stöhr with spirit , and made a few remarks about the carpenter ’ s son and rabbi of humanity , whose birthday they fancied they were celebrating to-day
mark , whoso for other pray himself he saves that waye
and always there was this curious equation of worthiness with sensual passion , this fixed and strangely drunken idea that inward worthiness could only fulfil itself , realize itself , in fleshly desire , which ob- viously was something of like value with worth ; that it was at once the highest and the most indispensable happiness to keep them together
yes , to make it all even more as it had been , mrs macdonald breathed her last , with the picture of her little son in her hand , and her room , next his cousin ’ s , reverted to joachim , after it had been thoroughly freed of bacteria by means of hco
at last the senator broke it by saying : i must say , christian , your ideas come rather late
our time itself tends , secretly - or rather anything but secretly ; in- deed , quite consciously , with a strangely complacent conscious

the consul smiled again
cerda and thomas , however , were to take a trip to northern italy , as far as florence , and be gone about two months
he was about thirty-five years old , broad-shouldered and fleshy , much shorter than either of the youths before him , so that he had to tip back his head to look them in the face
he travelled direct from england , with-out coming home
we have got rather brown , he said , putting his arm arouml hanno as he stood before him
from behind him in the room hans castorp responded : that would be rather early—surely it can ’ t be settling down to winter already—but it has a terribly final look
they ought not to fetch the priest before one is quite weak
engineer , settembrini said sharply , almost angrily , pull yourself together and stop talking this demoralized rubbish
they stood together on the platform by the miniature train , in one of whose grey-upholstered compartments joachim kept a place with his overcoat , travelling-rug and roses
you seem not to have thought it might be possible to do something , to get help
drawing a paper from his pocket and laying his long finger with the signet ring to the side of his pointed nose , he read aloud , with a mock-heroic intonation : when the marechal saxe and the proud pompadour were driving out gaily in gilt coach and four , frelon spied the pair : 'oh , see them , he cried : 'the sword of our king -- and his sheath , side by side
and he spoke of priestly demagoguery , which began to vent its thirst for power in exaggerated solicitude for the under dog , when the top dog would none of it
it was now a question of probabilities : whether the symptoms of infection were to be referred to the insignificant amount of tubercle bacillus , or to the streptococci , which , also , were only present in small quantity
she said to me lately : 'there is nothing of the burgher about christian , thomas -- he is even less of a burgher than you are , yourself !
the act of fructification , the sexual merging of two cell-bodies , stood at the beginning of the upbuilding of every multiple-celled individual , as it did at the beginning of every row of generations of single elementary forms , and led back to itself
h am , well , yes , i agree with you
that was commendable of you
it beats not solely on physical grounds , as finger-nails grow on a corpse ; but humanly , on grounds of my joyful spirits
no , hans castorp said , when he was once more in his seat between the seamstress and the englishwoman , and had docilely unfolded his serviette , though still heavy with the earlier meal ; no , god help me , milk i never could abide , and least of all now !
while he had been at a safe distance she had hugely enjoyed the solemn conferences with her father and mother and the suddenly enhanced im- buddenbrddk portance of her own person and destiny
for i need hardly say that adrian was no very zealops participant and his membership was more a matter of form than of punctual per- formance of activities
two or three times she stammered : you are mistaken -- you are mistaken
yes , i like munich extremely
he suffered at limes also from spells of dizziness
it is all juggling and sophistry -- begging your pardon , he grumbled

and took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee… then saith he unto them : … tarry ye here and watch with me
he looked quite yellow , and died without saying another word ?
he was affability itself
death was a joy , so great , so deep that it could be dreamed of only in momenta of revelation like the present

the leuchenfield , which took its name from the lighthouse that stood on it , somewhere off to the right , stretched its extent of short sparse grass under the pale sky , to a point where the grass passed into a growth of tall , coarse water- plants ; and then came the sand , with its rows of little wooden huts and tall wicker beach-chairs looking out to the sea
do not shriek like that -- control yourself , for god 's sake !
it is still alrnost nothing , what lies underneath , by comparison with all there is on top ; we give time , plenteous time , abundant time by the eye , the end whereof we do not need to consider , not for a long time yet , nor need to trouble yet awhile even of the point of time where you could begin to take heed to the ending , where it might come to arespice finez
the hofrat , bestriding a stool in front of the screen , lighted the light
they were on safer ground when they could sustain the conversation in the realms of the intellectual , and hold the attention of their audience by one of their elegant and impassioned debates , academic , yet conducted as though the matter discussed were the most burning question of the time , or of all time
saint elizabeth had been flogged by her confessor , conrad von marburg , until the blood came , and by such means her soul was rapt to the third choir of angels
now and then , indeed , if they happened to be alone , a jesting and teasing mood seemed to overcome him ; once he attempted to fall on his knees and approach his whiskers to her face , while he asked in a voice apparently trembling with joy , have i indeed captured you ?
we were driven by sheer force of logic to this conclusion ; dr krokowski implored his hearers , having arrived at it , to hold it fast
they waited for the glass to move
of course , a female !
and even with better visibility , the host of difficulties must have combined to hinder his progress : the snow in his face , his adversary the storm , which hampered his breathing , made him fight both to take a breath and to exhale it , and constantly forced him to turn his head away to gasp
you finally land at the objective di- rection , the name : allegro appassionato
he saw him stand , of an evening , in the card-room , among the other guests , quite lost in gazing at the lovely , contaminate creature on the sofa in the small salon , in talk with the whimsical , fuzzy-haired tamara , dr blumenkohl , and the hollow-chested , stooping young men who were her table-mates
mahlzeit , children , said he , languidly
wehsal had seen frau chauchat ’ s smile , and expressed himself on the subject to his companion , showing his bad teeth as he talked

sleep is one of the—what did you call them , young man ? —one of the classic gifts of life—the first , the very first , the highest , ladies and gentlemen
it is even as tlugh our mjldly slumbering thuringian , vere woke up to a sevcn-hundred -- thou- £and-man ilpudence and smattered abhominably , ja , v stuck out - horrible , dreadful , but , god i ( eep us , certes meaning no harm , and mixed with self-mockery which they can graunt unto them- selves on the ground of their world-pulse
it is really rather frightening
i am astonished that such a stupid goose as i am have to tell you this -- yes , i am a stupid goose , and i should not be surprised if permaneder never loved me at all , for i am an ugly old woman , very likely , and babette is certainly prettier than i am !
so that at the decisive moment i wasn ’ t where all the others were , but behind the scenes , as you call it ; as i go along the corridor , they come toward me , in their lace robes , with the cross in front , a gold cross with lanterns—it made me think of the schellenbaum they march with , in front of the recruits
but hanno regained some little strength , consciousness returned ; and though the crisis which he had survived greatly hindered his progress in walking and talking , there was no longer any immediate danger to be feared
tell me , what do you think about greatness ?
one might have asked : and the good man too ?
nobody could say he broke his word
one might with truth say that he who was worthy of the one was fully worthy of the other
a respectful greeting from table to table—only that , for the time , no more
if i understand what he means by metabolism , it is nothing but physiology , and to talk about its being sanctified—irreverent , i call it
nowadays he too turned mottled when he changed colour , being too copper-tinted to grow really pale
if this foible added a quaint touch to his appearance , yet the effect was only of a slight negligence or licence due to age , which length of days either consciously and cheerfully permits itself , or else brings in its train without the victim ’ s being aware
i can not think of it today without wondering how i bore it so long
herr gr� threw him a quick look and seemed to grow slill more limp
for it turned out that they had mistaken a precipitate of sulphate of lime for protoplasm
he hastened to behrens , and found him in the lab , a cigar in one hand , and in the other a test-tube of dull-coloured fluid
as for the background of my actual narrative , up to the point whither i have brought it , i have characterized it at the beginning of this chapter in the phrase into the hands of strangers
you are beside yourself , your sufferings make you imagine preposterous things

was it her idea to attach herself to all these maternal figures and call theln sisters ?
during the years of approach- ing defeat and ever more gnawing stringency , he was , thank god , on the schweigestill farm as tolerably cared for as one could wish , without knowledge or appreciation of the state of things , almost unaffected by the slowly corroding changes under which our blockaded and invested country suffered , evell while militarily still on the offensive
that too was a work of immaturity
he sang the praises of the middle ages for forbidding the taking of interest
his face , with its light eyebrows , seemed serious and attentive as he worked ; but his thoughts travelled far away in the dark on their lonely , painful path
that 's what has happened !
i told you that in this difficult situation you could be a great help to me

his hand hurried over the paper , never pausing except to dip his quill in the ink
a piece of music called a five-minute waltz lasts five minutes , and this is its sole relation to the time element
yes , if you will pardon me , i will take down this picture , there ’ s positively no light here where it hangs , permit me to carry it over to the sofa , we shall see if it won ’ t look entirely— what i meant to say was : what is the main concern of the study of medicine ?
it was absorbing to watch these ghostly pranks ; one needed to keep alert to follow the transmutations , the veiling and unveiling
what a lot of rooms !
truly , she bloomed anew in these weeks ; and their invigorating activity , the manifold plans , the search for suitable quarters , and the feverish preoccupation with furnishings brought back with such force the memories of her first betrothal that she could not but feel young again -- young and boundlessly hopeful
and what have i to expect from your sense of justice ?
every trace of strain was gone from the features , they had composed themselves , growing cold , into a silent purity of form
true , the circumstances had been extraordinary
and then 'antonie
he stumbled backward ; but at that moment sister julie appeared from behind a tree , like a little black demon , and , falling upon tony , tore off her hat and scratched her cheeks unmercifully
she shook her bird-like old head vig-orously , and her brown eyes were clouded with her distress
frau permaneder had hardly , with her sleepy senses , taken them in before she interpreted them as well , in such a way that she felt the blood leave her cheeks and rush to her heart , which contracted and then went on beating with heavy , oppressed pulsations
he would , so he would tell them , bring his music more into the fore- ground , and accordingly he was going to the city where the musi- cal mentor of his school-days was working

dr faustus in his favour , and today too , when i go over it all again i feel mildly towards him , to a considerable extent touched by his tragic end
one might answer , life : a special power of resistance of the living protoplasm ; but this would be not to recognize the mystical character of such an explanation
she is a wonderful creature ; there are few like her in the world
such people incline to mistrust and bitterness
i want the linen and dishes
he carried his coat over his arm and his hat in his hand
she was wearing a thin dark silk this evening , cut round in the neck , with filmy sleeves finished by a buttoned cuff at the wrists
they all took part settembrini , naphta , hans castorp , ferge and wehsal—one and all slightly feverish , at once nervously stimulated and physically lethargic from walking and talking in the severe frost , all subject to fits of shivering , and—whether principals in the argument , like settembrini and naphta , or for the most part receptive , like the others , contributing only short ejaculations from time to time—all , without exception , so utterly absorbed that they stopped several times by the way , in a disorderly , gesticulating knot , blocking the path of the passersby , who had to describe a circle to get round them
it was not an optical toy which the guests discovered one evening in the salon , and greeted with applause , some of them flinging their hands above their heads , others stooping over and clapping in their laps
suddenly -- ihe carriage was rolling through castle street -- a wretched thing happened
it was a capital painting , by an artist of some note , in an old-masterish style that suited the subject and was reminiscent of much spanish , dutch , late middle ages work
he spoke again soon , this time on beethoven and the fugue
it did not cost anything , either , remarked herr gratjens drily -- he certainly ought to have known -- and studied the wall-painting through the hollow of his hand

once on the other side , he could see what lay beyond
as they crossed the entry , he added , what do you say , for in-stance , to h c f burmeester and company in hamburg ?
i do not want the money
i do not blame permaneder for that , of course ; i do not mean that
but on the other hand , thank goodness , i have certain material rights on my side -- the consul walked up and down with his hands behind his back , his shoulders twitching nervously
ottilie was taken with high fever , her curve went well up
steps away , among the disarray of chairs , stands inez , who sees him and waits for him to stop clapping , turn round and speak to her

he lay quietly , giving himself up to the operation of the soda he had taken
mais c ’ est vrai , you are a little bourgeois
as hans castorp looked rather mortified , he added in his most charming manner : we all know you for a wag , engineer : but your sly quips at the expense of the true , the good , and the beautiful will never make me doubt your fundamental love of them
again you wo not answer me !
but the sum was fixed at eighty thousand
but as in the spiritual life everything is interrelated , one thing growing out of another , and since one may not reach out one ’ s little finger to the devil , lest he take the whole hand , and therewith the whole man ; since , on the other side , a sound principle can produce only sound results , no matter which end one begins at—so disease , far from being something too refined , too worthy of reverence , to be associated with dullness , is , in itself , a degradation of mankind , a degradation painful and offensive to conceive
energy and phlegm are not much use under
all monism is tedious
good time , divellishly german time !
your calling , as i have often said to you , has a certain charm about it
he said certain things—you know the ones i mean—about modern communism , and the religious zeal of the proletariat , and not withholding its hand from bloodshed—i wont discuss them further , but surely your grandfather , with his citizen ’ s pike , was a perfect ewe lamb by comparison—please forgive my language

these sebaceous glands have little erector-muscles that act upon them , and when they do so , then you are like the lad when the princess poured the pail of minnows over him
the word is made for praise and honlage ; to the word it is given to astonish , to admire , and to bless ; it may characterize a phenomenon through the emotion it arouses ; but it can not con- jure up or reproduce
i am unfortunately without talent in that line , but i did what i could to encourage the mostly recalcitrant rudiger to visit pfeiffering
one would have to be as old as grandfather for that ; in these days , save for him and his old fiete , nobody , far and wide , wore such collars and neckcloths
' n ' then this buddenbrook -- he be so devilish fine wi ' his cuffs ' n ' his silk tie ' n ' his stickin'-out moustaches ; hast seen him walk ?
she would be forced to live in adultery : a just punishment for her philistinism , for what the wretch called her cowardly re- treat into bourgeois society
look , the sky is blue nearly all over
the french system of deportation had worked very badly
they had looked dreamy all the evening ; but now they stared into the candle-flame with a cold sharp gaze
but alongside the religious cast his reading took another direc- tion , which in certain times would have been characterized as wanting to speculate the elements
the prejudice that haunted him was grown to an itch , a ceaseless persecution-mania , which led him to smell out the vileness hidden or disguised in his neighbourhood and hold it up to scorn
but why do you ask ?
everywhere one saw people absorbedly bent over cameras supported in the pit or their stomachs , focusing and snapping the shutter ; and floods of snapshots were handed round at table
i caught your words and turned round
dr gieseke regretted being obliged to explain to her that neither the affair on the stairs nor the insult she had undoubtedly received , the pre-cise nature of which she hesitated to divulge , was sufficient ground for a divorce
then he slackened his pace , and finally almost stopped , as it seemed to him he must have got a good distance ahead of joachim
yes , she was unchanged
in my opinion the wretch , aside from satisfying his lust , had aimed at her death
but that was in his dreams—the waking hans castorp was no such matter , but a much less untrammelled person ; not disinclined , either , on the whole , to try out the influence upon himself of this novel human type , with its critical animus and acumen , despite the fact that he found the italian both carping and garrulous
something pressing , the tailor said curtly , stitching
after all , how else should i do while i ’ m up here ?
what is lacking is distance , con- trat , mere differentiation between the inaterial and the hand that shapes it
just a moment , thomas
after dinner , during the social half-hour , hans castorp came out of the music-room to look for his cousin , and saw him by the tiled stove , near marusja ’ s rocking-chair , which joachim held tipped back with his left arm , so that she looked up in his face from a half-lying posture , with her round brown eyes , and he bent over her , talking softly and disjointedly
in , when the french were in the country , he called us together and promised us a constitution
hans castorp sprang up and ran to the thermometer on the wall , as if to catch it in flagrante
and so -- it is madness to keep the house as dead capital
where did it come from ?
outside , the foundation storey was un- whitewashed and unadorned ; only above it did the ornamental woodwork begin
there stood the mighty tree , between the dark red window-curtains , towering nearly to the ceiling , decorated with silver tinsel and large white lilies , with a shining angel at the top and the manger at the foot

three rapid , noiseless steps forward -- and he was in his own room
it would be a pity

what an absurd want of style !
a pair of stairs led up to the first storey , where the consul opened a white door and admitted his guests to the billiard-room
the hortensia had been like homage at a ball , the brief chat with the two fine young cavaliers a tiny affaire de cœur ; she , the mother , had seen it
the latter felt less proud than one would expect
how the cock really swells his comb , or any of the other well-known instances come about , is still a mystery , particularly where it is a question of emotional influences in play
ah , that is you , herr settembrini !
hans castorp asked him succinctly , with the air of a connoisseur , circumstances betraying him to this tone
that the long-forgotten pribislav hippe should appear to him in the guise of frau chauchat and look at him with those kirghiz eyes—this was to be immured , not with opportunity , but with the inevitable , the unescapable , to such an extent as to fill him with conflicting emotions
there is no question of an extension
she went to god , and the firm of buddenbrooks received a large sum of money , a round hundred thousand thaler , which strengthened the working capital of the business in a highly desirable way
it was to be

the housewife 's brothers , of whom i spoke , , vere two , one older and one younger than herself : ercolano manardi , lawyer , mostly called l ' avvocato for short , yet with some satisfaction too , he being the pride of the otherwise unlettered and rustic fanily , a man of sixty with bristling grey ustaches and a hoarse , com- plaining voice , which began with an effort like a donkey 's bray ; and sor alfonso , the younger , perhaps in the middle of his forties , intimately addressed by his family as alfo , a farmer
could not have gone off better , declared rudolf
i despise paradoxes , i hate them
he circles directly overhead , he hovers , not a single beat of his wing—at a tremendous height in the blue , and with his keen , far-sighted eyes under the prominent bony structure of his brows he is peering earthwards
no , no , he said , we ’ ll stop at the covers
i see , i see , i see , he said again , giving the s the same sharp sound as before
so the question is , are we dealing with a harmless infection or with something more serious ?
after this he took his instrument again and sang : he who the world will joyous rove
on the badly out-of-tune square piano in the frjends ' living- room he played to us once during our stay - unfortunately only once - from the completed sections , mostly already scored for a speciaiiy chosen orchestra , of the pleasant well-conceited comedy love 's labour 's lost , as the piece was caned in
he was some thirty years old ; his hair was thin , his teeth poor , and he had a self-depreciating manner of speech
how about the stitches in the right hilum , where it always sounded so sharp ?
fires on the mountain-top , and ring around-a-rosy about the leaping flames !
he said nothing , gave his feelings no vent -- to whom should lie speak , then ?
he found it not unlike life at the seashore
inez did not nurse her children ler- self , the family doctor having advised against it
the garden was full of young buds and bathed in tender sun-shine ; a pair of birds called and answered each other pertly
the consul could not look at him enough as they sat and drove
i can ’ t comprehend how in the world i—
it was a prophecy whose slighting note would have been harder to bear had he not known that prophecies are sometimes made in order that they may not come to pass—as a spell , indeed , against their fulfilment
but once in a way he would stop rather longer , standing there broad-shouldered and sturdy , ever with his manly smile , chatting with the comrade of this and that : the weather , the various departures and new arrivals , the mood the patient was in , whether good or bad ; sometimes about his personal affairs , origin and prospects—before he uttered the formula : good day to you and passed on
then the wife in justifiable wrath had left him , and for the rest of his life he had seen himself confined to the unaccommodating idol
several people were standing by rudolf , among them dr kranich , holding his hand
he is likely to demand equal shares with my sister and me after your death , which would mean a loss of hundreds of thousands to the firm
i ’ d feel a perfect coward
finally they sent her to davos , but that seemed to have been the finishing touch , for she died there almost at once , just as she had wished and wanted it , and if she had been right in her idea that everything had been evened up by the readiness for death , then she , vas quits and had got what she was after
when they met , adrian trembled for a long time , resting his head on the breast of the woman he called mutter and du
when this happened , the school yard became a desert , the day lacked all charm , hope alone lingered
but on the other hand , he felt a lively pleasure at having actually carried out his undertaking
that power is evil we know
joachim was quite cool , this being for him no new experience , hans castorp rather feverishly expectant , as no one , up to the present , had ever had a view into his organic interior
but i think , tom , he ought to stop swearing , went on the frau consul with mild disapproval
so that , however strange it may seem , this chapter , ' w
her most powerful realization for the senses she finds in orchestral music , where through the ear she seems to affect all the senses with her opiate wand and to mingle the pleasures of the realm of sound with those of colour and scent
hans castorp asked : a—what ?
of this uprooted child of patrician stock , striving towards in- tellectual and artistic goals
his head shook with the effort he made ; but he finally managed to bring out a well i and the spell was broken
they will still lay it to my charge - as though things would have turned
he let himself down sidewise on one of the high-backed chairs around the dining-talle , and held his hat and stick between his thin knees
but on the whole he was sound and fit , an adequate tennis player and rower ; though actually handling the oars was less to his taste than sitting of a summer evening on the terrace of the uhlenhorst ferry-house , with a good drink before him and the sound of music in his ears , while he watched the lighted boats , and the swans mirrored in the bright water
no , of course , it was out of the question
have you never heard of german becoming , of german wandering , of the endless migratings of the german soul ?
i should be so glad to learn something
as i say , i am for selling at the right time
what a love of a woman !
hans castorp retained only pale memories of his parental home
what am i laughing at ?
it was clavdia ’ s x-ray portrait , showing not her face , but the delicate bony structure of the upper half of her body , and the organs of the thoracic cavity , surrounded by the pale , ghostlike envelope of flesh
it must have been a happy few days for both of you
it was the worst hole they had ever found themselves in , devil take it !

nowadays we have it down finer than that ; but even so it ’ s a good plan to get the mortis causa fixed up beforehand
adrian nor i really liked and whom he had presupably invited along with the departed spengler ; helmut lnstitoris , no , v a sort of widower ; the clearly articulating dr kranich ; frau binder- majorescu , the knoterichs , the hollow-cheeked jester and acad- emy portrait-painter nottebohm and his wife , brought by in- stitoris
i was pleased to say , said the italian , swallowing , i am pleased to say , that i am resolved to prevent you from continuing to molest a defenceless youth with your equivocations
a work that deals with the tempter , with apostasy , with damnation , what else could it be but a religious work ?
the hofrat had advised a stay of three months
even more unsightly symptoms , therefore , must not be tai { en too seriously
thus ended the campaign of the flat-land to recover its lost hans castorp
i knew all the time that i was making it myself—the park with the trees , the delicious moisture in the air , and all the rest , both dreadful and dear
i had considerable dealings with him some while back : count strelitz , a very smart-appearing man , with a square eye-glass ( i could never make out why he did not cut himself ) , patent-leather top-hoots , and a riding-whip with a gold handle
he tried to fit his speech with gestures , then perceived that they were awkward , and gave it up
you will kindly address me with the accepted form employed in the educated countries of the west , the third person pluralis , if i may make bold to suggest it
often , in an hour of depression , thomas buddenbrouk asked himself what he was , or what there was about him to make him think even a little better of himself than he did of his honest , limited , provincial fellow-burghers
hans castorp had flushed ; joachim , in act to button his braces , paused as he stood , and listened
in fact , he showed disquiet and embarrassment whenever the conversation turned to the dead
two weeks had passed ; and hanno said to himself , and to every one who would listen to him , that there was still as much time left as the whole of the michaelmas holidays amounted to
the little eyes were almost in the right place , so was the pointed ear , and the tiny legs under the rounded little belly ; the curving line of the back ended in a small neat ringlet of tail
probably she took over-doses , which did not increase her animation but reduced her to a state in which she could not appear in public
the tones coming from the choir had resembled delicate instrumental music and evoked an impression of heavenly mildness and piety in the hearer
you will make yourself ill are things so very bad ?
but you mus not give way , tom
but it isn ’ t a humanistic gesture , speaking latin in honour of death ; and the latin isn ’ t what you learn at school , either—the spirit of it is quite different , one might almost say hostile
the little company in meng street , not committed , as we have seen , to large entertainments , had the more leisure for intimacy with each other
settembrini was silent a few paces
what he wants and gives is triumph over it , is shining , sparkling , vainglori- ous unreflectiveness !
what are you thinking of ?
it would have been un- thinkable
his excellent chair , with the sectional mattress and the neck-roll , he pulled close to the snow-cushioned balustrade ; at his hand was the white table with the lighted readinglamp , a stack of books , and a glass of creamy milk , the evening milk which was brought to each of the guests ’ rooms at nine o ’ clock
as the others entered , the house-boy , in shirt-sleeves and good-natured grin , was just bringing in a fresh supply of bottles
awaiting the final collapse , beyond which the mind refuses its office , i have withdrawn within my freising hermitage and shun the sight of our horribly punished munich : the fallen statues , the gaping eyeholes in the fa
right , then , of course , as i always am , behrens answered himself
above the whole , in the tall , gothic hand of him who had left it to his descendants , was the quotation : my son , attend with zeal , to thy busi-ness by day ; but do none that hinders thee from thy sleep at night
then the judglllent upon this very biron : you shall this twelvemonth term from day to day visit the speechless sick , and still converse with groaning wretches ; and his cry : it can not be : mirth can not move a soul in agony !
hans castorp slapped his thigh and threw himself back against the bench , looking up at the sky
but now he said : sapristi , engineer !
if not for the symptoms of infection , they were not worth noticing
pure and godly manner of life , strictly regulated , hard-working and dietetically sound , full of sacrifice and self- discipline
in short , it came close to being blasphemous
herr settembrini seemed to bring together in a single breath categories which in the young man ’ s mind had heretofore been as the poles asunder—for example , technology and morals !
they all do it , without exception , and all of them are only too much at home up here
the family thurs-day afternoon was put off on some pretext
it happens to be just pre- cisely my favoured language
why must he be for ever opposing these scruples against the hard , practical affairs of life ?
that makes a bond between people as far apart as paul and virgil 's leneas
and , finally , there were the little daughter of hermann and the little son of moritz , two white-frocked children , already as good as betrothed to each other , for the huneus-hagenstrbm money must be kept together , of course
the mygrim , the point of attack for the knife-pains of the little sea- maid - after all , you have them from him
it was too dark in the carriage to see his expression
it was the difference of the life-curve between good , yes , excellent average , which was destined to return from that roving , seeking student life to its bourgeois courses , and the other , invisi- bly singled out , who would never forsake the hard route of the mind , would tread it , who knew whither , and whose gaze , whose attitude , never quite resolved in the fraternal , whose inhibitions in his personal relations made me and probably others aware that he himself divined this difference
i ’ ll be here too , to help make things comfortable , and befitting the officer and gentleman he is
but ihis single bond was very close , even from his earliest school rlays
tony and morten seated themselves in one of the little rooms facing the sea ; it smelled of wood , like the cabins at the bathhouse
the truth was that the town had been the whole day in a state of unrest
i am the one to be grateful , for permission to sit here a little ; i get a great deal more out of it than you—i assure you my motives are not altruistic
but see , i do know it
hans castorp , seated in his capacity of patient , looked up at him with an expression that betrayed mental activity
ellen brand rested her finger lightly on the glass and directed her pure , childlike gaze away into the rosy light from the table-lamp
the former , indeed , all the while protested that he was just a plain man , and this high-flown stuff utterly beyond him , his experience with the pleura-shock having been the sole event in his life to raise it above the most humdrum sphere
contagious diseases , plague , black death , were probably not of this planet ; as , almost certainly indeed , life itself has not its origin on our globe , but came hither from outside
but the demands made by himself and by others upon his talents and his rapacities were constantly increased
she put her hand on the portfolio that -lay before her on the table
the green cap-strings still fell down upon the old lady 's childish shoulders ; but she had grown so tiny , with her seventy-five years of life , that she could scarcely raise her elbow high enough to gestic-ulate above the surface of the table
upon manzoni ’ s inni sacri !
oh , no , no , said the consul , pulling himself together , and making a weak gesture of dissent
was noted down the awful screari given to the mocking , bleating bassoon , the wail of the bird ; or perhaps that song and answer , like an antiphony , which on first hearing so gripped my heart - the harsh choral fugue to the words of jeremiah :
if necessary , of course , there were other expedients—for instance , artificial nourishment
then there was an odd , tiny little woman with a large head , who put up a huge tattered umbrella at every sign of a storm
you threw your honour overboard without getting any return
a few bool { s lay on the table : a little volume of kleist , with the bool { -mark at the essay on marionettes ; the indispensable volume of shakespeare sonnets and another book with some of the plays - twelfth night i think , mucb ado about nothing , and i believe ywo gen- tlemen of verona
as for schwerdtfeger , well knowing how many curious eyes he would meet , he scarcely during the whole evening looked down into the parterre
was it your earthly part which lay there alone on your balcony , while your spirit revelled below , with captain miklosich and his kisses ?
the truth is , the seasons here are not so distinct from each other ; they run in together , so to speak , and don ’ t keep to the calendar
somewhere else , in some far-off clime , clavdia was letting doors slam behind her , somewhere else she was expressing herself by that act , as intimately bound up with her very being and its state of disease as time is bound up with the motion of bodies in space
it is the demand of which i speak
, atisfactions , stimulating his urge to improve
yes , thanks , with the greatest pleasure , answered the buddenbrdoks banker , and there was a pause while he presumably helped himself
then passed several days , occupied in hans castorp ’ s mind with the question how this blood of his , this part of himself , would behave out of his control and under the eye of science
you are so quiet , tom
behrens answered , she ’ d never think of it
all the residue is elaboration , sticking at it
the next moment little johann sat upright in bed , stammering incomprehensibly , and staring wilh wide-open , strange golden-brown eyes into a world which he , and he alone , could see
the bench on which they sat leaned against the steep wall of the mountain-side , and near them a spring in an open wooden trough ran gurgling and plashing to the valley
it would be a pretty bit of property , if the grass were cut and the trees trimmed into formal shapes
these few lines will tell you that the vision has never ceased to hover before his spiritual eye ; that never has he during these interminably anxious months ceased to think of the precious afternoon in your parental salon , when you let fall a blushing promise which filled me with bliss unspeakable !
hans castorp being taken by another fit of laughing , his cousin laughed too , with hearty enjoyment , and told other funny things to add fuel to their merriment
i have always objected to the perpetual occupation of young heads with greek and latin
a week later there sat in senator buddenbrook 's private office , in the leather chair beside the writing-desk , a little smooth-shaven old man with snow-white hair falling over his brow and temples
he had a habit of slowly and cautiously stroking the red-brown moustache that grew over his mouth with the extended middle and index fingers of his left hand ; or he would rub his hands together and let his round brown eyes wander so aimlessly about that he gave the impression of complete confusion and absent-mindedness , though he was always must watchfully bent on the matter in hand
i vvill characterize it , however little the desig- nation i have in mind will seem applicable to a jest
the family of my late mother
a wild grape-vine , springing from bare roots at the door , flung an arm along the ground-floor wall towards the display window of a tiny shop
he fairly pushed himself away from it
that is what we recognized betimes and why from early on we had an eye on you - we saw that your case was quite definitely worth the trouble , that it was a case of the most fa- vourable situation , whereof with only a little of our fire lighted under it , only a little heating , elation , intoxication , something brilliant could be brought out did not bismarck say something about the germans needing half a bottle of champagne to arrive at their normal height ?
more than that can no man
she complained of relaxation
my daughter 's munich friend , she began , lives so far away that we shall have no opportunity to repay her hospitality
be reason-able , for heaven 's sake
hans castorp suitably explained and excused his seeming intrusion , speaking in a low , moved voice , with delicate reverence
repeated the frau consul , inquiringly
and i have to stagnate up here—yes , just stagnate like a filthy puddle ; it isn ’ t too crass a comparison
the church , in which they survived , has set itself to oppose astronomical knovvledge in the humanistic spirit ; bedevilled and forbidden it to the honour of the hulnan being ; out of humanity has insisted on ignorance
't is whether which dub d ' th ' three be ahead o ' the others , eh ?
we shall see if i am not quite a different chap when i come back
it simplified the return
hans castorp suggested that he be released from his post of first control , but dr krokowski refused
speak openly , tony , have you learned to love your hus-band in these years of marriage ?
certainly we must deem him lost and undone , and the object of our just concern
after that you just keep on saying amadame ' : 'ah , madame , madame , que pensez-vous , madame ; on me dit , madame , que vous ctes fana- tique de musique ?
well , anyhow , hans castorp considered , so much was granted : that in the antithesis between body and soul it was undoubtedly the body which embodied—the body embodied , that wasn ’ t so bad , was it ? —the evil principle ; in so far as the body was naturally nature—pretty good , too , that ! —and nature , being diametrically opposed to the spirit and reason , was by that fact intrinsically evil—mystically evil , one might say , if it didn ’ t sound like showing off !
and so this , said he , after he had greeted the young girl and exclaimed over her likeness to her mother , is the new member of the family ?
surely , i answered him , you wo not defend such a ridiculous and dogmatic arrangement , such childish rationalism as this in- vention of masters and servants
for these good gifts he praised germany ; praised her for her past , but awarded his own country the palm , because she had been the first to unfurl the banner of freedom , culture , and enlightenment , at a time when all other lands were wrapped in the darkness of superstition and slavery
with him it had grovvn to be something like a state of mind , in which past and future merged together ; the cool gaze he directed upon the hypertrophy of the post-romantic monster orchestra , the need he felt for its reduction and return to the an- cillary role that it had played at the time of the preharmonic , the polyphonic vocal music ; his tendency in this direction and thus to oratorio , a species in which the creator of the revellltion of st john and the lajlentcltion of dr faustus would later achieve his highest and boldest flights - all this came out very early in
and , as ever , hans castorp was filled by emotion at the sound , an emotion which this time circumstances magnified and as it were condensed into a longing ; he thought : barren and sinful or no , it would be a marvellous thing , a darling adventure !
all the good fellows , among them dr gieseke and peter dbhlmann , took leave of him at the station , and brought him flowers and cigars , and laughed to split their sides -- recalling , no doubt , all the stories christian had told them
but as consciousness of self it also strengthens life , and in this sense - i mean also to this extent - i call it good
we sit here visiting , but i really came to-night on a serious and im-portant errand
he was habitually observant and critical of this feature , and accustomed when he made a new acquaintance to direct his attention first upon it
the senator walked at her side , his hands behind his back , his head bowed
that cast a somewhat singular light on the art of verse-writing , naphta retorted , but was not otherwise worth answering
thomas buddenbrook 's prestige was of a different kind
good-morning , he said cheerily , with the idea of lending the scene a note of the natural , which should help to dissipate its evil bearing—but was out of luck , for nobody answered
of course , i leave , and so on
if you said that illness is sometimes a consequence of depravity , that would at least be sensible
for this hellish laughter at the end of the first part has its pend- ant in the truly extraordinary chorus of children which , accom- panied by a chamber orchestra , opens the second part : a piece of cosmic music of the spheres , icily clear , glassily transparent , of brittle dissonances indeed , but withal of an - i would like to say - inaccessibly unearthly and alien beauty of sound , filling the heart with longing without hope
we shudder as we realize that a connection subsists between it and the nether world , and that the reassuring epitheta which i sought to apply : sane , noble , harmonious , hu- mane , do not for that reason quite fit , even when - i force my- self , however painfully , to make this distinction - even when they are applied to a pure and genuine , god-given , or shall i say god- inflicted genius , and not to an acquired kind , the sinful and mor- bid corruption of natural gifts , the issue of a horrible bargain
it is the angel of the in- dividual , the genius of his life , in whose all-knowing guidance it gladly confides
pity you aren ’ t a member , you could get me in as a guest , as—as associate half-lunger—you ought to ask behrens to put you out of commission , then perhaps you could learn to whistle too ; it must be something one could learn—well , that ’ s the funniest thing ever i heard in my life !
laugh , dream , and feel amazement , when the world yet makes upon us not one single demand ; when the impatience of those whom we should like so much to love does not yet torment us for evidence of our ability to succeed in the impending strug-gle
it is your turn
but he had taken it up and thought it over
its colour toned beautifully with the paper above the wainscoting , and its large-flowered stuff , of a beautiful soft texture , was embroidered all over with sprays of tiny glass beads of the same colour , while row after row of red velvet ribbons ran from neck to hem
a touch of indigestion
they began to get used to the noise that rose and fell outside , to feel quieter ; to make themselves more comfortable , to sit down on the lower benches and chairs
at first there had been posts , staves set up as guides through the snow— but he had soon cut free from their tutelage , which recalled the coastguard with his horn , and seemed inconsistent with the attitude he had taken up toward the wild
ah , ha , ah , ha !
it was not particularly ladylike , this hand that was putting the braids to rights ; not so refined and well kept as the hands of ladies in hans castorp ’ s own social sphere
talking about post-mortems already
hans castorp ’ s charitable impulse was stronger than his cousin ’ s distaste ; which the latter , moreover , could only manifest by silence and averted eyes , since he could not stand for it except by betraying a lack of christian feeling
it enters my head that perhaps i ca not swallow , and then all of a sudden i ca not
he did not see the servant who opened the door
that was a polite exaggeration , settembrini answered
but i do not believe we should actually become bank-rupt if he put down his pen a quarter of an hour sooner
one of these appeared to be a nervous distaste for the expression of feeling
here were tall , stout , lusty rascals who would soon go to sea or else begin a mer-cantile career , and who had no further interest in their school life ; and small , ambitious lads , far ahead of their age , who were brilliant in subjects that could be got by heart
but -- or so said herr longuet , the livery man in john street , as he himself drove the covered char-a-banc up to the door of the house in meng street : the sun will be out before an hour is over -- which was most encouraging
oh , you are only here for a short time ? -- this from another lady
tony and her mother did hear from him , in the course of conversation , what dishonourable means gr� had used to get hold of the eighty thousand marks ; but the consul was careful to give the matter no pub-licity
but he had long since resigned himself to his fortunes ; and in his later years , especially after his nephew turned over to him the consulate of the netherlands , he ate his lozenges out of his tin box and harboured the friendliest feelings
reckoning at twenty pfennig the kilo , this would come to fifty-seven marks and sixty pfennig
up to that moment he had not been fully aware of the changes the last weeks had made in joachim—the young have not much eye for such things
is it conceivable for a psalmist to make god ask : wouldo i then eat the flesh of bulls and drink the blood of goats ? '
i am about to do something that would , in a novel , break all the canons : i mean to introduce into the narrative an invisible charac
his superiors were alarmed by a hæmorrhage ; he hovered for weeks between life and death , when they hurried him , barely convalescent , back whence he had come
what i mean is , it wo not turn out all right
he never heard the work , one of the two chief monuments of his proud and austere life ; but after all he used to say about hearing i do not feel entitled to lament the fact
and go his stiff-kneed way
do you hear , tilda ?
the view was cut off by the grey side-wall of the neighbouring villa
it will be so easy !
weeks passed like this : four , five , six weeks
we are going to the city
i am staggered—i admit it
the family dining-room and the much larger kitchen , in vhich friends from the village were entertained , lay in the upper storey
that this nervous complaint set in precisely on festal occasions , under the influence of emo- tion and excitement , is understandable
a bowl of fresh and dried fruits stood in the centre of the table
but that 's been over with for a long while now
he was all the time saying how clever and resourceful he was , and all the time hiding his villainy
the good soul read about cinderella , about the prince who could not shiver and shake , about rumpelstiltskin , about ra-punzel and the frog prince -- in her deep , patient voice , her eyes half-shut , for she knew the stories by heart , she had read them so often
he bent over the grave and spoke to the dead , calling her by her full name , and blessed her with the sign of the cross
when good dr grabow begged him to relax a little , iip answered , oh , my dear doctor , i have not reached that point yet !
it could subsist , in his mind , along with a degree of distaste for any social approach
the third exception , related to the second , was a journey to basel , which he made in company with his teacher kretschmar to attend the performances of sacred music of the baroque period , which the basel chamber choir gave in st mar- tin 's church
it was a frightened cry , and it repeated itself in an even more anguished tone the next minute ; and then three , four , five times more , one after an-other
is the record here ?
but herr naphta preferred to discredit art sooner than admit that it might have a humanizing effect upon a sunken wretch
he appeared in the first storey , where he was received by the three ladies , mother , daughter , and grand-daughter , talked for ten minutes , and promised to return an-other day for coffee and more leisurely conversation
and now began for tony buddenbrook a stretch of beautiful summer weeks , briefer , lovelier , than any she had ever spent in travemunde
then the process was repeated on the left side ; then the hofrat commanded : turn !
thus they came to an affectionate settlement ; the consul jingled his keys like a man satisfied as he got up
i ’ m glad i ’ m here still , for this , said hans castorp to his cousin
with a hospitable motion of his small right hand he would have ushered them to the satin chairs
it is quite different
but when one looked across the intervening space , at the towering marble statuary of the high alps in full snow , one felt a quite different emotion , and that was awe of their majestic sublimity
it was a large volume , poorly printed on cheap paper and poorly sewed ; the second part , only , of a famous philosophical system
with his never heavy luggage , to which belonged a brief-case with his scores and the rubber tub which in italy too had fur- nished his bath , he travelled to his goal from the starnberger sta- tion on one of the local trains , which stopped not only in walds- hut but ten minutes later in pfeiffering
it had always been , as far back as he could remember , the question
he ate twice a day in the best hotel and was a member of the club
un de nos pensionnaires , qui est un peu devenu mon ami , m settembrini— il vient de te lancer quelques paroles
y ou know what i find ?
i ought to practise my sonatas and etudes and then stop
the firm round chin was the old man 's , and the straight , well-chiselled nose
fine people come late , said consul buddenbrook , and kissed his mother-in-law 's hand
the muscles of his mouth and cheeks , other-wise obedient to his will , relaxed and became flabby
to-day it was frau chauchat who issued from the portal , in company with her concave fellow-countryman , herr buligin , who was to accompany her for part of the way
yes , russia must give herself time to recover from her little mishap in the east
the question , the great question , could now not be put off any longer
during the next few minutes one scarcely saw one ’ s neighbours ; then their eyes slowly accustomed themselves to the darkness and made the best use of the light they had—which was slightly reinforced by the small dancing flames from the chimney-piece
under his tutelage , they tasted the classic gifts of life : coffee and cream with fresh bread , moist cheese and fragrant alpine butter , heavenly-tasting with hot roasted chestnuts
when you have made your rounds , you are wiser than anybody : you have had the heads of nearly all the great houses under your hand , and know the mood of each one
the gay old lady continued to talk in her semifluid tongue at the care-worn dr blumenkohl , diagonally opposite ; her lean niece actually at last ate something else than yogurt ; namely , the thick cream of barley soup , which was handed round in soup-plates by the waitresses
it ’ s old , of course ?
after joachim ’ s cavalier treatment of madame chauchat—in which hans castorp seemed to savour something almost like faint hostility on his cousin ’ s part toward their fair fellow-patient , a hostility at which he could not help smiling , despite the commotion in his mind—clavdia tried a turn up and down the room
and that is not all ; it is , pedagogically speaking , only the beginning
they are very fine people , in mind and heart
the way things stand : this zany has taken away your beatrice from you , yet you—it is unheard of
but one only keeps a thing so long as it is rising or at least keeping steady
this was a practical , rational modern town
the letter b comes next , kai , so there 's not much help for it
everybody knew that the bond between the lawyer and frau salomon from amsterdam , after subsisting for several months , had been broken by common consent , and that frau salomon had followed the leanings of her time of life and taken up with callow youth
there will be a heavy rain , but no wind
you will develop your convictions another time , naphta cut him off icily
this was the one
i can not wait any longer
will you contemn them , in favour of some suggestion—hocus-pocus and emotional charlatanry ?
again they are billeted in the town for a time , are mustered out and go home -- to ijie great relief of the cheering citizens
she once related in a letter the story of how she met in the street a mason 's ap-prentire , carrying a mug of beer in one hand and holding a large white radish by its tail in the other ; who , waving his beer , said jovially : neighbour , can ye tell us the time ?
i have been working now for several days on these pages ; but though i try to keep my sentences balanced and find fitting expression for my thoughts , the reader must not imagine that i do not feel my- self in a state of permanent excitement , 'which even expresses it- self in a shakiness in my handwriting , usually so firm
i have already mentioned the garden of the cloister above the town , to which our friends climbed every morning with their portfolios to work apart
she was still about when i first came up here , and she could be wildly hilarious , regularly giggly , like a little kid
human reason needs only to will more strongly than fate , and she is fate !
marie ( in other words mile godeau ) addressed her as ma tante or tante isabeau ; she apparently lived with her niece as companion and housekeeper
tables were laid in both dining- and living-room , and there were a hired cook and waiters and kistenmaker wines
but enough on this theme
the corridor door opened , and there stood before them in the twilight , in a pleated pique house-frock , white as snow , a slender figure
it was you italians that invented banking and exchange , which may god forgive you !
but the weakness was burdensome too and went far to spoil the meal hours for him , which he had otherwise continued to find diverting and full of interesting episode
in your splendid walls live well ,
they bring you your midday broth , as they brought it yesterday and will bring it to-morrow ; and it comes over you—but whence or how you do not know , it makes you quite giddy to see the broth coming in—that you are losing a sense of the demarcation of time , that its units are running together , disappearing ; and what is being revealed to you as the true content of time is merely a dimensionless present in which they eternally bring you the broth
it would never occur to anyone to call you that
listen , my dear child , said the consul , stroking her hair
it was in the light of what he had said , he went on , that the work he was speaking of in particular , sonata ope i i i , was to be regarded
he wished , he said , not to offend either side
my cousin and i have had the privilege of frequent conversations with him on this and kindred subjects—what it amounted to , of course , was that we listened while he explained and developed his views—so i can vouch for the fact , and my cousin here will confirm me , that herr settembrini spoke more than once , with great enthusiasm , of the revolutionary principle , and about rebellion and reform—which is no very peaceful principle , i should think—and of the mighty efforts still to be made before it triumphs everywhere , and the great universal worldrepublic can come into being
but no one will suppose that the city he had chosen to live in really took him to her bosom or ever made him her own
they are not worth printing , the reader may easily find th
the word , even the most contradictious word , preserves contact—it is silence which isolates
life and experi- ence can give to single syllables an accent utterly divorcing them from their common meaning and lending them an aura of horror , which nobody understands who has not learned them in that awful context
and even so they are dead , said jonathan , and tears came in his eyes , while adrian , as of course i saw , was shaken vvith sup- pressed laughter
i know that during the writing of the we of the apocalypse he vore the jewel on his left hand
it is rather something psychical ; it means that the perception of time tends , through periods of unbroken uniformity , to fall away ; the perception of time , so closely bound up with the consciousness of life that the one may not be weakened without the other suffering a sensible impairment
and who can lead a theological existence without me ?
the snow mounted apace , it became a nuisance
you think so too , do not you ?
but they say that down there ; even the most cultured people do , and it does not hurt anything -- it slips out once in a while and nobody minds
and your perceptions are perfectly correct , naphta responded
but herr settembrini was only a representative—of things and forces worth hearing about , it was true , but not the only forces there were
hans castorp stumbled once or twice on the level street and grinned ruefully as he shook his head
every morning joachim appeared arrayed in white flannel trousers , to greet his cousin , and hans castorp felt a pang of regret , in which both heart and youthful muscles joined , at the loss of all this splendid weather
it was worthy of all respect -- herr k�en called it respeck
well , it is the tenth of september
eva ewers slept with her
now the frau consul rose
that was an instance of a technical mischance , the conse- quence of an error
but of course matter that is capable of taking those ascending stages by dint of outward pressure must have a little something in itself to start with
she looked at him
grown up bet\\'cen two lan- guages , she wrote ladylike and original studies of society in a charmingly incorrect idiom peculiar to herself alone
oh , yes ; that is south-german , said the consul , breathing the smoke slowly out into the room
in very truth , dead spirit is more repulsive to the living than dead matter , than granite for example , which makes no claim to be alive
ushered in by the technician , frau chauchat was entering the laboratory
madame antoinette , in a white lace cap and an apron over her striped frock , was busy with flannel and linen at the table
they would consider it an insult , and i should be punished for insubordination -- all for having discovered for them a much higher significance in their calling than they themselves were aware of !
tony sat in silence , and he did not un-dertake to engage her ; only gazing at her now and then , with his head a little tilted , his face looking dejected and encouraged by turns
no call for panic , he varied his theme
grandfather said thou to him and addressed him in dialect—not with any humorous intent , for he had no bent that way , but in all seriousness , and because it was his custom so to do in his dealings with the common people—the warehouse hands , postmen , coachmen , and servants
you call that recently ?
we have to banish the bright daylight and its pretty pictures out of our minds
but when there came a sudden mild spell , he would find that the soup he had brought with him in chunks had melted and run away
the four guests from the berghof had met settembrini there , and by chance naphta also
they were folio-wed by the piercing cry of the new member of the family , who had just waked up
which does not prevent his hair and nails from growing , or , all in all—but no , we shall not repeat those free-and-easy expressions used once by joachim , to which hans castorp , newly arrived from the flat-land , had taken exception
he has the reputation of having got so-and-so many dishonest bankrupts off scot-free
according to him , it was absurd to prate about human dignity , since true dignity indwelt not in the flesh but in the spirit
is the food decent up here ?
no , i would not , my dear arzt , answered deutschlin , vith some leat
since he went to bed , the cold and cloudy weather had given place to a succession of wonderful midsummer days
for he loved it all , the seats , the musicians , the drop-curtain -- even the smell of gas
when i am bored i sometimes poke about down here
we should give it out only in the form of praise—of complete and utter—enough , ladies and gentlemen
no more than a hands-breadth or so of space had been between his face and hers , whose outline and features , peculiar though they were , had been familiar to him as long as he could remember , and spoke to his very soul as nothing else could in all the world
he had seen it coming long before , he had felt it beforehand , before any one else had such an idea in his head
a whole year long the pride of the spirit asserted itself against the injury it had received , and it was always a sort of con- solation to me to feel that his surrender to the naked instinct that had laid its spiteful finger on him had not lacked all and every human nobility or psychological veiling
she merely pouted , sticking out her al-ready prominent upper lip still further over the lower one
it is almost as fine as gr� 's , and much finer than permaneder 's !
i levelled this reproach against no one—no one
in fact , from his grandson ’ s narrative , the two hearers got a picture of a dark and tempest-tossed figure , a ringleader , political agitator , and conspirator ; despite all their pains , they did not quite succeed in hiding a feeling of mistrust , even repulsion
in the dusk of that slow-brightening dawn , moved by such mingled and fluctuating hopes and feelings , he mounted the narrow path along the slope , from the village end of the bob-run ; arrived at the deeply drifted woods , crossed the little wooden bridge over the course , and followed a way among the tree-trunks trodden by feet in the snow rather than cleared by any shovel
in overcoat and galoshes he went with his cousin down to the village , to buy himself blankets for the out-of-doors cure , since it was plain his plaid would not suffice
yes , tony said ; adding with tact , unfortunately
little sister u rsel was too small to take part in these exercises , and moreover , of us four probably one was superfluous in the lcind of vocal music to which hanne elevated our lusty shoutings

it had come to be the case that precisely this intoxication was the most bearable condition he knew
his social bearing was no less satisfactory to them
you will ask if it was t so wit !
it doesn ’ t do at all , i tell you
but they did not , nor had hans castorp been sincere in his conviction that they would
he knew that such and such a person had been operated on for rib resection ; had it on the best authority that from the autumn onward no one with a temperature of more than ° would be admitted into the establishment
hans castorp , of course , could only speak of those at which he was present ; but he felt tolerably sure he did not miss any ; that his presence , the presence of the bone of pedagogic contention , was necessary , to give rise to a disputation of any magnitude
we ’ ve only one word for that—personality
the hot drink hurt the bark tooth which herr brerht had just been working at
poke , the slightly inclined head and the rapt look of a man in a vision
it is sad enough that when i followed the dictates of my heart and married against your wishes , and further wounded your insensate pride by taking over a shop , you should have repulsed me so cruelly and remorselessly ; but the way in which you now treat me cries out to heaven , and you are utterly mistaken if you imagine that i intend to accept your silence without a struggle

settembrini said frigidly that he lacked the brains necessary to the understanding of this death-and-murder mysticism—and he really didn ’ t miss them
the ladies liked to dally with him , and he listened to their talk , for example to that concerning lawyer einhuf , the young lady in the combinations , and fränzchen oberdank
herr kesselmeyer followed their course with the greatest interest

therefore , if it is too much to say that one can tell a tale of time , it is none the less true that a desire to tell a tale about time is not such an absurd idea as it just now seemed

he paused in front of her , fairly wringing his hands

they were a failure in the first place because our population had on principle no use for lectures ; and secondly because his themes were not popular but rather capricious and out of the ordinary ; and in the third place because his stutter made listening to them a nerve-

she was disappointed and grieved that her brother had passed over his son and heir and had not wished to keep the firm alive for him to step into
instinctively i have rejected it from my picture of the cosmos and never felt the slightest inclination rashly to open the door to the powers of darkness : arrogantly to challenge , or if they of themselves ventured from their side , even to hold out my little finger to them
still , there seems every reason , on our part and on his , not to go into it very much , and we will only add that thereafter wehsal carried his friend ’ s overcoat with even more self-abnegation than before
he said , and let buddenbrook slip through
and vhen he took leave for the evening , he showed his readiness to be sorry and do better : he came and said good-bye and made little jokes in dialect , at which one rather winced , for perhaps one was suffering from fatigue
for , it appeared , this followed of itself ; no other course seemed possible
the senator , in markintosh and goloshes , went walking with gosch ; chris-tian drank swedish punch with the barmaid in the pastry-shop
the end of it all is that the little soldier , white as a sheet , shirt open at the throat , stabs his mistress with his knife in front of the circus—which , after all , she brought upon herself
ijhill- justus scowled forbiddingly when the conversation , with the advent of the second course , turned upon the absent members of the family , and he saw the foolish mother wipe her eyes
the thing is this , answered frau permaneder , with some hesitation , as the brother and sister began to pace the gravel path of the fore part of the garden
her face still streamed with tears , but she was soothed and comforted and entirely herself as she rose to her feet and began straightway to occupy her mind with the announcements of the death -- an enormous number of elegant cards , which must be ordered at once

the coming sunday , as he remarked to himself and to his cousin , would see the performance of another of the fortnightly concerts , and the monday another lecture by dr krokowski ; then , on tuesday or wednesday , he would be off , and joachim would be left up here alone—poor joachim , for whom rhadamanthus would prescribe god knew how many more months !
it is a small detail , yet worthy of mention , that he was growing to have a contempt for certain ways of expressing himself
is your summer over now ?
pray do not , on that account , refuse to entertain it , settembrini said with a smile
thus it had gone on : certainly this was no bagnio , no siberian penal settlement ; frau salomon had remained , and displayed her beauteous underwear
what abortions were brought forth !
under no conceivable circumstances
they sat down , twelve together , hans castorp between his kingly host and clavdia chauchat
she stood there , a victor in the good fight which all her life she had waged against the assaults of reason : hump-barked , tiny , quivering with the strength of her convictions , a little prophetess , admonishing and inspired
when , or if , he can leave this place , remains in doubt
perhaps it happens to you that you come into your room when it is getting dark and see a man sitting on the sofa , nodding at you , when there is no man there ?
thank god , wide stretches still lie be- tween our home soil and destruction rushing on from the east
he made as if he were itching all over with curiosity
he kept repeating that he could see right into the gentleman rider ’ s vitals ; when they reached the restaurant his travel-weary eyes had an excited glitter
of this time , and honour and dignity do not help the state one jot , if it does not of itself have a grasp of the economic situation and know how to direct it
how could one possibly talk to a man who had proposed for one 's hand ?
hanno himself was in a pale cold sweat , with staring eyes , incapable of protesting or running away ; in short , in much the same condition as a condemned criminal
then he wrote that he was in bed , on sick-leave , a catarrh , a matter of a few days
she was a stout lady , with thick white curls over her ears , dressed in a plain gown of striped black and grey stuff which betrayed the native quiet simplicity of her character
and after all it was worth listening to , all that naphta had to say
there was an almost dangerous surging to and fro inside the tram , which had come to a stop
we came to acquire health , to get healthier and healthier until we are entirely well , and are free to quit , and go down below where we belong !
rudiger 's judgnlent of the war was conditioned by his admiration for the english , as , vas jeanette scheurl 's by her french blood
it is the end of everything , the hellish despair , the judgment day
they bent over the little one in a circle , convulsed vvith rapture ; squatted down beside him and called on jesus , \ary , and joseph at sight of the beautiful little lad
hans castorp laughed—a thing herr settembrini never did
women are for ever smiling , at anything , just for the sake of smiling ; there is no sense in attending to it
he took occasion to animadvert upon it one day in autumn as they were walking on the main street
it seems as though you needed to come back here to be as you were on the day of your promotion
that birthday suit there is painted with science , it is organically correct , you can examine it under the microscope
she was standing near by , among a group of her table-mates , waiting until the press about the lodge should be lightened
in the beginning of february , , after eight years ' ab-sence , christian buddenbrook returned to the home of his fathers
you needn ’ t tell me : so far as peeperkorn is concerned , i ’ m certain we ’ re companions in misery—quaint creature , he continued aloud , and shrugged
do not like , replied , to have you make over the natural to evil
the populous valley , extended and rather winding , now began to show lights everywhere , not only in the middle , but here and there on the slopes at either hand , particularly on the projecting right side , upon which buildings mounted in terrace formation
you have never been married , so of course you know nothing about life , really ; but you are a truthful woman , and you have some sense -- and you are forty-two years old !
and joachim pulled him over to number twenty-eight , where the scene was reminiscent of that long-ago evening when hans castorp arrived
it is hard , isn ’ t it ? —you just tell me if you don ’ t think it is pretty hard on me
she had a boundless appetite for gossip
all this world , including the cousins and their protegée , were betaking themselves to the rink , which lay in the depth of the valley not far from the kurhaus ; in summer it was a meadow , used for football
and slowly , slowly , with mournful long-drawn pomp , thomas buddrnbrook 's funeral train wound away , while the flags at half-mast on all the houses flapped before the wind
the picture had changed considerably since the war
you should be just , even if you are angry , to her and to -- why should not it be my child ?
she did it gallantly
so that after your death your inheritance would pass to them ?
in short , all that ceased , long ago , to be folk and blood and religious reality ; it is nothing any more but weak water-gruel
ay , said he simply , he has it behind him now , and lifted the stethoscope from joachim ’ s breast
born in dresden , but in origin low-german , of medium height and neat build , and with a shock of flaxen hair , he had the polish , the pleasing versatility of the saxon , and was in equal measure good-natured and desirous to please
if all these sensations caused him no high degree of suffering , that was only because his head felt as though he had inhaled a few whiffs of chloroform
it was this : certain fires of considerable extent had taken place in different localities , which would have cost his company large sums of money
some of the form remained in the chemistry hall , others went up to the classroom ; nobody needed to go down and freeze in the courtyard , because herr modersohn was in charge up in the corridors , and he never dared send any one down
he followed this street , which led down to the trave parallel to meng street , for a few steps , and paused before a small house , a modest flower-shop , with a narrow door and dingy show-window , where a few pots of onions stood on a pane of green glass
no , it is the right thing to do , this time quite particularly , he declared
the bob-run , which led down from the north-western slope of the schatzalp into the valley , was zealously worked on , it would be possible to open it in the next few days , unless a thaw put out all calculations
he seems to sleep , said he , humanely ; though such was far from being the case
and on high days and holy-days , after the cake and wine , he made one of the long line of pupils who , in grey and green uniform with a stripe on the trousers , high collar and kepi , went walking in the country
but the truth was , neither of the cousins was sure the other believed it ; if they did not meet each other ’ s eyes , it was because of the doubt both pairs of eyes sought to hide , and because the eyes had met before
and , as madame gr� , should she drink morning chocolate ?
here is your latest photo , take it and hold it up to the light
it leaned there , set off against the cold lifelessness of the inanimate world , in its own vaporous sphere , relaxed , the head crowned with something cool , horny , and pigmented , which was an outgrowth of its skin ; the hands clasped at the back of the neck
but he would lift his head , with the curling light-brown hair , inflate one delicate nostril , and it was as if he cau-tiously sniffed the air about him , expecting to perceive that odour , that strange and yet familiar odour which , at his grand-mother 's bier , not all the scent of the flowers had been able to disguise
we passed some of the villages that we had left smoking in our rear , and the hill where the tragic woman had stood
is distinctly a malicious slander and fits me not a whit
what word did not shake , as only too often the hand that wrote it , with the vibrations not alone of the catastrophe towards which my story strives but simulta- neously of that cataclysm in whose sign the world - at least the bourgeois , the human world - stands today ?
in the cantata he is clearly drawn in the charac- ter of a tempter ; and the tempting of jesus by satan is unmis- takably suggested ; as unmistakably also is the apage !
even so , he seemed to cling to the soothing ne- cessity of an early leave-taking and fixed departure by the eleven- o ' c ] ock train
like to that other , what thrilling opportunities it offered , what prospects lay concealed within it of coming into social relations with frau chauchat !
she stuck her glasses on her nose , unfastened the two great leather hasps of the book , opened it to the place where there was a book-mark , took a sip of eau , sucree , and began to read , from the yellowed page with the large print , the christmas chapter
but he was enraptured not so much because she looked so charming , as because her charm added strength to the sweet intoxication in his brain , the intoxication that willed to be , that cared only to be justified and nourished
a man knows by a certain numbness of the features that he has gone pale ; the drops of perspiration which may come out on his brow are deathly cold as well
he waited , erect and composed , on the edge of the sofa , buttoned up tight in his ulster
there was the unhappy wehsal , consumed by his louring passion for frau chauchat ; who grovelled before peeperkorn and hans castorp , the one on grounds of the past , the other for the sake of the compelling present
don ’ t pay too much attention to my prattle
they argued over it in adrian 's presence and each put on the other the merit of the attention they paid him
they envied those actively engaged the chance , the justification for screaming ; a gnawing desire to do likewise possessed mind and body , and he who could not summon strength to flee apart , was soon willy-nilly in the midst of the mêlée
no , people do not do that now , there are other man-of-honour rules , you are not to say no , especially if the woman is pretty , though in rather a fatal and suffering way
medical books and lllagazines lay about , for instance an illustrated history of morals , in the room where adrian for the first and the second time awaited his treatment
do you find it so disgusting to have to sit next to me ?
that same morning the master 's two maids had made off , for the night be- fore , at about one o'clock , there had been a furious quarrel , rous-
she had known it for that from the first , and only hoped that ziemssen by his pigheadedness had not made it putrid
johann buddenbrook gave him a quick glance and let the glass down hastily
she gazed at him with her brown , close-set , blue-shadowed eyes ; as he stood before her , she took his head in both her hands and kissed him on the brow
herr brechl 's nervous exertions communicated themselves to thomas buddenbrook 's whole body , he was even lifted up a little on his chair , and he heard a soft , squeaking noise coming from the dentist 's tjiroat
his head was hot ; for he had treated his friend franz not only to many beers , but to champagne wine as well
there were cases of choking , some of them having been in the act of chewing and swallowing when the excitement began
once you are up here , why not ?
i repeat , he said , with one lancelike finger reared up , i repeat , that therein lies our duty , our sacred duty to feel
item , some doctores assert and swear by peter and paul there must be brain specialists among the little ones , amateurs in the cerebral sphere , in short a virus nerveux
after he had prayed with joachim , the patient assumed an official tone and air , and uttered his wishes in the form of short commands
both cousins were surprised by the luxury of the two-windowed study
it will do me good—i feel our visit just now has done me good already
it is at an end , i tell you -- you draw your pay , and stay away from the office
it ’ s a fantastic little gadget , and ingenious
the city , the state , the social community regulated according to the principle of division of labour , not only might be compared to organic life , it actually reproduced its conditions
under herr settembrini ’ s critical eye—he played the connoisseur , though innocent of sports—hans castorp acquired a pair of oaken skis , finished a light-brown , with tapering , pointed ends and the best quality of straps
but johann buddenbrook was already dead
what are you talking about ?
my suspicions were not definite , she stammered
she gave him a halflength red pencil in a silver holder , and warned him in an agreeable , husky voice to be sure to return it to her after the hour
she was a tall blonde , with large features whitened by cosmetics , a full lower lip and under- developed chin ; she was preparing for a dramatic career and stud- ied with an elderly actor who played father parts at the hof- theater
it was a significant fact that the whole town , the bourse , the docks , the club , and the street called them by theii first names -- peter and chris
of the traditional world of the russian and french ballets , represented by a tchaikovsky , a ravel , a stra- vinsky , he had no notion ; ideas about the classical ballet such as those which the last-named russian master later enunciated , vere remote from his mind : ballet as a triumph of plall and measure over unstable feeling , of order over chance , as a pattern of con- scious , apolline activity , a paradigm for art
frau permaneder repeated over and over again , in her despair : and mother lying there in the next room !

we shall be able to test the truth of his prophecy , for we are destined to spend yet much earthly time at this pleasure resort
he filled the whole house with the rolling periods buddenbrook of his exquisitely modulated , sonorous voice
what you wish to express is—
thus things lool { ed to me , as seen from dr institoris 's side
but that could not be
you are silent , herr settembrini said , moved
it saddened tony to hear him call the nobility idiots and wretches and to see the contemptuous if awkward gesture that accompanied the words
dr faustus as , i say it again , an envoy and message-bearer ; all this lulled the reason in dreams beyond the claims of logic and tinged with the hues of our christian theology
it was a significant decision , one pregnant with fate
goes at him like that , and simply tells him not to behave that way !
i can prolong my days , but only up here
yes , you are without pity , without love , without humility -- dh , he cried , and stretched botr arms in front of him , palms outward , as though pushing eveiything away from him , oh , how sick i am of all this tact and propriety , this poise and refinement -- sick to death of it !
the symptoms of infection have not for a long time corresponded to the local condition , which is undoubtedly very much improved
moreover , he would have no right nor reason to interfere—no more than upon that carnival night on which hans castorp had found himself in a position quite as mad and bad as this one , when he gave the ailing clavdia chauchat back son crayon—his , pribislav hippe ’ s , pencil
they lead a loose and idle life , and imagine themselves entitled to pity , and justified of their bitterness , irony , and cynicism
and though there was no idea of bustling her away from under the parental roof , she plunged at once , with the greatest zest , into the business of finding and renting a new home
he was fortunate in this friendship , and it did him credit ; for dr gieseke , though as much of a rake as christian , knew how to keep his dignity
that happens not once but ten times before i get to sleep
he sang at first softly , in a humming tone , then louder , finally at the top of his voice
i have a couple of rooms at the city of hamburg -- a couple of rooms , thought the frau consul -- which was just what herr gr� meant her to think
there were letters , on torn and yellow paper , written by anxious mothers to their sons abroad -- which the sons had docketed : received and contents duly noted
the hofrat ’ s large , goggling blue eyes watered as he told this story
he would curve forefinger and thumb to a circle ; extend the palm , that was so broad , with nails so pointed , to hush , to caution , to enjoin attention—and then , having by such means led up to some stupendous utterance , produce an anticlimax by saying something his audience could not quite grasp
is that so gernlan ?
but hans castorp gave the mountains only a fleeting glance
poor clothilde bore up under the departure of her rela-tive , as one must bear up under the afflictions of this life
but no matter what his feelings , he must have winter clothing , money , footwear , linen—in brief , everything he might have brought with him had he known he was coming , not for three short summer weeks , but for an indefinite stay which was certain to last for a piece into the winter—or rather , considering the notions about time current up here , was quite likely to last all the winter
dh faustus i , ) year 's separation
last year the horrible man escaped with his life - by now surely only , an insanely flaring and flickering existence - from the plot of desperate patriots trying to salvage
they reached the high road that led along the terraced slope a storey higher than the valley floor
the betrothal of her adored brother rejoiced her heart
this occupied the entire pause till the bell rang , and dr marotzke came in
he had hurried directly to his cousin ’ s room without going first to his own , in order to greet his old-time companion , while his mother was putting herself to rights in the chamber assigned her
his demonstra- tion became very diverting , and likewise flattering , since it as- sumed in us a certain apprentice and brush-washer intimacy with music
i learned that adrian was looking for a theme for an opera and , years before he seriously approached the task , had had love 's labour 's lost in mind
his whiskers were freshly curled , and at this early hour his rosy face was rosier than ever
let her have patience , and wait , and bethink herself a hundred times
at the beginning it seemed endless ; you could not believe that it would end ; it was almost indelicate to suggest such a thing !
you can do what you like : you can harness up all your work-horses -- but you can never drag me back to munich again
but here everything was empty and still , and his road up the broad linoleum-covered stairs lay free
they boasted in conversation of having met knut in the garden , the wood , or the english quarter
hans castorp , as fräulein engelhart said this , gave a hasty glance at joachim bending sedulously over his plate a face gone all mottled
he heard hermine kleefeld say to two of her familiars , the student rasmussen and the thick-lipped young man , whose name was gänser
he had no time
he replied , quite calmly , that he found mynheer peeperkorn a blurred personality ; a personality , that is , undoubtedly , though blurred
there were pictures of saints on the walls of the flat-arched window embrasures , and leaded win- dowpanes that had squares of painted glass let into thenl
not only for the sake of comfort , to be better bedded down ; but most of all because he hopes to get from it good and fine things for his '\tvorking energy and enthu- siasm , for the human content of his future work
there was a pause , in which he gave a little cough
i know you ca not stand me -- you used to hate me ; but -- why , tony !
the bud den-brook ladies from broad street made the remark : well , let 's hope it will last , this time
you perceive that the objects toward which the league directs its efforts are ambitious and broad in their scope
he did know the names -- at least some of them
he confesses : sometimes i cursed the hour i met thee , and tried all vainly to forget thee—only next moment to rue his blasphemy , and pray on his knees to see her once more
and certes i schal be mum , will hold my tunge , were it sheerly out of shame , to spare folkes feelings , for social considerations forsooth !
but one admission i will make ; inez , as , ve know , committed a few years later a capital crime , which aroused general horror and put an end to her bourgeois existence
dizzyingly it escapes your measurement
he acquired some black-bordered note-paper , and wrote to his uncle-cousins : he , the doubly , now , so to say , triply orphaned , expressed himself as being the more distressed over the sad news , for that circumstances forbade him interrupting his present sojourn even to pay his great-uncle the last respects
you might refer to your interest in the medical side
the hofrat ladled coffee and sugar into the long-handled pot , added water , and let the brew boil up over the flame of the lamp

this was the recent habit , for instance vhen he , vas thinldng , of mov- ing his eyeballs rapidly to and fro rather far , from one side to the other , rolling them , as we say

the jest had for its point a jeer at the senator 's carefully preserved and faultless exterior -- and it was received as a masterpiece of wit by his fellow-citizens

in so few years -- oh , that 's simple , answered herr kesselmeyer , good-temperedly
gaffer , why are you circling and spying up there ?

why should not the child have her own little ideas about such things , at her age ?
he was an idler pure and simple , whose special characteristic was a sort of rough good humour

and i have the rule ’ at my fingers ’ ends , and observe it faithfully
he rubbed his hand over his eye and forehead , drawing a long , deep breath , mechanically lighted another rigarrlle , though he knew they were bad for him , and continued to gaze through the smoke-haze into the darkness
no ; what you are saying interests me
with the help of a sort of metal shoehorn from her pocket , she looked at the patient ’ s tonsils , hans castorp standing by with the lamp
the material must have been extraordinarily stiff , for the edges stood out in a circle around the legs of his short , broad boots
you have a business friend from somewhere , and you invite him to dinner
and i can assure you that his prejudices , in so far as they exist , are in no case of a petty or bourgeois character
but he himself felt sure that the increase in his bodily heat had to do with the mental activity and excitation which kept him in his chair on the balcony until deep into the glittering , frosty night
fdr people without overshoes are suffering , and stamping their feet to warm them
but now joachim had made another discovery , he had fathomed the duplicity of his cousin—without , be it said , any faintest intention of so doing , without having bent his military honour to the office of spy

i only suggested that a great deal of virtuosity , foreign or not , was after all a component of wagner 's internationally so well-tolerated art - and then charitably distracted his mind by speaking of an article on problems of proportion in gothic archi- tecture , which he had recently , vritten for the periodical art and artists
one read of it in the novels
how have you got a right to treat me like that ?
the recipient read it with a certain surprise , and on account of its literary quality it could not possibly be passed over in silence

he even raised himself a little , bent over , and looked his vis-a-vis in the face , with his mouth open
i am not afraid of that

it was half past three by his watch when he was roused by voices behind the left-hand glass partition
the table-d'hote was very gay , for this was a good season at the baths , and the great dining-room was filled with acquaintances of the buddenbrooks , hamburg families , and even some russians and english people
the worst of it was that hans castorp would clearly not have been surprised if she had

well , castorp , i won ’ t grudge you human society any longer
there were modifications of this organic plurality united to form the higher ego : cases where the multitude of subordinate entities were only grouped in a loose and doubtful way to form a higher living unit
he got up , and the con-sultation was at an end
his muscles relaxed , his head sank weakly on his shoulder , his eyes closed , and a pathetic , almost an anguished smile of speechless rapture hovered about his mouth ; while his tremolo , among the rippling and rustling runs from the violin , to which he now added runs in the bass , glided over into b major , swelled up suddenly into forte , and after one brief , resounding burst , broke off

he still wore his pilot coat and check trousers
his researches , which dealt with psycho-analysis and the dream-life of humanity , had always had a subterranean , not to say catacombish character ; but now , by a transition so gradual that one scarcely marked it , they had passed over to the frankly supernatural , and his fortnightly lectures in the dining-room—the prime attraction of the house , the pride of the prospectus , delivered in a drawling , foreign voice , in frock-coat and sandals from behind a little covered table , to the rapt and motionless berghof audience—these lectures no longer treated of the disguised activities of love and the retransformation of the illness into the conscious emotion
you would think old behrens must admit to having made a mistake in the treatment ?
and it went so well -- it always went so well !

yet it seemed to him , as he thought about it , that what one characterized as absurd might also be thought of as intellectually honourable ; from which it would follow that the absurd hostility to nature evinced by gothic art , when all was said and done , was as fine in its way as the gestures of plotinus or voltaire , since it testified to the selfsame emancipation , the same indomitable pride , which refused to abdicate in favour of blind natural forces— naphta burst out laughing
you are right , she had answered , and arranged the laces through which her bosom shimmered like marble
it was a simple affair , a motif entirely of his own invention , which he had slightly developed
it stood at the side of a flat open space laid out with lawns and sandy paths and country flower-beds ; beyond it , the forest rose gradually like an amphitheatre

it was agreed at length to leave the decision to the elder rotbein , soon to arrive
at the other end of the table frau reiff energetically presided between adrian and schwerdtfeger , next to whom sat , respectively , a young , or still young professional woman , mlle godeau , a french swiss , and her aunt , a thoroughly good-natured ,

his ention could escape no- body , certainly not the child
the experienced joachim had already moved over toward the entrance door and taken position at a stand ; at his back was the lofty structure of the apparatus , with a bulb half full of water , and distillation tubes ; in front of him , breast-high , hung a framed screen on pulleys
the party was thinning out ; many of the guests had presumably taken up the horizontal

but in truth , the fathers of the early church were never weary of warning the faithful against the lies of the old philosophers and poets , in particular of cautioning them not to be corrupted by the voluptuous eloquence of virgil ; and to-day , at a time when again an age is declining to its fall , and we see the approaching dawn of another proletarian morn , the time is ripe to feel with them
hans castorp replied that the hofrat had taken the words out of his mouth , and offered him what he was on the point of asking
a charming woman like her , in the bloom of youth—why should she , every time she gives a man her hand to kiss , tell him straightway that she is bound in wedlock ?
my instrument came from the paro- chialstrasse , a present from my parents at my confirmation
then came scenes from all parts of the world : the president of the french republic , in top-hat and cordon , sitting in a landau and replying to a speech of welcome ; the viceroy of india , at the wedding of a rajah ; the german crown prince in the courtyard of a potsdam garrison
but in general we would emphasize the fact that people in hans castorp ’ s state regularly feel a craving for self-revelation , an impulse to confess themselves , a blind preoccupation with self , and a thirst to possess the world of their own emotions , which is the more offensive to the sober onlooker , the less sense , reasonableness , or hope there lies in the whole affair

hans castorp made a face ; but his eyes remained fixed on madame chauchat ’ s back , as he vaguely recalled what dr krokowski had been saying , about counteracting influences of a bourgeois kind , which set themselves up against the power of love—the arm , in its gentle upward curve , was better than the hand ; it was scarcely clothed , for the material of the sleeve was thinner than that of the blouse , being the lightest gauze , which had the effect of lending the arm a sort of shadowed radiance , making it prettier than it might otherwise have been
he felt common , clumsybooted
deuce take it—was he never to have a moment ’ s peace ?
he nodded , read the remaining sentences , closed the book , and looked about him
all you have just now said came from the very depths of your personality ; even the present stage you have arrived at found there poetic expression , and showed itself to be still the experimental—

as they passed the boulders where morten schwarz-kopf sat , tony nodded to him from a distance , and somebody asked , who is that you are bowing to , tony ?
the mistakes of these favourites would be passed over with neat , careful corrections , so that their work retained a respectable appearance , no matter how bad it was ; whereas he would attack the other copy-books with heavy , ruthless pen , and fairly flood them with red ink , so that their appearance was shocking indeed
he was in the real sense of the word a man of disinclination , avoidance , reserve , aloofness
he fairly bellowed , and with the words appeared to fling off the last vestige of restraint and go stark mad , shaking his fist at emerentia , literally showing her his foaming teeth
and now he is bankrupt
they had tried all that already
woods , meadows , mountains , trees , lakes , beauty of scenery ?
in matter it was an exposition of the philosophy of sensual passion , developed in a spirit of debonair and man-of-the-worldly paganism
tbe brass does not start from the beginning as it did the first time , but as though its melody had already been tere for a while ; and it continues , solemnly , to that climax from which it wisely refrained the first time , in order that the surging feeling , the ah-h-effect , might be the greater : novv it gloriously bestrides its theme , mounting unchecked , with weighty support from the passing notes on the tuba , and then , looking back , as it were , with dignified satisfaction on the finished achievement , sings itself dec- orously to the end
but there must be something about the man too , if she can ’ t bear to be with him

joachim suddenly choked violently , and could scarcely get his breath
and thus m stanislaw von zutawski was constrained to apply without delay to the undersigned and to authorize them to institute honourable proceedings against the said m kasimir japoll
for it is plain that from that moment rebellion becomes a crime—
the fear of invasion grows : , ve await the attack , from all sides , with preponderance of material and millions of soldiers , on our european fortress - or shall say our prison , our madhouse ?
she tossed bark her head , stretched out her arms before her , or flung them above her head as she talked ; and her voice showed by turns anger and dismay , passionate opposition and deep feeling
this juliet mollendorpf , or hagenstrbm -- or semm-linger -- whatever she is , the- creature ! -- imagine , mamma !
i have never found any other teeth to compare with them , not in valparaiso , or london , or anywhere else in the world
yes , that is what you are , hans castorp asserted , and struck the table with the flat of his hand
but you have always known how to reconcile it with regular work and a serious life
i-ie decreed that there should be masters and servants in every scale
but one doesn ’ t like to seem forth-putting
it may be the sentimenta ] disingenuousness to which the vice leads , or is always immanenr in it , that causes my unconquerable distaste
there was a plucked fowl , with its long writhen neck hanging down from a table among a setting of vegetables
at this hour , she said , the café life was not yet in full swing , the dancing became much livelier as the evening advanced , and numerous patients from the sanatoria , as well as dissipated folk from the hotels and the kurhaus , many more than were here as yet , came later to join the fun
since joachim ’ s departure hans castorp sat no more at frau stöhr ’ s table , the one with dr blumenkohl ’ s empty place , at which the gay marusja had been wont to smother her irresponsible mirth in her orange-scented pocket-handkerchief
hans castorp heard of a new sport that had come from scandinavia , ski-jöring : it consisted in races in which the participants were drawn by horses while standing in their skis
he came on children 's day , and was received civilly by the relatives of his betrothed
and then , there is something else , gerda dear
who would ' a ' thought it ?
cerda looked rather dis-dainfully from one to the other , and tony wrung her hands , imploring -- tom , christian !
i don ’ t enjoy seeing him smoke , either ; it distresses me , because i know it is not good for him and gives him melancholia
the invasion of our beautiful sicily by no means proved that it was possible for the foe to gain a footing on the italian mainland

the son of poor madame josephine had had the worst of it in life , compared with the younger and stronger brother and sister born of madame antoinette
but the seasons up here followed the calendar with halting steps , and only within the last few days had spring fairly arrived : a spring still without hint of summer ’ s denser air , rarefied , ethereal , and balmy , with the sun sending silvery gleams from a blue heaven , and the meadows blithe with parti-coloured flowers
the woman , the gipsy girl , can not , will not understand

thus one passed from the supposed smallest unit to a still smaller one ; one was driven to separate the elementary into its elements
to the graveyard then , on the slope of the dorfberg , the three wended their way— we tell it to complete the tale of their excursions
then the consul turned back to the front of the book , to some pages written in bluish ink , in a hand full of flourishes , on paper that was like parchment , but tattered and spotted with age
i want a home , and somebody who will be sympa-thetic when i am ill and we suit each other very well
there are situations where—quarrels that—in short , i am at this man ’ s service
noborly was pleased to have him called up after the gentle perlemann
it might be true and it might not ; but was he , thomas buddenbrook , called upon to express such ideas -- was he called upon even to think them ?
she was silent , and looked neither id the right nor to the left
with pribislav ’ s very eyes she had looked at him , and at the spots of blood on his coat ; her look had been rather bold and ruthless too , as a woman ’ s would be who let doors bang behind her
what did she reply ?
this paroxysm of anger was out of proportion to the cir-cumstances , no , it was not the hundred and twenty-seven thousand marks that had brought him to this unprecedented state of rage
the guests went up to them at once on entering , courteously ready to praise
the g minor concerto of bach , herr pfuhl
this made hans castorp go from tears to laughing ; and thus he was tossed back and forth among varying emotions , until the dawn came through his half-open balcony door and wakened him
herr settembrini spoke with droll and plastic effect
it was the overture to die meistersinger
that is good too

christian was now more than ever master of his own lime
it was a very pretty scene when the consul led hi ?
all that is at an end , tom -- you know all ?
this reduced the offender to silence , for certainly peeperkorn , as host and dispenser of the good cheer , might find fault with its quality if he chose
then i will lend it to you
i can not express the mournful pity which almost overcame me
the business is young , but in fine condition -- assets must be somewhere about a hundred and twenty thousand thaler , and that is obviously only the situation at the moment , for he makes a good slice every year
james asked him , shivering in his inch-thick ulster
he flung the covers over him , one after the other : first from the left side , all their length up to his shoulders , then from the feet up , then from the right side , so that he formed , when finished , a neat compact parcel , out of which stuck only his head , shoulders , and arms
hans castorp gazed thoughtfully at it
at the same time polyphony predominates in the extreme , and every part is quite independent at every moment
the shouts that greeted him when , i amust almost say on rare occasions : he appeared at a session in the smoke- filled private room in mtitze 's tavern , did contain a little fun at the expense of his supposed misanthropy ; but they expressed genuine pleasure as well
ing in the scenarios freely and more or less the dialogue , after which it was i who in my spare time quickly gave them their final form in mixed prose and rhymed lines
i needed only to imagine that instead of speaking myself to my helene , instead of using my own tongue , i had sent some attractive friend of mine to tell her my love , to see the whole equivocal absurdity of what he had done
the mystery of life was literally bottomless
well , tom , said the consul expansively , and took the cigar out of his mouth , we are arranging that rye sale i fold you about , with van henkdom and company
how the phrase suited the man !
it ended , apparently , in the triumph of chastity
on a party like this he is inimitable , it is true -- we shall have crabs to eat , herr permaneder , he said in a livelier tone ; crabs and baltic shrimps !
well , i have made up my mind to concern myself a bit in future with the severe cases and the moribund
i know i gave him cause to worry and complain over my ex-travagance and silliness and my new dressing-gowns

incited by frau stöhr , who joined them at the exit , they paid a visit to the café at the kurhaus , karen clapping her hands in delighted gratitude
this last letter was exhaustive , it covered the case ; not according to the time-conceptions of down below , but according to those obtaining up here ; it asserted hans castorp ’ s freedom
but with all this , rudi appeared depresseq by certain circum- stances of his private life ; in short by his liaison with inez insti- toris , about which he relieved himself in private to adrian
your tale is told
such was individualism , in its two aspects—all things unto all men
all this hans castorp did , and all this we report of him , indifferent to the danger that someone may thereby be reminded of ferdinand wehsal , who once was wont to carry hans castorp ’ s overcoat
but that never occurred to him
when she and the consul were alone , in the room lighted by burned-down candles , with the furniture disarranged and the air thick with heavy odours of rich food , wine , cigars , coffee , perfume , and the scent of the flowers from the ladies ' toilettes and the table decorations , he pressed her hand and said : very good , gerda
the german element they avoided entirely - schild- knapp invariably took to flight so soon as a sound of his mother tongue struck on his ear
is not everything wonderful ? —my child , he went on , with a perfectly serious face , almost sternly , you surpass all my expectations
there was really no danger that the solemnity of the feast would be rudely broken in upon by youthful high spirits
the frau consul , health permitting , would attend tom 's wedding in amsterdam
and the most dreadful thing is that i ca not help seeing through you with such dis-gusting clearness !
the church of st mary ' a was entirely shrouded in rain and darkness

the ceiling light came on
that country too lay remote from the humanistic mean , though on the side of austerity rather than of softness
there was a neat little office , with a typist busy at her machine and three clerks bending over desks
the dutchman ’ s manner toward hans castorp ’ s friends was rather mocking than ironic
why have we given the platonic philosophy the preference over every other , if not because it has to do with knowledge of god , and not knowledge of nature ?
he was , permissibly at this hour , smoking a cigarette
he would walk up and down with the same unquiet and brooding eyes
the fact might rest upon sympathy and physical likeness , for the grandson resembled the grandfather , in so far , that is , as a rosy youth with the down on his chin might resemble a bleached , rheumatic septuagenarian , yet it probably spoke even more for that which was indeed the truth , that the grandfather had been the real personality , the picturesque figure of the family

do you remelnber a certain lecture given for the society for the common weal from which it fol- lowed that in music one certainly need not hear everything ?
he sat there lost in troubled and bitter thoughts of his fate and his future , when a member of the teaching staff of the morning star , the pensionnat of the society of jesus , out for a walk , sat down near him , put down his hat on the bench , crossed one leg over the other under his cassock , and after reading his breviary awhile began a conversation which waxed very lively , and proved in the end a decisive factor in leo ’ s destiny
yes , in fact , this was the idea he had in mind and hoped to be able to carry out -- provided the broker did not try to drive too hard a bargain with him , ha , ha !

it was no matter , she said
but it is probably something else , responded deutschlin
how should we come to be doing that ?
but they found her out by exchanging her regular thermometer for a silent sister
do freemasons believe in god ?
no , she is a russian , was the answer
madame kethelsen , her simple sister , had grown rapidly deaf and had understood almost nothing of tony 's affair
tony , what an idea !
you are not usually lacking in dig-nity
even more telling , schleppfuss thought , for the psychological situation , was the restriction imposed upon a youth of that same period : it had come upon him by no fault of his own , through fe- male witchcraft , and tragic indeed had been the means of his re- lease
i do not so interpret it ; but rather think that if some blemish existed it lay in the realm of the spirit and taught her to understand every sort of need for consideration and scru- pulous tact
that vvill keep you safe
well , you sha not do it , then , shouted the senator , and sprang up
the consul had scarcely reached home again when he was attacked by a fresh misfortune , which had for the moment shaken his firm to its foundations and by which it had lost eighty thousand marks at one blow
under the circumstances the best thing , in the dutchman ’ s opinion , was to begin where one had left off ; and that innocent effervescent wine had the same effect as soda-water
i must confess i know nothing
she said it was right , she knew it must be so ; but in her heart she mourned over her sister-in-law 's departure
the hofrat had not much time for private interviews

this choice of a place to live , reproducing the earliest one , this bury- ing oneself in one 's earliest , outlived childhood , or at least in the outer circumstances of tle same - it might indicate attachment , but in any case it is psychologically disturbing
but if herr settembrini meant to suggest that the pleura-shock was a good example of what he was talking about—that torture by tickling , with its stench of sulphur and its three-coloured fainting fit—well , really he was very much obliged to herr settembrini , he really must thank him very kindly indeed ; but there had been nothing of the sort about the pleura-shock—not it !
and thus began tony buddenbrook 's third marriage
the young pair had made calls in only a few houses ; for the director , a serious and preoccupied man , with no social experience , intended to devote what leisure he had to intimate domesticity
i ca not realize it !
more annoying for me personally was the presence of dr chaim breisacher , the lover of paradox , already known to the reader
he had practised fur a long time on the piano , and now was idling about in the living-room
how odd it was , that she still did not know his first name !
it was in no eerie or ghostly sense that the scene affected the sympathetic one as mystic or mysterious , as conducing to solemnity ; it was rather natural , organic—by virtue of the intimate association we have already referred to
he drew upon his repertory of comic songs , and half sang , half recited , with incomparable pantomime and highly suggestive gesture : i sauntered out one day , in an idle sort o ' way , and rhanced id see a maid , ahead o ' me
ther 's evolution iverywheer , in berlin , in paris -- but , smolt , what do you want ?
he sat bent over , tracing figures on the ground with the ferrule of his cityish silvermounted walking-stick
he repeated the word , and held up one hand before his face with the fingers crooked , in the same gesture as when he used to tell about maria and the depravity of london
it was a trait of her family : the uncle that died had had white hair at thirty
hans castorp took an interest in this glimpse into the business side of the enterprise
but perhaps she had failed in the service of the cure , perhaps hers was one of those cases in which the air proved in the first instance to be good not against but for the disease
i have been here the whole afternoon -- yes , herr consul , brought out carl smolt , chewing violently
if only mamma had not spoken of getting excited !
that was in the end of may of the year
obviously he , vas primarily concerned with the typical progress of the case and a clear clinical picture in all its stages
he knew more than that
they could not dissimulate , and they would accept no responsibility for omitting to say that little johann was fright-fully slow about learning to walk and talk
just try to imagine my sensations , and how frightened i was !
you have acted like a distracted person , in a perfectly unreasonable way
she was a raw-boned jewess , of about the same age as nacke- cley , with thick , unmanageable woolly hair and brown eyes where timeless grief stood written for the daughter of zion despoiled and her people as a forsaken hearth
humanist—yes , certainly , i am a humanist
it happened on the way to the opera
how long were the gentlemen thinking of stopping ?

he knew that the thought which tony hugged to her breast in secret was being spoken in the street
thought han no in despair
how much did it lose by the bremen failure ?
jeanette scheurl whispered magnifique !
if weakness it were , it was the only one the sharp eye of the child ever noted in his grandfather ’ s exterior
too bad about the feasts of roses !
the same tremendous meals were served here as at the others ; rhadamanthus himself occasionally folded his huge hands before the doctor ’ s place at the head ; and the nations who ate there were respectable members of the human race , even though they boasted no latin , and were not exaggeratedly dainty at their feeding
from here you could look into the pretty little garden , which was well laid out , though just now brown and sodden with the autumn rains , its beds protected with straw mats against the cold
the chord is no harmonic narcotic but polyphony in itself , and the notes that form it are parts
he had grown skilled in the handling of his rugs and the art of making a proper bundle , a sort of mummy , of himself , when lying on his balcony on cold days
strictly speaking it was not three days , but as many minutes , which brought about the change
or take an hour spent in the rest-cure , at the dinnertable , or on the daily walk—and these ways of employing the time-unit practically exhausted its possibilities—what was an hour ?
in other words , if he can paint a little below the surface , and stands in another relation to nature than just the lyrical , so to say
director weinschenk was , like erica , devoid of every social connection : the two were thus , in a manner , marked out for each other -- it was plainly the hand of god himself
individually they had probably all questioned themselves , in these last few days ; they knew whither their thoughts tended
he pressed your hands
their guide , the manager of the estate , himself told them , with compassionate head-shakings , as a fact worth mention , that the villagers only had meat one day in the year , at christmas , and had not even tallow candles , but literally went to bed with the chickens
i could keep down the soup the mother brought me
hans castorp was not on sick-diet
i brar in myself the seed , the tendency , the possibility of all capacity and all achievement
thanks for your telegram -- of course , it shocked us a good deal -- she stopped
when behrens says half a year , you can make up your mind it will be more
what did he mean by introducing such a subject—what kind of upbringing had he had ?
but at last a lucky turn gave him a clearer view ; he hastily arrested his hand and brought his intelligence to bear
he turned on his heel and moved away , as if his words had settled the matter
the room belonged to the beer-hall and danceestablishment of a widow named suerkringel ; but on certain days it was at the service of the gentlemen burgesses
the man was an resthete unnerved by erotic excesses and in a religious sense a progressivist blockhead , typical of the back-formation of the cult of the effectively present national god , the general concept of the metaphysical power of the folk , into the preaching of an abstract and generally human god in heaven ; in other words , from the religion of the people to the religion of the world
the friendly and helpful attitude of french constitutionalism toward the new , practical ideals and interests of our time is some-thing we should be deeply thankful for practical ideals -- well , yees -- the elder buddenbrook gave his jaws a moment 's rest and played with his gold snuff-box
but then he would suddenly have the thought that the whole thing was a senseless folly , and confess to himself that his present house had plenty of room for himself , his wife , their child , and their servants
to put such words in god 's mouth is already simply unheard of , a slap of impertinent enlightenment in the face of the pentateuch , which expressly describes the sacrifice as 'the bread ' - that is , as the ac- tual nourishment of jahve
but catarrhs are not caused by cold ; they come from an infection , which one takes from being in a receptive state
the unnatural condition , vas not removed , the attacks recurred intermittently , and the afflicted one declared he could stand them if it were not for the permanent and constant pain in the head , above the eyes , and that indescribable , paralysis-like feeling all over from the top of the head to the tips of the toes , which seemed to affect the organs of speech as well
he had a hand-organ , propped by a sort of wooden leg against the pavement , and as he played a sprightly air , he flung his humanistic eyes up to the people in the houses
it consoles me to be able to tell myself that the reader can not lay to my charge the extraordinary size of the last chapter , which considerably exceeds the disquieting number of pages in the one on kretschmar 's lectures
the heart of hans castorp rejoiced in the blessed fact that two vacant and securely tranquil hours lay before him , dedicated by the rules of the house to the principal cure of the day ; he felt it—though himself but a guest up here—to be a most suitable arrangement
then he got red , tossed his half-dozen spoons back into the chest , and exclaimed , 'who told you i was going to do any-thing with these things but look at them ?
the darkness of her colouring , the black hair , the black eyes with their quiet , friendly gaze , might have made me take her for an italian were it not for a certain sturdiness in the facial structure
settembrini had ceased to have residence at the berghof , he had taken up his abode with lukaçek , the ladies ’ tailor—and that indeed some weeks back
everybody flew downstairs and through the breakfast-room into the bedroom
she tapped softly with the sole of the foot that rested on the floor
sports activities were unconditionally forbidden at the berghof as in all other establishments of the kind
he may laugh at my pedantry , but i consider it right to let him know that since i be- gan writing almost a year has passed ; and that whilst i have been composing the last chapters , april has arrived
why are you making such a face ?
in their place were the only guests not members of the family
adrian 's ca- pacity for mocking imitation , which vias rooted deep in the mel- ancholy of his being , became creative here in the parody of the

pastor tiburtius had modestly chosen a bed-chamber in the back building next the billiard-room
i do not think you can comprehend such meanness
we aren ’ t more than three steps from the conception that tuberculosis is a disease of the blood
it was he who with due respect dubbed it inaccessible—and afforded herr settembrini the chance of saying that this particular rock was considerably frequented
that is as good as all there is to it
with clothing dishevelled , his features so distorted as to strike terror to the beholders ; the eyes dazed , absent , listening , all at once ; he had stared at them , they got the impression that he had come out of a life-and-death struggle with all the opposing hosts of counterpoint
they clawed at each other ’ s faces , clutched throats or noses , grappled , hewed loose from each other and rolled together on the floor , spat , kicked , worried , and foamed at the mouth
superfluous to account for herr peeperkorn
he rots away , liver , kidneys , stomach , heart , bowels ; some day his voice will be a croak , or he will be deaf , after a few years he will ingloriously shuffle off this coyle , with a cynical quip on his lips - what then ?
it is just the chagrin that upsets him , poor man
what belongs to you is well invested , and brings you in something safe
but will it do any good ?
herr settembrini looked at him , as so often he had looked in the course of the years , with melancholy black eyes
why should we beat about the bush ?
you overslept , did not you ?
i am standing here with my eyes shut , and have quite a pleasant sleepy feeling
consul peter , like justus kr� , belonged to the group of young men whom the town called fast
i mean the ones at our table
dh , i see -- the pavor repeated frau permaneder
thomas buddenbrook finally declared that he must take time to think , and that in any case he must consult his sister , before he accepted the twenty-eight thousand thaler -- which was unlikely
hans castorp changed colour
he summoned them , with raised forefinger—and that pointed finger was like a waving standard or the flash of an unsheathed sword , as his words were like the rallying-cry of the leader , which brings to a stand the threatened rout
yes , that is the middle ages , the way the books say ; and i can more or less recognize in this thing the conception i have been getting of them lately
there was a feeling of indiscretion , even of guilt , bound up with it , not quite alla ) ted by the feeling that science must be allowed to press just as far forwards as it is given the in- telligence of scientists to go
hans castorp was rather put off to see the dutchman wearing not a white night-shirt , but a long-sleeved woollen vest , buttoned at the wrists and collar-less , cut round in the neck , and clinging to the old man ’ s powerful torso , his broad shoulders and breast
sounds as though she had been dead a very long time
hans castorp returned to his invisible , melodious pair of lovers
he had got his musical educa- tion in his country of origin ; but he was early drawn back to the old world whence his grandparents had once migrated , and where his own roots lay and those of his art
or rather , said he , i ’ ll fetch my revolver ; that will be more interesting
the elder kr� was telling the most delightful stories ; and his son justus , who sat with dr grabow down at the bottom of the table , near the children , was chaffing mamsell jungmann
she only turned her head as her daughter entered , and her face wore an almost defensive expression
they were sensible and beautiful , by no means small , but slender and small-boned , the wrists encircled by the cuffs of a white silk blouse
bevi , bevil said the padrona
you must admit that from the other side it has something suitable about it - on that side where you got it from , and indeed forewarned , from the side of your pretty song with the letter symboi- oh , really ingeniously done , and almost as though by inspiration : when once thou gavest to me at night the cooling draught , with poison didst undo me
one evening the social hour happened to be livelier than usual—which it might be at any time without especial cause
most particularly in the late work , where audacity and despair mingle in so unique a , vay , the jvebeklag of dr faustus , written in pfeiffering , where the inclination shows even more strongly to use those intervals also in a sirlultaneous-harmonic combination
he did not betray that he felt the blow
oh , a souvenir , the nephew answered
for all interest in disease and death is only another expression of interest in life , as is proven by the humanistic faculty of medicine , that addresses life and its ails always so politely in latin , and is only a division of the great and pressing concern which , in all sympathy , i now name by its name : the human being , the delicate child of life , man , his state and standing in the universe
you have got it good here , said herr permaneder , as he let himself down in his chair and looked at the variety of cold meats on the table
naphta cited arndt , who cursed industrialism and glorified the nobility ; and görres , the author of christian mysticism
she gave an order to mamsell severin , and the spinster went out through the hall , past thr rhoir-boys and the poor and down the corridor to christian 's room , where she knocked on the door
it was the same with the skating in the wintertime , and with the bathing in summer at the wooden bathing establishment of hcrr asmussen , down on the river
herr gr� sat silent , stiff , irresolute ; his mouth opened and closed without a word coming out
al- ways , we were told , the opponents and rivals of the bold inno- vator asserted that beethoven could not write a fugue
he changed his shirt every day , sometimes twice a day , and perfumed his handkerchief and his moustache , which he wori !
to me it was a moral certainty that the contrast between the eyes of the two parents , the blending of hers into his , was what formed his taste in this respect or rather made it waver
the excellent man set out his views , with eloquence if some embarrassment : spoke of the difference between line and dash , told the tale of the forest green and the scuttle of coals , and made use in every other sentence of the phrase in consequence
on his one hand he might have a precipitous , pine-clad declivity , falling away into the mists ; on the other sheer rock might rise , with masses of snow , in monstrous , cyclopean forms , all domed and vaulted , swelling or cavernous
he could see the narrow head of old hans lorenz , as it bent musing over the pale gold rim of the christening basin , that symbol of the passing and the abiding , of continuity through change
dr zimbalist 's eyes were cast down like those of a man taking heed to his steps on the stairs
there is , after all , something peculiar about the process of habituating oneself in a new place , the often laborious fitting in and getting used , which one undertakes for its own sake , and of set purpose to break it all off as soon as it is complete , or not long thereafter , and to return to one ’ s former state
the tired , worried eyes gazed at objects without seeing them ; they became red and watery
that 's all , he said , and put his cigar into the ash-receiver
then he commanded that the register be brought , and slowly marked down for laziness all those pupils -whose performances of the morning had been deficient -- or entirely lacking -- six or seven marks at one fell swoop
it was just this that made one sad
you want to badger me into abetting your damned hypocrisy , so that you can sleep in comfort , while other people have to wake and watch and grin and bear it
eh , ingegnere , un po ’ di ragione , sa !
as was to be expected , frau permaneder protested against the sale of the house which her brother had built
but at the same time they were an end in themselves too
dh , so you are leaving me in the lurch , edgar , said dr mantelsack with tender reproach
christian 's reply to this was one that made gerda budden-brook turn and gaze at him with an enigmatic expression in her eyes
she jumped out of bed and opened the blinds
naphta , continuing , derived the reverence which the christian middle ages paid to physical suffering from the fact that it acquiesced on religious grounds in the sight of the anguish of the flesh
very good , said hans castorp
they take each other ’ s hands and dance in a ring—the whole square is full of dancing people
permit me , said he
dn the third di fourth day after his arrival the hop dealer let it be known that he had concluded his business with the local brewery
i should be mad to believe it
he was most friendly with the boy as they drove out together to the cemetery , in the first carriage behind the hearse
we shall see : what does caesar say ?
no , papa , he said , and his tone bespoke finality , i must advise you not to give in
why could not he be reasonable ?
he : w ouldst like to besides , and art well content that thou canst hear
on one of these visits she asked if she might go up and see the senator a minute
we put it in this way on purpose , in order to suggest another element , an illusory , even , to speak plainly , a morbid element , which is quite definitely a factor in the situation
the pale shimmer of this tender , though not emaciated , bosom , losing itself in the bluish shadows of the drapery , was very like life
but sometimes one starts out with having an opinion and feeling righteous indignation and all that , and then something comes up that has nothing to do with judgments and criticism , and then it is all up with your severity , and you feel disgusted with the republic and the bello stile—
oh , very well , let it strike , and get along with your prussian woman !
and i am so stupid , i do not know what is rhadamanthus
- declared it of his own ac- cord to his parents at buchel , who received the news even better pleased ; and had already told me earlier , confessing at the same time that he did not envisage his choice as preparation for taking a parish and assuming a cure of souls , but as an academic career
and i ( retschmar 's re- ply : that document i have not by me
i have been here listening to the wind ; the weather is something fearful
is it my fault that phthisis and concupiscence go together—slight harshness here ?
only what surprises me is that the glands are erected for such different reasons
thus kretschmar , on beethoven and the fugue ; and cer- tainly it gave us matter for talk on the way home - ground too for being silent together and for vague and silent reflection upon
one day , some three quarters of an hour before dinner , hanno had gone down alone to the first storey
a sigh passed through the assemblage , and lawyer paravant weightily nodded approbation as krokowski proceeded to develop his theme
every-body downstairs , into the fresh air , as quick as possible !
it seemed ashen in the twilight , the pale , weary eyes stared out beneath the great folds of brow , the large chapped lips stood half open , like the mouth of a tragic mask
precisely because they do , because they try to as hard as they can , they are worthy of all respect
we are going to the schwarzkopfs '
he got as far as fishers ' lane and began to descend the left-hand sidewalk
and they observed the season at the berghof , as they did consistently all the recurrent feasts of the year , by way of breaking up and articulating the long stretches of time
the hofrat said : spooky , what ?
i am obliged to inform you , he went on in a sing-song tone , his sharp eyes jumping from one point in the room to another and then to the window , that some time ago i pro-posed for the hand of mademoiselle buddenbrook
the harmonium was an over-powering dream -- which just now he had no time to indulge
it is precisely youth , i mean more highly developed youth , that is more likely to shrink or be scornful , to display hostility
that was genuine salami , the real thing ; herr settembrini ate it with tears in his eyes
she ventured , turning her light eyes a little away , that he might not see the bewilderment they expressed
thee , my friend with silver hair ,
here signora manardi reigned , called nella by her family - i believe her name
it was even my impression that he believed he could use the sufferer 's reduced and as he probably thought more or less helpless state to exert his quite imperturbable ingrati- atingness , enforced by all his personal charm , to conquer a cool- ness , dryness , and ironic withdrawal which annoyed him , on grounds more or less serious , or hurt him , or wounded his vanity , or possibly some genuine feeling on his part - god knows what it was
he tapped all over , as he had with joachim , and several times went back and tapped
her again , and put to her in person the question which he here wrote down with his whole heart and soul : did she not under- stand that a man , out of veneration for another man , could sacri- fice his own feelings and act regardless of them , making himself a selfless advocate of the other 's desire ?
christian no longer knew what he was saying ; he leaned over the table , knocking on it all the while with his knuckle , glaring up , red-eyed , his moustaches bristling , at his brother , who , on his side , stood looking down at him , pale , and with half-closed lids
not for nothing had the angel said to tobias : over them who are given to lewd- ness the demon wins power
\y lutheranism agrees , for it sees in theology and music neighbouring spheres and close of kin ; and besides , music has alvvays seemed to tie personally a magic marriage benveen theology and the so diverting mathe- matic
and turned under these circumstances to god , imploring him to take under his special care and protection his beloved sister
hans castorp started as the door opened in his rear
it was the second summer the friends had spent there
scant confidence in god 's prompting , scant re- spect for it is expressed in that ameilleur ' - itself not so very en- thusiastic either
silly business , hans castorp said , with the ready understanding of the old inhabitant
the great soul of which we are a part may dream through us , in our manner of dreaming , its own secret dreams , of its youth , its hope , its joy and peace—and its blood-sacrifice
he leaned against the wall of the school , drawing his jacket closer about him , yawning and shivering : , i am so scared , kai , that it hurts me all over my body
she has her whims , of course , has maria ; but the inspection must be very thorough , for she doesn ’ t vary much , and draws perfectly even
people posi- tively did not want to know why ope i i i has only two move- ments
that is what i am thinking
he had to lool { very high , intellectually , where he was to feel himself called as musician , and so the german poem to which he gave himself productively is also of the highest rank if without the intellectual distinctiol of the !
the consul was in his easy-chair beside her , and the child perched on her grandfather 's knee in the window
but oh , how easy to understand !
i-iowever , it was here that adrian llade the acquaintance of jeanette scheurl , a woman of peculiar charm and sincerity , a good ten years older than he , daughter of a deceased bavarian government official
they thought of going to the riviera , to nice and so on
my position is so serious -- yes , i admit , it is serious
heavens , what is there to say ?
now and then mother schweigestill would put her head round the door to look for her daughter , whom she might have needed in the house ; but she nodded approvingly at the pair and withdrew
the skin of his face was abraded in spots , and the nose was bruised
genghis khan , he said
and many of my colleagues are as yet unacquainted with the situation which confronts us , namely , that a man can even have tubercular bacilli in his blood without being any the worse for it
i will go to dr gieseke
but now , when the snows were melting , and she was prescribed , at her examination , another six months , on account of whistling sounds in the upper left lung , and unmistakable discords under the left shoulder-blade , her patience suddenly came to an end , and she left for her wet and windy amsterdam , uttering invectives against dorf and platz , the far-famed climate , the doctors , and the international sanatorium berghof
she was a designer , so adrian had been told by frau reiff ; an artist who sketched and
the melodic components pre- sented themselves in different layers , but no jangle or conf ? sion ensued , for the imitation of the first phrase by the second singer fitted itself very pleasantly point for point to the continua
and the lady thus courteously and exotically entreated came and sat down , clasping elly ’ s fragile wrists , one in each hand
do you know what you have done ?
but hans castorp had been for some time now inclined to reject harmless and disinterested explanations as being in the nature of twaddle ; nor could he regard in any other light this oil-painting , considered as a bond of interest between a widower with a robust vocabulary and a narrow-eyed , soft-stepping young female
the atom was a cosmic system , laden with energy ; in which heavenly bodies rioted rotating about a centre like a sun ; through whose ethereal space comets drove with the speed of light years , kept in their eccentric orbits by the power of the central body
the sky-line was high , the distance seemed to mount to hans castorp ’ s view , looking down as he did from his elevation onto the spreading gulf beneath
not that he was narrow-minded
after tony had expressed many times her conviction that she should soon be back again on a visit , and that they too would not delay long to come to hamburg to see her , she climbed in good spirits into the coach and let herself be care-fully wrapped up by the consul in the warm fur rug
indefinite , exaggerated rumours of the unfavourable liq-uidation got about , and were fed by the news that gerda buddenbrook meant to sell the great house
there is no occasion for that , first of all because i can by no means pretend to have ex- cluded myself from the general emotion
a man came into my life ; by his heartfelt holding out he overcame death - you might really put it like that
the last bit of blue had disappeared ; the dark grey sky lowered heavy and swollen over them
this had gone on for more than an hour when the leader found it to the interest of all concerned to grant a brief intermission
at the same time , i say to myself : your acquaintance with madame is older than ours
he sat down , he obliged her to sit as well , and , bowing over her hand , which , limp with indecision , she resigned to him , he went on in a trembling voice : fraulein antonie , since first i saw you , that afternoon , -- do you re-member that afternoon , when i saw you , a vision of loveliness , in your own family circle ? -- since then , your name has been indelibly written on my heart
you must know that children are tender stuff , they are re- ceptive for poisonous influences - now it was i , in very truth , who cried out and indignantly repudiated his words
as the atmosphere in which we live is obviously very favourable to such miasmic growths , i may hope , or rather , i must fear , that you understand my meaning
it was a harmonium -- a pretty little thing of polished brown wood , with metal handles at the sides , gay bellows worked with a treadle , and a neat revolving stool
instead , i felt at once ashamed and anxious
he told hans castorp about two little henry clays he had once taken to his heart , in an evening company , which had come within an ace of putting him under the sod
then i said i would visit the patient
that would be a rejuvenation of the worn-out by the con- stellation
and hans castorp was reminded , as he saw her , of something else : the look on karen karstedt ’ s face , a smile just like that , when she stood with joachim and himself and regarded the unmade grave in the dorf graveyard
i should be surprised , i should be greatly surprised , if there were not wendish , slavic , sarmatic elements in play there
such a very gratifying sight that is not , and no deduction can be made from the word painful when i use it here to characterize the impressions i got as a purely passive ob- server from the gatherings of certain councils of intellectual workers then springing up in munich hotels
the englishwoman with the rose tea was miss robinson
and if this be so , then it is clear that time , while the medium of the narrative , can also become its subject
unfortunately , gone mad , uttered kai , count molln , with great clarity and precision
next , it appeared that gerda arnoldsen did not take piano like the rest of them , but the violin , and that papa -- her mother was dead -- had promised her a real stradivarius
but only for a moment
at the right , in front , was a time-regulating device , with a dial and figures like a watch ; at the left , the lever , which set the mechanism going or stopped it ; and behind , also on the left , the hollow , curving , club-shaped , nickel-plated arm , with its flexible joints , carrying the flat round sound-box at the end , with a fitment into which the needle was screwed
frau schweigestill , worn with lack of sleep , her eyes swollen with weeping , met me at the door and urged me to go at once to adrian
but every human being needs to express what he feels , said wehsal complainingly , to relieve himself , my dear castorp , when he is in the state i am in !
they must have taken a long time to dry—but were sometimes effective by way of helping out the other shortcomings
were they , he asked , up here for the winter sports , or were they patients ?
these were forms of tissue—and very luxuriant forms too—produced by foreign cell-bodies in an organism which had proved receptive to them , and in some way or other—one must probably say perversely—had offered them peculiarly favourable conditions
every one was silent
if you please , he said
in these last days his eyes had grown so shy , so uncertain in their glance
but he scorned the effort
what sort of men prefer the monotony of the sea ?
there would be a frock-coated official representing the management , perhaps even the physicians themselves ; then out came the gracious recipient of the attentions paid by this little world to a departing guest ; generally with a beaming face , and a bearing which the excitement of the moment rendered far more animated than usual
and so you go round visiting the fever cases ?
yet that lifelong inlpress never resulted in any conflict vith my humanistic attitude in general , my love of the liberal arts as one used to call them
but it is a good thing , notwithstanding
why should not you speak first ?
this important matter must be settled
next morning he heard for the asking the name of the mysterious new arrival ; heard likewise that the two travellers occupied neighbouring suites on the first floor
one might put—here he paused a second , and the crisping at the corner of his mouth grew crisper—more than one interpretation upon your laughter
herr settembrini advanced as far as the neighbourhood of one of the windows , hans castorp followed
there were milk , tea , coffee , chocolate , even bouillon ; and on every hand the guests , newly arisen from some two hours ’ repose after their heavy luncheon , were busily spreading huge slices of raisin cake with butter
these aging spinsters felt that all too little shadow set off the sunshine through which thomas 's outward life ran its brilliant course
she looks so very fit
the old inhabitants passed it by without thought ; and—though in general they seized on every pretext for jollification , and took occasion to celebrate their own private anniversaries in addition to these that accented the recurrent rhythm of the year ; making merry with popping of corks in the restaurant , over birthdays , general examinations , imminent departures whether wild or sanctioned , and the like—they accorded to the anniversary of arrival no other attention than that of a profound silence
with the turkey ramp roast potatoes and two kinds of compote , and each dish held enough to satisfy the appetite of a family all by ilself
the engagement proved a failure ; and her teacher , a man of experience named seiler , must be absolved from all responsibility for it
the room was further enlivened by several electric chandeliers in bright brass , consisting of three rings placed horizontally one over the other and held together by delicate woven work , the lowest ring set with globes of milky glass like little moons
? een , and such a time is also an eternity - then you shalbe fetched
his old father , in fact , still lived in silesia ; but the family seemed not to come into consideration , hugo being , evidently , a self-made man
as though israel 's whole and unique task had not consisted therein , that it should build god a dwelling , a tent , and provide all means for his constant presence
he was in contact by letter , it appeared , with persons who were at the head of the portuguese lodge , and there , without much doubt , things were ripening to a decisive event
the master had wrought late into the night , on the credo , the credo with the fugue , without a thought of the meal that stood waiting on the hearth ; while the maids , yielding to nature , had at last fallen asleep
if not , he might be assured she had it on the best authority
it is a telling fact that , as i mentioned earlier , the first performance of adrian leverklihn 's apocalyptic oratorio took place in gern- : any - or re precisely its first complete per- formance
they all drew a long breath and broke the circle
the colourless hands , whose sensitive shape i had always loved , lay crossed on his breast , like a saint 's on a medixval tomb
not with any idea of wounding or annoying his father !
that makes six hundred and eighty
vvas there , i asked myself , something in the wonlan 's outward appearance that might explain the fundamental condition of her relations with adrian , the in- visibility , the avoidance , the rule that they should never set eyes on each other ?
see here thy flow ’ ret treasured well—how exquisitely josé sang that !
'not aloud , but probably to himself -- he has not sair much about the other poem -- it is called 'the nursery clock ' -- he has only wept
and he broke a lance in defence of the blamelessness of sensual gratification—hearing which , hans castorp could not but think of the humanistic cuddy under the roof , with its standing desk , rush-bottomed chairs , and water-bottle
to-day it was a hurried , lively ah ha !
briskly he responded , sprang up and flung on some clothing , ran his fingers through his hair , and went down ; not slow , not fast , and more in uncertainty as to the how than the what , in the meaning of these summons
how pretty it was , though , with its curved mouthpiece , shining in the decoration of its keys and levers !
he , naphta , stated this , in order to counter the arrogance of materialistic science , which gave out for absolute knowledge its astronomical quackery , its windbaggery about the universe
when one thinks how women are made ( you smile , to hear a person of my youth and inexperience making general observations on this subject ) —how dependent a woman ’ s feeling for a man is upon his feeling for her—it is not surprising
he even remarked this tendency and took thought to comment upon it
he showed them to hans castorp in the lab : a red , coagulate blood , in which tiny grey points were discernible
those who stood about him , drawn first by the reports of the man ’ s wealth , soon hung absorbed upon his personality
what hovered before his mind 's eye were simply gauze petticoats , toe-pointing , trip- ping , and arms bent gracefully over heads , under the eyes of a court society asserting the ideal , reprobating the hateful prob- lematical , these sitting in their loges , while a well-trained bour- geoisie filled the parterre
you should not think that , he said , and smiled a peculiarly fine and painful smile
her left hand fingered the sofa pillows nervously , and her light eyes wandered restlessly to the window
he was a well-known art connoisseur
in school , when it was settled that someone was not to move up to the next form , he just stopped where he was ; nobody asked him any more questions , he did not have to do any more work
giddy and oppressed , he considered as in a dream how very odd he had felt since he came up here
hans castorp helped himself to his ; it was unusually large and thick , and had a gilt sphinx on it
but these volumes lay now neglected in favour of other textbooks belonging to quite a different field , an interest in which had seized upon the young man : anatomy , physiology , biology , works in german , french and english , sent up to the berghof by the book-dealer in the village , obviously because hans castorp had ordered them , as was indeed the case
joachim had begun , without more ado , to lay bare the upper half of his body
only one totally ignorant of the tender passion will suppose that such scruples can detract from the object of love
adrian , in his scrupulous delicacy , had asked him to rep- resent him and he felt he could not refuse
how yes and no ?
i find that in a chordal combination of notes one should never see anything but the result of the movement of voices and do honour to the part as implied in the single chord-note - but not honour the chord as such , rather despise it as subjective and arbitrary , so long as it can not prove itself to be the result of part-writing
in the duel with the outrageous little naphta he had borne himself like a man
one must just be satisfied with symbolism , my good man , when one is speaking of hell , for there everything ends- not only the word that describes , but everything altogether
young man , said he to hans castorp , holding him by the power of his pale eye and his developed gesture : young man—the simple—the holy
obviously he did not feel comfortable so long as any of his audience knew what they were to think
the morning is come unto thee , thou that dwellest in the land
he could see only a part of the interior , some four or five chairs
the sun shone , the day was beautiful and bright
introduces himself to me as a guide and proved it by his brass badge and his lw ' o or three scrapes of french and english , diabolical pronunciation ; peautiful puilding , antiquide extrement indcressant
this is what i wanted to bring out , this is the word of warning i have been trying to utter
and above all the macabre proposal , answered with giggles : alourons enscluble , voulez-volls ?
hans castorp too finished with his cure for the time and went into his room to put himself to rights a little
she is simply priceless , mother
when he had tapped to his satisfaction , he began to listen , setting his stethoscope on joachim ’ s chest and back , and putting his ear to the ear-piece
the half-parted lips moved a little too , as if forming words
and the cornered father could only admonish him to pray for a tranquil spirit—ut in aliquem gradum quietis in anima perveniat
well -- in fact -- why should i wait for them and let slip a good chance when it offers ?
how learned you ’ ve got , said hans castorp
he was a master in the irresistible , a virtuoso of the italian da capo school ; he must have come forward to the footlights and flung up his arm , as he held the last tone before the closing tonic , so that the audience involuntarily burst out in shouts of applause before he ceased
now they str : uck into the path at the edge of the village , which brought them back home
almost he inclined to call them what peeperkorn in his royal cups had called him , hans castorp—chatterboxes
so that the retirement of the frau senator had a practical justifi- cation and even became a genuine interest , for it enabled her to provide her daughters and also former friends of the house , like the knoterichs , with supplies from pfeiffering : eggs , butter , : flour , sausages , and so on
the frau consul , frau permanrder , christian , clothilde , herr and frau consul kroger , herr and frau director wrin-sl'henk , the broad street buddenbrooks , and therese weich-brodt were all bidden to dinner at four o'clruk , with the senator and his wife , in honour of hanno 's birthday ; and now they sat in the salon and looked at the child , perched on the music-stool in his sailor suit , and at the elegant , foreign appearance his mother made as she played a wonderful cantilena on the g string , and then , with profound vir-tuosity , developed a stream of purling , foaming cadences
it even came to this : that the thought of lawyer einhuf could not enter his mind without calling up there , by an association of ideas , the thought of fränzchen oberdank , the little creature with the sleek blond head , whose mamma , a worthy dame from the provinces , had brought her up to the berghof a few weeks before
every family has its own skeleton , he went on in a lower voice , with a glance at jock 's broad back
when the shattered wood steams ( a povverful passage ) ; the so new and enlightened concord of the high register of the organ with the strings at the end , when the deity comes , no longer in storm , but in hushed murmurings and beneath it arches the bow of peace ; yet despite all these i have never understood the work in its real spiritual sense , its inward necessity , its purpose , informed by fear , of seeking grace in praise
here his grandfather johann had set down the genealogy of the main branch of the buddenbrooks
of course , if i did not have my house in fishers ' lane -- but i have , and what should i do with it ?
that was rather tall talk , retorted naphta ; and mentioned mount everest , which to date had icily refused to surrender to man ’ s importunity , and seemed likely to continue to do so
the four and a half months which i gave as the period of production are reckoned up to the beginning of the relapse
but it remained an open question whether the old school , as an institution , with its smaller endowment of modern comfort and its larger share of gay good nature , courage , charm , and good feeling , had not been more blest and blessing than the new
enough of your theological spinsterhood !
dh , if i could only make a match worthy of our name , and set myself up again -- do you think it is entirely out of the question ?
that was hard to bear ; yet , since it undoubtedly happened on his account , it preserved the relation between them , if only on its negative side
it was holger in person , the spirit holger , who understood such matters as the pinch of salt and that , but knew better than to mix into lessons at school
what it demolishes is the pretence in the bourgeois work of art ; music , although she makes no picture , is also subject to it
i did not know then that what was involved was a tendency , an idea , in a way a sort of rehearsal for something to come later ; a pattern , i mean , of sending to the beloved - for that is what i must call her - and leaving it to someone else to speak to her
may they live long and prosper !
he might count , however , on a general understanding of it , and as for the inevitable malice that went with it , he took that for granted
per bacco , this was a joy to listen to !
at your service , repeated heir schwarzkopf , taken aback
well , geida , i am off for london
give it to me , please , he said shortly
gone for good , o ’ er the border and awa ’
no trace of confusion showed in his blue eyes , which could burrow with such penetrating naivete into the eyes of anyone 'who vvas making clever , learned , or cultured remarks
joachim could hear , hours on end , the noise made by the paperknife going through the uncut leaves
i should be boasting if i say yes , lying if i say no
what do you mean ?
i have been at small evening companies at the van henkdoms and the mo el ens , and on the third day after my arrival i had to put on my dress clothes to go to a dinner at the house of my former chief , van der kellen , which he had arranged out of season in my honour
the little engine puffed and pulled off , the train glided after
you may as well resign yourself , hanno , be-cause if it is his inscrutable will --
she is ill , and she is limited ; her case is hopeless , and the matter is simple
it was life-bound , and thus entirely utilitarian ; it was pathetically unheroic
we have reproached hans castorp with being willful ; but certainly , whatever the goal toward which his wishes led , it was not that of social intercourse with madame chauchat
so you are interested in organic chemistry too ?
his slightly faded nationality is scarcely sufficient ground for introducing him at this late day into our story
the orchestra stood open-mouthed
there was one more person in the room than before
armed with the recommendation of a brother of the cloth who had eaten at least once in meng street of mock-turtle soup and ham with onion sauce , he waited upon the frau consul and was invited to be her guest for a few days
an ethiopian prince had been received at the same time with naphta ; he had woolly hair , and was distinctly moorish in appearance , though most distinguished
and at that there swept over him anew , from head to foot , the feeling of reckless sweetness he had felt for the first time when he tried to imagine himself free of the burden of a good name , and tasted the boundless joys of shame
have you a double ?
yes , says behrens , and shrugs his shoulders , it seems to be indicated that she certainly can not stand the climate up here
joachim had not much to bring up against the plan
but hagenstrom , he 's got the money
it smells like that , too
it is very radical , but it relaxes the prohibition which after all already hung over consonance
do it not only for yourself , but at the same time for me and my guilty soul
they only begged him for the mercy of a gentle death
i am interested in the development of our railways -- it is a tradition with us from on
the height of the piled-up snow was estimated at two feet ; its consistency was said to be ideal for skiing
you ’ ll learn all about it , he said , and added : one ’ s ideas get changed
he never wore an overcoat
yet all these figures were , in a way , public institutions , uncommonly characteristic of the psychological picture of my native town , adrian 's setting till he went to the university , for nine years of his young life
yes , it had to come , and it came
our good jungmann has your room ready
never mind the propositions
you are quite frozen , poor boy , she said
the frau consul heard the news , and there was a long and particular conversation among her , herr permaneder , antonie , and thomas , in the landscape-room that very evening , and every-thing was arranged
when he was fifteen , he had had a front seat at the christening ceremony of the new double-screw steamer hansa
this thing was sent to me !
i will make one exception to this uniform ironic contempt which he presented to what the school offered him and the claims it made upon him
but not without talent , not at all without talent for a heightened degree of oxidization
the young folk looked at the view , standing in the snow before the stone gateway to the cemetery ; then they entered through the ironwork grille , which was on the latch
it was a matter of abstractions , an intellectual disagreement
for the moment , while she peered into his throat , nothing ; but even after she was done , he was at a loss
why , if he and a few other people had not kept at the senate continually , we should most likely still be behind the danish and the thurn-and-taxis postal service !
that was the song of a dweller in a great city
sometimes he sealed himself on the little terrace , in the pavilion now entirely overgrown with green , and stared across the garden at the red brick rear wall of the house
and he looked at the guests as well ; the groups began to break up for him , and individuals to stand out
it , vas simply as though we had parted the day before
they returned almost in silence
i shouldn ’ t have thought i could remember him so clearly
her breasts , which were not high and voluptuous like marusja ’ s , but small and maidenly , were pressed together from both sides
no doubt he , vas very welcome there , and just as certainly the arrangements to release him went forward slowly in munich , where there was reluctance to let him go
dh , so you like being there ?
they went out on the high-road to the next village , or along the beach to the ocean temple on its height , whence a wide view was to be had over land and sea ; or to the woods be-hind the kurhouse , where was a great bell used to call the guests to the table-d'hote
i enjoy drinking the beer -- i drink a good deal , the more so as the water is not very good
i hate , love , and fear it ; for - may i be pardoned for this all too personal excuse ?
well , when you say amateur ( hans castorp could not recall saying anything of the sort ) , the word is perhaps not ill chosen ; it has a slight suggestion of superficiality—yes , very well , i am an amateur of music—which is not to say that i set great store by it ; not as i love and reverence the word , the bearer of the spirit , the tool and gleaming ploughshare of progress—music ?
drink seven swallows of water , and then lie down and count a thousand
flowers half faded , wilted but not dry , lay scattered on the floor of the loggia and on the balustrade ; others , between sheets of blottingpaper , were giving out their moisture under pressure from heavy stones
of course he will have it anyhow , but never mind , i will make the most of it while i can—he enlarged upon his objection : but you are a humanist , are you not ?
the audience , however , took no offence , all being in much the same irresponsible condition
never before had hans castorp been so impressed with its oddity as when he saw it to-day under this absurd head-gear : the flat , snub-nosed , purple-flushed physiognomy , the watery , goggling blue eyes beneath tow-coloured brows , and the blond , close-trimmed moustache mounted crookedly above the full , bow-shaped lips
fine lads , eh , frau consul ?
he inquired after tony 's acre and cow , asked how much she wanted for a sack of wheat , and tried to drive a bargain with her
he had stammered something unintelligi- ble , and then burst out complaining and scolding at the fine kind of housekeeping he had , and how everybody had run away and left him to starve
some days later , however—that is , between the beginning and middle of the month— there came another change : a latter summer set in , with amazing splendour
she repeated his word , not without difficulty
frau stöhr tells me the concierge sells tin horns in his lodge , did you know that ?
the two physicians , the directress , madame chauchat , and the malay were within , the last-named dressed not as usual , but in a sort of national costume , with a striped garment like a shirt , very long wide sleeves , a gaily coloured skirt , and a curious , cone-shaped hat made of yellow cloth on his head
the guilty satisfaction of seeing the open book in front of him gave him a pricking sensation in his skin ; but at the same time he had such a feeling , of disgust that he intentionally deceived as badly as possible , simply to make the deceit seem less vulgar to himself
he was fitted out with the pneumothorax and wore smoking at the midday meal but not in the evening , saying this was their custom in the navy
need i tell you how ?
young behrens sometimes visited his father in the holidays ; he had done so once during joachim ’ s time up here
people un-earthed wise old saws on the subject of human nature and applied them to senator buddenbrook 's wife
he had just come from the operating-room , so he said , and was on his way to private practice in the village
the kr�s lived in the grand style ; there was a difference be-tween their brilliant establishment and the solid , somewhat heavy comfort of the paternal home , which was obvious at a glance , and which impressed very much the young dem-oiselle buddenbrook
nor do we except the person and situation of the husband—if we may regard in that light our young friend , who had indeed formed such a wish—sitting there , with the knees of the little mother between his own , holding in his her hands , which were as wet as once little leila ’ s , so that he had constantly to be renewing his hold , not to let them slip
or rather , the thing is , i do not dare really will it
but now , she went on , in a louder key , slowly nodding her head from one side to the other , now that you are here , i am glad you are
it must be the most melancholy thing in life
a deaf man , he cried , quite ignorant of sound , could not but de- light in these gracious visions
he took a morbid and extravagant pleasure in thus trifling with fräulein engelhart , and she on her side reciprocated ; first out of a natural instinct to be the go-between in a love-affair , secondly because to oblige hans castorp she had actually contrived to fall victim to frau chauchat ’ s charms ; and finally because she felt a pathetic joy in having him tease her and make her blush
the consul could not see her face -- but it had the expres-sion it often wore those summer evenings at travemiinde , as dhe leaned at the window of her little room
their bearing , less angular than usual , expressed a mild satisfaction with the impartial justice of death
then he asked the pianist , a weary-eyed youth who had certainly dreamed of something higher than his present occupation , if he could accompany dvo- rak 's hurnoresqlle , and on the mediocre fiddle played the popular piece , with its many grace notes , charming glides , and pretty double stopping ; so pertly and brilliantly that he won loud ap- plause from everybody in the place , ourselves and the neighbour- ing tables : , the amazed musicians , and the two waiters as , veil
a young man with thin moustaches sat next beyond
they have been brought forward , these comrades , for a final thrust in a fight that has already lasted all day long , whose objective is the retaking of the hill position and the burning villages beyond , lost two days since to the enemy
for marusja was almost always there in the evening—laughter-loving marusja , with the little ruby on her charming hand , the handkerchief with the orange scent , and the swelling bosom , tainted within—hans castorp comprehended that it was her presence which drove joachim away , precisely because it so strongly , so fearfully drew him toward her
he bowed low , laying his hand upon his breast
repeated herr settembrini , and looked at him
kai asked with deep interest
if he is that , then i would gladly make his acquaintance—did i not tell you your cousin would die if he went down to be a soldier ?
the masters have not known him since he was a baby , the way i have -- they do not know how to take him , when they are teaching him
oh , heavens , you poor thing !
but today i seem to hear them when i hear you
pastor kolling of st mary 's per-formed the service , and laid special stress upon moderation
he was now thirty-three years old , but he looked much older
a lovely boy , with full hair drawn sideways across his brow and falling on his temples , sat directly beneath him , apart from his companions , with arms folded on his breast—not sadly , not ill-naturedly , quite tranquilly on one side
they were not the worst
now look how you can improve on it !
hans castorp sat awhile without answering , looking in front of him
silent and stiffly erect , with his eyes half-closed , lebrecht kroger sat with the rug over his knees , the consul at his right hand , while the carriage rolled through the streets
there is the administration of jus- tice and the preservation of order
she folded her arms and looked around her like one sure of ap-plause
the more i think of it , the surer i am that the bed of repose—by which i mean my deck-chair , of course—has given me more food for thought in these ten months than the mill down in the flat-land in all the years before
he said no more , clutched a roll , and began , standing , with his hat on and his bag under his arm , to swallow his cocoa
it will soon be filled up again , i am not worried about that— but anton is off , on the wings of the wind , in the twinkling of an eye , rapt away before he knew where he was
whereat tony , red with anger , gave him a push and darted an embarrassed glance at young schwarzkopf
industry and beauty chaste
i-ie repeated the passage and declared that some day he would cer- tainly compose it , also the incomparable talk in the fifth act about the folly of the wise , the helpless , blinded , humiliating misuse of wit to adorn the fool 's cap of passion
he rested his elbow on the sofa-cushion , and his chin in his hand , and looked at the things for a while from a distance
his case was long-standing , he had wandered for years from one establishment to another
aussi longtemps pour toi
he did not sit down
they accused herr albin of perpetrating this rather contemptible jest , but he denied it on his honour ; and even without his word they all felt fairly certain no one of their circle was guilty
it is like a word , a key word , stamped on every- thing in the song , which it would like to determine entirely
child , you will believe me when i tell you that i feel everything you can say , as much as you do yourself
but it is well worth seeing
fame and virtue were shadows to him , nature an evil power—and so she is , stupid and evil both , i agree with him there—he even despaired , horrible to say , he even despaired of science and progress !
even more nefarious , in their eyes , was the exploitation of time ; the montrousness of receiving a premium for the passage of time—interest , in other words—and misusing to one ’ s own advantage and another ’ s disadvantage a universal and god-given dispensation
when we students greeted him on the street he would take it off with a very sweep- ing bow and say : your llumble servant !

the crashing applause , loud enough any- how , rose still higher as ferdinand edschmidt motioned to the orchestra to stand up , and put out , his hand gratefully to his kon- zertmeister
he was wrong , they said , at least for the most part

in beethoven there are already movements of a rhyth- mic freedom foreshadowing things to come - a freedom which in leverktihn is complete but for his bar-lines , which , as an ironi- cally conservative conventional feature , he still retained
her mouth wore a pinched smile , her nose was rather beaked ; the expression of her blue eyes , blurred by the drooping lids , was weakly , dull , suspicious ; it was a loolc of knowledge and suffering , if not without some effort at roguish- ness

hanno , still looking down , made an obvious effort to give a prompt , alert , and correct answer to the question
how the child can play !
well , you should be pleased : you have some good things in the adagio

he said the hrart and lungs were operating soundly , but the occasional difficulty in breathing was due to muscular sluggishness , and ordered first the use of a fan and secondly that of a green powder which one burned , inhaling the smoke

a tall young girl in a green sweater , with untidy hair and foolish , half-open eyes , brushed past hans castorp , nearly touching him with her arm

herr gosch spoke the last word with his teeth particularly close to-gether , and went on : oh , the thing has its fine side , that 's certain
in the first place he had gone back to william blake and set to music a very strange poem of this favourite au- thor of his
of course preference is not the right word ; i only mean that at least in this work , the apocalypse , he makes exceptionally frequent use of it , and certainly these images of terror offer a most tempting and at the same time most legitimate occasion for the employ- ment of that savage device
to try to make a clean-cut distinction between the passionate and the soulful—that would , no doubt , be analytical
hanks , deutschlin , laughed adrian
the fell intent of this sentence , so full of pitfalls , was that you should write ei where you ought to write ie , and contrariwise
he was hampered by his illnesses , and often absent-minded , for his thoughts would linger among his harmonic combinations , or upon the still unravelled marvel of some piece 'which he had heard his mother and herr pfiihl playing ; and all this did not help him on in the sciences
'the waggoner gks up at thrrc from his bed of straw ' -- why , of course he- docs !

it is much easier for us to follow the feelings of a man for a woman - even though he be entirely indifferent to her himself - than to put himself in the place of a woman in love with another man

then i wrote to him : amon tres cher fits : you are marrying our shop -- very well , that 's an end of it
but he had also felt great curiosity at these fateful gifts of ellen brand ; combined , it is true , with the knowledge that their field was with difficulty accessible to the spirit , and the doubt as to whether it was not barren , or even sinful , so far as he was concerned—all which did not prevent his feeling from being what in fact it actually was , curiosity

it was touching to see hans castorp labour to master his drowsiness and be polite
leo , or leib , as he had been called in his childhood , had been allowed to watch in the court-yard while the father carried out his task , aided by his helper , a powerful youth of the athletic jewish type , beside whom the slender elie with his round blond beard seemed still more fragile and delicate

the senator shook his head as he stood , playing with his pince-nez on the table-cloth
mynheer peeperkorn arrived at the dorf station by the same evening train as frau chauchat
the cousins learnt of the death from fritz rotbein ’ s nurse , alfreda schildknecht , called sister berta , who met them in the corridor and discreetly communicated the sad event
they exchanged glances and head-shakes and rather intimidated smiles as they stood regarding this spectacle , this long catastrophe of foam and fury , whose preposterous roaring deafened them , frightened them , bewildered their senses of sight and hearing , so that they even imagined they heard above , below , and on all sides , cries of warning , trumpet-calls , hoarse human voices
so she had stayed at home

frau consul buddenbrook had invited her brother to meng street , in order that he might talk over the provisions made by the deceased with thomas and with heir marcus the confidential clerk

she accepted with no false pride the fruits of his charity or his unquenched love , whichever it was , seeing herself quite humbly as a dishonoured and sinful creature ; and so bore all the plagues of job with astounding patience and resilience , with the elementary powers of resistance of her sex , which triumphed over all the misery of her tawny body , and even made of the gauze dressings which she had to wear about her head a becoming personal adornment

he was like the scholar in the peculiarly happy state of never being asked any more ; of never having a task , of being left to sit , since the fact of his being left behind is established , and no one troubles about him further—an orgiastic kind of freedom , but we ask ourselves whether , indeed , freedom ever is or can be of any other kind

certainly a greek venus or athlete is more humanistic , it is probably at bottom the most humanistic of all the arts , when one comes to think about it !
the primary symbol of alchemic transmutation , naphta said , was par excellence the sepulchre
lead back my mind to what you said previously about vice : that it consists in an affront to the simple , what you call the holy , or , as i might say , the classic , gifts which life offers us ; the larger gifts , by contrast with the later and cultivated ’ ones , the refinements , which you indulge in , as one of us put it , whereas one consecrates oneself ’ to the great gifts and pays them homage
one can only add that had there been no pieter peeperkorn , party feeling would have run higher on both sides ; as when leo naphta defended the arch-revolutionary nature of the church , against settembrini ’ s dogmatic assertion that that great historic power was to be looked upon merely as the protectress of the sinister forces of reaction ; whereas all the forces that made for life and future , and looked undismayed on change and resolution , he claimed for the principles of enlightenment ; science and progress , which had their rise in an epoch of quite opposed tendencies , the famous century that witnessed the rebirth of classical culture
he had used the second person singular
in any case , it was at the schlaginhaufens ' , and through this very breisacher , that i first came in touch with the new world of anti-humanity , of which my easy-going soul till then had known nothing at all
he felt beforehand , quite clearly , that such experiencess whatever the course of them , could never be anything but in bad taste , unintelligible and humanly valueless
the pain grew and grew , to limitless , incredible heights ; it grew to an insane , shrieking , inhuman torture , tearing his entire brain
in the moment when that hope can no longer be decently sustained , in that moment i shall turn my back on this establishment , and take private lodgings somewhere in the valley
herr settembrini , of course , could not refrain from protesting against this hideous conception of policy ; against the gesture of a shrewd and sinister complaisance , made by the spirit—or what called itself so—against the imaginary guilt of its opposite , which it pretended to deal with in a politic sense , but which in reality stood in no need of the pernicious indulgence it proffered ; against the accursed dualism of a conception which bedevilled the universe—that is to say , life—as well as life ’ s dark opposite , the spirit—for if life was evil , the spirit , as pure negation , must be so too
hans castorp well remembered the mottled pallor of joachim ’ s skin when , for the first and only time , he had innocently alluded to marusja ’ s physical charms in the light tone he might have assumed at home
in hans castorp ’ s case its nature was evident in the extent to which he not only ceased to exercise his judgment , but even began to experiment for his own part and upon his own mortal vesture
the hofrat came , summoned by sister berta
a fresh rumour from the town hall , running zig-zag through the crowd , has reached her ears
that is to say—i suppose i am expressing myself very ridiculously , but—you can see how the things of the mind and the love of beauty come together , and that they always really have been one and the same—in other words , science and art ; and that the calling of being an artist surely belongs with the others , as a sort of fifth faculty , because it too is a humanistic calling , a variety of humanistic interest , in so far as its most important theme or concern is with man—you will agree with me on that point
in short , he has made a mistake in his calculations about me and the character of my firm
such at the moment is the background of my biographical ac- tivity
then he went into the balcony with the glass cigar in his mouth , like an old hand
once more she saw his anguished face , his im-ploring eyes directed upon her ; again she saw , and was moved to see , that this pleading , this anguish , were real and un-feigned
dh , no , morten said , hastily
such scenes in the family are frightful , but we must speak out once for all
it ’ s annoying— who is that dark woman down in the garden ?
into it adrian spun himself round like a cocoon , to stimu- late himself for a work which should gather up all their elements into one single focus , assemble them in one pregnant , portentous synthesis and in relentless transmission hold up to humanity the
still , his drunkenness was not debasing , there was no loss of dignity ; rather it combined with the nobility of his nature to produce an immense and awe-inspiring effect
he weeps so easy , poor little lad , and it is so hard for him to stop
but it is painful for me to have gotthold think that his step-mother looks out after her own children and delib-erately makes bad blood between him and his father !
they were , to a man , well-meaning and sweet-humoured ; and they were one in the belief that knowledge and good cheer are not mutually exclusive
in other words , between death and us there is no rapport ; it is something with which we have nothing to do—and only incidentally the world and nature
we will see who dies first
come along , it is time we both went to bed
the slender , elderly legs were cased in black silk stockings ; the shoes had silver buckles
everything depended upon who was drunk—a drunken personality was far from being the same as a drunken tinker
he had no more time to concern himself with his cousin ’ s fate or further sojourn
i myself have seen some beautiful cases of acclimatization
they rubbed their eyes , stared vacantly before them , blinking in the brilliant light and wishing themselves back in the darkness , looking at sights which had had their day and then , as it were , had been transplanted into fresh time , and bedizened up with music
she sat up quickly and put her feet to the floor
will you take a glass of red wine with me ?
and the ladies , even though aware of the mechanicocosmetical origin of this conquering-hero air , were foolish enough to be carried away by it
one day the english reached bremen , the americans were at the gates of upper franconia ; nuremberg , city of the national celebra- tions so uplifting to unenlightened hearts , nuremberg surren- dered
people have on good black clothes , and they take off their hats and look at the coffin , and behave serious and reverent , and nobody dares to make a bad joke , the way they do in ordinary life

even a k ferge , to whom all elevated thoughts were foreign , who disclaimed from its inception any power to measure the seriousness of the dispute—even he was convinced that this was a quarrel à outrance , and that there was nothing to do but let it take its course
a while ago i was feeling rather queer -- not exactly ill and yet not quite well
but what troubles me is that your experiment should lead you in just this direction
and now irnagine ( here is the clear picture i promised to give ) how these gentlemen , scientists themselves , scholars and teachers - vogler , unruhe , holzschuher , lnstitoris , and brei- sacher as well- revelled in a situation which for me had about it so much that was terrifying , and which they regarded as either already in full swing or inevitably on the way
but was that all ?
they returned to their own storey , hans castorp greatly pleased and edified by the visit
it was just a little arrangement among them-selves -- not very honourable , indeed , but then , not very un-common either
then the wind he faced took his breath on the spot , so that he was forced to go through the awkward process of turning round again to get it back , and collect his resolution to advance in the teeth of his ruthless foe
only that the dialectic process - by which , at the stage of development that this work occupies , is consummated by the change from the strictest constraint to the free language of feeling , the birth of freedom from bondage - the dialectic process appears as end- lessly more complicated in its logic , endlessly more miraculous and amazing than at the time of the madrigalists
but at length the master sighed and said : oh , buddenbrook !
well , hanno , so you want a little taste of music , do you ?
come round—not coming round—that ’ s the regular expression they use , of people drowned or frozen to death—i suppose i used it because i arn not quite so clear in the head as i might be
it was a decent conviction , if you were to ask me
at that moment he did not know how old he was , despite strenuous , even desperate efforts to bethink himself
oh , it was absurd to get up now !
hans castorp ’ s thoughts , or rather his prophetic half-thoughts soared high , as he sat there in night and silence before his truncated sarcophagus of music
to all this herr kesselmeyer simply shook his hand in the air , as if to say : this wo not get us anywhere , my dear friend
the property of the establishment was extensive , comprising in its buildings space for four hundred pupils , with wood and meadow land , half a dozen playing-fields , farm buildings , and stalls for hundreds of cows
take the soldiers of the spanish counter-reformation , for instance , or of the various revolutionary armies , the napoleonic or garibaldian—or take the prussian
uncle justus brought his feeble wife , with whom he lived an un- happy existence
and from this circumstance arose all the proceedings , acts , and formalities , which were the theme of a widely circulated composition
the buddenbrooks must have dragged the old man in by the hair !
he : off you go again !
as for the cigarettes , adrian never gave up smoking except when forced to on the days when the migraine , with its violent attacks like seasickness fell on him , and he kept his bed in a darkened room , as happened two or three times in the month
so passed october and november
but of course youth is capable of anything
the worst case at their table was dr blumenkohl , leo blumenkohl , from odessa , the young man with the moustaches and the absorbed and care-worn air
there ’ s no law against it—anybody can paint that likes
st augustine , at least , had gone so far as to say that the function of tie bad , vas to make the good stand out more strongly ; that it pleased the more and , vas the more lovely , the more it was compared with the bad
furthermore , since newspaper might easily come to have four times the value of wrapping-paper and pasteboard , it would become an economic factor of considerable importance , and the basis of fruitful governmental and communal assessments , and thus lighten for newspaper readers the burden of taxation
he put up a sign which read : here lives count molln
his head was bowed and his legs far apart , his manner vastly respectful
but these inhabitants , these streets and granaries , which were normally a matter of complete indifference to him , became positively hateful when they were made the subject of an examination
the greek sculptors did not trouble themselves about the head and face , their interest was more with the body , i suppose that was their humanism—and the plasticity of the female form—so that is fat , is it ?
then it was over , and the whole holiday lay in the past—or , equally , it lay in the distant future , a year away : twelve months would bring it round again , seven more than the time hans castorp had spent up here
much roasting and baking went on in the kitchen
now and then some-body sighed and said that the wife would be waiting with the coffee -- and then herr benthien would venture to mention the trap-do or

impudently , deceptively , they imitated the vegetable kingdom : most prettily of all , fern fronds , grasses , the calyxes and corollas of flowers

he coughed , for the sound of his own voice in the emptiness made him feel unpleasant
we must lead the human race up out of the primitive stages of fear and patient stupidity , and set its feet on the path of conscious activity
chairs and ice-pails were upset

i will paint it a little , he said ; and began at once to apply a strong-smelling liquid in generous quantities
winter was here again ; and the buddenbrooks began to consider sadly what sort of christmas feast they should have this year
she sincerely regretted being obliged to take the view that dr leverktihn 's messenger and representative was also necessarily affected by this change in the situation
they crossed the flags at the back , leaving the kitchen on the right , went through a glass door and up two steps into the lovely , scented flower-garden
then he turned and , passing through the room , went straight up to clavdia chauchat , who , as he was well aware , was standing near the door of the little salon , watching with a smile the throng round the punchtable
she had considerable left from her earlier equipment , but new purchases were necessary to complete it
kai worked at his new literary project during this period , and hanno occupied himself wuh conducting , in fancy , an overture with full orchestra
they met the guests of the cure , strolling about , young people for the most part : gallants in sporting , without their hats ; white-skirted ladies , also hatless
he will insist on absolute cleanliness , and by means of frequent shifting and changes of linen will keep the patient free from bed-sores -- if possible ; in some cases it is not possible
but any ass might have cocci , and tubercular bacilli too
the explicit order to destroy this letter i did not obey - and who on that ground will condemn a friendship which can claim for itself the description deeply intent used therein of delacroix 's friendship for chopin ?
the food is already swallowed , but the muscles -- right here -- they simply refuse
they all bowed and exchanged greetings , and naphta took his place beside ferge in the first landau , which now contained four persons , while herr settembrini added himself to the other two in the second carriage
how are you forcing him , when it is he who conies to you ?
from where they sat at the table they could look between the grey gables of intervening houses at the stars and the slowly moving clouds
i was not meant for change and excitement
a pair of birds chattered , and the faint rustling of the leaves mingled with the sound of the sea spread out below them

hippe already wore long trousers , and a blue jacket belted in at the back and closed to the throat , the collar of which was usually whitened by a few scales of dandruff
he held it to his lips , a reed pipe or little clarinet , and coaxed from it soothing head-tones , one after the other , just as they came , and yet in a pleasing sequence
the truth is simply that i fix my eye in advance with fear and dread , yes , with hor- ror on certain things which i shall sooner or later have to tell ; they stand before me and weigh me down , and i try to distribute their weight by referring to them beforehand , of course not com- prehensibly to anybody but myself
upon my word , the old man said , i still feel angry with myself that i have never put it into some kind of order
since then history has taught me to regard vvith otier eyes our conquerors of that day , who will shortly conquer us again in alli- ance with the revolution of the east

he lay in the centre of the large , light room , the furniture of which had been removed , amid the white silk linings of his coffin , dressed in white silk , shrouded in white silk , in a thick and stupefying mingling of odours from the tube-roses , violets , roses , and other flowers with which he was surrounded
the elders of the family fell in behind , and the younger brought up the rear ; the servants and poor joined in from the hall ; and so they marched , singing with one accord dh , evergreen -- uncle christian sang oh , everblue , and made the children laugh by lifting up his legs like a jumping- ] ack -- through the wide-open , lofty folding doors , and straight into paradise

in particular he recalled the agreeable sensation of being totally lost and abandoned , with which , in the fourth quarter , he gave up the running—he could have laughed at the whole thing

he came to the verses that were to have been prepared for to-day , and called up petersen

the boundary line between usance and actual dishonesty is extremely hard to draw

it became unbelievably warm
but with the real chord , consisting of several notes , it is after all something different
long ago it had been herr settembrini who brought sudden illumination into the room , sat down beside the horizontal hans and sought to influence and instruct him upon matters of life and death
and he extinguished the last candle
the little glass was so full that the bread overflowed and bedewed the plate
he had composed a melody which was just the same read forward or backward , and based upon it a fugue which was to be played crab-fashion
only a light case , at most

but did you see , joachim went on , and the joy of having fought and won his battle mounted in him and almost took away his breath , did you see how he gave in and showed no more fight , directly he saw i was in earnest ?
the courage to recognize and express—that is the quality that makes literature—that is humanism
it becomes static , mo- notonous - twice d , three times d , one after the other - the chords do it - dim-dada !
one single memory of the sound they made as they plashed against the breakwater could make him oppose an invincible front to all the pains and penalties of-his life
he quit his situation in london and started off
by little and little his morality and his curiosity approached and overlapped , or had probably always done so ; the pure curiosity of inquiring youth on its travels , which had already brought him pretty close to the forbidden field , what time he tasted the mystery of personality , and for which he had even claimed the justification that it too was almost military in character , in that it did not weakly avoid the forbidden , when it presented itself
it is a regular dilemma for the human feelings—i find it more deplorable than i can say

they let him stare , and paid no heed
any departed person they chose ?
he was talking and laughing , anxious to try his skill ; asked on all sides for a pencil , and at length received a stump of a thing , hardly to be held between thumb and forefinger
they had talked at length and repeatedly with him , on the subject of his resolve ; also about how he could carry on the service of the cure even after he left the berghof ; about his taking with him and continuing the great encyclopædic task he had set himself , that survey of the masterpieces of belles-lettres , from the point of view of human suffering and its elimination ; finally , about herr settembrini ’ s future lodging , in the house of a petty chandler , as the italian called him
the old treadle- box stands here pretty forlorn ; but for all its simpleness it has the meat of the matter in it
she bent over as she mounted the stairs , and held up her frock with one beringed hand , while with the other she pressed her tiny handkerchief to her lips and , all stooped as she was , stared up over it into nothing , with great blue , distracted eyes
hanno would laugh too , softly but with heart-felt glee ; for those two up there were both of the opinion -- which neither of them expressed -- that the sermon was silly twaddle , and that the real service consisted in that which the pastor and his congregation regarded merely as a devotional accessory : namely , the music
but it always seelned as though one were looking at a fairy princeling

the first letter she wrote , fron brussels , was accompanied by a gift sent to hinl in homage : a ring the like
she read the newspaper articles aloud many times in her throaty voice : those same newspapers which at the time of the jubilee had paid tribute to her brother 's merits , now mourned the irreparable loss of his personality

hans castorp reflected that if one party did not fire , the other would surely not be able to bring himself to do it either ; and his heart perceptibly lightened
fr�ein meyer-de-la-grange lifted her pretty brows and asked : 'the son of consul buddenbrook ?
hans castorp thought him well over , with his gift of the gab , his florid harangue on the combination of dullness and disease , and how he , hans castorp , had been taken to task for calling it a dilemma for the human intelligence

they have turned to the right -- they are going down broad street !
he asked , half- dazed : what did you think ?
it did not prevent him from believing stoutly in revelation , nor indeed from being on a very familiar footing '\-vith the devil , if also , of course , the reverse of a cordial one
he spoke of the mere appearance of musical notation , and assured us that a l { nowledge- able person could get from one look at the notation a decisive im- pression of the spirit and value of a composition
and , by a natural association , hans castorp decided that in the interest of these mental activities of his , and his responsible position as a civilian member of society , he must really—and joachim must too—pay that little man the honour of a visit
i see his mother kiss him and , perhaps in the same way as she had done that time with kretschmar in the living-room , lean his head on her shoulder
and yet hans castorp did progress
ah , no ; you have already played your best card
what do you mean ?
i am not in love with him , and i would not marry a teacher , anyhow
once he had played the role of domingo in an amateur performance of schiller 's don carlos -- this was the culmination of his career
even in the matter of the operation he took a business view , for , so long as he lived , that would be his angle of approach
all those who saw the encounter trembled hours after

they broke off at last
where greatness and death come together , he declared , there arises an ob jectivity tending to the conventional , which in its majesty leaves the most domineering subjectivity far behind , because therein the merely personal- which had after all been the surmounting of a tradition already brought to its peak - once more outgrew itself , in that it entered into the mythical , the collectively great and supernatural
yes , indeed , herr consul , if your wife is satisfied
it comes from the bay-window in the right-hand corner , between the verandah door and the bad russian table , at a goodish distance from frau chauchat ’ s place , and almost equally far from hans castorp ’ s
the present slope was too steep to ascend directly , so he slanted a little , and went on thus awhile without much heed whither

the bulwark of luxury , her protection against life , threatened to fail the fright- ened woman ; it was already doubtful vvhether they could keep the expensive home on the english garden
not to ny entire satisfaction , i may add
even before leo ’ s baptism he had , at the father ’ s instigation , found temporary lodgment in the stella matutina , where he was given food for both body and mind ; and had migrated hither with the greatest equanimity , and the callousness of the born aristocrat , leaving his brothers and sisters to the care of the poor guardians and a destiny suited to their lesser gifts

the beer , the noodles , the artist who wanted to paint her , and the court coaches had made the greatest impressions
if during our year of separation he had not become \ different person , at least he was now more definitely that whictjl he was , and this was enough to ilnpress me , especially since i had probably a little forgotten what he had been

only the fingers showed beneath the too long , too wide sleeves of his nightgown : one of his hands lay on his breast , the other on the coverlet , with the bent fingers jerking slightly now and then

and the hofrat skipped away , wiping his eyes behind his glasses with a table-napkin—but whether it was tears or sweat he wiped could not be told
but the misery in the side had , if anything , grown worse , and added to tlms was a whole list of other infirmities of which christian kept the closest watch , and which he described in all com-panies , with his nose wrinkled up

are you willing to absolve yourself of it ?
but after the old masters had had their due , gerda no longer needed to urge him to respond to a more complex demand upon his virtuosity ; with an expression of shame-faced pleasure , he would glide into the weaving harmonies of the leit-motiv
the creator of fausti w ebe-klage can , in the previously organized material , unhampered , untroubled by the already given structure , yield himself to subjectivity ; and so this , his technically most rigid work , a work of extreme calculation , is at the same time purely expressive
he beckoned to a dining-room girl—it was the dwarf—and though busily engaged , she at once obeyed his weighty summons , and stood , milk jug and coffee-pot in hand , by his chair
but , after all , tony felt that his peace and quiet had not suffered any long in-terruption
he could say , without stretching the truth , that such a connexion now existed , or was easily induced : he was aware that he felt an emotion to correspond with the action of his heart
hanno buddenbrook closed his bible and stretched himself , yawning
but why is it just this one that profits by the cunning ?
this time it was a duel
but , as never before , he began to cling to money and , in his private life , to save in small and petty ways
and literally no soul had taken notice of it save settembrini , who strolled over at the end of the meal to exchange a lively greeting

i must add that he troubled himself as little about the circumstances of his second bad shot as about the extraordinary atmosphere of his first one
there was no doubt that in the future , after we had begun to practise a large-scale elimina- tion of the unfit , the diseased and weak-minded , we would justify the policy by similar hygienic arguments for the purification of society and the race

i fled from this exaggerated sense of the comic into theology , in the hope that it would give relief to the tickling - only to find there too a perfect legion of ludicrous absurdities
you mean , he interrupted , that the early and repeated contact with death developed in you a tendency which made you sensitive to the harshness and crudity , let us say the cynicism , of our everyday , worldly existence
individualism was romantic-mediæval , in its conviction of the infinite , the cosmic , importance of the single human being , whence was deduced the doctrine of the immortality of the soul , the geocentric doctrine , and astrology

some of the young girls rose , and peter d�ann insisted on accompanying them up the beach
you may well be astonished ; but as for smiling , give me leave to tell you it is out of place
and after the senator and his wife , and frau permaneder and erica , had received for long hours the condolences of the entire town , elisabeth buddenbrook , born kroger , was con-signed to earth
thus he clung to mother schweigestill , to clementine , to waltpurgis
he got up the idea that , so far at least as his own sanatorium was concerned , the summer cure was not only not less to be recommended than the winter one , it was , on the contrary , of great value , really quite indispensable
every morning early he appears in broad street , takes the boots frnm before the door , and cleans them below in the court
his great adam ’ s apple and his good-natured moustaches worked up and down as he repudiated any lack of respect for the sufferings he had undergone
then his uncle sat without mov- ing , his chin resting lightly on the hair of the sleeping child , until one of the women came and fetched him away
sometimes the symphonic accompaniment would fade far off and be forgot
the tablets and crosses were modest affairs , that must have cost but little
they did not , however , think him proud of his achievements ; the trouble was , he was not proud enough , just therein lay his arrogance
but the disease makes him ailing within and fevered without ; disease makes men more physical , it leaves them nothing but body—his own thought startled him , and he looked quickly at joachim with a questioning glance , that travelled from the bared body up to the large , gentle black eyes
her redblond hair gleamed in the morning sun
i can not … once more , renounce her… in vain thou pleadest—and deathly obstinacy and anguished love blend together in a duet of extraordinary power and beauty , but absolutely no hope whatever
she had always known , of course , that she should one day marry , and be the wife of a business man , and embark upon a solid and advantageous married life , commensurate with the position of the family and the firm
hans castorp , bustling and solitary , sifted and classified it all , and tried a fraction of it upon the instrument
inez , that is , espoused the view - i have on occasion heard it from her lips - that pain is an indignity , that it is shameful to suffer
but when naphta did the same , he made unaffectedly merry over the sphere which the other represented , and gave hans castorp to understand that the things for which settembrini fought were all of them dead issues ; free-thought and bourgeois enlightenment were the pathetic delusions of yesterday , though prone to the self-deception which made them a laughing-stock : namely , that they were still full of revolutionary life
he made a wide , sweeping gesture , and cried : twenty-nine thousand thaler , eighty-seven thousand marks current , for your mother 's house !
then i certainly did offend him , hans castorp said fretfully , for it annoyed him to give offence
no , this dark tone-poem pernits up to the very end no consolation , appeasement , transfiguration
arms akimbo , he stood and said : well , well !
such beauty as they had was not of this earth , and made no appeal to the ordinary layman 's human feeling
i beg your pardon for speaking of it like this , but they seem very jolly over it themselves , your pneumatic friends
hans castorp had seen them in herr albin ’ s room , and against his own convictions , out of sheer compulsion from the prevailing temper , offered to borrow them
but one thing i will say : such weirdnesses are exclusively nature 's own affair , and particularly of nature arrogantly tempted by man
h , and un- civilized , the leadership was incapable , the air frightful , and the result less than nothing
it was apparent that one must not demand consistency of conduct
forgetfulness held sway , a blessed hush , the innocence of those places where time is not ; slackness with the best conscience in the world , the very apotheosis of rebuff to the western world and that world ’ s insensate ardour for the deed
and it is a fact that he marked no more the loosening and dissolving of the bond which united him to pribislav than he had previously marked its beginnings
they say already that the prince will be made regent in time
he heard dr krokowski ’ s baritone voice summon him , formally , cheerily , and repeat the request
but i think i may fairly claim to have had a personal share , more than once , in the fortunes of the bud-denbrnok family
albeit first our friendly hert and good will , trusting and playing that thou maist almost joyfully bear the rod and in tract of time be so holpen thereby , till at the last in braid and buttons thou goest forth as a reserve sergeant inajor
the truly musical , in modern , mechanical form , the german soul up to date
i think it pleased the childless man to receive a young kinsman in his far too spacious house
hans castorp and joachim—the first faster than the second—turned their heads from settembrini to naphta
to the frau consul he speaks rather unctuously , to thomas and gerda like a man of the world , and with frau permaneder he is downright jocose , making jokes and gesturing fluently
a way we have in the service
never , he said solemnly , as if transported , speaking to nobody in particular , have i seen more beautiful hair
but at the same time they came to a stop , and the ministrant with the censer knocks , and lifts the latch , and makes way for his superior to enter
like something you dreamed in a fever ?
it had not been so
between the opaque glass walls that divided him on the one side from joachim , on the other from the russian couple , he lay and idly dreamed , his heart pounding , breathing through his mouth
they , vho practised this critique were men of education , culture , science
the parents , afflicted as they were , sustained the brief colloquy with courteous inquiries as to the state of the cousins ’ health , and other conversational devices
he had the feeling that he had been out of touch with yesterday since waking , and had only now picked up the threads again where he laid them down
but after all , joachim said , it is rather flabby-minded of you to be so dependent on it
i will try to tell you about it , in so far as i can , now that i am secure in the honour of your confidence , and in this altogether exceptional and extraordinary twilight hour
his audience rose , pushed back its chairs , and slowly began to move towards the same door , as though converging upon him from all sides , without volition , hesitatingly , yet with one accord , like the throng after the pied piper
the back of his chair was against the hall door
right-oh , i see , the rigor mortis , hans castorp said blithely
we must hold them firmly -- deep within us
after a while the chairman , herr dr langhals , spoke in a subdued tone : gentlemen , i think we could come to some agreement if we opened the meeting
ball gowns he had seen , stately and ceremonial , cut in conformity with a fashion that exposed far more of the person than this one did , without achieving a jot of its sensational effect
it must be more fun to lie in company than alone
there was his smile , of course not quite free from coquetry and consciousness of the charm he
he had reached the second stage of the melody , by the first starting again at the beginning , having surrendered to the second as the fundamental bass the descriptive ding-clang-dong - and so on
we were passing the university , and the conductor , in his felt boots , was standing in front of me to take my ten pfennige and give me my ticket , when the incredible thing happened - at first , like everything entirely unexpected , quite incomprehensible
well , summer is over , in so far as there has been a summer , that is—it has really been a sell , like life in general
he spoke in the pleasant , conversational tone which he liked to use in the pulpit ; his head a little on one side , a subtle , humorous smile on his pale face , gesturing easily with his free hand
seldom has one heard certain things of vivaldi , vieuxtemps and spohr , the c-minor sonata of grieg , even the kreutzer sonata , and compositions by cesar franck , more fault lessly played
a thousand pardons for not waiting , ' she said , as she stood up
the day , however , was cloudy , inclined to frost and snow , and was to clear only towards evening
adrian seemed not to notice
there had been a farewell between clavdia chauchat and himself , the surviving member of a severed brotherhood ; a farewell , uttered in the shadow of a tragic renunciation , and followed by her second departure from the berghof
he felt disgusted , yet for all that he went on fishing in these troubled waters , quieting his conscience with the assurance that he was only up here on a visit and would soon be leaving
the naive expression of her mouth betrayed that the whole of her dignity and importance were a part of a beautiful , childlike , innocent game which she was constantly playing with herself
having decided to regard the com- mon chord as the melodic centre of any given key , he called masters the notes belonging to this chord , and the rest or the scale servants
naphta suggested that since god , in punishment of our sins , had visited us with the shameful and horrible sentence of bodily corruption , after all it was not such a frightful insult to that same body that it should now and then get a flogging
today we see , of course , that it was the mistake of our civilization to have practised all too magnanimously this respect and forbearance
privately he received vords of praise or blame , exception , :vas taken , shortcolnings pointed out in french and gernlan ; he said nothing , either way , and anyhow he agreed with no onc
no arrangements had been made to fetch the guests ; and frau schvveigestill , whom helene and i sought out in the kitchen , explained to us in no small consternation that adrian had not said a word to prepare her for the invasion
a forthright question on the subject could at most have been in place and had any chance of results in the course of a students ' evening jollification , when tongues and brains were loosened and livened by drink
hans castorp took in this information with a sprightly , yet half-distraught air
i noticed he had gone , he is probably in the rest-cure by now
wehsal , who was present , announced that naphta had already expressed himself to the effect that he wanted no doctor

his little deep round eyes began to stray moodily about ; he rubbed his left side with his hand , and seemed to be listening to uncanny sounds within himself

there is nothing in the book -- i have no crib -- i have not deceived you -- i have al-ways been honourable -- give me your book , repeated the master , stamping hia foot
people hurried past the window , their chins tucked into their turned-up collars ; no one gave a glance into the corner of the little flower-shop , at the two who stood there saying their last farewells
for the distinctive feature of his cosmos was that he made god and the devil two distinct persons or principles , with life as a bone of contention between them—which , by the by , was just the way the middle ages had envisaged them
but , herr hofrat , why are you so hard on me ?

at four o'clock , when she had stopped watch- ing and almost stopped thinking about her daughter , there was a stir below in the house
yet he was so sure he was bringing joy to everybody that there was something contagious about it
bitterer , harder to understand , for him who knew and walked beside him than for the devoted one himself , whose knowledge , even though he knew and kept silent , was academic in its nature , was in a way less his own concern than his companion ’ s
he had become more and more subject to uncannv delusions and morbid hallucina- tions , until finally his wife had acted upon the advice of a physician and had him put into an institution
johann buddenbrook found and greeted his old friend g f koppen , and then kb'ppen 's rival , consul kistenmaker

what suspense , what subterranean activity !

i know i am silly ; but i have noticed about myself -- and about other peo-ple too -- that we are most likely to get angry and excited in our op-position to some idea when we ourselves are not quite certain of our own position , and are inwardly tempted to take the other side
to go on without any marked cresura would be correct , for the subject of the narrative is the same : the outer world , and the history of my departed friend 's con- nection or lack of connection with it

as for krokowski , for all his brain , it was a question whether the technique of wound treatment would be his strong point
he sat with his back to the salon , already arrayed in a black coat and light trousers with a pattern of large checks , eating a grilled chop , in the english manner
there were even two or three women -- who had probably promised themselves the same millennium as the buddenbrooks ' cook

when the beach was too stony to go on , they began to climb , and continued upward through the wood until they reached the temple
—the beautiful old furniture , hans castorp went on , the pieta out of the fourteenth century , the venetian lustre , the little page in livery—and such a lot of chocolate layer cake , too—he must personally be pretty well off , i should think— herr naphta , settembrini answered , is , personally , as little of a capitalist as i am
they were served by a friendly maid in black frock and white apron
he paused , and his bony , emaciated face cleared up as be regarded the little theatre
the man was of slight proportions , with a grey , hollow-cheeked face
yes , you say that as a soldier ; and i must admit the military has an understanding of these matters
adrian no longer believed
it was pathetic ; and the flabby humanitarianism of it went hand in hand with the wolfish cruelty and baseness of the economic conflict within the bourgeois state
after all , he was only thirty-nine years old , and besides , but few of the guests present possessed enough musical knowledge for such an attitude on any rational grounds
but , before everything , he must find out his daughter 's real feelings
it was indeed a solemn moment when , after early breakfast , the consul led him down into the office and introduced him to herr marcus the confidential clerk , herr havermann the cashier , and the rest of the staff , with all of whom , naturally , he had long been on the best of terms

she held her left hand doubled up in a fist near her cheek as she ate , and drew her upper lip back from her long , narrow , rodent-like teeth when she spoke , obviously trying to make an impression of culture and refinement
time always did—but more gradually , in the rule , not so strikingly
before they separated , hans castorp told them that behrens ’ s order was for joachim to remain in bed at least on the morrow , or until he had come to examine him
wild horses could not drag him up here
it seems that she gave him all the sweetness of her womanhood , to repay him for what he risked
leila , after ten minutes ’ talk , gave signs of fatigue , or rather of over-excitement ; the flush deepened in her cheek , and her forget-me-not eyes glittering disquietingly
the imaginative grasp , the brave idealism of his youth was gone
he watched frau chauchat going out , gliding along with her head thrust forward
not a member was frost-bitten , nothing snapped when he stamped , shook and struck himself , as he did vigorously , all the time seeking to establish the facts of his situation
he may die any day— and yet they ’ ve never found even the ghost of a bacillus in his sputum
that indignity of corruption , he said , of which naphta spoke , could by its means be redressed
the snow-fall was monstrous and immeasurable , it made one realize the extravagant , outlandish nature of the place
iwersen made a low , awkward bow ; his wife , continuing to push the little carriage back and forth , looked calmly and observantly at the frau senator with her narrow black eyes , as the lady approached them on her husband 's arm
and herr hofrat , how much longer do you think—
suppose he did do it , began frau permaneder afresh , and her voice gathered strength
what is it you want ?
whereat he , with a feverish presence of mind for which he thanked his stars , had responded : pas de quoi , madame
naphta , with unexpectedly spontaneous cordiality , expressed the hope that he might have the pleasure of meeting them again
he leaned against the wall , now and then contributing a word to the conversation , and for the rest looking out into space across the balustrade
he himself had five children , and his brother moritz had four sons and daughters

on the steps he met the consul , and his eyebrows went up under the brim of his grey hat
the laggard greeted her table-mates with a nod , and took her place on the inner side of the table with her back to the room , next to dr krokowski , who was sitting at the top
she had taken up the paper as she spoke , and
the general rest-hall was populated by reclining patients , reading , writing , or conversing
the queen herself says : in my own france how different !
he had the greatest respect for work—though personally he found that he tired easily
no talk of getting away

he told himself that it was not his regular bed-time ; that during the day he had probably rested too much
he blinked rapidly for a bit and then got up
i well remember how she once said : hop up !
tom was very attentive in helping his sister out , while anton and line hastened up to unfasten the trunk
shockingly pale , he had the same red eyes as the rest of the household ; with his mouth firmly shut , he kept mechanically moving his tongue to -and fro inside his lower lip
hans castorp remained in ignorance of the hour or day of his cousin ’ s coming , and thus could not receive him at the station when , three days later , he and his mother simply arrived
two rows of jewelled buttons sparkled on his black velvet waistcoat
furthermore , the sole and only reason zutawski had declined to institute proceedings was that all the world , himself included , was aware that his wife jadwiga had provided him with a complete assortment of horns ; as to the truth of which fact japoll would have found nothing easier than to give evidence ; and that lastly the appearance of the kryloff before a court would have been little edifying for anybody concerned
but the experiment \\ras not en- tirely without fruit , for it had put me in touch with the leaders of the artistic life of paris , painters , musicians , writers
thomas 's contemp-tuous ill will , which christian bore with quiet indifference , expressed itself in all the trifling situations that dome up be-tween members of a family

the same train brought them as had hans castorp , when years ago , years that had been neither long nor short , but timeless , very eventful yet the sum of nothing , he had first come to this place
in the mouth of rosaline and her friends biron falls quite out of his role ; he is no longer biron , but shakespeare in his unhappy affair , vith the dark lady ; and adrian , who had the sonnets , that profoundly extraordinary trio of poet , friend , and beloved , always by him in an english pocket edition , had been from the beginning at pains to assimilate the character of his biron to this particular and favourite dialogue and to give him a music which , in suitable proportion to the burlesquing style of the whole , makes him grave and intellectually considerable , a genuine sacrifice to a shameful passion
no doubt of it at all
he drew out and opened his book again , all the time apparently wrestling to recover his self-control and staring about the room
well , how are you , my dear boy ?
it is quite mad to be eating so much cucumber and potato salad with the beer -- my tummy rebels audibly
he gave me his hand first , he announced when he looked up and saw me

then it was shut away ; but he heard it again when , a few minutes later , he was bidden to enter , and behrens presented him to the blonde lady lying there in bed and looking at him with curiosity out of her blue eyes

it would disgust me to enter the lists in the sort of rivalry that is too current up here ; otherwise i might reply that my case is far more serious than yours—so much more , in fact , that it is only by artificial means , almost by deliberate self-deception , that i can keep alive the hope of leaving this place and having sight of the world below before i die
their voices rose unisono to the blissful sustained note leading into the octave , as they assured each other that now heaven was opening , and the light of its eternity streaming forth before their yearning eyes
it was , at that musical time of day and at the young adept 's age , almost inevitable that here and there the influence of gustav mahler should be perceptible

in the household she was most intimate with her poor and pious cousin clothilde , whose father had lately died , and whose idea it was to es-tablish herself soon -- which meant to go into a pension some-where with the money and furniture which she had inherited

thus for the space of a moment they stood , he in a posture of commanding rage , tony pale , weepy , and trembling , her damp handkerchief to her mouth
he risked nothing by this attitude , being confident that his accomplice would agree to anything he said , no matter how wide of the mark

there were also , however , some objective grounds for his state , as the cousins had heard : international scandal of a kind only too familiar in the establishment
aside from the few oak-trees that had been set out down in the platz , where they had just managed to survive , and long before now had despondently shed their leaves , the whole region held no deciduous trees to give the landscape an autumnal cast ; only the hybrid alpine alder , which renews its soft needles as though they were leaves , showed a wintry baldness

the disciplining of lovableness till it became love : that was what it amounted to ; but at the same time there was more abstnlse matter , about something wherein thought and sense mystically melted into one ; the idea that the contradiction between the frivolity of society and the melancholy untrustworthiness of life in general was resolved in his embrace , the suffering it caused most sweetly avenged

perhaps , indeed , her whole disease consisted in that , and in nothing else—but though lost to view , she was none the less invisibly present to hans castorp ; she was the genius of the place , whom , in an evil hour , an hour unattuned to any simple little ditty of the flat-land , yet one of passing sweetness , he had known and possessed , whose shadowy presentment he now wore next his months-long-labouring heart

but up here -- here sits mother on one side and tom on the other , looking at him and lifting their eyebrows , and uncle justus gives a start and fairly snorts , the way the krogers do , and pfiffi buddenbrook gives her mother a look , or friederike or henriette , and i feel so morti-fied i want to run out of the room , and it does not seem as if i could marry him -- oh , childie -- it would be munich that you would live in with him
why was i more than surprised , namely moved and a little startled ?
with the swift-changing years , a spirit began to walk in house berghof : a spirit of immediate descent , or so hans castorp surmised , from that other demon whose baleful name we have spoken
he had left off his worsted gloves to-day , and his hands were long and white , marked with blue veins

he heard his cousin get up from his chair and go indoors , probably to show the doctor his curve ; and the conversation seemed to be further prolonged inside the chamber , to judge from the length of time before the assistant appeared , this time from the inside , through his room
such events did not disturb him -- they had never disturbed him

she appears unannounced on the scene , some three heads taller than i am , white-haired and exceeding wroth ; fetches herr anton a couple of boxes on the ear , takes him by the collar , and puts him on the train
but , after all , it was not so absolutely cer-tain , beyond a peradventure -- there were exceptions to every rule
the old man 's rosy face grew sterner as he opened the seal with one finger , unfolded the thin paper , and gave it a smart rap with the back of his hand as he turned about to catch the light from the candles
they were students from the conservatoires , painters , writers , young publishers , also beginning lawyers with an interest in the arts , a fcw actors , members of the leipzig kam- merspiele , under strong literary influence - and so on
all this bespoke and beknown , will i now to take leave to play you a little out of the construction which i heard from the lovely instrument of satan and which in part the knowing children sang to me
to the pedagogic temperament there is something revolting about that
she sobbed once or twice before she answered , hopelessly : oh , no , tom
i ca not tell you how pleased i am that they are installing gas for the street-lighting , and the miser-able old oil-lamps are disappearing -- i admit i had a little something to do with that change
thus what we call tedium is rather an abnormal shortening of the time consequent upon monotony
you do understand me - you could scarcely mistake
fränzchen ’ s case , on her arrival , and even after the examination , had been thought a light one
i howled like a rhained-up dog ; i felt dread-fully
we who were present at the explanation had indeed an uncommonly enriching evening , and this although the sonata un- der discussion was to that date entirely unknown to us
it is all perfectly new and astonishing to me—i am free to confess
hans castorp walked into his own room in confusion
i prefer to annihilate my consciousness at its very centre by introducing my charming little foreign body direct into this interesting organ—herr albin indicated with his index finger a spot on his close-cropped blond pate
the tea-kettle was humming
she knew that clavdia chauchat was having her portrait painted , and asked hans castorp if he knew it too
it is not quite the thing , is it ?
that ’ s nothing but a week-end ! —won ’ t pay you to take off your hat
three weeks up here was as good as nothing at all ; they had all told him so in the beginning
the health of the dear patient , as well as of the infant , is unexception-able
the discussion was intermitted only by a visit to the church ; it was in the main a controversy between rudi schwerdtfeger and me over the so- called madness , the incapacity for reigning , the dethronement and legal restraint of ludwig
it was like a dry cough , which had of late become almost a habit with her , and had probably to do with her digestive trouble
after the examination he confirmed the disposi- tions of his obsequious rural colleague : avoidance of light , head kept cool and bedded high , very gentle handling , alcohol rubs , concentrated nourishment ; it would probably become necessary to give it by a tube through the nose
who would have thought it of him ?
after the third time , however , the frau senator refrained from reply
but it is obvious that you are even more interested in him than in her
i , yell know this is at bottom what they mean 'who apply the , vord barbaric to adrian 's creation
the invasion of france , long recognized as a pos- sibility , has come , a technical and military feat of the first , or rather of an altogether unique order , prepared with the fullest de- liberation , in which we could the less prevent the enemy since we did not dare concentrate our defence at the single point of land- ing , being uncertain whether or not to regard it as one among many further attacks at points we could not guess
all about him was coldness - and how do i feel , using this word , which he himself , in an uncanny connection , once also set down ?
and he , as i said , responded with a , vorsening of his impediment amounting a few times almost to a calamity
and joachim , with a quick look at his cousin , answered , drawing his heels together as he sat : for half past three
after forty years in the service of the buddenbrook family , left it to return to her native west prussia to live out the evening of her life
i think i can understand a joke , but you see how your joke was understood
the lesson went on
they must wait and control themselves
oftener there vvas no occasion at all , it was the purest silliness , and i confess that i al- ways had certain difficulties in seconding him
she carried in one hand her little lacquered key-basket ; the other was in the pocket of her gown , whose soft folds played about her
yes , just now , as we came out
the whole affair , each time , took but a second ; one after another , the row of patients received their dosage , in thigh or arm , and turned away
take care , if it drips on your skin it will blister
the senator followed on the invitation
on using his handkerchief he discovered it to be red with blood , but had not enough energy to think about the fact , though he was rather given to worrying over himself and by nature inclined to hypochondria
hans castorp said—and he too addressed his companion with the licence of the season , and said thou to him : dear me , you ’ re full of poetry to-night
are not we well enough as we are ?
ah , it was worth dying for , the enchanted lied !
even so , the present enclosure seemed fairly full , both along the wall and in the less desirable inner plots ; one could hardly see or say just where another interment was to take place
it seemed he simply could not lay eyes on the hofrat ; either that evening , or in the course of the two following days
ich trage meine minne
he is the feeling of god
then grotthold had come , and josephine had died
they took her hand and murmured , with drooping eyes , precisely no more and no less than what on such occasions must be murmured ; while the gentlemen made ready to go down to the carriages
raise my spirits , as i reflected that after all only the youthful play- mate and nobody else in the world could be the recipient of such confidences
he took his skis and went up on the funicular to the schatzalp ; there , rapt six thousand feet above the sea , he revelled at will on the gleaming slopes of powdery snow—whence , in good weather , there was a view of majestic extent over all the surrounding territory
he said himself that he had the pedagogic itch
i ’ ll stick a little something in my pocket for second breakfast ; then i shall be independent
she had folded her arms again
you must see kretschmar soon , it occurred to him to say \
the red spots on breast and ab-domen are more numerous
she set a steaming cup of cocoa before him , and pushed the bread and butter , salt , and an egg-cup toward his place
her manner expressed sheer surprise and umbrage - and that both startled and secretly pleased him
peeperkorn made no objection to his neighbours ’ enjoyment , but did not smoke himself—he never had done so
good gracious , what a business !
his name , so the young people understood , was naphta
he had the same rather small round deep-set eyes and the same prominent aquiline nose ; the lines of his face below the cheek-bones showed that it would not always retain its present child-like fulness
is there anything more heartfelt , more glorious , he would cry , than such a pro- gression of mere triads ?
hans castorp reflected that if that were true , then what about the anonymous and communal—not to mention any other contradiction ?
he looked toward the open balcony door , and considered seeking counsel of joachim , but thought better of it and paused again by the table
but she had seen the child 's smile , the rhythm of his body , the beloved little head swaying enraptured from side to side -- and the sight had penetrated to the depths of her easily moved nature
on a june afternoon , not long after five o'clock , the family were sitting before the portal in the garden , where they had drunk coffee
no more did his body lie supine while his ego roved back to a far-off present
the fresh milk , and the farm sausages and hams -- one thrives like the cattle and the crops
it seemed to him that with his two simple inquiries he had refuted settembrini ’ s whole position , even the republic and the bello stile
edgar , said dr mantelsack , closing his note-book with his finger in it
even so , it did not come about without angry opposition , bitter reproaches and outcries against the piece as a mockery of art , an expression of nihilism , a crime against music , in short , to use the current and fashionable condemnation , as a specimen of cultural bolshevism
but doubtless—am i then to ascribe it to the—what was it you said ? —the pedagogic principles of signor settembrini that you—i beg you not to misunderstand me— not at all , mynheer peeperkorn
joachim was for instructing his cousin in the names of the mist-wreathed alpine heights which seemed to enclose the valley on the south , pointing them out in turn with his alpenstock
he had been coughing a bit down below , but otherwise quite lively
art would like to stop being pretence and play , it would like to become knowledge
he addressed his relative as young man , and asked if he was crazy
he will undoubtedly come up to ascertain your condition
but when he heard his neighbours to right and left conclude their evening cure and re-enter their rooms to exchange the horizontal without for the horizontal within , he gave utterance to the conviction that at least this evening the barbaric pair would keep the peace
only a short hour now remained before school would begin
it was the re-turn from an unspeakably painful wandering , the correction of a grave mistake , the loosening of chains , the opening of doors -- it put right again a lamentable mischance
let us see , now -- let us see -- what sort of offer was it they had made ?
and dr krokowski entered it all in his book , just like the tailor ’ s assistant
furthermore , joachim was always urging an early withdrawal
in the corridor joachim pointed to this and that door and gave the names of the occupants—there were german names , but also all sorts of foreign ones—with brief comments on them and the seriousness of their cases
it would have been better to keep still and get a mark
if one had to sit up here for ever and a day— !
would you like to dance ?
then it appeared that herr kistenmaker was not minded to allow any interference in what he considered his prerogative
so when echo addressed his uncle for the first time , his words , instead of sounding forward , seelned to be placating and making light of something , loyally reducing it to simple and friendly terms : well , you are glad i did come , yes ?
you can expect from me nothing that runs counter to the duties i have to-day assumed ; all other feelings must be silent
so much the better if that is true
let me do it , he said to them , gently putting them aside ; and they gave way , first because he wore an air of having known all about it for years , and second because they cared little to take their pleasures actively , instead of sitting to be served to as much and such enjoyment as they could comfortably and unbored receive
but it was perfectly plain that either he or her mother had let the pastor into the secret
in the details of his physical appearance -- the rhin , the nose , and especially the hands , which were wonderfully true to the buddenbrook type -- his likeness to his grandfather was more pronounced than ever
and the senator determined not to let any such opportunities pass without improving them
for the visitor ’ s first motion , while still on the threshold , had been to turn on the electric light , which filled the room in a trice with vibrating brilliance , and reverberated from the gleaming white ceiling and furniture
but the 'senator ' and this house are superficial after all
what does wouldead ' mean when the drop displays such a healthy appetite ?
i call it that , because in my opinion the unhappiness of the world rests on the disunity of the intellect , the stupidity , the lack of comprehension , which separates its spheres fron each other
so this was young joachim ’ s home-coming—for a little after-cure
he has consecrated his burgher ’ s pike on the altar of humanity , so that salami may be taxed at the brenner frontier
which in my view was an inven- tion of tante 's
you lie there on your chips and sawdust , and you bloat ; the gases swell you up , puff you all out , the way frogs do when bad little boys fill them up with air
they laughed , glad that he should be pleased to jest and talk poetry
the anthers shook out their yellow pollen on the thalamus from the tips of their filaments , the pitted pistil stood stiffly up from the ovaries ; when hans castorp cut through it longitudinally , he could see the narrow channel through which the pollen grains and utricles were floated by the nectar secretion into the ovarian cavity
thus ended the continuation of p : drian 's cure by dr zimbalist , after its earlier interruption
dr faustus present or dreamed of
be happy , you good child , she said , when tony appeared at herr gr� 's buddenbrodks side in the hall
joachim sat up straight
so novv i copy it down - and i fear that no distant explosions jarring my retreat will be needed to make my hand shake as i write and my letters to be ill-formed
halle was , if not a metropolis , at least a large city , with more than two hundred thousand inhabitants
moreover it is pure hypochondria
no , just as it was , it accurately mirrored his inner state , and that , whatever its simplicity , was full of troubled , involved , dubious , not quite ingenuous thoughts
you are not fond of children , antonie
it must keep together
the softness of his outward seeming , however , contrasted strongly with the actual strength and self-respect of his charac- ter
he made a droll picture of a grief-stricken widower on his daily pilgrimage to the graveside , to hold communion with the beloved departed ; and said that the man must have a superfluity of that most precious of human commodities , time ; and further , that the rush of business in a large modern burying-ground must surely dash his atavistic bliss
monic powers , to a world of fantastic uncanniness , an ocean of d
the pavements were wet and dirty , the grey gables dripped
there is something suspicious about music , gentlemen
so that , he thought , was directress von mylendonk
the consul had hard , nerve-racking days behind him
after his first visit , as the old lady with sly reproof betrayed to him , she had , vept a few tears on her tante 's breast
( out of print ) past masters and other papers translated by h t lowe-porter
then you have already made his acquaintance ?
he sat down , as if all were in the best of order
i can still see the figures of some of them ; for instance , that of thomas , the ostler , who used to fetch us from weissenfels and bring us back : a one-eyed , ex- traordinarily long and bony man , with a slight hump , on which he used to let little adrian ride ; it was , the meister often told me later , a most practical and comfortable seat
jonathan leverkiihn was a man of the best german type , such as one seldom sees now in our towns and cities , certainly not among those who today , often with blatant exaggeration , repre- sent our german manhood
you will , herr settembrini persisted , level this reproach in vain , if humanistic pride one day learns to feel as a debasement and disgrace the fact that the intellect is bound up with the body and with nature
he might as well have said against whom , but expressed himself impersonally to show how completely unconscious he was of herr settembrini ’ s meaning—a meaning which even joachim perfectly comprehended
you never asked me to wait , i did it on my own
i wouldn ’ t contradict you , herr settembrini , because you look at the question from a higher point of view , so to speak , as an author
yes , this wipes out a lot of things -- not least the affair with that person whose name i do not even like to speak
there is both rhyme and reason in what i say , i have made a dream poem of humanity
fashion , in his left hand , against his shoulder
at last he received from her hands the pressure that meant yes
or , to speak literally , by his mama—a very determined lady , i quite took to her
i invite you , sir , to take heed to your words
herr permaneder f orebore to commit himself on the subject of his departure
he had driven hither in his carriage
yes , the good , the patient , the upright joachim , so affected to discipline and the service , had been attacked by fits of rebellion , he even questioned the authority of the gaffky scale : the method employed in the laboratory—the lab , as one called it—to ascertain the degree of a patient ’ s infection
he tried to say very well , but his voice was inaudible in the clamour behind him
father , she said , i understand very well that this affair is a blot on our family history
producer at once and urgently claimed our sympathy
the date can not be fixed , but it must certainly have been in our early school-days that he ceased to bestow it on me and used only my last name instead , though it would have seemed to me impossibly harsh to do the same
whether settembrini had remarked yes , yes , or i see , i see , or both , or merely poveretto !
that was all he did ; the rest the drop did itself
her brother himself sits there , certainly a little pale
hans castorp betook himself to his balcony , his ears full of the hurly-burly and the clashing of arms , as the army of jerusalem and that of babylon , under the dos banderas , came on in battle array , and met each other midst tumult and shoutings
the consul said : no , let me do it , gosch
still , i may be allowed to indicate the tragic antino- mies of which life is full
it must come up , and he must answer ; but was her brother now in a mood to be governed by gentleness and filial piety ?
times are not what they were when your grandfather was a prussian army contractor
hans castorp felt utterly dumbfounded—involuntarily he slapped the table with his hand
he crossed the stream and the narrow-gauge road to the street , with its scattered buildings ; but left this again soon to strike into a meadow path , which went only a short way on the level and then slanted steeply up to the right
literally that , and making just such a face ; i have often heard them , and i see now it made an impression on me—which it would not have done , of course , unless it had struck me as strange
they shook their fingers at him , they winked maliciously , they put their heads on one side , crooked their forefingers beside their ears and waggled them in a pantomime suggestive of their delight at having found him out , who had played the innocent so long
it was so obnox-ious , so incredibly tactless , that i can find no words -- the stupidity called down a sharp snub on you at once
not eight hundred even
hans castorp was vaguely smiling ; the other ’ s eyes looked sad , beseeching
if so be it 's all o'er wi ' kurz then i am fer buddenbrook
his distorted lips curled back with the emphasis of the here !
gerda had finished her hair for the night and was brushing her big white teeth , using the ivory-backed hand-mirror to see them better
in the morning the bathing-master would give a mighty thump on the door and enter—a nervous individual named turnherr , who wore his sleeves rolled up , and had great standing veins upon his forearms , and a gurgling , impeded speech
what is it you reproach him with ?
it was not easy to understand her rage and terror ; hans castorp did not see at once what she meant , and inquired : well ?
passionate—that means to live for the sake of living
he felt all the world looking at him expectantly , questioning if he would know how to command prestige for the firm and the family and protect its name
he tested hanno 's heart action and measured his chest and his lamentable muscular development
i thought you wanted to go down later as a sound man , to be a soldier
those were his very words
you really mean that ?
a missionary comes , and stops the week with us
beethoven , then , so we heard , was reputed not to be able to write a fugue ; and now the question was how far this malicious criticism was true
on the sixth occasion , when he felt , he divined , an inner voice whispered him , that she was looking , he pretended to be absorbed in disgusted contemplation of a pimply dame who had stopped to talk with the great-aunt
madame kethelsen wept softly , but comprehended nothing
is not it amusing that music for a long
up to a certain period they had been his only trouble in life
no , i am no good
but they must be up !
he had not shed a tear -- which fact rather mortified him
he was not capable of consecutive thought
the cousins ordered orangeade for the refreshment of their charge and themselves , while frau stöhr took a brandy and sugar
but if i may take the occasion to give you the benefit of my poor opinion—sine pecunia , you understand , quite sine pecunia—i would suggest that you do just as your cousin does , while you are up here
this distension of the tissues , or turgor , pressed the lymph , after it had nicely swilled out the cells and exchanged matter with them , into the vasa lymphatica , the lymphatic vessels , and so back into the blood again , at the rate of a litre and a half a day
my name is , i repeat , grunlich , he said ; from hamburg , i may say by way of introduction that i am a close business friend of herr buddenbrook
you have expressed it to a t , herr settembrini
this was the lower second form of the real schule , some twenty-five strong , comrades of hanno and kai
i rejoiced that i was on the spot to protect adrian ; i should not have liked him to be delivered over alone to this representant
she had on a short bodice with high puffed sleeves , that left exposed a flawlessly modelled neck adorned with a spray of diamonds on a satin ribbon
i did not care for it when kammersanger kioeielund brayed out sieg- fried 's pretty dull and long-winded smith 's songs so that all the vases and glass-ware in the salon rattled and rang in sympathy
i regret to say it escaped my attention , joachim said grumpily
on their side , the jewish publishers ' wives and bankers ' ladies looked up to him with the profound admiration of their race for german master- blood and long legs and greatly enjoyed making him presents : the knitted stockings , belts , sweaters , and scarves which he wore were mostly gifts , and not always quite unprompted
the arch of the loggia framed a glorious panorama of snow-powdered forest , softly filled passes and ravines , white , sunlit valleys , and radiant blue heavens above all
hans castorp might have applied to him with his metaphysical puzzles , if only by way of challenge or in a carping spirit , without any serious expectation of an answer from the humanist , whose concerns and interests , of course , were all of this earth
actually , he only told him what the artistic sense of the pupil might have said itsejf , or what it had already told him
never mind , my child ; things will all be arranged here , just take what is necessary in a small trunk
i shall do nicely now
my eyes run over
more than once he remonstrated angrily , this constant harping on musical \dlues , my dear , strikes me as rather tasteless and opinionated
he lifted his head and tried to say something ; but bubbles of blood welled out between his lips , whose gentle fullness seemed all at once so touching to me ; his eyes rolled and his head fell back with a thud on the bench
i-ie begged her pardon for the treason , which he had committed against nobody but himself
true above all for the embittered self-castigation of the heart be- cause of its infatuation with the whitely wanton with a velvet brow , with two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes , and again quite particularly for the musical picture of these beloved ac- cursed eyes : a melisma darkly flashing out of the sound of coffi-
you don ’ t mean to say it is going to snow now ?
in pfeifferilg he had wished not to rec- ognize me
echo liked these things , of course , but when he had played vvith them he soon said : 'nuff , and much preferred to have his uncle show and explain some object of grown-up use - alw
it was somewhat past the half-hour when the door was opened by the technical assistant to admit the swedish giant and fortune ’ s minion
as you see , sir
they drove under a heaven thick with stars , and hans castorp , his head tipped back , with pointing forefinger expounded to his uncle-cousin the starry field , named planets by name and showed off this or that constellation
herr permaneder had to explain to frau antonie in her turn the reason of his appearance
because they were revolting
with unerring instinct he divined that this figure was cal- culated to add content to his unsatisfied existence , and he made himself the slave of one who had scarcely ever heard his name
mother , i am looking forward to trouble
his grandfather had enjoyed playing the flute , and he himself always listened with pleasure to melodies that possessed a graceful charm , a lively swing , or a lender melancholy
life was harsh : and business , with its ruthless unsentimenlalily
he did not stir , he lay on his back in the narrow yellow wooden bed , the linen of which was extremely thin and soft with age
oh , said hans castorp , i know how already
i can see , now i look back , that i was always struck by it
the corners of thomas 's mouth were drawn down in an expres-sion almost scornful
she had been a charming person , to judge from her likenesses , though too large-eyed and asthenic-looking
it may not be too late , since christian has decided to give up a professional career , for him to learn much that is valuable from his chief , mr richardson ; may he prosper and find blessing in the mercantile line !
he is no longer here ?
to-night , perhaps , before we go to bed
he preserved a depressed and brooding silence
ah , thought i , there lies our charming invalid , obeying the rules of the house , for the sake of an early return to the arms of her waiting husband
and there were still nlhrr days , dreamy , blue , wind- less , broodingly warm , when the blue flies buzzed in the sun above the leuchtenfield , and the sea lay silrni and like a mirror , without sir or breath
and if we touched upon the further question , whether our readers were clear how much time had passed since the upright joachim , deceased in the interval , had introduced into the conversation the above-quoted phrases about music and time—remarks indicating a certain alchemistical heightening of his nature , which , in its goodness and simplicity , was , of its own unaided power , incapable of any such ideas—we should not have been dismayed to hear that they were not clear
his wife thought this very elegant , but also very disgusting -- she had never brought herself to take it instead of her usual breakfast of bread and butter and an egg- tony was in her dressing-gown
i believe , on my soul , she looks like netta , old johann said , beaming with pride and pleasure
what a shocking pity , my friend !
herr albin asked , almost gruffly , and emphasized his energetic speech by shaking his head
their movements were quick , agile , and noiseless ; hardly had any one time to be sensible of the pain of the situation , before they had lifted the burden from the bier to their shoulders , and the flower-covered casket swayed away smoothly and with decorum through the pillared hall
certainly not for a joke , he repeated , and compressed his
he received me in his private office
and once in a while the rircu-lation is not what it should be
and even 'his sense of personal modesty seemed to be breaking down
thus passed tom 's and christian 's boyhood , with no great events to mark its course
i must say that gives me to think
and yet what all in our time have the police not allowed - again in agreement with the times , which might read- ily , by degrees , allow just such things to happen again now ?
outside was the reeking void , the world enwrapped in greywhite cotton-wool , packed to the window-panes in snow and mist
her mother , frau permaneder , saw further
he wrenched his eyes open , amazed at the depths of the trance in which he had been sunk
a peculiarity of this given name was that you were to pronounce it as though it were spelled pschibislav ; and the singularity of the appellation suited the lad ’ s appearance , which did indeed have something exotic about it
or , rather , it followed directly from the union , the unity that subsisted between humanity and literature , for the beautiful word begets the beautiful deed
the entrance was through a narrow whitewashed corridor opening into the restaurant on the right side , where it smelled of beer and cooking , and thence through a handleless , lockless green door so small and narrow that no one could have supposed such a large room lay behind it
thomas used to make cool sarcastic comments and act as if he thought christian was exaggerating or hoaxing -- which was certainly not the case
i ask , are they problems ?
and you will see , you will succeed with him
they were quite ready , and took temporary leave of frau permaneder , expressing the hope of seeing her again when they had finished
flushed with pleasure and industry , she ran impetuously down the steps ; gerda and thomas climbed out of the trunk-laden carriage wrapped in their furs ; and she drew them into the house in her embrace
we saw tears run down his cheeks and fall on the keyboard , wetting it , as he at- tacked the keys in a strongly dissonant chord
it is necessary , in any case , that you should make some new connections
y ou want to put me on my honour as a humanist , said i hu- man reason !
beneath each dried specimen in his herbarium he carefully inscribed in ornamental lettering the latin name which a humanistic science had gallantly bestowed on it ; added its distinguishing characteristics , and submitted the whole to the approval of the good joachim , who was all admiration
cross yourself , like this , forehead to shoulders , the way you learned as a child
but seriously speaking , it was chance after all ; for the reason that this whole complex of halle univer- sity life , just as in the earlier case of the i

perhaps somebody dropped a little word to madame his mother ; anyhow , she got wind of his goings-on , in baccho et ceteris
she promised to bring kulmbacher beer , and did so
i know how much you contributed to make her visit in munich pleasant and entertaining
he had been taken to the opera as compensation lor a particularly painful visit to herr brncht ; sitting beside his mother , in the dress circle , he had followed breathless a per-formance of fidelia , and since that time he had heard nothing , seen nothing , thought of nothing but opera , and a passion for the theatre filled him and almost kept him sleep-less
he contemplated this fact with pleasure ; he enjoyed the reflection that his relation to the femur , or to organic nature generally was now threefold : it was lyrical , it was medical , it was technological ; and all of these , he felt , were one in being human , they were variations of one and the same pressing human concern , they were schools of humanistic thought
in one aspect death was a holy , a pensive , a spiritual state , possessed of a certain mournful beauty
he wears the stately ruff of the departed and we do him honour in solemn black
the & hame that gnaws at us secretly and eats away our self-respect -- that is far , far worse
he had gone to the keyboard not out of desire to master it , but out of private curiosity about music itself ; he was entirely lacldng in the gypsy blood of the concert artist , who produced l
an of the hundred and forty-four thousand redeemed , filling the heavens with their voices , here the four choral parts simply sing in the same rhythm , while the orchestra adds to and sets against them the richest , most varied and contrasting ones

no , no , my friend
he awoke with the thought in his mind that he must certainly tell joachim of this discovery on the morrow
what pains she would have to take to spare me if she had to say no !
who says tbou to me ?
he talked about the pleasure of driving , the charm of sitting still and being moved along at the same time amid a changing scene ; showed a fatherly interest in hans castorp , even patted the forlorn wehsal ’ s cheek and bade him forget his own unsympathetic ego in admiration of the blithe exterior world , to which the italian pointed with a spacious gesture of his hand in its worn leather glove
he began to smoke—it was wonderful , as behrens had said
it is indeed a most thought- ful and beautiful gift
his business instincts conflicted with his good breeding—the more keenly the more he was aware of the self-confident poise of the institutional life
they looked at each other , and smiled ; then , as there remained nothing more to say , they turned , first their shoulders and then their backs , and went
then he shut his eyes , lifted his face to the ceiling , and drew , all the time uttering objurgations against the pencil , some horrible inanity upon the paper , in his haste spoiling even this , and running off the paper on to the tablecloth

postage stamps were exchanged
so for the first time , with honest admiration , but no trace of shyness , kai entered hanno 's beautiful home

they talked with the children or discussed the unseasonable cold and the new house
and jurisprudence—making laws , pronouncing judgment—its main concern is with human beings too
your heads are full of fantastic religious humbug -- practical idealism , the july monarchy , and what not : and we old folk are supposed to be wretched cynics
his heirs sold the janson matrices in holland to w olffgang dietrich erhardt , of leipzig
but -- do not throw yourself away , i tell you
i still remember the coffee and the pleasant talk we had last autumn , herr hofrat , he would say
the irksome physical conditions that had victim- ized him so long , the catarrh of the stomach , the throat trouble , the tormenting attacks of headache were all gone , his day was his own , and freedom to worl { in it
very remarkable to me , even on the second reading , , vas the fact that the style , the travesty or personal adaptation of icumpf 's old-german , prevailed only until the adventure was recounted and then , vas dropped regardless , so that the closing pages are entirely uncoloured by it and show a perfectly modern style
oh , morality , and that !

no , thomas , the thing was that it filled the cup to overflowing -- and that did not take much , for it was full already , and had been for a long time -- a long time
hans castorp would be good enough to go by himself—let him pay his cousin ziemssen a visit
she did not live deeply , it is true , into the life or affairs of her new home ; but she breathed the munich air , the air of a great city , full of artists and citizens who habitually did nothing : an air with something about it a little demoralizing , which she sometimes found it hard to take good-humouredly
came the eve of departure
should it not pause on the sixty , or give some small sign that this was the end of one thing and the beginning of the next ?
as you know , marcus has become my partner , in proportion to the quota he has paid in

they were in the highest degree calculated to stimulate adrian 's penchant for parody , and the thought of dramatizing them musi- cally in condensed form for the puppet theatre occupied him from the day he made their acquaintance
yet it looked quite properly warlike , like an old-fashioned foot-soldier , perhaps
no , she wears no ring , i have noticed it myself
should you like to guess ?
he assented to frau ziemssen ’ s withdrawal , but was not minded to be bowed from the scene himself
how were things in the world ?
perhaps in a larger city he might be , but here everything depends on cliques and personal motives
you see , munich -- he pro-nounced the name of hia native city in such a way that one could only guess what he meant -- munich is no commercial town

we live in a very pretty square in the town , with a fountain in the middle , like ours at home in the market place , and the house is quite near the town hall

tom , she said , her voice quavering , wringing her hands inside her muff , you must give it to us -- lay it out for us -- you will , wo not you ? -- the money for the bond , i mean

i was already tolerably well aware that what is called liberalism—individualism the humanistic conception of citizenship—was the product of the renaissance
there was no doubt as to which of the two would finally triumph : it would be the power of enlightenment , the power that made for rational advance and development
everyone looked forward eagerly to the activities of these sound people down below—to the sports and races , which it was forbidden to attend , but which numbers of the patients resolved to see , by cutting the rest-cure and slipping out of the berghof
your phrase was that the thou had full sway—very good , let ours likewise have full sway , let us give free rein to brotherly feeling
then he ran down the narrow corridor and sprang out upon the platform to greet his cousin properly
it sounded ridiculous enough , monstrous enough—
for instance , he had the old bell-pulls taken out and the house fitted throughout with electric bells
pieter peeperkorn lay under the red satin coverlet , in his tricot shirt , as hans castorp had so often seen him
he said this not only within himself , his lips formed the words

old dr grabow appeared in person , buddenbr ddks looked at the patient with his long , mild face , shook his head , pressed all their hands , and then stood as dr langhals stood
dazzled by the light and the unfamiliar look of the room , they marched onre around it , singing , filed past the manger where lay the little wax figure of the christ-child , and then moved to their places and stood silent
in other words , to a limited extent and with limited means , he carried on studies ill natural sci- ence , biology , even perhaps in chelnistry and physics , helped out occasionally by my father with material from our laboratory

the criticism of ornament , convention , and the abstract generality are all the same one
he rowed with his little red hands in the air , the fuzz on his head waved up and down , his whole face , with its bristly white beard distorted and grotesque with uncontrolled hilarity -- had grown the colour of cinnamon
he scarcely felt the forceps close around his tooth ; but from the grinding sensation in his mouth , and the increasingly painful , really agonizing pressure on his whole head , he was made amply aware that the thing was under way
i was just wondering about it
breathing heavily , and not quite sure how he got upstairs , hans castorp lay once more in his capital chair upon his loggia ; after this meal there was rest-cure until tea-time—the most important and rigidly adhered-to rest period of the day
to become a laughing-stock be-fore her , too -- no , surely he was not called upon to do that
instead of complying , he drew his hands away from beneath elly ’ s face , and stood up
he looked disturbed and em-barrassed
firstly , said he , i will exhibit to you my thanl { fuiness for the courtesy and the friendship , both undeserved by me , ye have vouchsafed in that ye are cle hither into this place , afoot and by wagon , since out of the desolation of this retreat i have tritten to and called you , likewise had you written to and called by my leal famulus and specjal friend , which yet knoweth how to put me in remembrance of our school-days from youth up , since we did study together at halla ; but thereof , and of how high-mind- edness and abominacyon did in that study already begin , more hereafter in my sernni
his voice cracked as he spoke , because it was changing , which hanno 's had not yet begun to do
he drew out the crib , looked at it with an ex-pression of extreme disgust , as if it were a piece of decaying offal , thrust it into his pocket , and threw the volume of ovid contemptuously back on petersen 's desk

yes , six times a day , like the rest of you
they are thronging before the town hall , with its ornamental glazed-brick facade , its pointed towers and turrets mounting toward a whitish grey sky , its covered steps supported on outstanding columns , its pointed arcades , through which there is a glimpse of the market place and the fountain

it is a compliment i am paying you , or rather to what you are from god
but with the words came so deep a sob that tears rolled out from under his lashes and down his cheeks and wakened him
permaneder has certainly behaved very badly , as i will give him to understand pretty clearly -- do not be afraid of that -- as to how he has behaved himself , thomas , she inter-rupted him , raising herself up to lay a hand upon her breast , as far as that goes , i have already given him to understand that -- and not only 'given him to understand , i can trll you !
i thank you for having taken trouble for me in these seven months , for having lent a hand to a young donkey in all the new experiences that came to him , and tried to influence him for his good—sine pecunia , of course—partly by means of anecdote and partly in abstractions
there was only a dull murmur from the front of the house

in short , no faint-heartedness !

a bitter taste came in his mouth
now and then rain-drops spattered the pane
no , it was her melancholy nature , seeking unhappiness , which fixed upon him as its object ; upon him froin whom she had heard with dis- gust the words : there are so many unhappy ones !
it ’ s coming , just keep it up , let it come , that ’ s the way !
it was partly the comfortable cut and durable wool material of his clothing , the broad , solid elegance of his boots , his crotchety expression , and the way in which his red-blond moustache drooped over his mouth
i have been up here too long not to know how things go
it infallibly reflected the chances of recovery with which the patient had to reckon ; the number of months or years he must still remain could with ease be deduced from it , beginning with the six months that hofrat behrens called a week-end , and ending with the life sentence , which , taken literally , often enough meant very little indeed
it comes down to us from a past seething with superstition , in which the idea of humanity had degenerated and deteriorated into sheer caricature ; a past full of fears , in which well-being and harmony were regarded as suspect and emanating from the devil , whereas infirmity was equivalent to a free pass to heaven
we ought to read other papers : the konigsberg gazette , or the rhenish gazette ; then we would -- she interrupted herself

it was vain , naphta responded , for herr settembrini to invoke the simplicity of those primitive times , the victorious element which preserved its creative vitality even while endowing that which it conquered with a demonic quality
she had spent the time since her father 's death in her room praying almost without ceasing
she scolded him , but she was proud to have him express so freely in her presence the views and opinions which she knew he concealed from his parents

naphta shrugged his shoulders
the window was covered with ice-crystals , and the blind was up in order that the light might come earlier
tom , father , grandfather , and all the rest !
the phenomenon so freshly called up to him the memory of his dead grandfather that , far from finding it offensive , he took a certain pleasure in availing himself of that remembered and dignified method of supporting the chin , by means of which his grandfather had been wont to control the shaking of his head , and to which the boy had responded with such inward sympathy
he stood before her , his weight on one leg , his hands in his trousers pockets

on her lips rested the mocking , merciless smile with which a young girl measures and rejects a man

i think you are very ill-tempered
he fairly snorted , but recovered himself immediately , horrified ; coughed , and tried his best to disguise the senseless outbreak
all he knew was that she was great-aunt to the young lady who ate yogurt , and lived with her permanently in the sanatorium
and accordingly i myself must cease to speak , since in spirit i have turned my back on his deliberately chosen refuge , shared with the silesian , where i had sought him out
after a short pause , herr gr� got up
the whole seemed to be a direction to go slanting through hans castorp ’ s room , that was to say , through number thirty-four
to fill it out , herr permaneder gave a sort of groan , and fol-lowed it up by an exclamation in the broadest of dialect : something that shocked the frau consul because it sounded so like swearing , though it probably was not -- at least , she hoped not !

naphta , having been in a manner challenged , straightway girded up his loins , and fell foul of the latin poet , whom settembrini was known to admire to the point of idolatry , even placing him higher than homer , while naphta had more than once expressed contempt for him and for the whole of latin poetry , and did not fail to seize this opportunity to do so again
it is true that repeatedly , for extended periods , i lived apart from adrian : during my year of military service , at the end of which i resumed my studies at the university of leipzig and became familiar with his life and circle there
by the beginning of june he was back

he saw the pine grove behind and below him , on his right , turned again toward it , and with a quick descent reached the laden trees ; they stood in a wedge-shaped group , a vanguard thrust out from the mist-screened forests above

he was quite a wit , and loved to play with verbal distinctions , as : you were to make a line , my child , and what have you made ?
he overlooked this or that pupil who had brought a book with him into the courtyard to prepare a little at the eleventh hour ; he overlooked the fact that one of his boarding-pupils handed money to the porter , herr schlemiel , and asked him to get some pastry ; he overlooked a small trial of strength between two third-form pupils , which re-sulted in a beating of one by the other , and around which a ring of connoisseurs was quickly formed ; and he overlooked certain sounds behind him which indicated that a pupil who had made himself unpopular by cheating , cowardice , or other weakness was being forcibly escorted to the pump
but a next course was unthink-able , after this mighty dish ; and despite the french toast and apple jelly which finished the meal , the reverend guest had to rise hungry from table , while tony tittered , and tom , with fine self-control , lifted one eyebrow
yes , of course , she was told ; and she followed frau permaneder up the main staircase , gazing silently at its magnificence

they had read it together in the evenings and it ap- pealed to adrian 's sense of the ridiculous , his craving to laugh , yes , to laugh until he cried

his chin was dropped , his mouth drawn down , his blue , musing eyes , with the tear ducts plain beneath them , directed toward the distant view

frau stöhr sat next it—it made her shudder , so she moved over to joachim ziemssen ’ s other side , in the room of miss robinson , discharged cured , and opposite the schoolmistress , hans castorp ’ s neighbour , still faithful to her post

they caressed and comforted her , kissed her on the forehead and sent her to bed
to-morrow the little puss will be slinking back—i ’ ve had a dispatch
one involun- tarily smiled as one applauded ; schwerdtfeger himself laughed like a boy , wriggling his shoulder in his jacket and making his little grimace with the corner of his mouth
an interesting character , brusque to a degree , yet melancholy
the change to liquid nourishment was indicated , and behrens sent him to bed , in order to conserve his strength
and that is just it : today even , along with the instincts , propaganda is made for claims to all sorts of sanc- tions , and that one too , i mean , it takes them in and trims up the old idealism with the psychology of instinct , so that there arises the dazzling impression of a thicker density of reality

thomas buddenbrook would sit there , and the torture was such that he sometimes softly groaned
no unorganic instrumental sound can be compared with it
he was a strange yet attractive figure among the citizens of the old city ; still , he belonged among them , for he carried on a small brokerage business in the most modest , respectable sort of way
the consul turned to those pages , written in a florid hand on rather coarse paper that was already yellowing with age
the book of job falls into three sections
for though joachim ’ s were but a companionship in suffering , yet he suffered , as it were , conformably with military etiquette ; even , though unconsciously , to the point of finding satisfaction in the service of the cure , of substituting it for the service down below and making of it an interim profession
naphta ’ s malicious wit lay in ambush , to spy out the weaknesses of the naturecompelling forces of progress , and convict its standard-bearers and pioneers of human relapses into the irrational
the student rasmussen had grown daily thinner and weaker , he was now bedridden , probably moribund

it seemed that in hans castorp ’ s case , the test of the eye confirmed that of the ear in a way to add lustre to science

cruel , and thoughtless - anyhow cruelty always comes of thoughtlessness
he cried , springing to his feet
he wore his usual black alpaca shirt , setting off the pallor of his face ; his elbows rested on the table , in one hand a pen , the other fingering his beard ; while before him lay various papers , probably the documents in reference to the patients to be examined

he was aware that weather of this kind was not recognized as bad ; such a conception hardly existed up here , where the most inclement conceivable went unheeded and had no terrors for anyone
no need to mention the vermiform appendix , which was a mystery ; in rabbits it was regularly found full of a pulpy substance , of which there was nothing to say as to how it got in or renewed itself
their high state of suspense might , one would think , have made the time seem longer to them than it actually was , whereas it shrank to less than a third of its objective length

behrens motioned them into the cabinet , saying : then you must have been more interested in sculpture , originally , than in painting , i should think

what a pity he had so little taste for those old records !
oh , yes , very energetic , said hans castorp
he did not look like a man at the end of the thirties
he comes to a fisherman who , by the fineness of his limbs , rec- ognizes that he has no ordinary traveller before him , and the two agree that the utmost isolation is the only fitting thing
she smiled as she spoke , and looked at her hus-band with her head on one side

herr permaneder accepted this invitation as blithely as he had the one to dinner
the round table in the great dining-room was grown very small
this consola- tion , true , the n ackedey lacked

besides myself , who took care to be free for the occasion , from our circle of acquaintances there was present only our dear jeanette scheurl , , vho despite her narrow means made the journey to frankfurt and reported on the per- formance to her friend at pfeiffering , in her very individual mixed french and bavarian dialect
bernard of clairvaux , for instance , preached an order of progress towards perfection quite different from any signor ludovico ever dreamed of

but no less painstakingly did the senator strive to influence his mind and give him lively impressions of the practical world in which he was to live
how i love the yearning , the urgent longing , which characterizes it ; the romantic note - since after all it is treated with the strictest of modern devices - thematic , in- deed , but with such considerable variation that actually there are no reprises

far and wide the darkness of the sea was illunlinated by shooting and circling will-o'-the-wisps , caused by the light with which dlany of the creatures were equipped , so that in some cases the entire body vas phosphorescent , while others had a search- light , an electric lantern , with which presumably they not only lighted the darkness of their path , but also attracted their prey

it takes all that is offered , and bites the hand that feeds it
but as he had one day put it to joachim : one begins by being angry and disgusted , and then all at once something quite different enters in , that has nothing to do with moral judgment , and it is all up with your severity ; you are simply not at home to pedagogic influences , however republican , however eloquent
the life christian led outside the house , mainly wilh his old schoolmate lawyer gieseke , was observed by the consul with disgust
horrible , awful ; never in my life have i imagined there could be such a sickening feeling , outside hell and its torments
they asked it teasingly , with that curiously superior and slighting air which grown people assume toward children , as if none of their affairs could possibly be worthy of serious consideration ; but hanno was proof against their questions
serenus , said she , it is inevitable , i knovi it , he '\-vill leave me
he had a face like a pug dog , and dull brown eyes
i thought about it a long time in bed last night , and i had a quite remarkable feeling -- you know how it feels -- � stop chattering , stop chattering , i beg you , interrupted the consul
we can not oppose you , for whatever we could say would be only sentiment , not real objections , it is very plain
placet experiri , he thought to himself , with a smile
his eyelids were usually half drooped , and he had a way of relaxing his lower jaw without opening his mouth , which gave him a flabby , resigned expression like that sometimes seen on the face of a sleeping person
ades , which both disguise the yawning void behind them and advertise it by the growing piles of rubble on the pavements
later there was supper , and he played a game of chess with his mother , at which neither side won
the proprietress of the cow-stalls , a heavy , bold-faced woman buddenbrodk in the forties , came by with a pail of milk and smiled at the gentlemen
and now he told us a story which in the most fantastic and suggestive way fitted into the frame of his present theme
in valparaiso , too , he had mostly associated with englishmen ; and his whole appearance had something english about it which somehow seemed rather appropriate
perhaps there are men who would answer like that , but they are poorspirited creatures—their women wear the breeches , if you will forgive the expression
it occurred at a week-end i was spending in pfeiffering , after the siinple meal served us in the big piano-room , when the primly clad young clementine had kindly brought us each our half-litre mug of beer , and we sat smoking zechbauer cigars , light and good
though one might have two views of the rôle he played when wrangling was the order of the day
but now they seem to have made up their minds to have that too ; and some of it they will get by moving into a house like this one
his bows were devoid of military stiffness , and you could not hear his heels click together as he made them
even the stairs widened only after the begin- ning of the mezzanine , which lay rather high above the stone entry , so that visitors and buyers - many of these came from abroad , from halle and even leipzig - had not too easy a climb to the goal of their hopes , the instrument warehouse
very good , anton , she said
i was simply too lazy to turn on the light
it became his daily task to console his cousin for the disappointment of missing the manœuvres , which were beginning in these august days
but of that which any ordinary person would call love , there was very little to be seen between the pair
when the choral was finished , herr pfiihl would slowly lift his fingers from the keyboard , so that only the bass and the fundamental would still be heard , in lingering solemnity ; and after a meaningful pause , the well-modulated voice of pastor pringsheim would rise up from under the sounding-board in the pulpit
adrian described the scene to me : the whole house , mother , daughter , gereon , maidservants and menservants , in sheer delight , laughing for pure pleasure , stood about the little man and cou ] d not gaze enough at so much loveliness
do you see it ?
when i say 'baked potatoes , she screams 'how ?
a chastened mood reigned for some time at the old house in meng street after madame gr� and her little daugh-ter returned thither to take up their abode
but the calling back of the dead , or the desirability of calling them back , was a ticklish matter , after all
by next day joachim lay in his silk dress-shirt , with flowers about him on the coverlet , looking , in the midst of all this white , more beautiful than immediately after death
i am not built on a grand scale , as you can see
funerals have something very edifying ; i always think one ought to go to a funeral instead of to church when one feels the need of being uplifted
it was three in the afternoon
but one thing they both felt : in the long second when their eyes met , all constraint , coldness , and misunderstanding melted away
yet his face burned
poor clothilde , lean and ashen , stood by the bed ; her face was apathetic , and she folded her hands in their -worsted gloves
it was an overflowing cornucopia of artistic enjoyment , ranging from grave to gay
asked krokowski , putting his head teasingly on one side
the coarse creature regaled the table with these repulsive details throughout the brief but hearty meal
there was good-natured applause , even from the bridge-tables , which had been set up and occupied by maskers , with bottles in coolers at their sides
and on a sudden felt so staunch as to allow myself a ciga- rette
why do you suddenly begin talking french ?
father , surely you can understand how painful my position is !
bookcases lined the walls , full of pamphlets and broadbacked medical works
would the gentleman like to see the young lady ?
the state of mind of the liltle elisabeth could not be fathomed
these circulars—you would like to know what they say ?
hans castorp wrenched himself out of a stealing paralysis , and flung himself once more into the breach
and he builds her a cloister , here she rules as abbess , but only for a short time
we leave marusja out of account
but there was no rest
hans castorp gave a sudden angry start
look , the child sits there listening -- would you then utterly corrupt his soul ?
the company had for the most part seated themselves on the chairs and the sofa
to delay longer would have been unfair to her , and the answering telegram announcing her arrival followed , vithout a day 's delay as i said , adrian had been told ; but it vas hard to know if he had grasped the news
job arm buddenbrook leaned back in his arm-chair quite white , with a fast-beating heart
naphta was acrimoniously debating the general tendency which led the humanist to exalt health and cry down and belittle illness
i really felt sorry for the baron
but he was uncommonly comfortable , he decided , with distinct satisfaction
herr settembrini had quite won him over with his plastic theory
those gentlemen who come as delegates from any body such as the senate , the board of trade , or the assembly of burgesses , appear in frock coats
no , kesselmeyer ; hear me out
and when you think we ’ d just finished with it and that the snow only just melted—at least , it seems that way , doesn ’ t it , as though spring were only just over—well , it gives one a turn , i will say
the whisperings had run dry , the first tension relaxed
my little daughter must not feel that people mean to urge or torment her
yet in its service , countered naphta , laboured the whole machinery by means of which the holy office freed the world of undesirable citizens
a sec- ond was necessary and inevitable after the way in which marie dismissed him the first time
well , my interlocutors did not go so far with their proposals as swift 's scholars
there was cordial applause
you have duties to your wife and sons -- my son , betsy
herr brecht told me lately that all my teeth are in a dreadful condition -- not to mention the ones that have been pulled already
i love her : but it crowns my happiness and pride to think that when she becomes mine , our firm will at the same time gain a very considerable in-crease of capital
his chin and upper lip were smooth-shaven ; he wore long , drooping side-whiskers , in the english fashion , and these adornments were conspicuously golden-yellow in colour
the poor prisoners stood with folded hands
she said softly and clearly , but that is the only thing i have refused you
but no one stopped the machine
subjectively , indeed , it , vas free , entirely so , within an objective restraint so native and incorporate that it was in no way felt as a fetter
shadow lay on half its height , but the upper half was bathed in palest rosy light
in kai- sersaschern i could have suffered it
both speakers treated their theme as of the utmost personal concern ; and both often turned , not to each other but to hans castorp , with argument and exposition , referring to their opponents with a jerk of the head or thumb
they arrived before we did , and the car did good service in pfeiffering , going to and fro several times between the little station and hof schweigestill and conveying the guests by groups , such of them , that is , as did not prefer to walk
yes , tom , said christian
his features were striking , their aristocratic character marred only by a soft , loose-lipped mouth such as i have often noticed among silesians
no , persisted hans castorp , with a violence out of proportion to the opposition he met , i insist that a dying man is above any chap that is going about and laughing and earning his living and eating his three meals a day
even in the last years of the consul 's life , his wife had more and more sympathized with his spiritual cravings ; and it now became plain that she was determined to honour the memory of her dead by adopting as her own all his pious conceptions
there was also frequent cor- respondence , an exchange , i believe every two weeks , between halle and kaisersaschern , about which adrian from time to time informed me and of which i even got to see some part
a drop of water always came in the corner of her mouth when she spoke
the offer was refused
the pupils sat drowsing in the warm room , some of them half asleep , soothed by the purring sound of the gas
my cod , ca not the senate just pardon him if it likes ?
responded the italian , and fanned himself with his handkerchief , though it was far from warm

everybody rushes to the landing , blocks up the doora to the salon , the dining-room , and the smoking-room , and peers down
do you think i might sell that instead ?
yet it is not allowed to form the end of the letter , rather some remarks about schumann , the romantic movement , chopin , are appended to it , obviously
but joachim seemed unaware of any offence in his own remark and went on , asking about matters and things in the berghof , not only without the least touch of condescension , but even rather moved by the home-coming
there followed a long prayer of thanksgiving , which the consul re-read with tear-wet eyes
long ago i said in these pages that in faustus too that letter symbol , the hetxra-esmeralda figure , first perceived by me , very often gov- erns melody and harmony : that is to say , everywhere \\there there is reference to the bond and the vow , the promise and the blood pact
that is just twaddle and the beginning of the end , that is the degenerate conception of the poets of the psalms ; with whom god is already entirely exiled into the sky , and who constantly sing of god in heaven , whereas the pentateuch does not even know it as the seat of the godhead
you mean you would mingle your mother 's inheritance with the -- savings of this lady ?
it was a pretty clumsy piece of work , i don ’ t flatter myself i hit her off very well , though we had , i suppose , twenty sittings

the fragrance from the neat beds and borders hung in the evening air , and the fountain , sur-rounded by tall pale purple iris , sent its stream gently plashing heavenward , where the first stars began to gleam
about the human skin in general , that you know so well how to paint

yet for sheer pleasure in the idea , for the joy of singing , he forced his voice and sang on , with frequent gasps for breath , until he could no more , and sank , quite out of wind , half blind , with coloured sparks before his eyes and racing pulses , beneath a sturdy pine
but then he shut the piano and cried out : oh , fie , fie !
then he would be silent -- silent a long time -- while his small deep-set eyes travelled round the room in thought
moreover the doctor to whom he went was so small in person that a practice for grown people would obviously not have been suitable and he could only have become a physician for children

what we call mourning for our dead is perhaps not so much grief at not being able to call them back as it is grief at not being able to want to do so
it was pieter peeperkorn who first spoke
my human powers of intuition told me : it had happened when dr helmut ap- proached her , as man to woman , and began to woo her
it took place just as other such which hans castorp had witnessed during his stay up here
frau senator m�ndorpf , in paroxysms of laughter , was crying out over and over again : stop , herr d�ann , stop !
a hero , he was a hero , cried she , and demanded that the erotica be played at his grave
but i hardly think that will make much difference to him -- a great lot of money would not be to his taste -- but -- what was i saying , ida ?
how he did love his tiny , warm little study !
as if the opposite of life— and we all knew what that was—was likely to be more refined than life itself !
it was early upon a magnificent october morning , sunny and fresh
for in these cases the two opposing groups of instincts—the compulsive force of love , and the sum of the impulses urging in the other direction , among which he would particularly mention shame and disgust—both exhibited an extraordinary and abnormal height and intensity when measured by the ordinary bourgeois standards ; and the conflict between them which took place in the abysses of the soul prevented the erring instinct from attaining to that safe , sheltered , and civilized state which alone could resolve its difficulties in the prescribed harmonies of the love-life as experienced by the average human being
and yet a shudder went through me when di- vined - divined very clearly - that he had made his choice out of { arrogance

again brahms 's first as piece de resistance - again the 'tenth sym- phony ' ?

he experienced them , as it were ; he did not know them beforehand
the cousins resumed their visits to settembrini and naphta and their walks with those two devoted opponents
what a con-trast between that relaxed and suffering facr and the elegant , almost military style , of his hair and beard !

the fish would nrrlainly be fresh , for the most of them were still alive
i can not help feeling astonished at you , tom
yes , tom ; such is my firm determination
thomas buddenbrook , though still a little pale , was strikingly elegant
he was speaking of count strelitz and the landed aristocracy , and he had expressed the view that the producer had a social advantage over the middleman

russian government official , in some distant province , daghestan , you know , out beyond the caucasus , he was ordered there
but i will tell you something : take any general principle or conception of life
the thermometer showed a few degrees above freezing , but the snow lay a foot deep , and a completely wintry landscape spread itself before hans castorp ’ s astonished eyes
he felt as often after a colloquy with settembrini and naphta , only to a far greater degree : dazed and tipsy , giddy , a-tremble with excitement
no failure on the prac- tical side can decrease this pleasure , especially when a good part of it consists in the disappointment
you will feel the cold less on account of the dryness of the air and the absence of wind
he was slightly thick-set as to figure , but neither fat nor lean
there were only two candles left when the elder turned again to his son , whom he could hardly see at the far end of the room
our ears are wrapped about by the great mild , ample wind , that comes sweeping untrammelled blandly through space , and gently blunts our senses
the spirit of the inventor of the master and servant notes and of musical hymn-recitation moves ghostlike in it
hanno buddenbrook was called up and could not do a line
i have no time
his marriage seemed not to have improved his health
so much is clear
how can anybody tell who she looks like yet ?
the tall white door , with the relief of the singing cupids above it , was scarcely closed for a moment ; there wag a constant vinw from within of the great staircase , upon which the light streamed down from the sky-light far above , and of the stairs themselves , full of guests cither entering or taking their leave
hans castorp stopped until far into the night in his balcony above the ensorcelled
why , in three weeks
gathered in a little group behind mynheer peeperkorn , frau chauchat surrounded by the five gentlemen , they stood and looked into the surging waters
if we sit on the benches we can be seen from outside
and yet there was something here - that elfin mockery seemed to express a consciousness of it - which put it out of one 's power to believe in time and time 's common work , or its action upon this pure and precious being
all the bud-denbrooks wrote a fine , flowing hand ; but these tall straight letters were full of heavy strokes , and many of the words were hastily underlined
long , long have i sought after this word , in the place where hippe appeared to me , in my loggia , everywhere
do his authorities stand for it ?
with all the pleasure in life
for then the others were undone , then they were cast in the shade , then they drew in their horns , and peeperkorn came out , grasped the sceptre , arranged , decided , settled
no one was here to blow a warning to the rash one—unless , indeed , herr settembrini , with his farewell shout at hans castorp ’ s disappearing back , had been that man
tony , he said suddenly , getting up and slapping his hand on the arm of his chair , you are not going to make a scandal !
they apologetically conveyed it back to its station , and rebuked the chinaman

he seemed unaware that he did this , nor did the other give sign of remarking it

every now and then a tall , smiling white figure seemed to step momentarily out of the tapestry and then back again
the same commaunde myselfe would keepe , and me insure my seemely slepe
he took the grain distillation between thumb and middle finger , and held it toward the light
i have always stuck to that
he knew it as veil as i did
nor am i for little naphta either , or his religion , that is only a guazzabuglio of god and the devil , good and evil , to the end that the individual soul shall plump into it head first , for the sake of mystic immersion in the universal

there was a very great failure in the supply of sunshine , an element so important in the cures achieved up here that without it they were distinctly retarded
madame chauchat had put on a thin dust-cloak belted in at the back , but wore no hat
alj this was pretty awful , and i take it adrian must have thought so too , though his pride prevented him from exposing his teacher
for the sake of the inner continuity it would be better , so he said to himself , to bring with him into the new situ- ation a remnant of the old occupation , and only to fix the inward eye on something new when the outward new should have be- come routine

schild- knapp distinguished himself by knowing the names of this or that ridge or wall
it even produces a certain in- clination to silence , to the extinction of speech ; but schwerdt- feger 's dresden upbringing did not tolerate any pauses

the witch makes her little bitch fast for two days , and then gives it bread spread with mustard to eat , which causes the little animal to shed copious tears
apparently his irritation over it was one of the reasons why he would not give his father the satisfaction of wiping out the stain in the person of his son , for he had frustrated the elder 's hope of seeing the younger a member of government
the nimble lame man attended to tickets and luggage
some day even the story itself will come to an end
the thing concerns all of us , and the disgrace will fall on us too ; for weinschenk belongs to the family and eats at our table

she raised her eyebrows and looked severely through her pince-nez -- which she nnw used for sewing , but never managed to put on straight -- at her knitting-needles
why else indeed should he be here ?
there is no thematic conception there as god gave it
the old dutchmen made her do the rummest sort of tricks , to the glory of god ; and it went harder and harder on her from all one hears , with no sense appeal , excogitated by pure calculation
bitter , bitter was the weird of our young man , who had borne out the long waiting only to be gulled at the end

he was pale , and the blue veins stood out on his narrow temples , from which the hair went back in two bays

for gerda was taking nothing with her -- she was going away as she had come

in the family , justus krbger was the first to mention the approaching event , on the thursday afternoon ; and frau permaneder saw to it that the venerable leather portfolio was solemnly brought out after dessert was cleared away , and the whole family , by way of foretaste , perused the dates and events in the life of the first johann buddenbrook , hanno 's great-great-grand-father : when he had varioloid and when genuine smallpox , when he fell out of the third-storey window on to the floor of the drying-house , and when he had fever and delirium -- she read all that aloud with pious fervour
then she returned to her papa and her cousin , her mental resources being exhausted

the youth with the voluptuous lips , sitting at frau salomon ’ s feet , turned his head upwards to talk with her , while behind them the thin-haired pianist directed his unchanging gaze down the back of her neck
did herr naphta realize what it was he denied and disavowed in the presence of youth , when he flung god and the devil together and in the name of this mad two-inoneness refused to admit the existence of an ethical principle ?

on two occasions he refined yet further
almost all jews are , very musical , but also she had , though with- out any extensive reading , much purer and more fastidious rela- tions with the german language than the national average , yes , than most of the learned

joachim indeed , when he stood or sat by his cousin for ten or fifteen minutes—and that happened ten times in the course of the day—would relate whatever there was of interest or variation in the daily life of the community ; and hans castorp ’ s questions , whenever he put any , had been of a general nature

he rose in his place and was about to utter some forlorn and absurd excuse to the effect that he had forgotten to study the lines , when he became aware that the boy ahead of him was offering him his open book
there was nothing surprising about that—it was of a piece with its fastidiousness in the matter of corporal punishment
there was not a sound but the rustling of the consul 's papers and the falling rain outside
down here the fundamental conception is lacking
a meeting was called
they would bring the conversation round to the subject of coiffures : the frau consul was capable of saying , in the blandest way , that she always wore her hair very simply , whereas it was plain to any one gifted by god with intelligence , and certainly to the misses buddenbrook , that the immutable red-blonde hair under the old lady 's cap could no longer by any stretch be called her hair

so they walked and kept silence between them upon all such unseemly natural concerns
mother schweigestill 's description of him was amusingly justified by his easy manner and refreshing lightness of touch
here he lay , at whom once christiari had flung the reproach that he was too heartless to iveep at h brother 's death

their spirits , particularly the sallow frau magnus ’ s , were proof against any ray of cheer ; forlornity exhaled from her like damp from a cellar ; even more than frau stöhr she represented that unedifying union of dullness and disease , which had offended hans castorp ’ s soul—under correction from herr settembrini
the cousins were sitting on a bench at the end of the garden , in front of a semicircle of young firs
but the senator sat apparently at ease
he would not have listened to it from one of you
and seeming to have forgotten rudolf
is gorgeously builded , my leipzig , of clear stone as out of a costly box of toy bricl , : : s the common peo- ples tongue is a devilishiy lewd speech so that one srinks before ever ) t booth before one bargains
we come out of the dark and go into the dark again , and in between lie the experiences of our life
there was another factor which added to clarissa 's emotional confusion
the mythological fantasy made me think of the sting or shot-wound of the chrys
eat your breakfast , my child , said the frau consul
for the moment we need only recall the swift flight of time—even of a quite considerable period of time—which we spend in bed when we are ill all the days are nothing but the same day repeating itself—or rather , since it is always the same day , it is incorrect to speak of repetition ; a continuous present , an identity , an everlastingness—such words as these would better convey the idea
you must show what you are made of , herr dieckmann , added the consul
a dinner is so soothing
you know , there is now and then one among them who does not treat the merchant classes with any great respect , though perfectly aware that he ca not do without them
in kitchen and cellar every-thing was tip-top , and he himself was considered a most courteous and tactful host , whose toasts were wittier than the common run
the father of all human beings , who had sent a part of himsplf npnn earlh to suffer and bleed for our sins , and who , on ihe final day , would come to judge the quick and the dead ; at whose feet the justified , in the course of the eternity then beginning , would br recompensed for the sorrows they had borne in mis vale of tears , yes , he strove'to subscribe to the whole confused unconvincing story , which required no intelligence , only obedient credulity ; and which , when the last anguish came , would sustain one in a firm and child-like faith -- � but would it , really ?
surely he knew the answer to his question ; as surely it could not be put in words
hans castorp would think of him when , before very long , it came to an upset in that country
both sisters had confidence in ne ; that is , they seemed to consider ine capable of just evaluations of others , a capacity , of course , which , if it is to inspire full confidence , must stand outside any situation and view it with unclouded eye
hans castorp asked , inclining his head in answer
the principal warks af thomas mann
thus for the third time in so short a space and in such young years did death play upon the spirit and senses—but chiefly on the senses—of the lad
he half lay , half sat , on the chaise-longue , tying and untying his sailor 's knot , and his eyes , raving aimlessly about , caught sight of an open portfolio on his mother 's nut-wood writing-table
if hans castorp wanted to do himself a good turn before he entered his post at tunder and wilms ’ s , what more natural than that he should go up to davos and keep his poor cousin company for a while—it would be agreeable on both sides
then the mistress of the house and her guest sat alone in the family living- roon
no little reading was done , in the rest-halls and private loggias of the international sanatorium berghof ; largely , however , by the new-comers and short-timers , for the patients of many months ’ or years ’ standing had long learned to kill time without mental effort or means of distraction , by dint of a certain inner virtuosity they came to possess
we must proceed to extraction , fraulein , he would say , growing pale
and a man-servant would be so useful for errands and so on
the senator gave away the bride , supported by christian 's friend senator cieseke , and two school friends of erica 's acted as bridesmaids
whoever is in that state can not wish not to be , it would be like wishing not to live , because it has bound itself up with life
quite exactly , no metaphors
i shall be forgiven for an argument more or less into the blue ; but to call soullessness the yearning for a soul- the yearning of the little sea-maid - that is what i would characterize as barbarism , as inhumanity !
it was tante isabeau whom ru- dolf met when he entered the little vestibule of the pension
the consul took her hand , bowed to his son-in-law , and moved with her toward the hall door
we say wilfully because his eyes were open , he was aware that reason and good sense were against it
he knew now tbaf the man in the worsted coat was right , and that thev would , in very truth , begin again where they had left off , and go on to this and that
his tiny hands play among the gilt trimmings of his nurse 's waist ; his head , in a lace cap trimmed with pale blue ribbons , lies sidewise on the pillow , turned heedlessly away from the preacher ; he stares out into the room , at all his relatives , with an old , knowing look
standing and walking , he rather stuck out his abdomen , which hardly made an athletic impression ; but his bearing at table was beyond cavil
young man , kiss this lovely woman good-night , upon her brow , said he to hans castorp
dh , do not be embarrassed
but they have both in themselves , i retorted ; otherwise they could not have exhibited both of them
above her head , over the door , was a transparency , garlanded with evergreen , that said glory to god in the highest
no , my dear mother , i am not asking a written answer to this letter , for i am leaving to-morrow
but as little as those at home did we understand what that meant
but now little johann was no longer small
oh , we should never be transplanted , we northern folk !
it is not very large , but it is a glacier right enough , the skaletta
he had mutton-chop whiskers that looked as though they had been dressed with gold paint
she held her stunted figure stiffly erect , tapped vigilantly on the table , cried nally or babby , and subdued mile
they are young -- so much the better
it was not found among the papers leverkiihn left
he accepted the invitation almost before she gave it , with such alacrity that it was plain he had expected it
nowadays , when hans castorp relieved his mind , he did not hem and haw , become involved and stick in the middle
i dn not understand your tone
if they had been put him , he would have tapped his forehead with the tips of his fingers , and most certainly not have known—a phenomenon as disquieting as his incapacity to answer herr settembrini , that long-ago first evening , when the latter had asked him his age
that diseases , plagues , epidemics have to do with the position of the stars was to those times an intuitive certainty
no , i still have much on my heart about it and about certain of its characteristics , which - of course with undeviating admiration - disturbed and depressed me , or , better put , absorbed my attention even while they disturbed my mind
hans castorp started ; looked at joachim , joachim at him
lord , herr consul , ye knaw what that is
his parents took the little coffin with them , back to their home
and joachim ’ s diaphragm rose quivering , as high as it could ; the upper pans of the lungs could be seen to clear up , but the hofrat was not satisfied
a key- basket stood beside her
i am not de-ceiving you , he repeated , in the greatness of his need
naturellement , you think i have in mind your ferocious discipline , and que vous enchalnez votre art dans un systeme de regles inexorables et neo-classiques , forcing it to move in these iron bands - if not with grace , yet with boldness and esprit
kesselmeyer , you have sat at my table -- oh , be quiet with your table !
that nobility is comprehended in the mind , in the reason , and therefore you will level against me in vain the reproach of christian obscurantism— hans castorp demurred
her passion was betting ; she staked against the gentlemen every conceivable object upon every conceivable subject : the weather , the dishes at dinner , the result of the monthly examination , the prescribed length of stay of this or that person , the champions in the skating , sleighing , bob-racing , and skiing competitions , the duration of this or that amour among the guests of the cure , and a hundred other , often quite indifferent or trifling subjects
she remained alone with her husband
so you have thrown yourself into a career of benevolence ?
jealousy -- tnp word meant action : mistaken , crazy , wrong action , perhaps , but at least action , energetic , fearless , and conclusive
she is greeting her table—you really ought to look , it is so refreshing to see her !
nikolaus , a widower - his rife died young - had up to adrian 's coming lived alone in the house with an old-established house- keeper , frau butze , a maid , and a young italian from brescia , named luca cimabue ( he did actually bear the family name of the thirteenth-century painter of madonnas ) , who was his assist- ant and pupil at the trade of violin-making ; for uncle leverkiihn also made violins
for he was by nature and temperament passive , could sit without occupation hours on end , and loved , as we know , to see time spacious before him , and not to have the sense of its passing banished , wiped out or eaten up by prosaic activity
he has short , curly blond hair and a smooth- shaven , bony face , with a somewhat theatrical range of ex- pression , from fanatical zeal to an exalted serenity
but he knows that that hour , four weeks ago , was a desperate one for mother and child ; and he bends tenderly over gerda , who reclines in an easy-chair in front of him , next his mother , her feet , in patent-leather shoes , crossed before her on a velvet cushion
but he disturbed none of the traditional customs of the house
they drew obscene pictures on pieces of paper , passed them about , and laughed at them greedily
no longer of the youngest , already far on in the fifties , he applied himself to worl { out a musical theory of his own , suited to his special requirements
it was hard , clavdia , even for a man phlegmatic in his passions
i find that in the last -- degree -- funny !
a god invented it , and with its invention civilization began
and the senator retorted with scorn , and with threats which he regretted a moment later
as if we did not owe to the monks the culture of the soil of all europe !
it was not joachim ’ s fault that their glances failed to meet , hers swerved aside
but make haste , or we shall get nothing hot to eat
that was the expression of dr gieseke -- andreas gieseke , the son of the fire com-missioner and christian 's old schoolmate
may i not see my ward ?
i have made great mistakes , you know
oh , there are a host more such titles in the upper reaches of the knights templars
it does one good , among such impressive performances , to con- tribute something oneself to the artistic entertainment , and i was gratified when excellence von riedesel , seconded at once by our long-legged elegant hostess , urged me in his south-german pro- nunciation , and voice made more strident by his officer 's training , to repeat the andante and minuet of milandre ( ) which i had once before played on my seven strings
a confused nation , he persisted , and bewildering for the others
but now he himself was the object of her visit
her person formed the chief subject of conversation on the bourse , at the club , at the theatre , and in society
homme gate , endurci comme moi , c'est toujours une experience touchante de rencontrer un grand homm ' c
it must be decided to-day -- but what shall i say , ida , when he aska me ?
he tried desperately to escape ; knocked into a column with his shoulder—and found himself , with the sound of that dreadful whispered brawling still in his ears , still wrapped in the cold horror of it , lying by his hut , in the snow , leaning against one arm , with his head upon it , his legs in their skis stretched out before him
it is , by god 's will , a daughter ; i can find no words to express my joyful emotion
i had my suspicions—i can tell you now—from the first day i had the undeserved honour of making your acquaintance ; i made a pretty shrewd guess that you were one of us and that you would find it out , like many another who has come up here on a lark and gone about with his nose in the air , only to discover , one fine day , that it would be as well for him—and not only as well , mark that—to make a more extended stay , quite without reference to the beauties of the scenery
i must dwell a little on this i point , and the sweeping gesture ac- companying it , this putting at the disposal of
but from this your school deduces in the first instance the right of the people to revolt from the monarchy
he did not buddenbrook look like the semmlingers , having a yellow face and pointed teeth with wide spaces between
he ’ s even austere ; he makes one feel rather uncomfortable , as if you were—well , shall i say as if you were being taken to task ?
once , at a certain critical juncture now far in the past , he had made its action serve him for an allegory
thomas buddenbrodk took a solitary early breakfast in bis pretty dining-room
he was unusually pale , of a translucent , yes , phosphorescent pallor , that was further accentuated by the dark ardour of his eyes , the blackness of his brows , and his rather long , full whisker , which ended in two points and already showed some white threads
thomas buddenbrook would sit at his desk and watch until he saw his wife 's friend enter the house
as they went along the corridor , hans castorp saw , beside two of the white-enamelled , numbered doors , certain curious , swollen-looking , balloonshaped vessels with short necks
for a long , dreadful minute she lay among the pillows as if stunned , as if paralysed
he made the duty calls which his position demanded ; but the buddenbrook house was the only one at which he visited -- too much , people thought , and the senator himself thought so too
and hans castorp took in a deep , experimental breath of the strange air
now , for a change , he was going downhill , with the wind in his face , when , at some distance before him , and seeming to hang in the driving wind and mist , he saw the faint outline of a human habitation
like that , he said , and gave his place to hans castorp , who assumed the same position
he remained the rest of the day in this condition , this heavy lethargy and intoxication , overpowered by the heady draught he had drunk , incapable of thought
how often had naphta not stood for instinct , what time settembrini called nature a blind force , mere factum et fatum , before which reason and human pride must never abdicate !
with tony and gerda here we ca not really talk -- but i have already told you i have responsibilities -- the last child , little gisela -- i know nothing about any little gisela -- and i do not care to
we have been waiting nearly half an hour already
he stood before her and found no words
hans castorp saw clavdia ’ s traveling-companion as he lay under the red satin coverlet , in his collarless woollen shirt , half ancient ouvrier , half royal bust
very good , said the master , when he had finished
you know i should not make a good bachelor
christian appeared not to notice the growing dislike of the head of the firm
we need not pity him , for was it not all his own doing ?
in the salon she looked thirstily at a long-legged , sunken-chested gallant , who described himself on his visiting-card as aviateur diplomé et enseigne de la marine allemande
i shall do well to leave the word entirely to him , since whatever adrian or i interpolated or replied played scarcely any role
he shows good taste , does not he , this canting money-grabber ?
if you bring me that much back , that the thought of shar- ing my life with me is not utterly repugnant to her , not exactly monstrous - then my turn will come and i will speak 'with her and her aunt myself
cer- tainly specimens of the race have also crossed my path - i need only think of the private scholar breisacher in munich , on whose dismayingly unsympathetic character i propose in the proper place to cast some light
adrian spoke of the itch one felt to expose the unexposed , to look at the unlooked-at , the not-to-be and not-expecting-to-be looked-at
what i meant to ask you , he began , the case in my room had died just before i got here ; have there been many deaths , since you came ?
in uninter- rupted application he provided with musical settings all the poems in the mount of incense , some of them with two or three , and set to music all the hymns he had himself ever written , as well as a great many by his pupils
but the broad mantle of civic respectability concealed this side of their life
little johann said he would
la conférence de m krokowski vient de commencer
monkey , little , merry fellow , thou art nature 's punuhinellu there were endless verses -- kassbaum read them , quite simply , out of his book
you mean he is pedantic
i do not know whether any of you have that feeling
it was the same with satan himself
on the contrary , i am pitiful of that i make mine own , and ye may see in that an homage , a declaration of love for music , a special position towards her , that in her case i should feel quite too deeply pitiful
my cousin and i were talking about it lately
then he sipped his sweet wine gingerly and listened to uncle christian , who had begun to talk
and so once more the patient } s familiar sur- roundings received him
how incapable he was of not keeping it !
the noble foam bedewed the cloth
the suits he made for the young masters buddenbrook were at the combined cost of seventy marks ; but at the boys ' request he had consented to put them down in the bill at eighty marks and to hand them the difference
'they have got at the silver , wunderlich !
if you knew the girl and the spirit of our bond , then you would know that there is no need to fear for my peace of mind , but that on the contrary everything is directed towards the foundation of love and tranquillity , a fixed and undisturbed hap- piness
what shall i take , papa ?
that first utterance which the society of a catholic theologian had tempted from him was—however comparative and analytical in form—in substance a declaration of affection for the roman church , as a power at once spiritual and aristocratic ( in other words anti-material ) , at once superior and inimical to worldly things ( in other words , revolutionary )
settembrini spoke of his grandfather , a milanese lawyer , but even more a patriot ; with something of the political agitator , and orator and journalist to boot
but he paid no heed
adrian might be cer- tain that elsbeth leverkiihn bore this loss with the same quiet resignation , the same understanding acceptance of the human lot , as lvlother schvveigestill showed
i have referred to his feeling of independence
schildknapp , with a reflective head-shake , even thought that one ought to set- tle down and live here ; but frau sch\\leigestill had her doubts whether it would not be too lonely for a writer , too far fronl life and culture
the place above in the left lobe is no longer worth talking about
shaving had grown burdensome to him , for some eight or ten days it had not been done , and he had now a strong growth of beard , setting off with a black frame his waxen face and gentle eyes
we were lewd enough , i do assure you ; but too high-brow too , as they say in english
the younger children were mentioned , and the consul spoke of them with easy satisfaction , shrugging his shoulders
she swept him with an astonished and deeply offended glance
he had left his uniform at home , of course
at the most he would have allowed it to suggest itself afar off , in some subtly disguised , almost ilnperceptible way
madame antoinette buddenbrook , born duchamps , tittered in precisely the same way as her husband
now , as then , it mortified hans castorp
a catarrhal condition due to alcoholism—and from what i can see he is threatened with tropical fever , malignant , intermittent , you know ; protracted , obstinate
later , perhaps , a certain sinister but strong desire of his , since gratified , had sharpened it the more and confirmed it in its general tendency to question and to carp
asked the pilot-captain , as tony and morten both rose from table and were about to take their leave
but , if you will permit me to say so , i can hardly subscribe to your deductions ; i must deny them ; my position is one of absolute dissent
never had i felt more strongly the advantage that music , which says nothing and everything , has over the unequivocal word ; yes , the saving irresponsibility of all art , compared with the bareness and baldness of unmediated revelation
the great man ’ s face was yellow , the eyes pale beneath the forehead ’ s heavy folds , a bitter expression sat on the wounded lips
so behrens brought him up with a round turn : do me the favour not to behave like that , he said to him ; and the patient became quite calm and died as quietly as you please
the experienced frau permaneder made several energetic attempts to get into touch with him , in order , as she importantly explained , to get evidence upon which to sue him for divorce on the ground of wilful desertion
hans castorp raised his arms , to signify that there was so much written , on both sides , it was hard to know the rights of it
in a civil court , to pronounce upon matters of life and death , communicate the will of god to man , and decide the course of history ! —well , so much for the wings of doves
afterwards they gave out that she had died , and her funeral toolc place , but actually she escaped to martinique and there married a frenchman
after he had had the goodness to carry out the second puncture with his own hands , he took a dignified leave and did not return
and i soon came to the speech of that one , the make-bate , the losel , in the italian room , have held much parley with him , and he had much to tell me of the quality , fundament , and substance of hell
he too , like his grandson , had always been in the opposition ; though he had been able to perform his rôle upon a larger stage than had ludovico
but it was all just like consul buddenbrook : a little pretentious , not like his forebears
i-lis playing was neat and cultivated t his tone not large , but of beautiful sweetness and technically not a little brilliant
yet after all , this adaptation took place more rapidly than one might have thought possible ; for was not time up here at the berghof arranged and organized to the end that one should get very rapidly used to things , even if the getting used consisted chiefly in getting used to not getting used ?
don ’ t talk to me about your cousin
behrens would like to persuade him ; but the doctor ’ s interest in the matter was single , whereas his own seemed equivocal ; he was not at all clear that he would not do better just to die in peace , with his ribs intact
only certes i should suffer the knives of pain therefor , even in the time , as the jittle sea-maid suffered thetn in her legs , which was my sister and sweet bride , and named hyphialta
my fury at the obscene prank of that small-beer schleppfuss knew no bounds - yet it was an impersonal fury , no evidence at all of prudishness in myself
the members of a certain sect , and even other persons of devout and serious character , submitted to flagellation in order that the spiritual impulse might be strengthened
you consider it necessary ?
i knew it , once
his delivery contributed to the effect , for it was entirely calculated to impress the young
now just tell me thi : is herr mantel-sack the sort of person one ought to be afraid of ?
you do know il , do not you ?
herr settembrini , for instance , that time when the weakness of the flesh had prevented him from attending the congress for the advancement of civilization at barcelona , ought to have had a saint elizabeth at his side— !
gerda had lifted her head from her work , and thomas , startled , looked at his sister
i know too well what i owe to you and to myself within these walls
ye would visit me deliberately here in italy of all places , where you are entirely out of your sphere and not on the peasant tongue at all ?
either the experience of death must be the last experience of life , or else it must be a bugaboo , pure and simple
we met these two young ones , the doctor and i -- he pointed to tom and christian , in their blue tunics and leather belts -- in king street , coming home from school
'oh , do not mention it -- i have been sitting for some time !
if a thing has size , one can not call it vice
sucl a llobilization for war , however stern and grim a face it wears , must always have something about it like an unlicensed holiday ; however unreserv- edly one 's duty , it seems a little like playing truant , like running away , like yielding to unbridled instinct
but don ’ t overdo it , he said ; that ’ s my advice
ran through him like tidings of great joy
they talked about business , the business of each one of those present ; but even this subject roused no great enthusiasm
i have convinced myself that it is not possible
on my side , let me make you an honourable declaration
i am alone with myoid helene , who cares for my physical part , and to whom sometimes i read aloud from my
when did you come ?
he may regard the general , impersonal foundations of his existence as definitely settled and taken for granted , and be as far from assuming a critical attitude toward them as our good hans castorp really was ; yet it is quite conceivable that he may none the less be vaguely conscious of the deficiencies of his epoch and find them prejudicial to his own moral well-being
his facial expression was of one with something bad-tasting in his mouth , and he ate without a word
my god , breathed frau schönfeld at him , what a tan this demon has—he gets it from the helio—it makes him look like a hunter of eagles !
wasn ’ t it the most utter bourgeoisiedom , the sheerest utilitarian philistinism , to make truth depend on the interest of mankind ?
he had been successful in the past , but was that not because of the enthusiasm and impetus drawn from reflection ?
the snow where it had been shovelled was melting and settling ; the paths were beginning to be slushy ; the friends wore their overshoes
the glass improvised inexhaustibly of the pangs of birth and the first kiss of lovers ; the crown of sorrows , the fatherly goodness of god ; plunged into the mysteries of creation , lost itself in other times and lands , in interstellar space ; even mentioned the chaldeans and the zodiac ; and would most certainly have gone on all night , if the conspirators had not finally taken their fingers from the glass , and expressing their gratitude to holger , told him that must suffice them for the time , it had been wonderful beyond their wildest dreams , it was an everlasting pity there had been no one at hand to take it down , for now it must inevitably be forgotten , yes , alas , they had already forgotten most of it , thanks to its quality , which made it hard to retain , as dreams are
but all the various conversations around the table flowed together in one stream when jean jacques hoffstede embarked upon his favourite theme , and began to describe the italian journey which he had taken fifteen years before with a rich hamburg relative
is it possible for any human being to disregard his love ?
others are transmitted by a freedom movement christened wenvolf : -a band of raving-mad lads who hide in the woods and break out nightly ; they have already deserved well of the fatherland by many a gallant murder of the invaders
rosaline , as the lover never tires of portraying her , is the dark lady of the second sonnet sequence , elizabeth 's maid of honour , shakespeare 's love , who betrayed him with the lovely youth
leverktihn , surrounded by the women , schildknapp , helene , and myself , had sat down at the brown square piano and flattened the pages of the score , vith his right hand
regardless of his programme , hans castorp devoured her , with his sleep-weary eyes
you will see , everything uaii be put right by a gdod marriage
however , it seemed fairly clear that dr ting-fu was right
the affair at the schlaginhaufens ' was not a dinner but a nine- o'clock evening company with a buffet in the dining-room next the salon
so then i learned that it , vas often thus
but the decline , the falling-off , the begin-ning of the end
it was only an episode , preceded by others ( he had worked as conductor in small state theatres in the reich and switzerland ) and followed certainly by others still
dr faustus willingly , said she ; only too bad my maxi ( that was herr schweigestill ) is out on the farm with gereon , that 's our son , they wanted to try a new manure-spreader gereon bought , so the gentlemen will have to make do with me
with the easy adaptability of youth , which suits itself to any environment , hans castorp had begun to imitate this indifference
herr hugo weinschenk spent eight or ten days doing nothing but smoking : then he began to read the papers and write letters
but a la longue they bored me
three steps from the door he trod on a cracker of such exceptional quality that it made a noise like dynamite
frankness for frankness : something shrinks together inside me , it makes me squirm when you use the word as you do use it in ref- erence to yourself
and hans castorp ’ s case was scarcely of such severity as to give him any special claim to attention
the camp thou hast left before the battle
the two spent twelve days in stately domesticity in the dix- huitieme salons and apartments of castle tolna , in drives through the princely estate and along the gay shores of the plattensee , attended by an obsequious retinue , some of whom were turks
i never go to sleep properly

i left kaiser- saschern and settled with wife and child at the edge of the isar , in this dignified city , seat of a bishopric for hundreds of years , where with the exception of some months during the war i have passed my own life in convenient touch with the capital and also with my friend , and shared , in love and solicitude , the stresses and the tragedy of his
is that you , good soul ?
it is the revocation
this it was which since yesterday had filled him as if with a heady , in-toxicating draught , had worked in his heart in the darkness of the night and roused him like a budding love !
they also invited the numis- matist dr kranich , schildknapp , rudi schwerdtfeger , and my- self ; but not zink and spengler , nor the little theatre people who had been clarissa 's colleagues
romans xiii : 'for there is no power but of god : the powers that be are ordained of god
time had moved steadily on , and brought more than one change in its train
adrian 's own family had been settled for several generations at buchel , a farm belonging to the village comillunity of oberweiler , near weissenfels , whence one was fetched by 'wagon after a three- quarters-hour journey by train from kaisersaschern
but she only whispered , kissing all three of them , for jesus christ 's sake -- and my blessed jean 's
he went up quickly , skipping a step in his usual way
hans castorp , thus slapped on the mouth , had to look on while ferge brought out the fatal étui from beneath his cloak , and handed one pistol to wehsal to pass on to naphta
you don ’ t mean to say the man is a jesuit !
it was a day like its predecessor : cold , mist , wind
so full of horror and rebellion , and anguish , and—well , perfectly indescribable
her pribislav eyes glided rapidly down his figure , as he sat there one knee over the other , with a deliberate insouciance which had all the effect of scorn ; they paused for a space upon his yellow boots , and then carelessly , with perhaps a smile in their depths , withdrew
he pushed his chair up to hers and stroked her hair , in an effort to console her
he said annthrr time there is a ship of our line being launched to-day , and i shall christen it
but in the long run , pretty stupid , is not it ?
for just as little as one understands the new and the young , without being at home in the traditional , just so must love for the old remain ungenuine and sterile if one shut oneself away from the new , which with historical inevita- bility grows out of it
but now we are all experts , all critics : we note that the idea is nothing new , that it all too much reminds us of something in rimsky-korsakov or brahms
and senator buddenbrook agreed
i will look after the tea , said tony gr� , and wait for you in the dining-room
imagine , he said to himself , he talks about irony just as he does about music , he ’ ll soon be telling us that it is politically suspect—that is , from the moment it ceases to be a direct and classic device of oratory
we have not it -- where should we get twenty-five thousand marks from , i should liks to know ?
at that moment the glass door on the left slammed shut , with a rattle and ringing of glass ; he did not start as he had on the first occasion , but only made a grimace of lazy disgust ; when he wished to turn his head , he found the effort too much for him—it was really not worth while
but also you are an at- tractive case , that i freely admit
i sha not have any mercy !
heart-piercing moving to the last—very
for then herr wenzel , barber and member of the assembly , appeared , with his in-telligent face and his red hands , his razors and other tools , and the basin of warm water which he had fetched from the kitchen ; and the consul sat in a reclining-chair and leaned his head back , and herr wenzel began to make a lather ; and there ensued almost always a conversation that began with the weather and how you had slept the night beforr , wpnt on to politics and the great world , thence to domestic aflaiis in the city itself , and closed in an intimate and familiar key on business and family matters
and at the directors ' meeting of the buchen railway yesterday , consul hagenstrbm simply talked me down , refuted my con-tentions , nearly made me appear ridiculous
and now he ’ s come to this
c ’ est à dire : en faisant ton portrait !
for some years now she had believed that each christmas was her last ; and she strove with all the powers at her command to give a depart- ing brilliance to the feast that was held in her small over-heated rooms
but a narrative which concerned itself with the events of five minutes , might , by extraordinary conscientiousness in the telling , take up a thousand times five minutes , and even then seem very short , though long in relation to its imaginary time
the family feeling which led him to cherish the past history of his house extended itself even more strongly into its future ; and he was influenced , too , by the loving and expectant curiosity concentrated upon his son by his family am ] his friends and acquaintances , even by the buddenbrook ladies in broad street
it must have been a frightful onslaught
for within , in the salon , there is a flower-decked small table , serving as an altar , with a young priest in black vestments and a stiff snowy ruff like a millstone round his neck , reciting the service ; and there is a great , strapping , particu-larly well-nourished person , richly arrayed in red and gold , bearing upon her billowing arms a small something , half smothered in laces and satin bows : an heir -- a first-born son !
what are you doing here ?
then he drew a deep breath and sat up
they did not judge or criticize like col leagues ; their comments were meant to annihilate , to leave their author alone in the field
two years up here , and still capable of such projects—ah , yes , your heart is sound , no need to despair of you
that 's the wife 's work
the roller , provided vvith metal tongues , turned along the tuned teeth of a comb and played , at first briskly and daintily , then slowly running down , three well-harmonized , demure little tinkling melodies , to which echo listened always with the same rapt attention , the same unforgettable mixture of delight , surprise , and dreamy musing
all i have to look out for is the dowry of my ward
the notice of the bridge party was attracted , the players were drawn by curiosity and came up holding their cards fan-shaped in their hands
sometimes , too , little buddenbrook was allowed to sit up with the organist at the sunday service in st mary 's -- which was quite a different matter from stopping below with the other people , in the nave
wherever he went , he suspected , he gibed , he vented his spleen ; in short , his days were filled with hunting out and hounding down all his fellow-creatures who did not possess that inestimable advantage which was the only one he had
a man may have a simple , childlike temperament ; but mu- sic is the mysterious revelation of the highest wisdom , a divine service , and the profession of music-teacher a priestly office
there was an uneasy stillness for some time
resembled was not the word : they were the same eyes
inez walked this road , of course with the cordial approval of her mother , and came to grief , as her sister did on hers
dr grabow came once more , to see that everything was being done
for years back , ever since father 's death , the whole back part has been going to pieces
they both have their good sides ; what i have against settembrini ’ s—the free-thinking line—is that he seems to imagine it has a corner in human dignity
then the carriage rolled along castle street and over the koberg , crossed broad street , and braked down the steep de-cline of fishers ' lane
this giant lamento ( it lasts an hour and a quarter ) is very cer- tainly non-dynamic , lacking in development , without drama , in the same way that concentric rings made by a stone thrown into water spread ever farther , without drama and always the saine
there lay the broad meadows , with the coneshaped summit of the schwarzhorn towering in the background , still in snow , and close in on the right the snow-buried skaletta glacier
disease and death as nobility , life and health as vulgarity—what a doctrine whereby to hold fast the neophyte to the service of humanity !
it is in the family papers
the elder kr� was bolt upright , enthroned between madame antoinette and frau senator langhals , dividing his pet jokes and his flourishes between the two ladies
turned into swiss currency , this was so advantageous that he had never spent one instalment when the next arrived , enclosed in a letter of a few typed lines signed james tienappel , conveying his greetings and best wishes for recovery , together with the same from grand-uncle tienappel and sometimes from the seafaring peter as well
not for an instant
from the rugged slopes came the sound of cowbells ; the peaceful , simple , melodious tintinnabulation came floating unbroken through the quiet , thin , empty air , enhancing the mood of solemnity that broods over the valley heights
i can still hear a certain deutschlin , konrad deutschlin , a ro- bustfellow with hair hanging in strings on his forehead , adding : and everything was once nothing , my good probst , and then be- came something
you paltry wretch , said the stare with which hans castorp measured the mannheimer—said it without the shadow of a doubt of its meaning
and how do you come to be here so late ?
well , tom , i must say i was ashamed of hagenstrbm
yes , here seemed to sound two voices , with differing counsels
you will not believe that your father played lightly and unre-flectingly with your happiness in those days !
but it could not : the painful , rebellious feeling sank away again , and he was still
but that again , in its turn , was belied by his blackness and pallor , so that some aura of the questionable always hung about the man
and when herr brecht opened the door , his invitation was repeated by josephus in such a way that somehow hanno was laughing when he went into the operating-room and sat down in the queer big chair by the window , next the treadle machine
there , if i am not mistaken , there is a tireless discursive argumentation and a cursed lot of dialectic tension
you ask a woman : do you love him ?
that a pastor from riga could thus bamboozle him behind his bark ?
he did what he could with those two hands , often adding his voice , which crowed and cracked , but never badly ; no , it was all even ravishing , by reason of its fervid musicality and enthusiastic rightness of expression
he ate enormously at dinner
evening , m ’ boy , said behrens , who stood talking in low tones with krokowski and the oberin , and nodded ruefully to hans castorp , with his upper lip drawn back
they two , alone together , as two beings are together in only one other human relationship , have , like them , the one acting , the other suffering him , shared a secret that binds them for ever together
and , contrariwise , one can conceive of a world so spacious that its time system too has a majestic stride , and the distinctions between still , in a little while , yesterday , to-morrow , are , in its economy , possessed of hugely extended significance
this show-piece did indeed give a singular tone to the silken chamber
the gentleman in the ulster looked at morten as one looks at a servant , blinking gently without seeing him , and said in a soft voice : is herr pilot-captain schwarzkopf at home ?
for the behaviour of these people was really due to the indescribable atmosphere of aloofness which he carried about wherever he went
how should i get on without them ?
it is not advisable to fall ill up here ; you aren ’ t taken any notice of
and began tapping as before
the others would have burst out laughing again , but adrian shook his head at them with his finger on his lips
he sat on his revolving stool with his face turned towards us , in the same position as ours , bent over , hands between his l { nees , and in a few words brought to an end his lecture on why beethoven had not
he would approach his fea- tures mistrustfully to the glass , pull a wry face , hold his chin with thumb and forefinger , stroke his cheek in disgust and then wave his face away with the other hand so expressively that we , adrian and i , burst out in loud laughter
the hofrat , still lost in thought , let him stand
the old man named each one to his grandson , pointing with beringed index finger
sesemi weichbrodt stood on her tip-toes , kissed her pupil , now frau permanerjer , explosively on the forehead , and said with her most pronounced vowels : be happy , you go-od che-ild !
so then i came round with alnlost ridiculous promptness , described the event as inconlprehensible ; allowed that a nlistake , a wrong bottle was quite possible , yes , probable
the products of animal metabolism , such as albumen , glycogen , animal starch , in short , were present in them
he does not hate us in the least
the persistence of poverty and sickness had been in the interest of both parties , and the position could be sustained just so long as it was possible to hold to the purely religious point of view
you can ’ t call it time , quoth hans castorp , thick-tongued
it is on account of my cousin , herr hofrat
what he had said , at bottom , was that he alone had the right to enjoy the pleasant things we had been regaled with
he went on , and ran his hand down the whole of his left side , very close , but not touching it
it reminds me of things dr krokowski says in his monday lectures
even the overdiecks were very lively
christian went on , and his voice was hollow and rasping
as before , he ordered a bottle of kulmbacher
we were touching upon this subject earlier in the afternoon , when we spoke of the responsive nature of women
in class leo expressed the desire to study theology , in order to prepare himself for membership in the society , in case he should be found worthy
this is the fact
but on the third day it seemed as though nature suffered a sudden reserve ; everything turned topsy-turvy
something jesting and commonplace , of course
what makes him limp like that ?
yes , he is my cousin , he confirmed her , unnecessarily
well , he may be innocent , after all
the chandler , it appeared , let his upper storeys to a bohemian ladies ’ -tailor , who in his turn let out lodgings
for now , instead of the dimness of the hall we have the rather pensive light of a declining spring day in the season of melting snows ; and our hero is seated in his wonted place at the bedside of mynheer peeperkorn , in friendly and respectful converse with that great man
every man , dumb with the shock , folded his hands upon his stomach and looked at his fellows or at the windows , where fists were being shaken in the air and the crowd was giving vent to deafening and frantic yelling
good , then freedom was the opposite of inborn sinlessness , freedom meant the choice of keeping faith with god , or having traffic with demons and being able to mutter beastlinesses at the mass
even when he seemed to rest , as he sat with the paper after dinner , a thousand ideas whirled about in his brain , while the veins stood out on his temples , and he twisted the ends of his moustaches with a certain still intensity of passion
hagenstrbm ! -- the word seems to have corns from nobody knows where -- down from the sky , or up from the earth
what do you make of that ?
and what an education !
her native genuine sweetness - the way , for instance , in which the dark-brown hair was dravvn back from her brow and sensitive temples , leaving the ears free and lying heavy at the back of her neck - set its stamp on the hands as weli
reason and enlightenment have banished the darkest of these shadows that tenanted the soul of man—not entirely , for even yet the conflict is in progress
he hiccoughed gently two or three times , was silent , and ceased to move his lips
she turned toward the door , with her pot of flowers , wrapped up in tissue paper , under her arm ; and thomas , after greeting her again , said in an elevated voice to the shop girl , give me a couple of roses , please
erica will be like me -- with grunlich and perma-neder
she said ly—ric , as hans castorp involuntarily noted
that was beautiful , and i praised it highly
of course , it is possible that she is consciously or unconsciously seeking a mate herself -- but i know the child , and i feel sure she has never yet found her heart , as the saying goes
to mitigate adrian 's acco\lnt by subjecting it to any kind of editing ; to dismiss the dialogue in a few numbered paragraphs ( will the reader please note the protesting quotation-marks i have given the word , vvithout concealing from myself that they can remove from it only part of its indwelling horror ) ; to do this no regard for the possible failure of the reader 's capacity could possibly move me
one believes in the coming of war if one does not sufficiently abhor it
they all sat down , and the consul and the broker talked by turns for the next few minutes
always the crass , obscenely comic figure of the divei has been nearer to them than the eternal majesty ; and kumpf , in his way , was a man of the people
the young man assured himself by a side glance that frau chauchat was paying no heed ; then stood by the bed in his accustomed posture , his weight on one leg , his head on one side , his hands folded across his stomach , reverently , reflectively gazing
but let me tell my tale
but the half-conscious cravings were stronger ; and in the desire to have them strengthened and justified from outside , he first revealed his plan to his sister
rising on tiptoes to peer into joachim ’ s throat , she asked : tell me , young un , do you ever swallow the wrong way ?
it seemed to hans castorp that not only he himself had arrived at this point , but that all the world , the whole show , as he said , had arrived there with him ; he found it hard to differentiate his particular case from the general
he was not out for change , new sense impressions , distraction , recreation
and no wonder , he said to himself
hans castorp was silent a little space
they sang in chorus—one could understand the words quite well :
this invisible figure is frau van tolna and i can not set her before the reader 's eye or give the smallest idea of her outward appearance , for i have not seen her and never had a description of her , since no one i know ever saw her either
his mogith was small and mobile , with two yellowish pointed teeth in the otherwise vacant gum of his lower jaw , and he was pressing these into his upper lip , aa-he stood absently by the door with his hands in his trousers pockets and the black and white down on his head waving slightly , although there was not the least perceptible draught
the senator breakfasted hurriedly , and the frau consul , tony , clolhilde , and christian meanwhile took their leave
hans castorp was forced to acquiesce
two months before i came , a student who had been here a long time hanged himself down in the wood , after a general examination
or would you rather stop on here and let out floors to different families ?
the windows were shrouded , daylight shut out , and two electric lights were burning
she lurned her pretty 'cad , and looked -- at me -- and said , 'you just get on , my lad , and hold your tongue !
with suppressed eagerness he had opposed those who had thought to take over , on the hofrat ’ s departure , the changing of plate and needle , the switching on and off of the current
but i can not follovv
i would show you the door !
only a few old hands , joachim said , could wield both blankets at once , flinging them into position with three self-assured motions
said kranich , and got a bravo !
but i have to obey the order -- that is my share , and you can look on at it
what a goodly idea !
instruction in magic , if you like
i never write a letter
inpossible , but refreshing , so adrian in a good mood characterized the work , which he had begun to write down even during the composition of the ensemble piece , carried in his mind and developed , burdened as it was with the work on the quartet , of which one would have thought that it alone must have consumed a man 's organizing powers for long and to the utmost
several times the shattering , headlong destruction has come breath-takingly near my retreat
it belongs to the realm of the great confusion
you know -- it even happened several times that he said ame ' instead of ' !
taking walks up here is very beautiful—but appears to have its difficult side
vanity , said the hofrat , and vexation of spirit
who was it threw christian out ?
creatures like that one has to love , whether one will or no ; they vex you with their heedlessness , but that is only one reason the more for loving them ; it makes you so happy to have to care for them in spite of yourself
they submitted to herr settembrini ’ s breaking up the little party and disposing of themselves without giving naphta the chance to come along supposing he had been inclined
his voice had grown quite strangely excited
i can surely go to sleep without being disturbed ; they will behave themselves , he said
he raised his arm as he turned to go
it was probably among the most acceptable of the children 's books in the shop , with pictures in english taste , a sort of kate greenaway style and not at all bad rhymes
it may cost the government a few window-panes -- but that 's all
such expressions repeated themselves in the letters
still it seems to be the case , and i point it out in connection with the statement that leverl { uhn in the text for his incommensurable choral work by no means confined himself to the revelation of st john , but tool { in this whole prophetic tradition , so that his work amounts to the crea- tion of a new and independent apocalypse , a sort of resume of the whole literature
on a smaller scale they too were monstrously incredible and exag- gerated ; the scene displayed the same vicious san-culottism
so now they knew—though very probably not all of them were capable of an opinion on what they heard
well , that is very flattering to me , wenzel -- just put a little more lather on my chin , will you ?
lord bless us , thought hans castorp , in shamefaced consternation
she says no more , she goes on with the cure , and loses weight by the week
but he did have all the sensations which the drunkenness of passion knows , when it sees its own case duplicated in the outer world , and which form a most fantastic mixture of disgust and fellow-feeling
is it a good solid amount ?
senator langhals spoke with some heat
not all that happens in madness is therefore simply to be prevented , and the obligation to preserve life was in this case obeyed in scarcely anyone 's interest save the mother 's - for undoubtedly the maternal would prefer an irresponsible son to a dead one
the answer was in the sense that this defect only brouglt the lovable closer to the suffering soul ; that without it there would have been no hope at all , it was just that which had made the fickle one ac- cessible to the cry of pain ; more still , and revealing enough : that the shortening of life which ight result from it was ltiore of a consolation and assurance to her , vho demanded possession than it was a moderation of her love
this director wulicke was a most formidable man
what was this , then , that was in the air ?
hans castorp sought and asked for him through the house ; was sent here or there where he would be certain to find him , and found only that he had gone
perhaps all your nerves are short on the left side !
he had not even smiled on her entrance ; and this immobility of his mien said all
his eyelids drooped , so that the long brown lashes lay over the deep blue shadows ; and his closed lips were a little wry
her black veil played about her , and her full skirt lay spread out in picturesque folds
but not alone a freak of nature , not simply a hoax
in my eyes , it is reason ’ s keenest dart against the powers of darkness and ugliness
we started with the idea that youth has closer relations with nature than the mature man in a bourgeois society - something like woman , to whom also has been ascribed , compared with man , a greater nearness to nature
it was a russian kiss , the kind that is exchanged in that spreading , soulful land , at high religious feasts , as a seal of love
things haven ’ t changed much with you , in the mean time
he passed on , in his everlasting check trousers , and left hans castorp behind , presumably , and to a certain extent actually , staggered by so much allusiveness ; though he was stirred to irritation at its being taken for granted , and muttered through his teeth after the departing back : carducci-latini-humani-spagheti—get along , do , and leave me in peace !
stretching out his large , white hand , with the long , trembling fingers , he said agree , my dear young patron : eighty-four thousand marks -- it is the offer of an honest old man
i am free to confess that the novel experiences of these kridwiss evenings , combined with my participation in adrian 's solitary work , were responsible for the mental strain of my life at that time and in the end for the loss of a good twelve pounds ' weight
from time to time he saw ' rudiger schildknapp , the like-eyed ,
i am inclined to look at people and say : so that ’ s you , is it ?
the ground-floor , settembrini explained , belonged to the chandler ; naphta was domiciled a floor higher up , with the tailor ’ s shop , and his own quarters were in the roof , where he had a peaceful little study
accordingly hans castorp set out on this tour of investigation , which began by descending from the meadow with the hut into another and rather deep gully that dropped off from right to left
bined cellos and flutes , half lyrically passionate and half burlesque , which in the prose , at the place , but her eye - by this light , but for her eye , i would not love her , recurs in a wildly carica- tured way , where the darkness of the eyes is intensified by the pitch , but the lightning flash of them is this time given to the pic- colo there can be no doubt that the strangely insistent and even unnecessary , dramatically little justified characterization of rosa- line as a faithless , wanton , dangerous piece of female flesh - a description given to her only in biron 's speeches , whereas in the actual setting of the comedy she is no more than pert and witty - there can be no doubt that this characterization springs from a compulsion , heedless of artistic indiscrepancies , on the poet 's part , an urge to bring in his own experiences and , whether it fits or not , to take poetic revenge for them
he arranged his small black felled hand upon the boy 's shoulder , and looked up at thi
it certainly could not be considered strict objectivity , there was much more free-thinking and subjectivity about it than leo naphta would admit—it was , indeed , quite as much politics as herr settembrini ’ s didactic phrase : freedom is the law of love of one ’ s kind
you ’ d say the eye slit was cut obliquely , but it only looks so
i have just received your important letter , and hasten to thank you for the consideration you show me in asking for my consent in the affair under discussion
settembrini , corrected the italian , clearly and with emphasis , making as he spoke a mocking bow
hans castorp respected work—as how should he not have ?
everything now depended upon the question : how far was the salvation of the deceived one involved by her receiving and using the unholy preparation ?
a quantity of little woolly ringlets covered his round head
and it makes me nervous to hear him scolding , about the cold , and behrens , and frau magnus because she is losing weight , and about pretty well everything
dne just must not mind
he said sententiously , and put his nose in the air
he seemed to be darkly dreaming for a moment ; then he got up
adrian suggested that they should take a walk , one talked bet- ter walking
dr heidekind scolded , and insisted on a change of air ; a complete change , not a stay at norderney or wyk on föhr—that would not mend matters this time , he said ; if they wanted his advice , it was that hans castorp should go for a few weeks to the high mountains before he took up his work in the yards
be assured that thy psychological feints do not trap me , any better then do the theological
his stomach seemed to have a prejudice against the good cod-liver oil
i have often heard
then , overhead in the salon , the harmonies would rise and surge like waves , with singing , lamenting , unearthly jubilation ; would lift like clasped hands outstretched toward heaven ; would float in vague ecstasies ; would sink and die away into sobbing , into night and silence
i do not say , answered hans castorp , i do not say that she ever returned it
next time ( that would be in four weeks ) it is bound to show further improvement
but christian 's gaze flickered absently over her head ; he would probably have stopped without her suggestion , for he seemed to be sunk in a profound , disquieting dream of maria and her depravity , while his little round deep eyes wandered back and forth
a mountain stream came flowing in its shallow , stony bed down the right-hand slope , poured itself foaming over the terraced boulders lying in its path , then coursed more calmly toward the valley , crossed at this point by a picturesque railed wooden footbridge
and the thought , again , almost did him good , berausc it was a simple , comprehensible , normal thought , that one could think and express -- quite another matter from this brooding over a mysterious disgrace , a blot upon his family 'scutcheon
there could be no better example of the quotation as dis- guise , the parody as pretext
perhaps if i got up my latin i could read it
i-io ' w much speaks for the man the deep , intent friendship of delacroix , who writes to him : j'cspere vous voir ce soir , mais ce moment est capable de me faire dcvenir fou
strange to say , hans castorp ’ s only reply to all this was a query as to whether it was possible to get porter up here ; when joachim looked at him , in some astonishment , he perceived that his cousin was overcome with sleep , that in fact he was actually nodding
'keep it to yourself
so the hundred years make an impression on you too ?
in old age the flesh becomes tough , that is because the collagen increases in the connective tissue—the lime , you know , the most important constituent of the bones and cartilage
aloud he said : you are good !
since her time he had flung himself with redoubled conviction into the arms of the clear-eyed goddess , of whose soothing powers hofrat behrens had so morally discoursed
have you a copy of the will here , betsy ?
and leopardi , thought hans castorp , who definitely despaired of science and progress ?
for , how-ever my life seemed to go awry , i was never quite lost
his inheritance from his mother , in-deed , half the interest of which had always found its way to hamburg , was managed by herr stephan kistenmaker -- in so far as it was not already spent in advance
it was rather a misnomer to speak of the village , since scarcely anything but the word remained
i didn ’ t know it
privately , she sometimes thought that the splendid von went with her better than it did with armgard ; for armgard did not appreciate her good luck , dear , no !
i only feel really fit when i am doing nothing at all
—and thus your catarrh is , in my view , a third-line phenomenon , dr krokowski concluded , very softly
have you ever asked him where he learned them , from his father or from whom ?
how lovely she looks again !
plantations , the harvests being manufactured in refining works on the property itself
we are entering into times , my friend , which will not be hood- winked by psychology
let it he as it is
thomas , smoking his cigarette , looked about keenly , and when they carne to the grain he called herr permaneder 's attention to its condition
you made a fine figure of yourself !
naphta responded , with disagreeable composure : my good sir , there is no such thing as pure knowledge
but i would also recall the share which german artists and friends of art had in the founding of the international society for contemporary music , in , and the performances by the society two years later in prague , when choral and instrumental portions of adrian 's apocalypsis cum figuris were given before a public including famous guests from all the lands of music
joy , he said , quoting aretine , held brilliant court within his , settembrini ’ s , breast ; a joy due to the blessing of the springtime—to which commend him
he did not put out his hand
he : oh , thy father is not so ill placed in my mouth
he did not ask if we understood that , nor did we ask ourselves
hans castorp looked at her , and all the modest and confiding friendliness native to him spoke in his eyes
when you entered it from the corridor on a day of cold and damp , or when the cutting tramontana blew , the warmth of it laid itself about you like a shawl , so that for very pleasure your eyes would fill with tears
tony looked a long time at her name and at the blank space next it
the patient , hands folded on his chest , smiled daily at the blithe address , smiled with a friendly , albeit rather harassed mien , watching the doctor ’ s yellow teeth , that were visible through his beard
it is different with your cousin
vacuity , monotony , have , indeed , the property of lingering out the moment and the hour and of making them tiresome
said the consul angrily
but all that won ’ t bring it up to a thousand francs , say what you like
it was not to be
dis pensed from oral examination on the basis of the maturity of his written worl { , he had taken leave of his teachers , with thanks for all they had done ; while on their side respect for the profession he had chosen repressed the private annoyance they had always felt at his condescending facility
here too there was music , a small , red-uniformed orchestra , conducted by a bohemian or hungarian first violin , who stood apart from the others , among the dancing couples , and belaboured his instrument with frantic wreathings of his body
the malay without turning his head followed the movement , until his eyeballs showed white
you shall not do that , papa , she went on , quite beside herself
oh , justifiably , quite justifiably !
one should preserve one 's sense of humour , quand meme
as they went , hans castorp discoursed earnestly upon the gentleman rider ’ s cough
to condemn as incapacity or ignorance , even as clumsy primitivism , the rejection of perspective eye-deception by pre perspective art ; even pityingly to shrug the shoulder over it : this , he declared to be the peak of silly modern arrogance
it dealt—at least possibly , if not quite admittedly—with the non-vital , with existences that took advantage of a ticklish , mysteriously and momentarily favouring chance to return to substantiality and show themselves to thair summoners—in brief , with the spiritualistic invocation of the departed
and that , vas all
and then , with a start , we remember that he has disappeared from the stage , that his voice no longer swells the general concert -- that he is , in short , departed from among us , and lies some-where ouside the walls , beneath the sod
you think there will be a severe storm , tom ?
your parents -- i really must ask you if you understand our financial position ?
even today in my thoughts i address him breathing vengeance and call him a prize ass in every sense of the word
his designs had been of the most discreet and delicate , he had meant nothing clumsy or abrupt
they scarcely as yet knew what , but would he at least be in principle inclined to do so , in his great amiability ?
he was a weighty man , whose suits were always of the best english cloths ; his eyes were watery blue and prominent behind his gold-rimmed glasses , his nose was ruddy , and his square cut beard was grey ; he wore a flashing brilliant on the stubby little finger of his left hand
one may as well go home
i fled with my flag
yes , papa , said little johann , and took up his post before the door , which closed after the two gentlemen
get used to it ?
i suppose magnus , the brewer , was rather stupid , after all , with his beautiful characters ’ ; but i do think settembrini might have said what the point really is in literature
he has not set any definite time
we will even add that he had already begun to treat of them before the arrival of ellen brand upon the scene of action , and the progress of matters into the empirical and experimental stage
did i really go pale ?
there are things to do , down below , but here—i doubt if anyone would take enough interest in it
but hans castorp considered that an answer was due , he felt it incumbent on him to cap the quotation , though it was unlikely he would have produced anything very striking
but until after mid-night he still sat in his room , before his harmonium , and played -- played in thought only , for he must make no noise
that , vas a definition suggested by the psychology of reli- gion
your father has had some heavy losses , due , we all know , to your brother justus
and what about western mysticism—and what about quietism , a religion that numbers fénelon among its disciples ?
i never knew that—but i ’ ve wondered for a long time what it is about eyes like that
hans castorp had had frequent word from his cousin , short messages , at first full of good news and high spirits , then less so , then at length communications that sought to hide something truly sad to hear
the soldier ’ s existence—i say this without intending the slightest offence to lieutenant ziemssen— can not be cited in the argument , for the reason that , as an existence , it is purely formal—in and for itself entirely without content
the raisin cake he contemplated with an interested eye , but literally shuddered at the thought of eating any
yes , and i did not sleep so very well , and the early breakfast was really too solid—i am accustomed to a fair breakfast , but this was a little too rich for my blood , as the saying goes
his sighs , in fact , meant nothing , and seemed to arise out of an excess of com-fort
the dying girl was indeed a charming blond creature , with eyes of true forget-menot blue
many a time and oft we shall be going down to pay him a visit—i am sure of that
her son augustus was a blond young man with a prosperous ex-terior , and there was julie his wife , born hagenstrbm , little and lively , with great blank black eyes and diamond ear-rings that were nearly as large
was that the hujus ?
there were gaps at the tables , all seven of them , at the good as well as at the bad russian table , and at those that stood transversely to the room
i-ie was not interested in travel for the sake of sightseeing or cmlture
what can i do for you ?
he stood there , clutching his sailor 's knot with one hand , felt with his tongue for a doubtful tooth , and listened to the earnest subdued voices which could be heard from inside
what new acquisition of house berghof was it which at length released our longstanding friend from his patience-playing mania , and flung him into the arms of another passion , nobler , though at bottom no less strange ?
never mind about tilda -- it does not hurt her
if the conversation turned upon the buddenbrook family history , christian might be in the mood to speak with serious love and admiration of his native town and of his ancestors
many are those who have responded to the call ; there is a considerable membership , in france , italy , spain , turkey , and in germany itself
they make pretty free with a human being ’ s idea of time , up here
oh , there 's nothing very good about mine , said thomas buddenbrook heavily , and leaned his head against the back of his chair with an air of disgust
i must hope that you will not entirely scorn the friendly hand of your virgil
your answer does not quite satisfy me—you must forgive me for disappointing you
i can ’ t depend on them—not only the first thought that comes into my head , but even the second one , the correction which my reason tries to make upon the first—more ’ s the pity
it was , of course , herr gr� , with an expression of im-ploring tenderness upon his face
the passionate rapidity of his approach even frightened hanno , at first
is that the doctrine of the roman church , which all the religious societies all over the world propagate by means of intrigue , or so they say ?
then it was that hans castorp laughed
gerda would like to rest a little
there was an old post-man , with watery eyes , earrings , and a white beard -- an an-cient oddity whom the senator used to salute on the street and call him herr postmaster : he came , stood in the doorway , and cried out ah hai not come fer that , herr se noter !
originally it was to have been three months
bathing and swimming -- let the boy have bathing and swimming -- he must bathe and swim , dr langhals had said
his patient was rather alarmed by the word comrade—who would have thought it ?
do you remember , morten began again , i once said to you that there was a question i wanted to ask you ?
and the homage he thus paid was genuine , and profound ; for , as he himself explained , judaism , by virtue of its secular and materialistic leanings , its socialism , its political adroitness , had actually more in common with catholicism than the latter had with the mystic subjectivity and self-immolation of protestantism ; the conversion of a jew to the roman catholic faith was accordingly a distinctly less violent spiritual rupture than was that of a protestant
even the hagenstroms have a flap
so you are against the works , he answered , and against physical nature , from which man comes and with him his incor- poreal part , which in the end does occur in other places in the cosmos
second class , to occupy less prominent places
this is a wonderful day , my dear son -- a wonderful day , she repeated
hanno might fail his father in all that demanded vitality , energy and strength
very well ; this is the object of the sociological pathology
she said , giving her query a curt , foreign intonation
next morning it showed ° , climbing during the morning to the same level as before
i ’ d like to wait for the comrade ’ though , he ’ ll be coming along presently , and just ask him if he is still of the opinion , in a case like this , that the physical is to be regarded as secondary
heavy ash-blond hair weighed down her head , so that she held it thrust out side- wise , with extended neck
people differ about that
he had the feeling , he said , that one should do the honours of mu- nich a bit for the ladies in pension gisela
yet it was not the same thing as borrowing a lead-pencil of a perfect stranger ; one might even say it would have been ill-bred to pass by a lady with whom one had been for months under the same roof and not salute her
take off your things , father dear
she folded her arms , flung back her head , and looked at the ceiling while she spoke
oh , yes , you are
but her little brown eyes looked as shrewd and faithful as ever
and then the dream became reality
there , there , little darling -- go to sleep now
not any more than i do ,
it begins , he said , with the cult of the marble statue that had got down to the bottom of the sea , the boy , who is obviously by thorwaldsen , and her illegitimate taste for it
so when i have an opinion nowadays on these subjects , people listen to me
she looked pitiable indeed
oh , it 's you , said the senator in a low voice , moving his lips cautiously
no justify thyself , was here ; no challenge , no priestly court-martial upon one who strayed away and was forgotten of honour
we shall sleep to-night in a hotel and travel home to-morrow
joachim raised seven fingers
it is my painful duty to tell you that your husband is obliged to call his creditors together ; that he can not carry on his business any longer
fa sangue it vinol and amelia moved her spoons to and fro before her face and murmured : spiriti ?
to rush into controversy with personalities , to be even forward of speech—but then to know how to extricate himself when need was , and his coat-tails , as it were , all but on fire !
no doubt he was grateful to his teacher for a kind of instruction
he could see them rolling up their velvet eyes and holding out their soft hats for the coins tossed from the windows
not blindly , but for that reason suffering the more ; and my inward attitude was that of her mocking sister clarissa , who looked do , vn her nose at the other sex : i should have liked to say to him : hop , man !
he answered at once , composed , alert and energetic , and heard the voice of one of the nurses in the house , saying in high , uncertain tones that frau chauchat would be glad if he would come at once to the first storey
the rain rustled the half-leafless trees in the avenue , and sometimes gusts of wind drove it against the window-panes
fraulein buddenbrook will want to unpack
would hamburg consent to be a party to this prussian scheme ?
oh , society doesn ’ t know what it wants
herr settembrini ’ s literary soul was pleased
they had wintered in rome , and in lvlay , as the heat strengthened , they had again sought the mountains and the same hospitable house where , in a sojourn lasting three months , they had learned to feel at home the year before
it was an attempt , a not utterly and entirely hopeless attempt ( the second since the failure of bismarck and his unification per- formance ) to norlnalize germany in the sense of europeanizing or democratizing it , of making it part of the social life of peo- ples
if this beastly ovid lesson were only over !
the family were dining on sunday in fishers ' lane , and he de-scribed how he had to summon all his powers , and crawl on hands and knees to the window to shut it
fc'yes , tom , over the desk in your office , answered frau permaneder , and embraced her brother
the pillars were faced halfway up with wood finished to look like sandalwood , the upper part white-enamelled , like the ceiling and upper half of the walls
his sense of the comic , his fondness for it , his proneness to laughter , yes , to laughing till he cried , i have already spoken of , and i have given but a false picture of him if the reader has not seen this kind of abandon as an element in his nature
at the same moment ap- preaching steps were heard on the echoing flags within
hanno sat quite still , his small hands clasped round hid buddenbrd dks knees , his mouth , as usual , a little twisted as his tongue fell out the hole in a back tooth
ah , that is most amusing !
he stoops when he walks , and rows along with his arms
he made a fine , sweeping gesture to wave away the imputation that he was a prosperous man
to-day she wore her dark red one
but she had been lucky : for just before the end of the term god in his loving-l { indness made her fall into the hands of the inquisition , and even under a slight degree of the question she had made a full and touchingly penitent confession , so that in all probability she obtained pardon from god
whether from his upbringing , or out of a natural idiosyncrasy , he loathed the slamming of doors , and could have struck the guilty person
he considered visiting pastor pringsheim and seeking advire and counsel ; but he gave it up in the end for fear of being ridiculous
he had per- suaded himself to put the thundering response in tones which an- nounce the powerlessness of the creaturely good before good in itself : the latter , being itself the source of justice , can not give way before anything that our human understanding is tempted to call unjust
but the others were silent : so profoundly silent that the director at length fell silent too
but hanno had a reason for absenting himself from the bathing , as well as from the skating and the drill class
i can only compare the feeling with the catch in the breath that a child feels in a sving as it flies aloft , the mingled exultation and terror
however that might be , it was clear that joachim was preoccupied with his own troubles ; the thought of him could afford his cousin no mental support
we must keep together , he used to say to refractory pupils , pinching them on the arm
as large as a salon , with stone floors like all the rest of the house
adrian and rudiger visited the place by mere chance
his face was not striking , but it had at least the stamp of a strong and lively intelligence
which was certainly a large order of sentimental superficiality
but chris-tian , for a long , long time , eats no more peaches
on the business side we have said everything
it threw up on its surface a little protuberance , something like a mount of conception , through which it took the stick into itself , lengthwise
please , please get up
oh , that 's just an expression -- a figure
me he shall never see again , whatever he decides
but on foot how long is it ?
in short , tony 's intentions in the matter of her divorce were not the only dark spot in the consul 's sky ; and the journey to hamburg was pressing
this salon was furnished with upholstered fauteuils , bronze candelabra , little gilt occasional chairs , a sofa-table , vith a bro- cade cover , and a richly framed , very much darkened oil painting of , representing the golden i-iorn wlth a view of gai
lawyer paravant and frau stöhr went white and red by turns ; the latter suffered pangs of indecision when called on to decide whether it was too high for her to buy at eighteen
one could not help feeling that it was by way of being a compensa- tion and atonement for the loss of human happiness and mutual love which had befallen him
the wind came up and blew the thick veils of water , tore them apart , and flung them about
tom , we will get to work
this is the reve-lation : that i shall live !
why are you sitting here writing in the dark ?
is it not the antithesis of hedonism ?
when i think that you have passed all your life in these surroundings -- in fact -- with some interruptions , said frau permaneder , in that extraordinarily throaty voice of which she sometimes availed herself
stine voss , who lived by the city wall , and mike stuht from bell-founders ' street , and fike snut from the river-bank or groping alley , their straw-coloured locks smoothed back with a wet comb , crossed the entry into the garden-room , which for a long time now had not been used as an office , and in which rows of benches had been arranged and frau consul buddenbrook , born kroger , in a gown of heavy black satin , with her white re-fined face and still whiter lace cap , sat opposite to them at a little table with a glass of sugar-water and catechized thrm for an hour
it sounded like a chal-lenge , like a little trumpet-call
when he was obliged to go into the city , adrian brought the boy all sorts of presents : various animals , a jack-in-the-box , a toy railway with lights that switched on and off as it roared round the curves ; a magic casket in which the greatest treasure was a glass filled with red wine which did not run out when the glass was turned upside dovvn
yes , how much has happened that had its effect on my own solitary activities , while yet i refused to look without-doors !
so it is with schoolmasters

as for myself , i am a humanist , a homo humanus
i carry yours here
what extravagance , what fanaticism , it will be said !
the abstract , the refined-upon , the ideal , is at the same time the absolute—it is sternness itself ; it contains within it more possibilities of deep and radical hatred , of unconditional and irreconcilable hostility , than any relation of social life can
he was obliged to spend much time in bed , not only on the days when the quartan fever held sway , but on others too
he has never seen any-thing like it , i am sure
it was a jewel of great beauty and - to me - incalculable value
he had been there a half-hour earlier , and given a camphor injection ; had scarcely been absent for more than the moment of the short crossing
just lie still on your back
his name was wiedemann , a christian name , not a filthy jewish
what an effete and obsolete procedure burial was , under our modern conditions—the price of land , the expansion of our cities and consequent shoving of the graveyards out on to the periphery !
it would be the abandonment of certain comprehensive responsibilities which had grown up out of his contemplation of the image called homo dei ; it would be the betrayal of that appointed task of stock-taking , that hard and harassing task , which was really beyond the powers native to him , but yet afforded his spirit such nameless and adventurous joys ; that task it was his duty to perform , here in his chair , and up there in his blue-blossoming retreat
there were lively times here in the restaurant on occasion , joachim said , and champagne flowed freely
having spent a year with adrian in leipzig , i know how he lived during the other three of his stay there ; his manner of life being so regular and conservative that i found it rigid and some- times even depressing
she wept over herr weinschenk 's top-hat , the way he raised his eyebrows at sight of her and let them fall ; over his regal bearing and his balancing fists
such were the motives that led him to force his way so blandly into the retreat where genius created and suffered
still , i can not see how you reconcile your nationalism with your horror of war
the document is extant , i will report on it in its proper place
pas prccisement humain mais ex- tremement respectable
again the consul was obliged to stop eating and lean back in his chair to laugh
the treatment was not wrong , but it was just possibly one-sided
others sat straining forward to fling the bait far out
he , kretschmar , would leave the ques- tion open , how far adrian was accusing himself in order to ex- cuse his corresponding accusations against art ; for this painting art as a marriage with the mob , as kiss-throwing , gala-posturing , as a bellows to blow up the emotions , was a facile misconstruction and a wilful one too
the sleigh or carriage halted before the door , coachman and porter strapped fast the trunks , while friends gathered about to say good-bye to the departing one , who , cured or not , and whether for life or death , was off for the flat-land
imagine how i felt !
and even here at home there was another source of worry -- for , as yet , there was no certainty whatever that the family name would live
disease has nothing refined about it , nothing dignified
he should have gone a step further and said that a good style would lead to good deeds , settembrini added
hanno could not stop laughing
the reader , on the other hand , may very likely find such adjectives the only ones suitable to describe hans castorp ’ s personality or emotions
take your wineglass , young man , i will use the water-glass again , it does the crude new wine no shame— with his trembling hand he filled the glasses , hans castorp hastening to assist him
you have worked hard -- that must suffice
but there were other , more perceptive regions
the green blinds in frau gr� 's sleeping-room were gently stirred by the mild air of a june night , for the win-dows were open
the beaten french tasted this awful experience in , vhen their negotiators , seeking to soften the conditions of the victors , priced very high the renown , la gloire , ensuing from the entry of our troops into paris
i remember the house-warming
of late the assistant spent no more time with this particular patient than with the others , but confined himself chiefly to the well , comrade ?
his placidity was fully restored by the appearance of the steaming dishes , with their burden of canary-yellow besprent with green , which dispersed a mild warm fragrance of eggs and butter upon the air
but on the way to breakfast , and later in the course of the day , they talked about the direction of the berghof sanatorium , and joachim , in his character as inmate , answered his cousin ’ s questions
who , what , how could i be , if i were not i -- if this my external self , my consciousness , did not cut me off from those who are not i ?
please do not make phrases
the cousins met in the corridor and descended the stair
yes , my dear good mother : i am complying with the request to send my solemn consent to clara 's be-trothal from the amstel to the baltic
the times are not good for merchants
he would leave the office in the midst of work , seized with unrest , and roam about the garden , sometimes pausing as if he felt confined in his movements , sighing , and covering his eyes with his hand
go on with your work
they showed their necks and bosoms , they transfigured their arms by veiling them in illusion ; they did so , the world over , to arouse our desire
but perhaps it is only the excitement of thr , celebration
i have no great fondness for balls , and having the young people jumping about here ; and , be-sides , there is not room
a single light burned in the hall ceiling—and in the adjoining salons dimness reigned
dnce a week they sat at the extension table in the dining-room by the light of lamps and candles
every lady said to frau consul or her daughter : what a treasure your mamsell is , my dear !
no , he had become inwardly aware—one could conceive him paling at the thought—that even as it was , after only a week up here , he would find eyerything down below wrong and out of place , and that the feeling would last a considerable time before readjustment set in : it would seem to him unnatural to go to his office , instead of taking a prescribed walk after breakfast , and thereafter lying ritually wrapped , horizontal in a balcony
the movements with which he took up paper and writing materials were so short and jerky that herr marcus ran his two fingers up and down his beard and gave his colleague a long , scrutinizing look
from far and wide scholars came to converse with him—one from haparanda , another from cracow— they came to our city of padua , expressly to pay him homage , and he received them with dignified friendliness
hurry , do you hear ?
it had happened that the sonata had come , in the second , enormous movement , to an end , an end without any return
your skin gets like a file , and if the stimulus is very powerful , the hair ducts are erected too , the hair on your head bristles up and the little hairs on your body , like quills upon the fretful porcupine—and you can say , like the youth in the story , that now you know how to shiver and shake
he would drink no beer to-day ; he would drink nothing at all , or at most a swallow of water
i should not conceal from you , he went on , that the firm has suffered losses already quite apart from this affair , and that the surrender of a sum like this would be a blow from which it would recover with difficulty
i am refusing you -- for heaven 's sake , ca not you understand ?
the lovers sat quietly together hand in hand , and spoke gently and earnestly of the beautiful future before them
lawyer paravant had received out of transcendency a sounding slap on the cheek , and had countered with scientific alacrity , yes , had even eagerly turned the other cheek , heedless of his quality as gentleman , jurist , and onetime member of a duelling corps , all of which would have constrained him to quite a different line of conduct had the blow been of terrestrial origin
schwerdtfeger , a little to the left of the first vio- lin , whose place he was soon to tal { e , stood with his instrument under his arm , warm and beaming , face towards the hall and nodding to us with not quite permissible familiarity , while inez , at whom i could not resist stealing a glance , with her head thrust out , her mouth mischievously pursed , kept her eyes obstinately directed at some other point on the stage , perhaps on the leader , or no , farther along , on the harps
an astonishing growth of hair , a wilderness of tight little curls , red-brown mixed with grey , made his head look big and heavy , though it was poised easily upon a long neck with an extremely large adam 's apple that showed above his low collar
if that is an error , and while without doubt it was an error to yield to the temptation to bring in pfeiffering and the schweigestills before their time , i would implore the reader to attribute such irregu- larities to the excitement which has possessed me since i began this biography , and to tell the truth not only as i write
but there is one power , one principle , which commands my deepest assent , my highest and fullest allegiance and love ; and this power , this principle , is the intellect
i have the use of my senses
he keeps trying to open them wide , and has made a lot of wrinkles , regular corrugations , that turn up on the temples and run straight across his forehead , and his forehead is high and red , with long wisps of white hair
if we don ’ t think so , our judgment is corrupted
yes , these were two different worlds
hans castorp , horrified , shook his fist at her , but she scarcely grasped his meaning ; she was far from any thought of sparing joachim ’ s feelings , and too matter-of-fact to dream that anyone , least of all the next of kin , could be in any doubt as to the character and issue of this illness
breathe deep , he commanded
it surely did not escape this haughty person with the too short chin when superiority , on grounds which have nothing to do , -ith superiority , gave something away and , vas just as certainly of the opinion that it gave nothing away
oh , really , very good !
he had been too careless , too generous to attain a solid position in the mercantile world
quite right , of course , but 'head bare at prayer was al- ways my - prayer , finished dr breisacher relentlessly , is the vulgarized and rationalistically watered-down late form of something very vital , active and strong : the magic invocation , the coercion of god
quite so , my dear jean , she said , though she was far from having understood everything , least of all what these big figures had to do with her engaging a man-servant
the walks go better in company , ziemssen , old fellow , what ?
if i did not kno , , , how to entertain adrian as schild- knapp did , i did have our childhood tie , our du , to my advantage over the silesian
frau stöhr , with her chin and shoulder coquettishly meeting , sought to reawaken lawyer paravant to desire
a lake was visible in the distant landscape , its waters grey , its shores covered with black fir-forests that climbed the surrounding heights , thinned out , and gave place to bare , mist-wreathed rock
he would gratefully accept the permission to accompany him ; but who was the overfilled ’ and how did hofrat
but the statement would be inexact
he kept guard over his forgetfulness
consul budden-brook was moved
complaining and despairing voices sounded in the chimney
but it n not flabby ; it does not make yon feel irritable
but to return , by way of example , to some of those strains and stresses to which hans castorp ’ s state was prone
gabled roofs ; con- nected by a criss-crosse labyrinth of covered courts and passages , and adjoining vvarehouses and cellars
my age is sixty , for i was born ad , the eldest of four brothers and sisters , at kaisersaschern on the saale , in the district of merse- burg
i said to myself : 'tom has been going about lately feeling very down in the mouth
the russians presented their gift , a large round silver plate , with the hofrat ’ s monogram engraved in the middle ; its utter inutility was plain to every eye
i tell you , it doesn ’ t matter in the least what a man ’ s views are , so long as he is a decent chap
even in the glittering winter they spent days in ettal , oberammergau , mittenwald ; and when spring came , these excur- sions increased , to the famous lakes and the theatrical castles built by the nation 's inadman
it guarded against the fever attending the di- gestion of hearty ineals
the priest stood on the threshold and spoke soothingly , i can see now just how he stuck his head out and drew it back again while he talked
but for all that , behind this so lovely and pleasant artistic production stood—death
i much prefer the dinners to the balls myself
the actual pain in the nerve seemed deadened ; in his mouth was only a dull , heavy burning sensation
and jolly bachelors on fire
the man is a boon—for god ’ s sake , is he not a personality ?
but consul hagenstrbm 's son limped perceptibly when he went home
anyhow , nobody for a long time thought of connecting young adrian in any way with music
he put away the book in the drawer of the garden table
wehsal shrugged his shoulders , as much as to say that precisely that extreme case was a contingency ; thus reducing to silence hans castorp , who was inclined to forget the fact
behrens did not set a limit ; he is a long-headed man , and doesn ’ t play the prophet
would holger not make up some poetry for them ?
but now it was her haven , her hap- piness : a bourgeois happiness , which obviously looked more acceptable because it possessed the charm of novelty ; the foreign nationality was a new frame into which she would be trans- planted
anonymous and communal , said hans castorp
well , tony , what do you say to it ?
- i have always feared adrian 's proneness to laughter , never been able , like rudiger schild knapp , to play a good second to it ; and the same fear , the same shrinking and misgiving awkwardness i feel at this gehen- nan gaudium , sweeping through fifty bars , beginning with the chuckle of a single voice and rapidly gaining ground , embracing choir and orchestra , frightfully swelling in rhythmic upheavals and contrary motions to a fortissimo tutti , an overwhelming , sar- donically yelling , screeching , bawling , bleating , howling , piping , whinnying salvo , the mocking , exulting laughter of the pit
thus he would speak of the dos banderas—the two standards—the satanic and the celestial , beneath which the armies gathered for the great struggle : the one near jerusalem , where christ was the capitán general of all the faithful , the other on the plains of babylon , of which the caudillo or chieftain was lucifer
i will keep faith with death in my heart , yet well remember that faith with death and the dead is evil , is hostile to humankind , so soon as we give it power over thought and action
kretschmar had not allowed it to upset his belief in the calling of his pupil
and when i am his wife , you will see , ida , i will take care that he has ambition and gels ahead and makes an effort and is a credit to me and all of us
the cousins sat at a table by themselves , rather apart from the others , for hans castorp was smoking with his dark beer , which he had brought out from breakfast
her daughter-in-law , frau consul elizabeth buddenbrook , born kroger , laughed the sputtering kroger laugh and tucked in her chin as the kr�s did
poor creature , she said
in such adventures , among such discoveries , the night wore away
they walked rather rapidly through the entry
but when it is fixed upon a human being , with a human face , then we begin talking about love
old fiete shooed it cautiously away , taking care not to touch the forehead of the dead , putting on a seemly air of absent-mindedness—of obscurantism , as it were—as though he neither might nor would take notice of what he was doing
he does not turn his head , on purpose , but i can see by the expression of his back that he is listening
it would upset everything , they would have to begin all over
when he did , he blushed unawares
as a moderate man and son of culture i have indeed a natur
adieu , darling little anna
jean , if you love me -- do you want to expose yourself to this danger ?
this new evil genius had , like the other , always been present , as it were , in the germ , but now it began to spread itself ; hans castorp had by nature no great predilection for becoming its slave ; yet with something like horror he observed that even he , when he let himself go ever so little , fell victim to a contagion so general that scarce anyone in the circle escaped it
he could scarcely see for the fog
well , daghestan—i don ’ t know the climate , it is probably better , when all is said and done , than being right down on the water
then he went behind the camera , and stood just as a photographer would , legs apart and stooped over , to look inside
no , i think there are other doctors in the world !
one evening , when they were alone
he stroked his mous-tache with his two fingers , punctiliously arranged his writing materials and glass
the effect of the inoculations on the entire organism was very noticeable , the nervous system reacted as after hard muscular exertion ; and their strength was displayed in the heightened fever which was their immediate result
man ’ s imperishable part , his ashes !
'yes , that made an impression , and i have certainly shown my good will , at least
the whole remote and lovely spot was wrapped in a sounding solitude by the noise of the rushing waters
pig-drawing , a diversion introduced by high authority on a long-ago carnival evening , had had its little day , and led up to geometrical teasers which for a time consumed all the mental powers of the berghof world , and even the last thoughts and energies of the dying
director wulicke gave utterance to a sound that was as though the lowest string of his double-bass had been violently plucked , and herr modersohn wrung his small , clumsy , inky hands repeating plaintively over and over
they parted , with a brief see you later at the door of number thirty-four ; hans castorp piloted himself through his room to the balcony , where he dropped just as he was upon his deck-chair and , without once shifting to a more comfortable posture , sank into a dull half-slumber , broken by the rapid beating of his unquiet heart
noth- ing harder , generally speaking , than getting into real paris society
of course in these pages i can only picture in a foreshortened form , just as i did with his school-days , the two years of our youth that i spent at halle with my friend ; the course of them interrupted , indeed , by holidays in kaisersaschern and at his fa- ther 's farm
opposed to it stood the protestant , the pietistic sphere , which had its origin in mysticism
friendship which caused me much distress and alarm , but always filled me too with pride : genius is a forin of vital power deeply experienced in illness , creating out of illness , through illness crea- tive
he proceeded to show himself immensely well informed upon current events , and gave his approval to the state of world affairs , in so far as they were running a course favourable to the progress of civilization
hans castorp did not conceal from himself that this smile had in it the seeds of corruption ; he knew in his heart that time was pressing
it failed to deliver the renowned meteorological specific in anything like the quantity indicated by the prospectus , quoted by old inhabitants , or anticipated by new
he , siegismund gosch , would have it on his hands , simply on his hands , and it would be the ruin of him
adrian talked with spengler , who was already in wretched health , his disease having attacked his heart , and laughed with the rest of us at the clowneries of leo zink , who leaned back at table and covered hinself with his huge damask serviette like a sheet up to his fantastic nose and folded his hands peace- fully atop
if man fails in feeling , it is blasphemy ; it is the surrender of his masculinity , a cosmic catastrophe , an irreconcilable horror— he drank
in whatever touched him she showed a surprising , even an unpleasant effrontery
bishop flowed in streams , and sesemi 's ginger-bread was very spicy
the gentlemen knew he had a certain grudge against life up here often enough he had railed against it ! —all honour , then , to the mountain spring !
settembrini glared at him
there were , on the other hand , the two sons of consul hagenstrbm , two fine strapping boys , twelve and four-teen years old , strong and full of spirits , who instituted prize-fights in the neighbouring woods , were the best gymnasts in the school , swam like otters , smoked cigars , and were ready for any deviltry
he tried various devices to disguise the weakness , for he could not continually support his chin on his collar ; he would keep his head in action , turning it to the right and left in conversation , or bear hard against the table with the left forearm when he carried a spoonful of soup to his mouth , and support his head with his hand
i am a grown man -- you do not in the least know what you have to do
she went on , staring before her at the brown carpet
verily he had done well , to march stoutly on despite all obstacles , until now human dwellings appeared , in sign that the inhabited valley was at hand
according to all accounts he has had to pay up pretty heavily , and transactions with bankers make dear money
i have been talking the whole time about myself ; i am a selfish thing
consul buddenbrook kissed his daughter on the forehead and said , go up to your child , antonie
herr k�n felt a great need to unfasten a few buttons of his waistcoat ; but it obviously would not do , for not even the el-derly gentlemen were permitting themselves the liberty
you know now who it was—before this present relationship was established which it would be absurd of me not to respect—with whom clavdia spent—or experienced , or committed—that twenty-ninth of february
i ’ ve always been a civilian and cared more about warm baths and good eating and drinking , whereas he has gone in for manly exertion
and thomas buddenbrook said yes and amen
but there came to be another , more definite goal to his glances , at table , on their walks , and in the salon of an evening
but just here , it seems to me , lies the excuse for vice ( you must pardon me , but i incline by nature to excuses , though there is nothing large ’ about them—i am quite clear on that point ) in so far as it is a result of impotence
leverkiihn , to 'whom i conveyed these impressions of mine , 'was unusually ailing at this time , in a way that had something humili- ating in its torments
on the periphery of its field it would come in contact with the marked counters ; and if the letters on these , when put together , made words that conveyed any sort of sense , the resultant phenomenon would be complex and contaminate , a mixed product of conscious , half-conscious , and unconscious elements ; the actual desire and pressure of some , to whom the wish was father to the act , whether or not they were aware of what they did ; and the secret acquiescence of some dark stratum in the soul of the generality , a common if subterranean effort toward seemingly strange experiences , in which the suppressed self of the individual was more or less involved , most strongly , of course , that of little elly
she had a good little head , and did as well in the school as one could desire ; but her conduct in other ways was far from satisfactory
the next day , of course , he was more dead than alive
no , he did not like going to school -- the old monastic school with its cloisters and vaulted classrooms
ah , the fatal facility of youth !
he agreed to the qualification , the more easily because what he had vaguely in mind was as un- wagnerian as possible , and most remote from nature-d
he sought again and again to pull himself together , to clear his countenance , to tell himself that this was a great day which was bound to heighten and exhilarate his mood
we all call her that up here , because it ’ s the only thing she says
one group of records contained the closing scenes of a certain brilliant opera , overflowing with melodic genius , by a great countryman of herr settembrini , the doyen of dramatic music in the south , who had written it to the order of an oriental prince , in the second half of the last century , to celebrate the completion of a great technical achievement which should bind the peoples of the earth together
you see , the pattern repeats itself on the whole set
germany is free , in so far as one may apply the word to a land prostrate and proscribed
yet the last traces of the sunset linger above and beyond
in the spring there had been a street riot , although a con-stitution corresponding to the demands of the new time had already been drafted ; which , a little later , despite the opposition of lebrecht kroger and other stubborn old gentlemen , be-came law by a decree of the senate
such a position requires no certificate or juristic training ; it is arrived at after a term of years of preliminary service by passing the examinations for sec- retary in chief
not so hans castorp
no , for even the house , the courtyard , and the family itself were all very like the buchel setting
youth in the ultimate sense has nothing to do with political his- tory , nothing to do with history at all
he stooped slightly too , or rather , shrank together ; though even so he overlooked herr ludovico , and was a whole head taller than little naphta
as they sat , behold , there came hofrat behrens through the garden
the equipage turned into the mengstrasse , and the fat brown horses stood snorting and stamping before the buddenbrook door
the authorities had ceased to devise him distractions
he rejected all idea of a monstrosity , whatever attaches in the popular mind to mythological combinations of the human and the animal ; and declared that he did not find admissible mytho- logical fictions of that kind
there was too much red all over the face , the nose was badly out of drawing , the colour of the hair badly hit off , too straw-colour ; the mouth was distorted , the peculiar charm of the features ungrasped or at least not brought out , spoiled by the exaggeration of their single elements
yet it was enough for him to breathe other air , be exposed to other influences , to bring about a complete estrangement , a hope- jess aloofness in the place of confidence and mutual understand- ing
he has nerve enough -- it would not trouble him at all
only it sounds strange to hear it like that , hans castorp said
and this philistine philosophy , this gospel of work and reason , served herr settembrini as an ethical system
sister alfreda had already packed her little trunk and left the berghof , to go to another moribundus in another establishment
the hofrat had seen the old as well as the fresh spots , and strands ran from the bronchial tubes rather far into the organ itself—strands with nodules
who told you so ?
sometimes it was even malignant , this outward beauty : certain conical snails , charmingly asymmetric specimens bathed in a veined pale rose or white-spotted honey brown , had a notoriously poisonous sting
the thing was to achieve an absolute cure , and to that end behrens had just lately socked him another six months
of germany the , opposite is true , and tl : at you would feel and know , leverkiihn , if you were not adrian leverktihn - in other words , too cool to be young , too clever to be religious
he was not going to the meeting-place to be salved and bandaged , but to lay about him , and that in grim earnest
behrens never recognized him , though it was broad day , and our beginner had well-nigh collided with him
he had a great weakness for the theatre and for other distractions of the great city
sundered from the shepherd of his original fold , orphaned , forsaken , full of craving after freer air and forms of existence upon which his native gifts gave him a claim , naphta , who was long past the age of consent , was so impatient for profession that he saved his patron all the trouble of winning this soul—or rather , this extraordinary head—for his sect
i do not doubt it , said he , and doubt not of its success
natu-rally , she received summary notice
she was weak enough !
now , hold your head up -- let your arms hang down quietly at your sides
accordingly , in the nike salon , rosa schneidewein was served with coffee and the little one with milk and cake
i-ie was greatly enlivened
the first word she pronounced dolce , with some reminiscence of her musical husband ’ s italian vocabulary ; but the second suggested jubilee , or an attempt to yodel , or goodness alone knew what
if chance took her up or down the stairs just as herr weinschenk passed that way -- and chance did this not seldom -- the director took off his top-hat , displaying his short black hair , which was already greying at the temples , minced rather more than ever at the waist of his frockcoat , and greeted the young girl with an admiring glance from his bold and roving brown eye
the many-sidedness of his activities , while they made me anxious for his health , his thirst for experience , accompanied as it was by a critical attitude , justified such dreams
dead and buried hopes spring once more to life -- and again are blasted
once more he would rejoice in real , solid time , the long , vital years of youth
i see that i must be very quiet , for the present
by which he meant that he still had an interminable deal of work to do before he arrived at the goal and could settle back to enjoy himself
joachim , preux chevalier , said something to her in english , which she answered in a monosyllable without ceasing to chew , and relapsed again into silence
but this was to much for his powers of self-command , his shrewdness and resource
weak human being that he was—though tolerably well equipped with the weapons of civilization—what he at this moment knew was the fascination of venturing just so far into the monstrous unknown , or at least abstaining just so long from flight before it , that the adventure grazed the perilous , that it was just barely possible to put limits to it , before it became no longer a matter of toying with the foam and playfully dodging the ruthless paw—but the ultimate adventure , the billow , the lion ’ s jaws , and the sea
hans castorp too , though there was echoing in his ears that large-hearted of course , of course out of the past , held back , and at the last moment was rather inclined to pass the choice on
that was , of course , the right way not to go to sleep , and now he felt not the slightest inclination
stopped close in their houses
i have just been coming to that conclusion
i read it too , of course , for want of a better one ; but it is not so very thrilling to hear that wholesale dealer consul so-and-so is going to celebrate his silver wedding !
i am next you on the right
the ends of sievert tiburtius ' long , thin whiskers are parted over his shoulders , and his small grey eyes now and then open wider and wider , most unexpectedly , and grow larger and more prominent till they almost jump out of his head
but i can not wait any longer
at the moment of slipping off one might give a start—yet what sleep could be purer than this in the icy air ?
the first time i came up , nobody was near enough to get hold of me ; the second time , the scow went over my head
when we were schoolboys we used to pinch each other 's arms and say : 'what is the name of the river at swartau ?
after the music , however , there would be a long explanation of the relation of this style of music to that of the strenge satz ; and one day herr pfiihl admitted that , while not personally interested in the theme , he saw himself obliged to add a chapter to his book on church music , the subject of which would be the application of the old key-system to the church- and folk-music of richard wagner
i-ie had a social presence and had been en- nobled personally by the late king ; was much sought after and high-priced
a keen and tortured intellect breathed in the words , and , probing further , the good father discovered a command of fact and a caustic elegance of thought made only the more surprising by the ragged exterior of the youth
then you sat down and began to put the inner one about you : first lengthwise , on both sides , up to the shoulders , and then from the feet up , stooping over as you sat and grasping the folded-over end , first from one side and then from the other , taking care to fit it neatly into the length , in order to ensure the greatest possible smoothness and evenness
but the consul , after sunday supper , in the hall , made the discovery , thanks to the décolleté of frau redisch ’ s spangled black frock , that her bosom was very white and voluptuous , the breasts pressed together so that the crease between them was visible for some way ; and the mature and elegant gentleman was as much shaken by this discovery as though it possessed for him a new and undreamed-of significance
but that he had never done in the klammer pool , only in its counterpart at buchel , the cow trough
the look he directed upon me as i approached had something violent and unbalanced about it , quickly resolved , to my great grief , in gloomy repugnance
what is there to hear , my dear wenzel ?
therese weichbrodt had given up her pensionnat in the past year
the sky above the valley was a deep southern blue and the pastures beneath , with the cattle tracks running across and across them , still a lively green
all works of art whose function it is to express the soul and the emotions , naphta responded , are always so ugly as to be beautiful , and so beautiful as to be ugly
but do explain this one thing to me , he went on
hans castorp said whimsically
he marked off the outer limits by lines dug with his heel in the snow , the inner by means of two canes , his own and settembrini ’ s
but they did recommend it , from the beginning
is not it possible for him to leave himself time enough ?
it seemed as though he feared and avoided not only the indelicate expression of deep and solemn feeling , but even the feeling itself
no , she is dead
ever since the first sunday in advent a great gaily coloured picture of a certain ruprecht had been hanging on the wall in grandmama 's dining-room
of course this misfortune was only revealed afterwards
his table-mates grasped quickly the state of affairs
i am lying up here , he said , paying full pension
upon this point elly was silent
the management was on the ground-floor
we are familiar with that spirit—and we have no great love for it
how make plain to the sober intelligence of the flat-land the changes that took place in the inner economy of our young adventurer ?
over his waistcoat he wore a long , thin gold chain that had belonged to his grandfather , and on the fourth finger of his broad but delicately articulated right hand was the old seal ring with the green stone
yes -- pneumonia , said dr langhals , with a solemn and correct bow
it was undoubtedly aware of itself , so soon as it was life ; but it did not know what it was
they did not even spend the night at schweigestill 's , for both had to work next morning and must take the train back from waldshut to munich
a moment later she leaned over and began to count the prune-pits on her brother 's dessert-plate : tinker , tailor , soldier , sailor -- finishing triumphantly with senator when she came to the last pit
eternal snow , if you like
ah , it was already familiar to their ears ; yet he would wager the cousins had never before rightly grasped its meaning and its majesty : the word was—civilization !
it is probably not only disgraceful , but stupid into the bargain
as for exports , well , we send a little corn to holland and england , it is true
she began to guess
somebody gasped with the effort he made -- then all was still again
wherever heir ballerstedt thought explanation necessary , he puffed himself up , said well !
it was cut with a modest little round neck like a schoolgirl ’ s frock , hardly so much as to show the base of the throat , or the collar-bones , or the slightly prominent bone at the back of the neck , beneath the soft fringes or her hair
the devil fly away with gaffky !
and he was underhanded
he began in a low murmur , so that very few understood his opening sentence or made anything out of it
of course they did not - how should they ?
it was early afternoon
ah , the principles and points of view constantly did that ; it became so hard for hans castorp ’ s civilian responsibility to distinguish between opposed positions , or even to keep the premisses apart from each other and clear in his mind , that the temptation grew well-nigh irresistible to plunge head foremost into naphta ’ s morally chaotic all
they stood and looked out over the dripping slope across the narrow , stony strip of beach , out to the turbid , restless sea
what he actually lacked , in fact , was an emotional bridge between two extremes
that italian who—whom i did not like
strangeness , tension , even suppressed hostility there was of course enough between them ; it is surely rather remarkable that a comparatively insignificant personality could have held them together
afterwards , too , he realized that frau stöhr had nudged dr blumenkohl in the side , and then looked about at their own and other tables , trying to catch people ’ s eyes
for the rest , he asserted his independence to himself and others by the funda- mental refusal to be obliging : when one needed him , he was defi- nitely not to be had
career -- what a lovely word 'career ' is !
the removal of joachim to this stately receptacle , decorated with lions ’ heads and rings , was the sole affair of the man who came along with it , a black-clad functionary of the undertaking establishment which had the arrangements in hand
my own name -- if i may be-permitted to mention it , he continued , waxing eloquent , is-that of most of my forefathers -- bendix
in the beginning it is all pretty good ; but why do you suddenly fall from b major into the six-four chord on the fourth note with a minor third ?
he was quite absurdly surprised to hear that there still existed such things as freemasons ; and diligently plied the terrorist with questions about the origin and significance of this curious body , which in a few years would celebrate its two-hundredth birthday
to es- tablish a fixed relation between the values of the notes did not
feddermann , he said , will you please recite the poem ?
when he laughs he draws the air in through his teeth in little jerks
but the words sounded strained
soon afterwards , however , she prepared to leave tow ! l and fill an en- gagement as jeune prelziere in the provinces , which her teacher , who played father parts at the hoftheater , had got for her
things even went so far that one day the school-mistress , a certain fr�ein agathe vermehren , felt obliged to call upon the frau consul , and , flushed with embarrassment , to suggest with all due politeness that the child should receive a paternal admonition
in other words , they would ask the bathing-master to see the oberin , in order that something might be done to relieve the sufferer
five hundred cows are before your mind 's eye , said gerda , looking at her in the mirror
i can sit down yonder on those boulders
despite his tanned face and broad shoulders his health was not always sound and as a younger man he had spit blood ; in other words , tended to be tubercular
it was an extra occasion , i enjoyed it no end—
we dealt with the matter of our present mode of ex- istence ; and deutschlin protested that it was poor taste for youth to explain youth : a form of life that discusses and examines itself thereby dissolves as form , and only direct and unconscious being has true existence
while they went across the court , thomas said : we will walk a few steps up and down the garden , my friend
war , then , and if needs inust , war against everybody , to convince everybody and to win ; that was our lot , our sending ( the very word we use is germanic , the idea pre-christian , the whole concept a tragically mythological , musical-dramatic motif ) ; that was what fate had willed , and 'we - only we !
you are very kind , papa , the consul 's wife said
there was given to lle a thorn in the flesh , the messenger of satan , to buffet me
but that is just the kind of people you pick out to say such things to ! -- if it is neces-sary to say them at all -- and so you lay yourself open to an insolent snub like that
i happened to hear somebody say so , and it just crossed my mind
i shall not be going too far in saying at once that she is politically suspect
i am only eager to make the acquaintance of the great unknown , the bringer of the terror
he does seem rather weird , was hans castorp ’ s view
i wanted to tell you that i am about to - i told him what i was about to do , told him about helene , how i had met her and we had got to know each other
i am quite willing to give adrian 's favourite vvith the like-co loured eyes due credit for the suggestion
they did so—by the latter
said he , not looking up
he was right not to take the separation seriously
upon which , herr gr� made another deep bow , settled himself again , stroked his beard , and coughed as if to say : well , let us get on
it hovered before him , somewhere in space , remote from his grasp , yet near his sense ; this body , this opaquely whitish form , giving out exhalations , moist , clammy ; the skin with all its blemishes and native impurities , with its spots , pimples , discolorations , irregularities ; its horny , scalelike regions , covered over by soft streams and whorls of rudimentary lanugo
such was his ignorant and hypochondriac judgment , right only as to the unfruitfulness of the result , but there wholly
when they returned , rudolf re- joiced in the prerogative that up to then , from our childhood on , had been mine alone : he and adrian were per due
rudi schwerdt- feger , zinl { and spengler , even schildknapp , they were all there
i think it ’ s quite possible i shan ’ t be able to stop , that i ’ ll have to leave—you wouldn ’ t take it amiss , would you ?
is there perhaps some porter ?
he was a native of north-western germany , and it was common knowledge that when he took the position , years ago , he had done so contrary to his previous intention and plans
let us shut our eyes , safe in eternity !
he was faithful to morning and evening prayers , asked per-mission to attend one of the frau consul 's sunday school classes , and even appeared on a jerusalem evening in the drawing-room and was presented to the guests , but withdrew affrighted when lea gerhardt began to read aloud
then you are a phenomenon worthy of study
we don ’ t feel the cold , hans castorp said , with tranquil brevity
we are at the end , i suppose
then came the ferry , and israelsdorf avenue , jerusalem hill , the castle field
you will tire of it—and then , i am not prudish , not an outraged middle-class housewife—
he had looked on enough at the sport to know the use of his tools ; and choosing for his practice-ground an almost treeless slope not far behind the sanatorium , remote from the hubbub of the spot where other beginners learned the art , he began daily to make his first blundering attempts , watched by herr settembrini , who would stand at a little distance , leaning on his cane , with legs gracefully crossed , and greet his nursling ’ s progress with applause
what do you mean by that ?
he stands still in the doorway , with his flowers held out in front of him , and be-gins straightway to speak
at half past ten the servant came from the house to announce that the frau senator was receiving guests in the salon
he must have been , at bottom , cruelly bored by the small , safe business he did and the petty trans-fer of this or that bit of property ; for this loss , this tragic blow with which heaven had stricken him down -- him , the schemer cosch -- delighted his inmost soul
what i call natural and international law , you are free to call the ius divinum
do you think i ’ ve no eyes in my head ?
yet in their pure white dress they afforded a scene of glorious winter splendour , mounting bold and austere between wooded gorge and wide expanse as we wound among them
joachim availed himself of both , finding they gave relief
there were pots of marmalade and honey , basins of rice and oatmeal porridge , dishes of cold meat and scrambled eggs ; a plenitude of butter , a gruyère cheese dropping moisture under a glass bell
you are right , replied the consul
everything was going well , his predictions seemed about to be verified
no , it doesn ’ t trouble me
but this he only said with his reason—to some extent detached from the rest of him , though after all nearly concerned
stu-pid and lazy both -- it is really too much
its concern is a cosmology proper to fcaisersaschern and its towers : it leads to astrology , to observation of the position of the planets , the constellation and its favourable or unfavourable indications - quite naturally and rightly , for nothing is clearer than the intimate interdependence of the bodies of a cosmic little group so closely bound together as our solar system , and their near neighbourly mutual reference
the first hint came when i saw among his papers a note that he had written with a broad pen-nib : this sadnesse moved dr faustum that he made note of his lamentacyon
then he stood a long time in the death-chamber and looked at the short figure under the covers , at the dead face with the mild features and white whiskers
he saw , he knew , he understood , no least particle more ; he let himself sink deep in the pillows , quite blinded and exhausted by the morsel of truth which had been vouchsafed
have you pupils , master ?
every compassion , every grace , every sparing , every last trace of consideration for the incredulous , im- ploring objection 'that you verily can not do so unto a soul ' : it is done , it happens ,
it is my duty to point out to your tender years the intellectual perils of intercourse with this man , and to beg you to keep your acquaintance with him within safe limits
now for-get the pain , it says
ten minutes later he came back , smiling , if rather pale , and with excuses on his lips for the disturbance
it is the imitation of a theme composed backward instead of for-ward -- a very , very difficult thing
yes , here it is , faust , valentine ’ s prayer
and a tiny , taper-decked tree burned likewise , it was said , in the rooms of the bedridden and moribund—each had his own
n one felt outraged over the dishonesty : they spoke of it as an act of folly , laughed a bit , and shrugged their shoulders
it possessed her altogether
that you will see , answered the consul
no threats were graven upon the bronze tablets , nor did those who came to petition fear the countenance of the judges he read in fear and trembling , read with design badly and disjointedly , purposely omitted some of the elisions that were marked with pencil in kilian 's book , made mistakes in the lines , progressed with apparent difficulty , and constantly expected the master to discover the fraud and pounce upon him
well , all that young hans castorp found worth listening to ; not precisely overwhelming , of a value largely experimental , but still worth listening to
one after another he mentally summoned up various people , the thought of whom might serve him as some sort of mental support
why she should call me young un i can ’ t imagine
and now , with hopeful hearts , we might rlrink together to the family health and to its future -- that future when all the old and elderly of the present company would be laid to rest ; and to the children , to whom the christmas feast most properly belonged
the deep-blue , star-shaped gentian and the autumn crocus , pale and poisonous , appeared again among the damp grass , and a reddish hue overspread the forests
what is there in it ?
you were right to laugh at his ruthful tears - aside from the fact that whoever has , by nature , dealings with the tempter is always at variance with the feelings of people , al- ways tempted to laugh when they weep , and weep when they laugh
he stands there , within the aura of her personality as it sweeps past , idiotic with happiness at the encounter , and at the word which has been uttered by her mouth directly for his ear
more and morc , after the dilatation of the stomach had been cured without diminishing the headaches and nausea , he shifted his explanation of the symptoms to the brain , confirmed therein by the emphatic demand of the patient to be spared the light
it was only necessary that the delicate child should conceal his thin-skinned perceptions and assume an air of unconsciousness ; when there was nothing to prevent his taking friendly advantage of naphta ’ s invitation
but she also - it came out by accident - knew pfeiffering ; had secretly made acquaintance with the setting of adrian 's activity , his immediate surroundings ; had , if i am not mistaken , stood under the window of the abbot 's cham- ber and gone away unseen
rudolf was always com- pliant
i will look on for a while , said he , brushing the wet from his coat
so hans castorp , when asked at table , might add a couple of tenths to his temperature , and could never help feeling flattered when they shook their fingers at him and called him an artful dodger
her room was next to tony 's , divided only by cur tains from it
there was a natural fitness in the fact that after adrian joined us the landscape began to rise and the mountain scenery under snow , though still at some distance , to come into vie , v
we came to the rescue , we freed germany from the invader -- tony , chin in hand , stole a look at him and wondered for a moment if he could have actually helped to drive out napoleon
thus all waited silently for the consul
i have heard him say : the work of art ?
before i forget it , julie would rejoin , would you like one of my apples ?
he is bankrupt , she repeated
but what is politics for , then , if not to give both sides a chance to compromise themselves in turn ?
of course he should have said nuremberg
on the flashing surface of the snow , shadows , so strong , so sharp and clearly outlined that they seemed almost more real than the objects themselves , fell from houses , trees , and telegraph-poles
but what sort of description is that of yourself—an ailing old man ?
no , let us be serious , professore !
the tea stood steaming in the meissenware cups when thomas entered
i wo not urge you
the wind had been two days in the south , the sun bore down , the valley seemed shrunken , the side walls at its mouth looked near and bald
and scien- tific musicality - applied sometimes to such simple material as the arietta theme of the monstrous movement of variations which forms the second part of this sonata
he unfortunately did not succeed in preserving his composure at the nai have and childish outpourings of his sister
i wanted to tell him about helene and of my proposed step , but his renlarks did not precisely en- courage me
what is the flesh ?
lawyer paravant and the magnus couple were still in the hall , frau stöhr and the kleefeld in the salon
for human progress snatched up ever more peoples with it on its brilliant course ; it conquered more and more territory in europe itself and was already pressing asia-wards
she looked him in the face
from them , or from one of them - he left me the choice -life had once , borne by cosmic projectiles or simply by radiation pressure , arrived upon our formerly sterile and innocent planet
well -- er -- i really could not repeat it to a lady
the inheritance is a matter of real importance for us
a gloomy , taciturn look came on his face
the fish-market , how-ever , was held around the fountain in the market-square it-self
i find it very serious
once a woman , perhaps
he had two desires : one of them , the stronger , was to be alone with his thoughts and his stock-taking projects ; and this his balcony assured to him
the dance was beginning
after a while he asked : et toi—où as-tu été ?
hans castorp recalled having heard similar sounds the evening before , though his weariness had prevented him from heeding them : a struggling , a panting and giggling , the offensive nature of which could not long remain hidden to the young man , try as he good-naturedly did to put a harmless construction on them
for instance , he , vas always the last comer at a party , he had to feel himself waited for , other people must always wait for him
i am still young -- do not you think i am still rather pretty ?
but i warn you , castorp , if you are going to give way to your civilian feelings and set up a howl , i ’ ll simply show you the door
she busied herself about the room , summoned the malay to take the coffee-machine , then withdrew awhile , and on her return , softfooted , took part standing in the others ’ talk
but her eyes , too thoughtful to close themselves , slowly followed the movements of a large insect with a long body , which perpetually besieged the glass with a million soundless motions of his wings
perhaps our hero himself was not quite comfortable either ; though he refused to give himself any trouble to wrestle clear of vagueness and involution and arrive at certainty of how much time had gone over his head since he came up here
it did not come
self as descended from the german humanists of the time of the poets
also he occasionally mentioned social affairs , visits , dinners , balls
tony was resting in her room
i beg your pardon , hans castorp said , a hymn to the devil ?
the way he put it , it sounded like shoving music off on me , as though it were more my affair than his
do not deny it -- it would be sacrilege
he had seen them coming along the level path half-way up the slope ; now they were stalking downhill directly towards him ; he heard their voices
it was incomparably more so
your position in the matter is quite clear
this is nice clean work
'how ' means 'what did you say ?
a manifestation of the highest energy - not at all abstract , but without an object , energy in a void , in pure ether - where else in the universe does such a thing appear ?
as he passed through the dark hall , he felt in his pocket for the letter
a gold chain , bequeathed him by his grandfather , now hung about his neck , with the family arms on a medallion at the end -- a rather dismal design , showing on an irregularly hatched surface a flat stretch of marshy country with one solitary ,
it was really more for decorum ’ s sake that she had tried to introduce a little sobriety into the mood of her son , not realizing that precisely the middle course , the golden mean , was impossible up here , and only a choice of extremes offered
there is so much to be done !
its quiet but modish cut was at once marked down by the cousins , whose worldly glances were met by their counterpart , only quicker and keener , from the little man ’ s own side
for , as you probably know , permaneder 's right to my dos , is , legally speaking a property right
hans castorp threw off his covers , sprang up and strode to the corridor door and back
there is a trap door on to the roof from the attic
the few roads kept open were like tunnels , with towering walls of snow on either side , crystal and alabaster surfaces that were pleasant to look at , and on which the guests scribbled all sorts of messages , jokes and personalities
i should think that , as my brother , you could ostensibly take the place he had -- that of confidential clerk
your remark is incomprehensible , settembrini answered him , which doesn ’ t prevent it from being at the same time silly
this had led to a crise de nerves , an outburst of despair on clarissa 's part , which went to the mother 's heart , and seiler had been asked to terminate the training and use his connections to get her a start as a beginner
others besides friends gathered round as well , curious on-lookers , who cut the rest-cure for the sake of the diversion thus afforded
hans castorp interrupted him again
little red spots appear on the breast and abdomen , about the size of a lentil
i must take my cure
in all these years , i have always longed to be out in the world again ; it is so dull here in this house
indeed , he might cherish the thought that in making her his he would be raising and rehabilitating her
i do not see , my dear friend , why my presence -- but no matter
music-stand , and the bas-reliefs of singing cupids over the doors
but how get at the confession ?
it had a view of the ocean , which was the main thing
look , that bench is in a pretty place
asked herr gr� , slowly stiffening
i-iere it often anunted to a rigidity , a more academic than artistic specu- lation in notes , a mosaic scarcely any longer effective musically , seeming rather more to be read than to be heard - and so on
at last they were settled
he had drawn up a chair for his sister beside himself , and slowly drank his tea and ate a biscuit as they talked
she had grown very old , and lived quite alone at the end
it was this very power , quiet yet compelling , that caused consul tienappel all unconsciously to gaze at his nephew ; and now even open-mouthed , for he found his nasal passages obstructed , though , so far as he knew , he had no catarrh
here i am -- and i have come with a heavy heart
frau permaneder loved these visits
i should say so , he answered
some- body once warned him in jest not to make some girl- or it might perhaps have been a married woman - unhappy , and he had actu- ally answered , arrogantly : oh , there are so many unhappy !
one sunday , as she sat in st mary 's with her parents and brothers , pastor k�ng began preaching from the text about the wife leaving father and mother and cleaving only to her husband
after all , these acquirements were premature , they must have burdened his young system , in addi- tion to the preparations for his finals
naphta evidently meant to hold humanity fast to its old , irrational position in the face of established biological fact ; meant to force it to remain at the stage of primitive religion , where death was a spectre surrounded by such mysterious terrors that the gaze of reason could not be focused upon it
and then , when i see her before me i always think : 'you are an old woman with a big daugh-ter , and your life is over
llill not have had nuch joy of him , nor even known ho ' w to take him , at ] cast in so far as they set store by inolfensiveness , expansiveness , friendly responsiveness
afterwards— afterwards , yes , gladly
he propped his head on his hand and read in his mythology bonk , munching mechanically the while , because that was proper to the day : marzipan , sweet-meats , almond cream , and plum-cake ; until the chest-oppression caused by an over-loaded stomach mingled with the sweet excitation of the evening and gave him a feeling of pensive fnlicity
this was the beginning of september
the succession of postcards began with the joyous announcement that joachim was with the colours , and a description of the fanatical ceremony in which , as hans castorp ironically couched it in his reply , he had taken the vows of poverty , chastity , and obedience
but in a boy 's eyes , as i see it again in retrospect , most gay and glorious of all was the comprehensive display of percussion in- struments - just because the things that one had found under the christmas tree , the toys and dream-possessions of childhood , now turned up in this dignified grown-up display
he took up his wanderings again
i feel we understand each other , and now—to the point !
senator buddenbrook carried out his plans
that must be a military trait in my character , after all , if i may say so—
you see what kind of trouble i get into every minute—and me so anxious to go my own simple way , unspotted from the world
it was furnished as a reading- and writing-room , with oak panelling and a light , vaulted ceiling , bookcases , a centre table covered with newspapers in holders and surrounded with seats , and writing appurtenances arranged in the bay-windows
but why , wlen obviously there was no need to take pains ?
the state of his health obliged him to give up his theological studies , after which he spent some years in a school belonging to the society , where he acted as prefect and preceptor of the younger pupils
and came and found them asleep again , for their eyes were heavy
this music has simply nothing in common with the spirit of the sp'ring celebration , which after all was in a certain vay the preparation for it : i mean with the spirit of hum- ble glorification
hans castorp rejoined that it was probably all true ; he and his cousin were naturally more or less prone to such dangers—it was the same old story about the delicate child of life , he understood perfectly
but the air helps us , helps us hear , if you understand what i mean , this thin , dry air up here
it is arsie-versie in the matter , for 't is the brain which gapes at their visitation and looks forward expectantly , as you to mine , that it invites them to itself , draws them unto it , as though it could not bear at all to wait for them
reason is not the highest thing on earth
i pay every homage to reason , settembrini answered
what i ’ d like to say is—i mean , you said , herr hofrat , if i understood rightly , you said : in another relation
well , it ’ s like this : it can not have escaped your acute apperceptions that there is something about your case that doesn ’ t hold water
the remark sounded final ; but he was far from letting the subject drop
then they stood about , looking first at the pump and then at the director , their faces pictures of distress ; and the director , meanwhile , had turned to dr goldener , who hurried up with a very red face and spoke to him in a deep hollow voice , fairly babbling with excitement between the words
oh , certainly -- of course he will buy it
during its progress joachim entered , and sat down by the open balcony door ; his cousin half reclined in his bed , with his head on one side , and his eyes swimming with pious enjoyment as he listened to the mounting harmonies , and bestowed a momentary metaphorical shoulder-shrug upon settembrini ’ s twaddle about music being politically suspect
you reached it after passing the hall , the garderobe , the kitchens and domestic offices ; you could not miss the door , it had a porcelain shield
{ noterich 's craving to make himself heard pla ) ting cello and snorting the , vhile
interjected the frau consul , shocked
the consul quite approved of this , and argued that it displayed love of one 's neighbour , a sense of human fellowship , and a lack of snobbishness
the day had come
this is naturally a thing to keep wry about , but after all not at the length - when the houre-glasse is set , the red sand has begun to run through the fine-fine neck - ah , but only just begun !
but frau schwarzkopf watched tony all the time , to see how much she admired the young man -- and really , it was most interesting , he was so learned and so jolly , all at the same time
but admiration and sadness , admiration and doubt , is that not alrnost the definition of love ?
when you lie here and look at it , from a distance , it makes you shudder
both of them , eh ?
true , he had to pay for it : for full two days—that is to say , for the space of ten meal-times , madame chauchat never looked his way
but we must be clear on this point , \iatthaeus , said he , that the social ideal of an economic social organization comes from autonomous thinking in its nature enlightening , in short from a rationalism which is still by no means grasped by the mighty forces either above or below the rational
on the th of august the news reached me in freising that that remnant of a life had been quenched : a life which had given to my own , in love and effort , pride and pain , its essential content
all this seemed to me so much be- neath his dignity that i wished he had told the truth rather than made the fiddler responsible for the idea ; yet i could not quite suppress the question whether our pixy platonist might not have had a hand in the enterprise
naturally , in his case it was not the same kind , certainly not ; he had what would have been called at home a feverish cold
herr gosch tried to lift his glass to his thin lips , put it back on the table again , cursing through his shut teeth , and struck the offending arm with his fist
it was his fatherly duty to occupy himself a little with the child : so , while the plates were changed , he would examine him and try to stimulate his sense for facts
that was young schwarzkopf , tony answered
on the other hand , if he were overtaken unawares by the storm , he would probably in any case not find his way home
her chin was so deeply buried in her hand that her four bent fingers clutched her under lip
the lame man took them up in the lift to their own storey
leo zink and he were on a cool , sometimes even ticklish footing ; i have often noticed that charmers do not appreciate each other , a fact equally applica- ble to masculine and to feminine conquistadores
it was a sort of half-monthly thousand and one nights ’ entertainment , spinning itself out at will , calculated , like the stories of scheherazade , to gratify the curiosity of a prince , and turn away his wrath
but the comparison has indisputable justice on its side
ru- dolf repeated his wooing , only this time not for adrian but him- self
for the molecule was composed of atoms , and the atom was nowhere near large enough even to be spoken of as extraordinarily small
it was not matter and it was not spirit , but something between the two , a phenomenon conveyed by matter , like the rainbow on the waterfall , and like the flame
he lived in the rambergstrasse , near the academy , as a lodger with the widow of a senator from bremen , named rodde , who with her two daughters occupied a ground-floor flat in a still new house
the frau consul looked toward the glass door and , still embracing her daughter , stretched out her hand to her grand-child , who stood there shyly with her finger to her mouth
i find your train of thought highly edifying , mynheer peeperkorn
the young man took the book in both hands and ran it quickly through , from cover to cover
this was the line he sometimes took
very well , answered justus kroger , sitting down again with a shrug of the shoulders
while he breakfasted below , hans castorp did the same above , his down quilt tucked behind his back , in enjoyment of the good appetite a change engenders
he cast about for means to refine upon the position
there were two curving prongs of bright steel , extremely sharp-pointed ; a slightly spiral centre portion of gold-inlaid ivory , in which the prongs were somewhat movable and could sink up to a point ; and a bulb of semi-hard black rubber
the whole company burst out laughing
for the sake of goodness and love , man shall let death have no sovereignty over his thoughts—and with this—i awake
we scarcely know how to explain why hans castorp , with all his native love of falling water , had never visited the picturesque cascade in the valley of the fluela
in other words , they are the humanistic callings , and if you go in for them you have to study the ancient languages by way of foundation , for the sake of formal training , as they say
but he did not know if such courtesies were practised up here ; probably the established order was more powerful than the rules of chivalry
what you been doing up here ?
hans castorp laughed , to hear his cousin speak thus , quite simply , without explanation
pieter peeperkorn lay grievously ill , the day after that evening of cards and champagne we have described—and no wonder
i must , must not i ?
dh , you can leave that to me , she said , quite undismayed
himself by the unnatural correctness of his language , which he used in order to intimidate the master
the one saving grace was that he could rail at it
he is a born objector , i saw that at once , down on the existing order ; and that always gives me the impression that the person is
by all means i am a humanist , because i am a friend of mankind , like prometheus , a lover of humanity and human nobility
or he would draw up a chair and sit down at the corner of the table , between hans castorp and the schoolmistress , or between hans castorp and miss robinson , and look on while they ate their pudding , which he seemed to have forgone
it changes its meaning ; it abides as a light in t
adrian said that he found spengler intel- ligent and agreeable to talk to
and the consul puts his hand on the old man 's shoulder and gives him a thaler
he could still hear old johann softly humming in the bed room
mon- signor hinterpfortner and i are certainly no longer alone in the trembling - and at the same time , god help us , secretly sustain- ing - realization
and when he stands there and talks , in his guttural dutch voice , there ’ s something unmistakably robust about him
her figure was full and well-proportioned , the impression she made both capable and rustically simple , as one saw her small work-hardened hands , the double widow 's ring on the right one , poised on the firm strong hips , bound by their stiff apron-strings
he closed his burning eyes and groaned
but if he , vas not there , that visitor - and i shudder at the admission which lies in the very words , seeming even conditionally and as a possibility to en- tertain his actuality - then it is horrible to think that those cyni- cisms too , those jeerings and jugglings , came out of the afflicted one 's own soul
and herr consul does not take it ill of me , do ' e , now ?
and then he recited , appropriately and with effect , two of the prayers customary on such occasions
but notwithstanding all the importance he attached to the projected improvement , he jumped away from the theme and demanded that joachim tell him more about life up here and about the guests—which the latter straightway did , being only too pleased to be able to unbosom himself
cyanosis indicated abrupt stoppage , a violent apoplectic arrest of the vital functions
but you are right -- what is there to say ?
sometimes consul kroger or sesemi weichbrodt came too , with her simple sister
somebody must have some esprit , settembrini said , looking straight ahead , with a melancholy air
and finally there was thomas buddenbrook himself , as a somewhat younger man
i will tell you -- it is too new
hand on his shoulder
is that worthy of a brother , you will permit me to ask ?
no , naphta went on
they left behind their own accustomed valley , and the change of scene refreshed their spirits
every one wanted to revise the constitution and the franchise , and the citizens grumbled
the hair half covered the ears , and as i grew up it was slowly silvering ; it was drawn tightly back , as smooth as glass , and the parting above the brow laid bare the whiteness of the skin beneath
she said , with her whole strength ; and looked at them all with a challenge in her eyes
shrove tuesday came on apace ; before one had actually seen it on the way , it arrived
it appeared that the stranger , who might be about settembrini ’ s age , was a housemate of his , the other tenant of lukaçek the ladies ’ tailor
well , i will tell you
hanno and several others did the same
but -- but -- she saw him before her , saw his gold-yellow whiskers , his rosy , smiling face , the wart on his nose , his mincing walk
but i assert they are that the more , and the poly- phonic character of the chords is the more pronounced , the more dissonant it is
he declined to accept that brutal fatum et factum
if you feel any inclination to blub , kindly suppress it
had he enjoyed himself ?
he desired to do so
it won ’ t do you gentlemen any harm , i take it
but now they stood with their mother about their father 's death-bed , weeping ; and a message was sent to meng street , though the feeling was not entirely wanting that their rich relations were somehow or other to blame for this misfortune too
he was tired of the cooking , he said ; they all were , up here , and it was customary to grumble at the food
wait , i have it—it was avdotia
herr gr� had turned his gaze upon her
somebody has been flown away with—by the devil
once again she yielded , to gain a present peace , and was thereby more than ever in his power
this corre- sponded , vith my own feeling
lie must have preserved it for a while and then in some moving to munich , to italy , to pfeiffering , it must have got lost
reason and magic , said he , may meet and become one in that which one calls wisdom , initiation ; in belief in the stars , in numoers
iwersen , the proprietor , a blond giant of a man , in a woollen jacket , was in the doorway with his wife
pastor wunderlich had not changed colour ; he looked as pale , re-fined , and alert as ever , while drinking down glass after glass of wine
but kant has shown in the most forthright words that such a thesis can not support itself be- fore the bar of reason
one word from thy sweet lips
thy life shah be cold , therefore thou shajt love no human being
you aren ’ t like a picture in a physiology-book , there ’ s a hitch here and there , and you haven ’ t cleaned up your gaffky , you ’ ve even gone up a peg or so , it ’ s six this time—but never mind , don ’ t pull a long face , you are better than you were when you came , i can hand it to you in writing
but what 's a man good for , but to wear himself out ?
do not say that , thomas
he had taken a small thermometer from a red leather , velvet-lined case on his table , and put the mercury-filled end under his tongue on the left side , so that the glass instrument stuck slantingly upwards out of his mouth
that villain learned in the law , to , , , horn in a weak moment she had surrendered , used his single conquest to enforce her
mynheer peeperkorn had presided at only one evening festivity in all these weeks ; and the group had taken but one short walk
the more secret they were , the more they required a third party , the intimate friend , the good man , to whom and with vvhom one could talk about them - and that was i i saw it and took my role upon myself
she was sometimes seized by attacks of panic and whimpering , caused by the lassitude which seemed to be constantly on the increase , or by her rising curve ; when she would come sobbing to table , the chapped red cheeks streaming with tears , and wail into her handkerchief : behrens wanted to send her to bed , she would like to know what he had said behind her back was the matter with her , she wanted to look the truth in the face
what joachim had said about his cheeks was fully borne out ; they were really purple , and set off his head garishly against the white surgeon ’ s coat he wore , a belted smock of more than kneelength , beneath which showed striped trousers and a pair of enormous feet in rather worn yellow laced boots
very good , very good
as for tony , the consul was gratified to see with what self-possession she defended her position in the town as a buddenbrook born ; for as a divorced wife she had naturally to overcome all sorts of prejudice on the part of the other families
herr gr� , with measured tread , passed between morten and his mother and went out the door
it had been a gesture not only of deliberate , but also of natural and instinctive disdain ; and that feeling was quite comprehensible to hans castorp
but the way it passed over the tiny intervening unmarked strokes showed that all the figures and divisions on its path were simply beneath it , that it moved on , and on— hans castorp shoved his product of the glashütte works back in his waistcoat pocket , and left time to take care of itself
she gave me a camphor injection , applied icecompresses and friction—and here i am , saved for humanity
there was a red-haired greek girl , another of unknown origin with a face like a tapir ’ s ; the voracious lad with the thick eye-glasses , and another fifteen- or sixteen-year-old youth , with a monocle stuck in his eye , who carried his little finger , with its abnormally long nail shaped like a salt-spoon , to his mouth when he coughed , and was manifestly a first-class donkey—these , and numerous others
hans castorp ate heartily , though his appetite did not turn out quite so stout as he had thought
you are so eager—you are very ambitious—she continued thus to mock him , in her slightly veiled , pleasantly husky voice , with her quaint pronunciation , giving a foreign sound to the r and making the vowels too open , even accenting the word ambitious on the first syllable , with exotic effect ; rummaging and peering the while in her leather bag , whence she fetched out , first a handkerchief , and then a little silver pencil , slender and fragile , a pretty trinket scarcely meant for use—the other , the first one , had been something more to take hold of
our readers will believe us that his antagonist insisted on giving him tit for tat , paying in the newest-minted coin , receiving in his turn another just as good ; thus the conversation proceeded , on the lines laid down
the rest is just a pretty feeble play on words
he commanded them the more absolutely in that , so far as he knew , he had never sought the leadership , but was rather called to it against his intention and desire
i know , morten , she answered gently , looking away from him at the fine white sand sifting through the fingers of her free hand
then there was a quaint old model of a ship ; and right at the bottom a rat-trap
to others , wind instruments , to still others strings a
as for herr gosch , he was not in the habit of sleeping in the daytime , he was glad enough to get a few hours ' sleep at night
herr gr� now said good-bye and departed for hamburg
he narrated with colour and vividness
as for the old frau consul , she was quite prepared to think of the new house as a logical consequence of all the other blessings which had fallen to her lot , and to give thanks to god therefor , accordingly
here now is a third , of quite different mould , not only equalling in disinterestedness those other simpler souls , but even excelling thenl in the ascetic renunciation of any direct approach , the inviolable observance of his privacy , the aloofness , the restraint , the persistent invisi- bility
they had a sweet sound in the ears of the daughters of uncle gotthold
they fetched the patient at her humble lodging , in glorious , frosty-sunny weather , and escorted her through the english quarter , so named after the hotel d ’ angleterre , and along the main street , lined with luxurious shops
he thought his mother had , perhaps ; the others did not seem to be aware
from him he gets the charcoal-burner ’ s faith in reason , freedom , human progress , the whole box of tricks belonging to the classicistic-humanistic virtue-ideology
you must go on alone now , she said
kenness ; so giveth he his soul thereto and cometh among the carrion
natures like adrian 's have not much soul
i have not asked what you would do in this or that case , but what you to-day , now , will do

certainly , of course , james tienappel acquiesced , rather intimidated
from all quarters of the fatherland came long-haired , black-coated gentlemen , to enjoy the pious intercourse and the nourishing meals , and to be furnished with the sinews of their spiritual warfare
not a dressing-gown , for he never used one , even in the mornings , only when he got up in the night and sat an hour or two in his chair
hans castorp turned his attention to the preparations for taking joachim ’ s x-ray
but in that kingdom they know that he who tastes even once of its fruits belongs to them
undoubtedly , though only superficially , as herr settembrini , in his plastic way , had remarked , the comfort on board an ocean steamer did make one forget the element of risk in the circumstances
it was , take it all in all , a happy youth for tony
how angry i have been !
i think i ’ ll just have to present you , as briefly as possible
certainly , of course , hans castorp said
in the modern style of doing business , there is a thing they call usance
he pressed his lips on her brow
ience of religion - ideas both of which have somethi , ng provisional about them , for theology therewith prolonged its life

heaving a sigh , her eye-glass ribbon behind her ear , she had betaken herself thither , since such and only such was the prospect life held out to her
it fills it in and breaks it up , so that there ’ s something to it , something going on—to quote , with due and mournful piety , those casual phrases of our departed joachim , all echo of which so long ago died away
do we really grasp the meaning of the fact ?
suits it to leave the ash long , i don ’ t knock it off more than a couple of times
but do not you think it 's cruel to let me know that only out of in- humanity i am what i am and that humanity is not becoming to me ?
and cherish with affection true
the natural instinct toward industry , common to all these good burghers , began to assert itself : they ventured to bargain a little , to pick up a little business here and there
tell me , engineer , he said , how have your family taken the news ?
our consent , she repeated after a pause , sadly , and rather bitterly as well
i have heard of such things , mostly in hesse , where a few of the landed gentry are in the hands of the jews
she lived in the twilight of her curtained living-rooms , and dreaded the sun , the dust , the crowds of townsfolk in their holiday clothes , the smell of coffee , beer , and tobacco ; and above everything else in the world she hated getting hot and upset
his little round eyes seemed to have sunk deeper in his head , his cheek-bones and his large aquiline nose stood out more prominently than ever , and the ash-blond hair seemed to have been just touched with a pdwder-puff where it parted on the temples
professor kumpf 's good out-and-out ways with the devil were child 's play compared to the psycho- logical actuality with which schleppfuss invested the destroyer , that personified falling-away from god
plastic themes in which the apocalyptic work abounds , rising to his mind , there at once to be checked and chilled , to be bridled and bitted and made to take its proper place in the thole structure ?
he usually drank out of the little gold mug which uncle justus gave him
un- fortunately , my dears , such is the case
you ’ re going to hook it ?
he said , and pressed his hand imploringly—and the latter noted that the excitement of the journey , the sleepless night , the emotion , made joachim ’ s head tremble on his neck , as his own did when he took stock—hans , he said earnestly , come down soon !
