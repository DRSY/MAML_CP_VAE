0	but as for questions , after all i had but one : why did adrian- if he wanted to let marie know that he , vas making plans in order to see her - not address himself to her direct , ring her up , even go to munich , call on the ladies and put his plans before them ?
0	she knocked a short , bony knock , entered almost before he had said come in , and then , upon the threshold , bent round to make sure of the number of the room
0	hans castorp assured himself that he felt only contempt for any propagandist of the republic and the bello stile who went about with his nose in the air , and calmly—with particular calm , although at the same time both febrile and fuddled—lumped the members of both tables together under the title of parthians and scythians
0	dr mantelsack smiled too
0	the alchemistic ritual of the lodges , in later centuries , led many a noble and inquiring spirit to that end—to which i need give no name , for it can not have escaped you that the successive degrees of the scottish rite were only a surrogate , a substitute of the hierarchy , that the alchemistic learning of the master-mason fulfilled itself in the mystery of transubstantiation , and that the hidden guidance which the lodge vouchsafed to its pupils has its prototype just as plainly in the means of grace , as the symbolic mummeries of lodge ceremonial have theirs in the liturgical and architectural symbolism of our holy catholic church
0	he ( laughing through his nose ) : do , re , mi !
0	but not longer ; buddenbrdoks and put on her thick jacket
0	the wedding party was not large : the oberwciler clergyman , the schoohnaster , the justice of the peace , , vith their wives ; from kaisersaschern besides us zeitbloms only uncle nikolaus ; rela- tives of frau leverkuhn from apolda ; a married pair , friend of the leverktihns , with their daughter , from weissenfels ; brother george , the farmer , and the dairy inanageress frau luder - that 'vas all
0	the cemetery was irregular in shape , having begun as a narrow rectangle facing the south , and then thrown out other rectangles on both sides
0	the dutchman had flung back his mighty torso more and more , his kingly head sank lower on his breast , he seemed to be dozing as he talked
0	all that is still very dark ; and the explanation is yet to come
0	it was half-past eleven , and mamsell jungmann and the children were already asleep in the corridor rooms
0	i confide to you the control of the medium
0	there is the position , in round figures , aside from small fluctuations in the capital
0	the return of the lad interrupted this parley , which had been carried on through the doorway
0	principally he saw his cousin , joachim ziemssen , in a strange , dislocated attitude on a bob-sled , riding down a steep course
0	but his father did not seem to be listening
0	he was the professor ordinarius , for whom it was usual to show respect
0	upon my word , one lives at least as well here as at the kurhouse , tony said a quarter of an hour later , as they sat around the coffee-table in the verandah
0	things being as they were between them , and the situation for them both , there was indeed not much to say
0	and i thank you in my turn , most warmly , for your willingness to share with me the great responsibili-ties which would perhaps be too heavy for me alone
0	you are not going to leave us ?
0	she added tonelessly , and i could not help recalling adrian 's words , vhen i first told him about the affair : fie illust see that he gets out of it whole
0	wehsal , however , obviously enjoyed this narrative of a man ’ s rise to success from humble and oppressed beginnings—and in any case there was no ground in it for arrogance , since the good fortune seemed dwindling away again in the prevailing fleshly infirmity
0	old behrens hasn ’ t forsaken you yet , my lad
0	and has hofrat behrens also told you about the germanrussian woman we had here last year—no , year before last—for five months ?
0	should one put down the actual children of the field as the pattern because they possessed organic actuality , while the snow crystals were mere show ?
0	he was holding his punch-glass with his hand at the level of his eyes and twisting the wrist round as he talked and jested with a group of masqueraders
0	october i he read this aloud first ; then turning the paper over , he began , in a voice that was already somewhat tremulous : honoured friends , my modest lay hastes to greet you in these walls : may kind heaven grant to-day blessing on their spacious halls
0	he spoke with sudden earnestness , and a slight flush spread over his face
0	i may be allowed here to say a word on the treatment of the chorus in my friend 's work : this never before attempted break- ing-up of the choral voices into groups both interweaving with and singing against each other ; into a sort of dramatic dialogue and into single cries which , to be sure , have their distant classic model in the crashing answer barrabam !
0	he turned sharply away from the window and gave vent to a little good-natured sigh , smiling familiarly at several pupils
0	hans castorp had heard nothing of her sudden turn for the worse and final exit , else he would gladly have assisted at the last rites , as a comradely attention , if not simply out of his confessed liking for funerals
0	there was no doubt of that ; but he was middle-class , respectable middle-class
0	fraulein weu-hbrodt sat on two sofa-cushions at the top of the table and presided over the meal with tact and discretion
0	i was received at first by an elderly companion , with whom i spoke french , but then gerda came , and we talked as on the day before for perhaps an hour , only that this time we drew nearer together and made still more effort to understand and know each other
0	of old sat freedom on the heights , quoted hans castorp airily
0	you can see for yourself ; there it is
0	the product of a perverted science , laden with death , slopes earthward thirty paces in front of him and buries its nose in the ground ; explodes inside there , with hideous expense of power , and raises up a fountain high as a house , of mud , fire , iron , molten metal , scattered fragments of humanity
0	cried probst , honestly startled , and peered with his pale blue eyes at adrian 's forehead as though he expected it to be glowing with fever
0	no , herr settembrini , there i find you are unjust
0	i will go , without being thrown out
0	thomas buddenbrdok was , in his heart , far from pleased with the development of little johann
0	but some day they get acquainted , and take to each other , only to find that one of the parties is on the point of leaving
0	if i may so express myself -- here he turned again to the consul -- i like best the names which show that the bearer is a christian
0	consul buddenbrddk came from the'harmony -- a reading-c-lub for men , where he had spent the hour after second break-fast -- hark into meng street
0	she was pale and shivered in her soft autumn coat -- from cold , weariness , excitement , and a grief that now and then rose up suddenly and filled her breast with a painful oppres-sion
0	she washed and dressed with quick , eager movements
0	we have as much right as the next person to our private thoughts about the story we are relating ; and we would here hazard the surmise that young hans castorp would never have overstepped so far the limits originally fixed for his stay if to his simple soul there might have been vouchsafed , out of the depth of his time , any reasonably satisfying explanation of the meaning and purpose of man ’ s life
0	lie may have decided
0	thus adrian 's confession in avoidance
0	yet though his tiny destiny fainted to nothing in the face of the general , was there not some hint of a personal mercy and grace for him , a manifestation of divine goodness and justice ?
0	above the house-door , in ornamental gilt lettering , was the word quisisana , by which name the retired little dwelling was known throughout the town , where they pronounced it with a very soft s and a very broad a christian buddenbrook , as senator giescke 's best friend , had obtained entry into quisisana , and been successful there , as formerly with aline puvogel in hamburg , and on other occasions in london , valparaiso , and sundry other parts of the world
0	considered courage , pride , and presumption because i would win glory in this worid , i made \ , rith him a bond and yow , so that all which during the term of four-and-twenty years i brought forth , and which mankind justl ) t regarded with mistrust , is only with his help come to pass and is divel 's work , infused by the angel of death
0	such was the spirit—it was aristocratic in its own special sense , and hans castorp deferred to it , out of an inborn respect for law and order of every sort
0	his friend was a child of aristocratic birth but neglected appearance , a certain count molln , whose first name \\as kai
0	so much is certain
0	what luck , to be called von schilling !
0	schwerdtfeger stood still and looked at the speaker , first in the one eye and then in the other
0	adjoining were the roomy bedchambers , also very sparsely furnished , a third one being opened for us
0	now he blithely took it up again and desisted , 'with entire unconcern , only when adrian for the sec- ond or third time refused to respond
0	all this was making the very oddest impression on our good hans castorp
0	he stood there as pale as at that first examination , which had ended by his being admitted as a patient
0	servant , herr consul , and , throwing his cap on his head and pulling the leather visor well down over his brows , carl smelt ran with great swinging strides down the street , chapter iv when the consul and siegismund gosch returned to the hall , the scene was a more comfortable one than it had been a quarter of an hour before
0	it is the despair of the teacher , for its proneness to display itself in the wrong direction
0	obedient servant , r say
0	it looked , in fact , as though hans castorp would return home in possession of a first-class cold
0	he liked to hold forth on the subject of metaphysical passages from the bible ; and when in a good-natured or discursive mood , he would entertain the boys of the first and second forms with marvellous interpretations of mysterious passages
0	if there is a god , then there is also this distinction
0	according to custom he was bare-headed and overcoatless—and moreover very well dressed , in a dark-blue flannel suit with white stripes
0	great waves , said thomas buddenbrook
0	it was to joachim , though he had the paper in front of his nose , that she had turned with her question ; because he was the older inhabitant of course , whom she had known longer by sight ; but perhaps for another reason as well , because they two might meet on a conventional footing and carry on an ordinary conversation in articulate words ; because nothing wild and deep , mysterious and terrifying , held sway between them
0	he wo not skin us alive , be- cause of our old friendship , and you will get a foundation for your castles in the air
0	heaven has willed otherwise
0	and what i had in me , as i quite clearly know , was that from long ago , even as a lad , i was familiar with illness and death , and had in the face of all common sense borrowed a lead pencil from you , as i did again on carnival night
0	it vas an isolated occurrence
0	he had assembled an apparatus to serve his need : a botanical text-book , a handy little trowel to take up roots , a herbarium , a powerful pocket-lens
0	he sat upright , and more than upright , he sat , so to speak , on tiptoe , for only his shanks touched the chair ; and with flashing black eyes faced the enemy , who turned toward him in assumed surprise
0	she held by the hand an extraordinarily thin small child , dressed in a flowered print frock , with lustreless ash-coloured hair and the manner of a little old maid
0	i beg you , my young friend , not to adopt the phrases current up here , but to speak the language of the european culture native to you
0	the consul puffed at his cigar till it glowed , threw back his head and blew out the smoke , and then went on : you are thinking , of course , that when god calls your dear parents unto himself , we shall have a considerable sum to look forward to -- and so we shall
0	the sun , he might begin , as they took their walks together , will soon be entering the sign of the crab
0	sometimes she gave such heart-breaking sighs as would move a stone to pity
0	it was provided , vith a supply of oxygen , a telephone , high-voltage searchlights , and quartz windovvs all round
0	of righteousness to chew
0	they sympathized with what they recognized ; without this sympathy they could not have recognized it
0	tom asked , to bring her back to her starting-point
0	but alas , every characterization of this kind involves a moral judgment , whether favourable or unfavourable—though , to be sure , each trait of character has its two sides
0	why must this proposition corns up just now , to shake him untimely out of his canny resignation and make him a prey to doubts and suspicions ?
0	father , herr gr� broke out
0	and then , in the sudden pause , there was no sound but the agonizing gurgles of thomas buddenbrook
0	, into the kingdom of the fend£fl and graceful and respect was paid it , the more readily because there were already newer works
0	now that , clavdia , is not spirituel—it even sounds conventional
0	in the winter it was good for coasting , but i was seldom there
0	it seemed that tony , despite frequent correction , had been guilty , not for the first time , of creating a disturbance in the street !
0	then he opened the door into the corridor and called out in an irritated voice : if there were nothing very important to prevent it , would herr brecht kindly make haste -- he was suffering
0	when settembrini spoke behind his back of naphta and his intellectual tendencies , it was always on an appealing note of warning , with a hint that the subject had more than a little of the diabolic about it
0	my poor , great friend !
0	it was an ordinary hour , not long , not short
0	in his blue eyes , under their reddish-brown brows , his fellow citizens read no answer to their curious questioning
0	somebody named uzza had laid hands the chest , the so-called ark of the covenant , as it threatened to slip when it was being transported by wagon , and he fell dead on the spot
0	reason stands simple before him , for reason is only virtue , while death is release , immensity , abandon , desire
0	look at that monstrous type , the inquisitor—for instance , the sanguinary figure of conrad von marburg—and his infamous zeal in the persecution of everything that stood in the way of supernatural domination !
0	in a word , hans castorp envisaged in this opening affair between him and the heedless creature who was a member of the berghof society no more than a holiday adventure
0	i ’ m positive she is married
0	my soul , think not on it !
0	take our great cities , the centres and foci of civilization , the crucibles of thought !
0	then of course kapellmeister sacher , who had arranged the concert , dr andrere , the regular conductor of the tonhalle , and dr schuh , the excellent music- critic of the neue zuricher zeitung - all these were present with their wives
0	but then he was roused by fresh vomiting , skull-splitting head- ache , and convulsions that shool { his small frame
0	but pre-cisely this casual , indiscriminate acknowledgment irritated thomas , for it had the appearance of setting no value upon superior capacity , earnestness , or respectability
0	he asked , and looked very embarrassed
0	( there , in fact , he really was sitting , his great hands folded before his place )
0	for it is like a dream to me , that we are sitting like this—comme un rêve singulièrement profond , car il faut dormir très profondément pour rêver comme cela
0	madame driinlich did not fail to tell the story at the table , so that even the frau consul burst out into her sputtering kroger laugh
0	in his cantata adrian might if he chose trans- form that cry of human and divine agony into the masculine pride and self-confidence of his faust 's sleep quietly and fear nothing !
0	i tnight com- pare his absentness to an abyss , into which one 's feeling towards him dropped soundless and without a trace
0	the high school of the resort had cannily secured the services of this distinguished latinist—the pupil of a religious house , as settembrini father vaguely expressed it—and it went without saying that he was an adornment to his position
0	the first engagement in celle had come to an end and the next one had not carried her much further : she was playing the juvenile lead in remote east prussian elbing
0	there was a singer there from the court opera , who sang songs , and a young artist , who asked me to sit for him , which i refused , as i thought it not suitable
0	i have preserved a letter which adrian sent to me at that time to freising from pfeiffering , where he was at work on the hymn of a great multitude , which no man could number , of all nations , and kindreds , and people , and tongues , standing before the throne and before the lamb ( see durer 's seventh sheet )
0	to tell the truth , however , i am hardly a very passionate man , though i have my passions , phlegmatic ones
0	with amazement , with tears of joy in my eyes , yet secret and loving concern , i read and heard , from week to week , what he put on paper : in the neatest , most precise , yes , even elegant notation , betraying not a trace of spasms
0	you work not because you must , but as master and head , and let others work for you , and you have the control , make your calculations , and are free
0	naphta replied : there can be no such triumphs as those you speak of ; for the authority is man himself—his interests , his worth , his salvation—and thus between it and truth no conflict is possible
0	beyond them was the throng of officials , clerks , grain-porters , and warehouse labourers
0	had kaisersaschern ever released him ?
0	i do not know what it was : i only know it is too much for my poor brain
0	and bach -- why , good heavens , you know how he was reproached for his want of melody and clearness !
0	for one would usually con-
0	his gaze grew dim , the unconscious tension of the features relaxed , the strained and swollen look about the lips notably diminished ; the beauty of early manhood visited once more our joachim ’ s quiet brow , and all was over
0	public property , was it ?
0	i came here to be in peace and quiet
0	his little book on church music was recommended for private study in several conservatories , and his fugues and chorals were played now and then where an organ sounded to the glory of god
0	the collection of the establishment was an amplification of the literature found in a dentist ’ s waiting-room—in many languages , profusely illustrated , and offered free of charge
0	his son was in fact often his superior when it came to a quick decision upon the advan-tageous course
0	yes , but that was the influence of the
0	but the thing about himself which he did not know , which he never studied and described , but which none the less grew worse and worse , was his singular lack of tact
0	a mist lay over the town
0	there was no stir of air , not so much as might even lightly sway the treeboughs ; there was not a rustle , nor the voice of a bird
0	i often found him at such studies and at written instrumentation
0	yes , they were , in the sense that they were the core of a period when with my senses at their freshest i was freely seeing , searching , and gathering in
0	i don ’ t want to wound you , and i admit that your mental state is a quite choice and par ticular mess
0	piz michel and tinzenhorn , in the notch— you can ’ t see them from here—have snow all the year round
0	one could temporarily suspend the irritability to sensation of every form of living matter in the plant as well as in the animal kingdom ; one could narcotize ova and spermatozoa with chloroform , chloral hydrate , or morphine
0	after the draught he would proceed thus , choking off with one hand the conversation , making a silence round him , as a conductor hushes the confused sounds of tuning instruments and collects his orchestra to begin a number ; mastering at will any situation , for could anything resist that regal head , with its aureole of white hair and its pallid eyes , the great folds of the brows , the long whisker and shaven raw upper lip ?
0	it was good that the coffin was now to be closed , the lid screwed on ; that the hour for removal was at hand
0	the mornings were very dark , breakfast was taken by the light of the artificial moon that hung from the vaulted ceiling of the dining-room , above the gay stencilled border
0	the frau consul , deeply moved , embraced her eldest-born
0	the plan , as he had said , was originally schwerdtfeger 's , hut i would probably understand his , adrian 's , wish that they should not get that im- pression in pension gisela
0	not only the persons involved felt the shock of these events ; the whole circle shared the shattering effect
0	it was odd , after all
0	no , you have nothing to do with the devil
0	oh , tony , be brave , said the senator
0	sit tibi terra levis
0	he had always pictured him as an officer ; but here he was in grey uni , looking like everybody else
0	con- tending that it had often been highly christian characters , bowed down by conscience , refined by suffering , their view of life marked by melancholy , from whom had come great things in art
0	and so it was in the lectures as well : and so it went in associa- tion with his fellow-students , the members of the christian stu- dents ' union winfried , which he had joined on external grounds and whose guest i sometimes was
0	and as thus a beginning had been made , he arranged on the same day with alfreda schildknecht a visit to her patient , fritz rotbein , who was as bored with life as his nurse , though to him , unless all signs failed , only a short term still remained
0	let me suggest to you , my son , that you yourself are ignoring the duty and respect which you owe to your mother
0	short trips on errands 'were given up , the last one having been made to buy toys for tie dead child
0	human devotion he accepted , i would swear often unconsciously
0	he had , as he t ?
0	when hans castorp thought of her hard , crabbed face it made him shiver
0	thy prospects are poor
0	tom and gerda made plans to go to the christening , and tony 's head was full of giving them an elegant reception
0	hans castorp could seldom refrain from caressing them with his hand , or stroking his cheeks with them as he went on his walks—their softness and freshness were irresistible
0	he came out of the diningroom leaning on his cane , dressed as usual in his pilot coat and yellow check trousers , looked about him with his critical , alert , and elegant air , and approached the cousins ’ table
0	from now on he had lessons twice a week from wendell kretschmar
0	whenever i see one of these , for in-stance -- he picked up one of the heavy silver spoons and turned to madame antoinette -- i ca not help wandering whether they belong to the set that our friend the philosopher lenoir , sergeant under his majesty the emperor napoleon , had in his hands in the year -- and i think of our meeting in alf street , madame
0	she coughed almost constantly ; and all her finger-ends were plastered up , as they had running sores
0	lo , he is silent , the highly prejudiced presiding officer announces once more ; and all the priests acain unanimously declare him guilty
0	it did not—only the misery remained
0	it was a simple motif which he employed -- a mere trifle , an unfinished fragment of melody in one bar and a half
0	the frau consul had brought a silver collapsible cup , and they scooped up the water from the little stone basin directly under the source and refreshed themselves with the iron-impregnated spring
0	the painted statues seemed to stand out white and proud on their pedestals against the sky-blue background
0	signs enough were present to prove such doubting uncalled for
0	and the captain , already white-haired and rather deaf , had retired from his office -- and madame griin-lirh was not a goose any more !
0	afterwards one could hardly find pleasure in anything in that field
0	it is annoying but not serious , nobody troubles about it , probably not even the fair one herself
0	mr richardson , threadneedle street , is , as you know , a close business friend of our house ; i consider myself lucky to have placed both my sons with such friendly-disposed firms
0	his fluctuating health had constrained him to give up his last undertaking , the champagne and spirit agency
0	he expected nothing good
0	magnificent , he said , between clenched teeth
0	why should not they be , -- you know ?
0	now , then : after centuries of disfavour these principles and standards are being resurrected by the modern movement of communism
0	a yellow wainscoting ran round the lower part of the wall , and above it the bare white-washed surface was decorated with a few maps
0	my opinion is that he will buy the whole property , live here in the front , and utilize the back part in some other way
0	will you tal { e offence at my criticism ?
0	the chapter just finished is also , for my taste , much too extended
0	but now i had to laugh , yet at the same time was amazed when the gentlemen at this point came upon the subject of dental medicine and quite objectively began to talk about adrian 's and my symbolic musical critique of the dead tooth
0	were they , those children of the sun , so sweetly courteous to each other , in silent recognition of that horror ?
0	why , man , you ’ re bound to have perfect command of the language before long ; and that will be a great advantage to you if there should be a war—which god forbid
0	you went in a circle , gave yourself endless trouble under the delusion that you were accomplishing something , and all the time you were simply describing some great silly arc that would turn back to where it had its beginning , like the riddling year itself
0	in his narrow , dark little office , however , he had a large book-case filled with poetry in every language , and there was a story that he had been engaged since his twentieth year on a translation of lope de vega 's collected dramas
0	actually it was the suite of dramatic grotesques , whose themes , so we heard , he had taken from the old history and anec- dote book , the gesta rolnanorum
0	gradually they all moved over to the landscape-room , where they sat with their plates round the table
0	personally , i am convinced that rhadamanthus was actuated simply and solely by artistic feeling when he made this fossil head overseer of his chamber of horrors
0	often and often , in these days , i have thought of a turkish proverb ; it says , 'when the house is finished , death comes
0	i have something for you : a little rhymed epigram from the french
0	there are always such peo-ple -- they are too funny for words
0	they were not separate and without all connection , for the present state had been preparing in the former one and to some extent had already been contained in it - just as indeed , on the other hand , the outbreak of the healthy and creative epoch was by no means a time of enjoyment , but rather in its own way one of affliction , of painful urgency and compulsion
0	i would tell him father- stories , i too
0	he held nepomuk 's hand , gazed into the starry eyes , and soon was lost in the sweet depths of that azure upturned smile
0	but he had a way of adapting what he picked up and giving it a personal character which took from his adaptatins anything that might sound ridiculous , if not everything boyisll and derivative
0	johann buddenbrook felt keenly the cloud on his wife 's family and looked with the more anxiety to the future of his own children
0	and she had strained her ear to hear too , but even at dinner she did not succeed , and somehow it did not seem proper to ask
0	everything—from the moment when an emanation from his nephew had first whispered to the consul that his undertaking had small chance of success—everything about the situation fulfilled itself , simply , inevitably , up to the end , and hans castorp accompanied the process with his melancholy , fatalistic smile
0	consul tienappel ’ s temples , covered with thin blond hair , showed swollen veins
0	and now the speaker described beethoven 's condition in the year , when his hearing , attacked by a resistless ailment , was in progres-
0	flushed of face , she drew hans castorp ’ s hand between hers to her breast , and looking at him as though she feared to hear , put her hurried , almost shamefaced queries
0	an unassuming young man was travelling , in midsummer , from his native city of hamburg to davos-platz in the canton of the grisons , on a three weeks ’ visit
0	i would give them something for it
0	once , when she was alone in the room with hans castorp and the patient , who was not asleep but lay on his back with open eyes , she actually made the remark : who would have dreamed i should ever come to tend the last illness of either of you ?
0	he already looked forward seriously and eagerly to his career
0	i should die , said she
0	said the con-sul 's wife , displeased
0	she over-saw kitchen , larders , linen and china cupboards , she made the most important purchases , she read to little erica , made clothes for her dolls , and fetched her from school , with a slice of french bread , to take her walking on the mill-wall
0	the pupils could not understand it , but had settled down to regarding it with a sort of embarrassed dislike , and to thinking of the two friends as outlaws and eccentrics who must be left to their own de-vices
0	the living , after all , had their rights—and so on
0	the turkey , stuffed with chestnuts , raisins , and apples , was universally praised
0	piano reduction , clcllanced a rough , mat paper , quarto format , wide margins , and notes printed not too close together
0	now he would hear his name , he would get up , he would not know a line , and there would be a row , a loud , frightful catastrophe -- no matter how good a mood dr mantelsack might be in
0	i want to ask you something very serious
0	the sense of mourning still lay too heavily on the air for tony to give expression to her outraged feelings in livelier or stronger terms
0	a physician might have ascribed the veiled effort in his gaze , a certain sensitiveness at the temples , to migraine ; and jonathan did in fact suffer from headaches , though moderately , not oftener than once a month and almost without hindrance to his work
0	which , in fact , it did
0	it was this : that on certain days , i e , under certain weather conditions , and in certain states of mind , he could not see an open window without having a horrible and in-explicable impulse to jump out
0	may i , even at the risk of being tiresome , try to follow that a little further ?
0	not that he was in reality less of an important 'and indis-pensable personage than he always had been
0	bury your talons in its entrails , make your beak drip with its blood—
0	it robbed the year of its articulation , made it tediously brief , or briefly tedious , as one chose to put it ; and confirmed another of joachim ’ s disgusted utterances , to the effect that there was no time up here to speak of , either long or short
0	said the consul , as he came to the table and lifted up the plate with which his soup was covered
0	thanks , we can exchange
0	from eight to ten
0	ade down to the ground - all these gave a sense of continuity with the past
0	that there ’ s always the devil to pay , responded the pneumotomist
0	but his credit had been inexhaust-ible , he had had capital from the banks , and for his undertakings continual endorsement from sound houses like senator bock and consul goudstikker
0	so herr settembrini would condemn the church for lack of democracy , for being wanting in a sense of the value of human personality ?
0	we seem to be cured , he said , no fever , free of infection , as good as ripe for the world again
0	they cited de tocquevillc , who had said that out of revolu- tion as out of a common source two streams issued , the one lead- ing men to free arrangements , the other to absolute power
0	she looked to him like a seamstress or home dressmaker , the idea being suggested by the fact that she took only coffee and buttered rolls for breakfast ; since his childhood he had always somehow associated dressmakers with coffee and buttered rolls
0	the smallest unit of time was the month , settembrini had said ; and as hans castorp ’ s stay was less than that , it amounted to nothing ; it was a week-end visit , as hofrat behrens put it
0	asked dr langhals , looking with his shallow eyes into hanno 's face
0	he had been exhausting himself , all this time , with a false start
0	in matter certainly they were a little vague , they might have been called lectures on the psychology of religion - and very probably were
0	\lve did not under- stand the frantic jubilation of the world over the result of the battle of the marne ; over the fact that the short , var on which our salvation hung had turned into a long one , which we could not stand
0	settembrini shrugged his shoulders
0	of course they were ill—but , after all , these young folk up here did have peculiar social standards !
0	we feel like the nobility , and we realize the differ-ence ; we should never try to live where we are not known , where no one understands our worth , for we shall have nothing but chagrin , and be laughed at for our arrogance
0	the great schoolmen of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries were agreed that what is false in theology can not be true in philosophy
0	do you know you have sensibly risen in my estimation ?
0	on the steps to the second storey she met ida jungmann , to whom she whispered in a suffocated voice
0	scarcely had she entered when herr permaneder sprang up and went to meet her wilh tremendous enthusiasm
0	the beautifying , veiling , ennobling , i mean , is
0	i have told you already , said the consul , that i can-not be responsible for leaving my innocent child in misfortune -- and i might add that you can not , either
0	said bullinger , using a phrase now in favour among stricter connoisseurs , who rejected the sentimental lovely
0	he is on his guard
0	when one says ( germany ' and declares that to be his connecting link , he does not need to validate it at all
0	no , the main thing was , he wanted to pay his respects to the frau consul and -- see frau sriinlich again
0	serted that in all time composers had secretly nested in their writ- ings things that were meant more for the reading eye than for the ear
0	now and then they would make a half-mechanical effort to lift the glass , but their hearts were no longer in it
0	i felt that in a way i had always loved him and i must confess that my sympathy for him was far stronger than for her , the un- happy creature who by suffering and by pain-deadening , de- moralizing vice had been worked up to the revolting deed
0	just imagine : only a short time before i was engaged , i did not even so much as know that the confederation decrees concerning the universities and the press had been renewed four years be-fore !
0	he sympathized - and at the same time found it all so unnatural that he even took his monocle out of his eye , thus robbing his face of every gleam of intelligence
0	it is twenty-two years since , almost before my eyes , clarissa rodde the actress , sister of the just as obviously doomed inez , went to her death : at the end of the winter season of - , ill the month of lvlay , at pfeiffering in her mother 's house and with scant consideration for that mother 's feelings , with rash and reso- lute hand she took her life , using the poison that she had long kept in readiness for the moment when her pride could no longer endure to live
0	when we were children , i boxed his ears in the open street , for very good reasons ; and his precious little sister julchen nearly scratched me to pieces for it
0	henri 's family , henri himself should learn of their relation if she did not yield to him again
0	to utter it is equivalent to the obligation of justifying the feeling , and that is hard to do without putting myself and others in a somewhat laughable light
0	was it hofrat behrens ?
0	he will continue to take his walks abroad , displaying outwardly his usual mingling of civic pride and self-satisfaction : but he will bear down with him into the grave the secret chagrin of never having been elected senator
0	the cards were covered with futilities , they had all done their worst , and now the current had set in another direction
0	the room was familiar to him from the hours he had spent here , behind joachim ’ s back , in conversation with the psycho-analyst
0	for the creature not only laughed at him , but shook her head and gave it as her view that there must be something wrong , it certainly had a bad smell , when a fine lusty chap like him all of a sudden was just not up to it , he must be possessed , somebody must have given him something - and so on
0	he did this despite his firm intention to get up the next morning at half-past five , to do some most necessary preparation
0	but contrary to some rather exaggerated expectations , mercurius climbed no further than before—though hans castorp kept the instrument under his tongue eight minutes for good measure
0	meanwhile , first her father would draw her aside and speak seriously , and then her mother would take up the tale , both pressing for a decision
0	it will be a pity for erica , if it turns out badly ; but i feel most for tony
0	but i am not insulting you , herr gr� , said tony , repenting her brusqueness
0	a part of their torment and lust of shame standeth therein that they must cogitate the extremity of filthiness
0	'think it over till this afternoon , finished the senator , and went into the dining-room
0	not a soul felt any qualms before it , and it even promised occasion for entertainment and mischief
0	but i have been thinking about these questions lately , in the rest-cure ; and i find it wonderful , i find it a simply priceless arrangement of things , that the formal , the idea of form , of beautiful form , lies at the bottom of every sort of humanistic calling
0	he had a hundred times regretted the building of his new house , which he felt had brought him nothing but bad luck
0	if so , she was the blood sister of inez institoris , the beloved - or ci-devant beloved - of rudi schwerdtfeger
0	and he uses the word virtue just like that , without the slightest embarrassment
0	i agree with everything except the relations after the flesh , which obviously must at all times have subsisted , since man is a highly developed vertebrate , and , like other creatures of his kind—
0	and if anybody had ever had the temerity to call his attention to it , that person would have been for ever deprived of even the chance of be-coming a favourite and being called by his first name
0	the opera of the south , a high-hearted , light-hearted ravishment ; the german , racy of the people , whimsical , hobgoblinish ; and both grand and comic opera in the french style
0	i have always been rather reserved
0	instead of glory to the lord ?
0	for there is one thing which he does not know at all ; with respect to one fact , he labours in complete darkness
0	he saw the single-celled organism of the fructified egg on the point of being transformed into a multiple-celled organism , by striation and division ; saw the cell-bodies attach themselves to the lamellæ of the mucous membrane ; saw the germinal vesicle , the blastula , close itself in to form a cup or basin-shaped cavity , and begin the functions of receiving and digesting food
0	the thing was that they were practical men , more naturally , more vigorously , more im-peccably practical than he was himself
0	i must permit myself to remark that my time is limited , my carriage is waiting , and i am really obliged to ask for the favour of a few words with you
0	the sight was no longer strange , it was already right familiar ; and as on those earlier occasions , only in still greater degree , he bore himself in the presence of death with a responsible air , quite self-controlled , showing no nervous weakness , if some natural dejection
0	but at this question the night closed in again upon him
0	it was not to klopfgeissel 's mind , he did not want to go with them
0	it says underneath 'the boys ' magic horn
0	did herr settembrini remember that the greatest poet of the middle ages , wolfram von eschenbach , could neither read nor write ?
0	but at length saturday came , school was over for the week , and herr brecht 's little drill had bored and buzzed away in the mouth for the last time
0	her daughter 's future had troubled her for years ; for erica was at a disadvantage compared with other young girls of her age
0	he silently apostrophized the oncoming one
0	hans castorp modestly mentioned the figure
0	action like that of bad food , the mere sight of a dish of straw- berries could make the skin of an allergic person break out ; yes
0	the prevailing temper did not permit hans castorp to laugh , as he would otherwise surely have done , at this rapid fire of boxes on the ear
0	she got out what is the matter with you ? -- but the tears were already rising
0	but mynheer peeperkorn , after a few bites , dismissed the whole as kickshaws—dismissed them with a scorn which gave dismaying evidence of the uncertain temper of this lordly man
0	he was also wrangling inwardly with joachim , who had not wanted to join the society on the verandah after luncheon , and had drawn his cousin against his will into the stillness and seclusion of the garden , until such time as they should go up to their balconies
0	i can only repeat that paragraphs and asterisks are in this book merely a concession to the eyes of the reader , and that i , if i had my way , would , vrite down the , vhole in one burst and one breath , without any division , yes , without paragraphing or inter- llissions
0	so now you have it
0	he held up his forefinger , close to his tired eyes
0	that proved again , he said , the relation between llusic and astronomy , as it had been shown already by pythagoras ' cos- mic theory of harmony
0	even christian appeared now and then , when there was nobody at the club , drank a little glass of benedictine , and talked about a project he had of opening an agency for champagne and brandy
0	that sum , translated into gulden , had at last safely reached herr permaneder 's hands , and herr permaneder had invested it securely and not unprofitably
0	such masses of snow as hans castorp had never till now in all his life beheld
0	( retschmar 's direction : the six- to eight-part choruses , the fugue , vith the three themes for string quintet vvrith piano accompaniment , the sym

0	i do not know what else to do but send them both to you
0	these papers , he said , bear the stamp , in french , of the international league for the organization of progress
0	gotthold 's eyebrows went up again under his hat , and his eyes fixed themselves on his brother with an expression of suspense
0	do you think , he said to tony , that i have a candle to go to bed by ?
0	o germany , thou art undone !
0	the estate , with its splendid , comfortably modernized eighteenth-century manor-house , com- prised enormous wheat-growing tracts and extensive sugar-beet
0	one after another joachim passed easily through the stages of his chosen vocation , whose difficulties were smoothed away by the interest of his superiors and his own passionate love for the service
0	but let it go , tom
0	he was dispensed from the duty of going to the military academy , as he had already studied some semesters , and from the cornetcy
0	that music turns the equivocal into a system
0	thus passed the second hour , while the guitar was strummed or the gramophone gave out the contents of the album of light music into the twilight to which they had again accustomed their vision
0	chide her ; but she assured them she had not blushed in that sense
0	her faithful , loving heart , just then , in its weakness , yes , she admitted , in its weakness , about to while away an hour with him in dance and song ?
0	if it did happen to any of them , it would be a sure sign that they were not sound , but diseased , and they would not react to the appearance with emotions of horror and by taking to their heels , but treat it as though it were entirely in order , and begin a conversation with it—this being , in fact , the reaction of a person suffering from a hallucination
0	'then go , in god 's name , jean
0	years on end they had to practise the sacred craft , the fundamentals of harmony and the strict style before they were allowed to make a song , and this music-teaching had not the faintest connection with any little friend
0	mais c ’ est un sauvage ! —
0	y say that the tilnes are not precisely favourable to the steady pur- suance of such a work as this
0	every-thing depends on the question i have already asked you
0	it seems to me you are contradicting yourself ; first you say our cases are different ; then you say they are alike
0	you would be right to deny it
0	i keep it in readiness for the day when i can ’ t stand this farce any longer , and do myself the honour to bid you a respectful adieu
0	neither in familiarity with the features peculiar to life as lived up here—a familiarity impossible to achieve in so few days , which , as he was quite aware , and had even said to joachim , he could hardly hope to acquire in the three weeks of his stay—nor in the adaptation of his physical organism to the prevailing peculiar atmospheric conditions
0	if anything hit him -- ' certainly , my dear
0	his face glowed rosy-red with dry , internal heat , a sign that for this child of the lowland , bred in an atmosphere that rejoiced in a high degree of humidity , acclimatization could only consist in getting used to not getting used to it—which , in fact , rhadamanthus himself never did , being perpetually purple-cheeked
0	i say all this only in order to explain the discomfort caused in me at times by my stay in halle and my participation in adrian 's studies , the lectures that i followed as a guest hearer in order to hear what he heard
0	well , that happens , tom
0	it was no pleasure excursion
0	yes , certainly it had a religious emphasis , he ipoke as a theologian , and he spol { e by no means with contempt
0	i have seen him serve nicely at table
0	of course , the other answered , not for nothing was it famous far and wide
0	kretschmar , before he left leipzig to become first kapellmeistcr in the liibeck state opera house , saw to the publication of the brentano songs
0	i am not at all masculine in the sense that i see in another man only a rival male and nothing more
0	he mentally addressed herr settembrini
0	in fact , the personal was here the decisive factor
0	should she ask him to repeat it ?
0	yet conscience still urged him to continue in the effort ; so clearly that often , as opportunity arose , he would even invite the italian to discourse on the subject of his ideas
0	i conjure you , madame , to tell me !
0	for me the talk , vas a real sacrifice
0	he spread the news of his cousin ’ s return , and all those who had been the young man ’ s friends were glad and sorry and both quite sincerely ; for his clean and chivalrous personality had been universally approved , and there was a sort of unspoken feeling that joachim had been the best of the lot up here
0	and went back , to the end that he and she might meet on the way , since that afforded a keener throb than when she merely walked in front of or behind him
0	one ought to be just
0	it ’ s all the same to us up here , remarked the dislocated joachim ; and then it was he and not the gentleman rider who was coughing in that horribly pulpy manner
0	the truth was that the consul 's estate was more considerable than any one had supposed
0	tony dropped her stocking and looked thoughtfully into armgard 's face
0	many a turn of phrase in musician 's jargon came not from the acoustic but the visual , the note-picture : for instance , one speaks of occbiali because the brol { en drum-basses , half-notes that are coupled by a stroke through their necks , look like a pair of spectacles ; or as one calls cobbler 's patches ( rosalia ) certain cheap sequences one after another in s : :ages at like intervals ( he wrote examples for us on the blackboard )
0	then i would better do it
0	those were three worries
0	but which devil was it he had been giving ground to just now ?
0	so long ago , indeed , that we wonder if the reader is clear how long ago it was
0	he suffered the man to carry his overcoat as they went on their walks together , and wehsal did this devotedly ; suffered even the conversation of the mannheimer , which was depressing to a degree
0	he took the liberty of remaining seated , because it looked less formal , and gestured with his head and hands most charmingly as he proposed a toast to the two ladies of the family , madame antoinette and the frau consul
0	to-morrow , after midday meal , i have my regular monthly examination
0	you can look at the pietà from the sofa
0	/ i have never loved him -- he has always been repulsive to me/ you know that
0	i certainly must have some fever ; otherwise i simply can not explain it
0	these are human topics we are treating of ; human in the sense that they have to do with freedom and the spirituel—you must pardon me if i use a rather ambiguous terminology , but i needed the expression lately , and made it my own
0	delighted to find favour in the eyes of a colleague
0	yes , he was already quite tall , was little johann
0	he answered : i don ’ t quite understand , herr settembrini
0	she drank from an invalid cup , all her fingers decked to the joint with opals , amethysts , and emeralds ; in no long time she had told her guests her story , the golden ear-rings swaying as she talked
0	the consul closed the portfolio and stowed it away carefully in a drawer at the back of the desk
0	this is , of course , only the beginning of a stream of callers
0	the baroness gleichen moved about , seeking sympa- thy for the obscure fatality that had befallen her and her hus- band : you know about this ennui we have had , she was saying to all and sundry
0	successful social reform would have robbed them of their necessary justification , as it would the wretched of their sanctified state
0	he was then , in the spring of , in vienna , where in the ehrbar hall and in the setting of one of the so-caljed anbruch evenings rudi schwerdtfeger at last and finally pla ) ted the violin concerto written for him
0	her position was no longer tenable
0	to whom should i write ?
0	she cried out , aston-ished , turning around on her sand-heap
0	we will just have to sit on the rocks
0	his days were consumed by nervous pedantry : harassed by a thousand details , all of them unimportant , he was too weak-willed to arrive at a reasonable and fruitful arrangement of his time
0	well , let 's be quick , then , wenzel ; there 's no time to lose , evidently
0	i have still to mention a letter from herr van der kellen , from which i was pleased to learn that you are a favoured guest in his family circle
0	i don ’ t know if i ’ ve to flatter myself over the title , but i like the sound of it at least , i must say that
0	she sat reading her home letters , which were written in round hand , and drinking tea the colour of blood
0	the frau consul said : my good man , we will take our walk first , and after an hour or so we should like luncheon served up above -- but not too high up ; say perhaps at the second landing
0	i-ie seemed grown smalle
0	yes , he thought , there was a difference , after all , between this light , soft , white powder he trod with his skis , that weighed down the trees , and covered the open spaces , a difference between it and the sand on the beaches at home , to which he had likened it
0	i have described the coolness of our parting in halle
0	he would not dis-illusionize the deep solemnity of his mood by making him buddenbrodks practise commonplaces
0	even the complaints which at first joachim had so frequently and loudly voiced at missing the manœuvres , and neglecting the service in general , he voiced no more
0	on thursday , when consul buddenbrook and the ladies from broad street , consul kriiger , clothilde , sesemi wiechbrodt and erica came to tea , she talked vividly about munich
0	but out of the corner of his eye he looks - or perhaps not quite looks , perhaps his blue eyes are only the slightest shade turned from a direct gaze up at the platform and towards the corner where she stands and waits
0	her strongly developed family sense was instinctively hostile to conceptions of free will and self-development ; it inclined her rather to recognize and accept her own characteristics wholesale , with fatalistic indifference and toleration
0	he will never get to be a master , poor chap !
0	when i came back to leipzig , once more a civilian , i found my friend unchanged in his walks and ways
0	anyhow , i shall marry again
0	joachim ’ s rounded back expanded and so remained ; the assistant , at the switch-board , pulled the handle
0	to save and conserve paper meant to save cellulose , meant the conservation of our forests , the protection of human material that was used up in the manufacture of cellulose and paper—human material and capital
0	and now began a festival , a triumph , an unbounded orgy of this very figure , which now displayed a wealth of dynamic colour which passed through every octave , wept and shivered in tremolo , sang , rejoiced , and sobbed in exultation , triumphantly adorned with all the bursting , linkling , foaming , purling resources of orchestral pomp
0	hard to say why , but in his mouth , alto- gether in connection with him , there was something dismaying about it , something wherein anxiety mixed in an odd way with reverence
0	senator buddenbrook sat alone in the living-room , which was done in olive-green rep , with a large round centre-table and a great gas-lamp hanging down over it from the ceiling
0	he is lumpy and lazy , and he caused you a cruel disappointment
0	i only say to myself that wherever theology is , and certainly in so meaty a personality as ehrenfried kumpf , there too the devil belongs to the picture and asserts his complementary reality to that of god
0	the social life of meng street had been extinguished with the death of consul johann buddenbrook
0	they reached a rotunda with covered galleries , where a band was giving a concert
0	and the agitations , the consultations , the struggles of opinion took their course
0	the ceremonies by which the evil one had sealed his pact with the old crone came out bit by bit under re- peated pressure , and were hair-raising
0	she was entirely reasonable about her own guilt and did not pretend that she had been seduced- on the contrary , carl , the chauffeur , had even said : it 's no good , fraulein , better not , but it had been stronger than she was , and she had always been ready to pay with death , and would do , and being ready for death , so it seemed to her , made up for the vvhole
0	oh , ida , do come here a minute
0	no , you are mistaken
0	never had it been filled by such reeking pipe-smoke ; such unpleasantly easy manners were foreign to it
0	she shaped the words with her lips and gave them voice out of her white throat ; it was the voice , not deep , but with the slightest edge , and pleasantly husky , that hans castorp knew—had known so long ago and yet heard so lately , swing : with pleasure , only you must be sure to give it me back after the lesson
0	it was not all intelligible , for she spoke into the folds of her mother 's stuff gown , and broke into her own nar-rative with explosions of passionate anger
0	do we eat now ?
0	and what does he an- swer them ?
0	what , he asked , about plotinus , then , who was known to have said that he was ashamed of having a body ?
0	what are we thinking of ?
0	he was bathed in perspiration ; yet he felt frozen in every limb
0	the young man accordingly took his leave
0	the jesuit , a much-travelled and cultured person , a judge and fisher of men , pedagogue by passion and conviction , pricked up his ears at the scornful tone , the clearly articulated sentences , in which the poor jewish lad answered his first questions
0	the decency to leave her post after a while , whereon the other adoring soul occupied it straightway
0	foxy-loxy is in the same boat with the rest of us after all !
0	if one of them had dragged the other ’ s good name in the dirt , if it was a question of a woman , or anything else really momentous , that you could take hold of , so that you felt there was no possibility of reconciliation !
0	tony paid little or no attention to sievert tiburtius and his betrothed -- which troubled them not at all
0	i hope , engineer , you have nothing against malice ?
0	dijhlmann -- in a voice loud enough so that all the people who did not already know the story could laugh at the joke
0	it had been odd , in church and at the table , to see the same sign in his father too
0	there was some hope for germany of social progress in peace and freedom ; of adult and forward-iooking effort ; of a voluntary adaptation of our thoughts and feelings to those of the normal world
0	she adored expressions of a cheap and common stamp , worn threadbare by over-use , which got on hans castorp ’ s nerves—as , for example , you haven ’ t the faintest idea !
0	the christian middle ages clearly recognized the inherent capitalism of the secular state : money will be emperor ’ is a prophecy made in the eleventh century
0	it would come , this war , and it would be a good thing , though the consequences of it would not be those anticipated by its authors
0	the other day he was telling me about dynamic drugs and asiatic poison-trees ; it was so interesting it was almost uncanny—interesting things are always a bit uncanny—but the interest was not so much in what he was saying as it was taken in connexion with his personality , which made it interesting and uncanny at once
0	have i had a revelation ?
0	monic , the german word for that is the instincts
0	but herr settembrini shook his head
0	old buddenbrook used his gold snuff-box
0	to it many factors contributed : masculine rascality , fenlinine frailty , feminine pride and professional unsuc- cess
0	i too prefer an intelligent ailing person to a consumptive idiot
0	he murmured that it was a shame , but added to console himself that even if he were up and about he would hardly know how to take advantage of it , since it seemed it did not answer for him to exert himself much
0	in this way we were always separate from each other in time , but the melodic presence of each kept together pleasantly with that of the others and what , ve produced made a graceful web , a body of sound such as unison singing did not ; a texture in whose polyphony we delighted without inquiring after its nature and ca
0	it was the expression all of us up here , which joachim had used several times , that had somehow struck him as strange and given him an uneasy feeling
0	tony sat down apart with another book , and herr gr� softly questioned : our book is not to your taste , fraulein ?
0	she stood at gerda 's side to receive the visits of condolence in the living-room and there was no end of these ; their name was legion
0	we ’ ve come for a little visit , said hans castorp , with his eyes more on the pious horror in the corner than on the owner of the surprising room , who was expressing his gratification that the cousins had kept their word
0	it is not certain what he meant by 'the rest , probably various things , both love and art
0	tears stood out in them , from the effort of the forced breathing and coughing and they gazed into space with a pathetic expression as the examination went on
0	she seemed to try to concentrate her gaze and make it penetrate ; but it slipped aside
0	i will tell you , tom
0	he jested : what do i hear , engineer ?
0	ah knows as iverybody gits summat as comes here to-day , but ah bai not come fer that , an ' so ah tells ye !
0	i start up from my boke and look
0	had been , he replied , in the sense that his illness and a stay up here of still undetermined length had come between him and his work ; that might mean a considerable interruption , even a turning-point in his career , he could not tell
0	frau schwarzkopf made excuses for tony 's room , whither she had already been to make herself tidy after the journey
0	she was feeling again the sense of in-creased personal importance first experienced when herr gr� proposed for her hand
0	i hope you do not think i mean i do not like to be with you , papa
0	yea verily , dear mates , that art is stuck and grown too heavy and scorneth itselfe and god 's poor man knoweth no longer where to turn in his sore plight , that is belike the fault in the times
0	under a deep blue sky , the two-colourrd flag floated above all the houses , ri^ht down fi^hfiv lane , frnm broad street to the wharf , where the wullenwrwri and thr fiiederike dverdierk ' lay under full flap , in their owner 's honour
0	i suppose i ave not wished for it , be- cause iny pity is too deep , my grief and sympathy are with this unhappy nation , when i think of the exaltation and blind ardour of its uprising , the breaking-out , the breaking-up , the breaking- down ; the purifying and fresh start , the national new birth of ten years ago , that seemingly religious intoxication - which then be- trayed itself to any intelligent person for what it was by its crud- ity , vulgarity , gangsterism , sadism , degradation , filthiness - ah , how unmistakably it bore within itself the seeds of this whole war !
0	she held herself very erect , chin in , and looked down at the world from above
0	created being the free viii to turn away from god - which would have been an incomplete creation , yes , positively not a creation at all , but a surrender on the part of god
0	for death was only the logical negation of life ; but between life and inanimate nature yawned a gulf which research strove in vain to bridge
0	hans castorp did not assist in person at the successive episodes ; but was informed of its involved and dramatic course by means of certain documents , protocols and formal declarations , touching the affair , circulated not only in the house and without , not only in the village , the canton , and the country , but even abroad and in america ; and presented for the consideration of persons who most certainly were not in the faintest degree interested in the circumstances
0	because if i am left up here—as i shall be , if he goes down , for it is out of the question for me to go with him—if i am left up here , it is for ever ; alone i should never find my way back
0	she was very musical , a pianist , a chopin enthusiast , a writer on schubert ; on friendly terms with more than one bearer of a great name in the contemporary , vorld of music
0	see what coal-black eyes she has !
0	the director was a silesian by birth
0	settembrini came , was very affectionate and charming , and called joachim capitana , instead of lieutenant as before
0	she drew her hand out of her shawl and gave it to him , a veined , emaciated , yellowish hand , with many rings , as she continued to gaze in his face
0	his active figure showed indistinctly against the dark red curtains , the only gleams of white being from his powdered hair and the lace frill at his throat
0	give me some reason
0	the young man weighed that possibility for a second , standing with lowered lids
0	as a neutral party , perhaps— the presence of such an one was a part of the prescribed chivalrous mitigations—he might be present
0	ah , that was not the effect thomas buddenbrook looked for from the influence of his own personality upon his son 's !
0	more doubt that he was indeed possessed
0	out with the gas !
0	his mid rile-class instincts rose against them -- and his vanity , too : the fear of being eccentric , of playing a laughable role
0	i do not under-stand -- it is from berlin
0	such was the multiple state of life , sprung from the union of two parent cells , the association of many non-sexually originated generations of cell units ; its growth meant their increase , and the generative circle came full again when sexcells , specially developed elements for the purpose of reproduction , had established themselves and found the way to a new mingling that drove life on afresh
0	the fact displays the inborn tendency of music to superstitious rites and observances , the sym- bolism of nulnbers and letters
0	but for the rest , his brilliant display of arithmetic had simply been so much dust thrown in his cousin ’ s eyes ; for here , as elsewhere , his mental processes were rather slow than fast , and the truth is that a previous calculation with pencil and paper underlay his present facility
0	however , fate was unkind , and the bargain came to light
0	if this failed - and it stood v/ritten that it must fail- then , whatever we might still for years accomplish , we were lost in principle and before we began : this time , next time , always
0	no , he sat there to be alone : to recall and go over in his mind the events and impressions of the past months
0	dr morris was nar-row-chested and yellow-skinned , and he talked very gaily , showing pointed teeth with gaps between them
0	we make money with the joint-stock brewery , that niederpaur is director of
0	clavdia took no interest in the mannheimer—had she done so , it would not have escaped hans castorp ’ s perception ; in this case it was not the dart of jealousy he felt pierce his soul
0	he himself had not expressed his own actual thoughts , his real misgivings
0	the sick person had no real right to it
0	for ' v £ brahms meant ie dernier ennui
0	he was feeling rather out of sorts himself ; he went to the platform and sat down buddenbrdok in the master 's chair , where he began to rock back and forth , scowling
0	do you too advise me to -- to -- to yield my consent ?
0	now and then he would start up , rub his hand over his bald brow , and murmur , yes , it 's frightfully sad
0	herr kesselmeyer 's face took on a serious expression which was vastly becoming to it
0	do you know what makes you go red and pale ?
0	he set more store by discipline than any of the other masters : he would reveiw the ranks of sturdy youngsters with a professional eye , and he insisted on short , brisk answers to questions
0	have we perhaps already made up our mind ?
0	i am aware you tend to do so , and are in the habit of saying that these conditions produce nothing fixed and stable enough to guarantee the harmony of the self-sufficient work
0	two great tears rolled down his cheeks and ran into the golden whiskers
0	adrian had seen from the train the rohmbtihel vvith its crown of trees , the grey mirror of the klammer ; now his eyes rested on these sights from close at hand
0	thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people
0	two days later , passing the room with joachim , hans castorp saw that it was being turned out
0	to speak of sorrow would be disingenuous
0	but still the faint scratching sound of the pen went on , over several more pages
0	he would have liked to stop behind in an easy-chair in the landscape-room and indulge the reveries that the music conjured up ; but his duties as host bring some coffee and cigars into the billiard-room , he said to the maid whom he met in the entry
0	ida jungmann confined herself to making a deep bow , while she played with the silver watch-chain on her flat bosom
0	behrens mean him to understand the title ?
0	joachim ’ s bearing became even more correct
0	in brief , our traveller was now over head and ears in love with clavdia chauchat— we may still use the phrase , since we have already obviated any possible misunderstanding on the score of it
0	i am sure i went the colour of a turkey-cock for laughing , while listening to a discussion , pursued with the same intellectual satisfaction as before , about the growing tendency of dentists to pull out forthwith all teeth with dead nerves ; since it had been concluded - after a long , painstaking , and refined de- velopment in the nineteenth-century technique of root treatment - that they were to be regarded as infectious foreign bodies
0	a tiny mole , at the point where the breasts began to divide , had been done with care , and on their rounding surfaces one thought to trace the delicate blue veins
0	she was in the habit of leaving the light burning on her balcony and stealing off to seek distraction in the quarter below
0	he has enough gift , herr pfiihl said , and nodded
0	thus the elder art did not know rhythm as music later understood it
0	the conception of the apocalyptic oratorio , the secret preoccu pation with it , then , went far back into a time of apparently com- plete exhaustion , and the vehemence and rapidity , vith which afterwards , in a few months , it was put on paper always gave me the idea that that period of prostration had been a sort of refuge and retreat , into which his nature withdrew , in order that , unspied on , unsuspected , in some hidden sanctuary , shut avvay by suffering from our healthy life , he might preserve and develop conceptions for which ordinary well-being would never sunmon the reckless courage
0	yes , said tom , i understand what you mean very well , tony
0	but i will be quite open with you - as open as you have been with me
0	and the way it proved not to be was really beautiful
0	casually he displayed letters from foreign potentates of the society : one from the very hand of the swiss grand master , brother quartier la tente , of the thirty-third degree ; and discussed the proposal to make esperanto the official language of the body
0	'the duke was very likely a feather-brained and seditious person , and as for the prisoners , their execution was probably the deliberate and necessary policy of a council of war
0	you wouldn ’ t believe it
0	i-low quickly one learns to tie a white tie , to enter a salon with complete noncha- lance , even if it goes a few steps down , and to forget the sensa- tion that you do not l { now what to do with your hands !
0	he jumped violently ; then , in these straits , he smiled exactly as though nothing had hap-pened and took his place before the middle row of benches , stooping sideways , in his customary attitude , and resting one palm on the desk in front of him
0	you are a lout , he said , not to like it
0	that was the time of the reasonable worship of god , of a generation of theologians in , vhose n
0	you are going to—what ?
0	these were frau iltis and herr albin ; they wore cardboard placards , on which were written the silent sister and the blue peter ; together , with sidling gait they moved through the room
0	there was probably buddenbro dks nothing very permanent about it at that time , and it was re-built again , on the trave
0	on the hard upper facet of the precious beryl two lines were graven in the tiniest greek characters
0	but wirhout wagner 's work , loud and violent as it was , herr riedesel and hi hoftheater could not have existed , so it was received , more or les
0	he wore white kid gloves , and he had his stick with the silver handle under his left arm
0	at worst , the experiment would have a negative result—which could hardly be called unfavourable , since even without it the patient must stop on in any case !
0	she did it all the time , to enjoy the aris- tocratic service and assure herself of the protection and care she
0	in her presence , when she spoke , entered or left the room , his eyes would grow surprisingly larger and larger and open out until they nearly jumped out of his head
0	in a certain sense i , vas of their guild and might have been justified in feeling irri- tation over this reduced and spinsterish reproduction of my own relation to adrian
0	madame chauchat wore a blue frock with a white lace collar
0	le ship and plunged into the , vater , crystal-clear at first , ] i ; hted by the sun
0	get up , gr� , she said , sobbing
0	it is covered up with flesh and put away once and for all ; nobody and nothing ought to come near it
0	i think the citizens -- then you feel lonely ?
0	you have a conscience like a butcher 's dog , and yet you are nothing but a ninny , a scapegoat
0	he met his brother 's remonstrances with a mor-tified air , making no defence , and for a few days would apply himself with somewhat more zeal to the english correspond-ence
0	they had declared , the heads , in the accents of a corps-student , that they were on track of the actual causes of the instability of hans castorp ’ s heating economy
0	my dear sir , what do you think of me ?
0	no truth may be written or taught which might not agree with the established order of things
0	if my conviction is worth anything , it was certainly not written after our visit to the moun- tain village or during our stay there
0	he had a head full of remark-able bumps , to which his blond hair clung as smooth as glass ; grey eyes with black rings beneath them , and long brown buddenbrook hands that stuck out beneath the too short sleeves of his neatly brushed jacket
0	the gentlemen have an eloquent advocate
0	i know him well , have been friendly with him for a long time ; he was kind enough to take me up , because he found i was a delicate child of life
0	how he looked , she heard , when they brought him !
0	i do not know how much of the situation you know or suspect
0	or , on the contrary , did they seem much longer than had actually been the case ?
0	he looked at his cousin , who only shrugged indifferently with brows and shoulders , as though to say : well , what of it ?
0	they pressed their arms to their sides , stood on their tip-toes , bent their heads , and bit their tongues in the fervour of their devotion
0	they describe with unearthly terror the sign of an epiphany of the god at his shrine
0	thus she went about in the town like a little queen ; and like a queen , she was kind or cruel to her subjects , as the whim seized her
0	yes , but wait a bit—if you had been there , you wouldn ’ t have known what kind of
0	a spacious cabinet , like another room , was built into the wall of his dressing-room ; and here , on long rows of hooks , on wooden hangers , were coats , smoking jackets , frock-coals , evening clothes , clothes for all occasions , all seasons , and all grades of formality ; the care-fully creased trousers were arranged on chairs beneath
0	he bent over his plate , turned his head away , and looked as though he wanted to sink through the floor ; and several times he interrupted her with a low , tormented good cod , tony !
0	she prob- ably thought that once accepted by the family , once married to henri and safe in another country , she would find ways and
0	it is pleasant to celebrate the past , when one is gratified with the present and the future
0	he sat up straight on the sofa , with one knee crossed over the other , puffed at his cigar , knit his brows a little , and mar-shalled his figures with wonderful fluency
0	i have had a card from munich too , from eva ewers
0	mynheer peeperkorn , genuinely thirsty , drank down glass after glass of the simple , effervescent drink
0	upon classical learning - luther had personally little enough of it - as the source of the spiritual turmoil
0	this was received with enthusiasm , though dr blumenkohl , whose state had now much altered for the worse , muttered something to himself , with the expression peculiar to him upon his face , or rather upon his lips ; he seemed to be asking what sort of verses were these
0	but the rules stood in the way , and hans castorp resolved to act behind his back
0	nothing in them but the orsini bombs
0	according to programme , hans castorp drew in deep draughts of the pure morning air , the fresh , light atmosphere that breathed in so easily , that held no hint of damp , that was without associations , without content
0	i call it very feeble of them
0	only a little further— supposing one were to give way to the temptation , and his temptation was great ; it was so strong that it quite lived up to the many descriptions he had read of the typical danger-state
0	but why so testy ?
0	his father and pastor wunder-lich could be seen to exchange the smallest of smiles
0	a matter of decades ?
0	on the previous day , the th of march , — , he was able to confirm the fact of the said calumny and detraction by the mouth of an immediate witness to the conversation in which the offensive words and insinuations had been uttered
0	he tried to speak , but no words came
0	hence our holy duty of feeling , hence the shame in unfeelingness , in powerlessness to awaken the woman to desire
0	here too the stove was burning merrily , behind a brass lattice
0	the will no longer availed
0	he found her excitation , or rather the expression of it , somehow unsuitable , almost offensive , in so homely and insignificant a creature
0	he talked a great deal , laughed without reason , struck his nephew with his fist in the pit of the stomach , shouting : hullo there , old fellow !
0	one does not at bottom understand that , one just accepts it as a well-bred man should , in objective respect for a law of nature - and indeed the attitude of a man is usually more tolerant and benevolent than that of a woman , who mostly casts a jealous eye on a friend who tells her a man is in love with her , even though she cares nothing at all for the man
0	i could not be seen with it here , you understand
0	obviously the system of this kingly man stood in more than common need of moistening
0	for the station of landquart lies at a relatively low altitude , but now the wild and rocky route pushes grimly onward into the alps themselves
0	thought the consul to himself , bowing as the company lifted their glasses
0	but / heard it , and it was a word that -- a word -- oh , it was that word , let me tell you , thomas , that caused me , to spend the whole night packing my trunk , to wake erica early in the morning , and to leave the place , rather than to remain in the neighbourhood of a man who could utter such words
0	so you think your wife is ruining you ?
0	they were not certain half-human beings settembrini corrected him
0	what do you mean by that ?
0	again he had learned that beauty can pierce one like a pain , and that it can sink profoundly into shame and a longing despair that utterly consume the courage and energy necessary to the life of every day
0	did he find things easier , for that ?
0	the little one looked up at grandfather ’ s narrow grey head , bending over the basin
0	and little johann stammered , retreating , with his hand to his cheek , i thought -- i thought -- there was nothing else coming ,
0	he sat straighter , higher , stiff er than ever , without touching the cushions
0	funny , joachim said , bending forward to look at his cousin , on herr settembrini ’ s farther side
0	music was heard ; the tapir-faced lady was playing handel ’ s largo on the violin , and then a drawing-room sonata by grieg , characteristically northern in mood
0	i felt myself that the image was inapplicable to the extremes of adrian 's nature , his swing between penitential paralysis and compensating creative re lease
0	he went on to say that in behaviour , in action , determinism did indeed rule ; there was no freedom of choice
0	it shouts for a campaign against the fall in the birth-rate , it demands a reduction in the cost of bringing up children and training them to a profession—and meanwhile men are herded like cattle , and all the trades and professions are so overcrowded that the fight round the feeding-trough puts in the shade the horrors of past wars
0	i refrain from quoting it , merely characterizing it as a human document which affects the reader like the baring of a wound and whose painful lack of reserve the writer probably considered an utter- most hazard
0	then he listened at the patient 's chest and felt his pulse
0	after gerda buddenbrook had watched her son a little , she decided that he must have piano lessons
0	but , after all , was it not best thus ?
0	hans castorp knew , for had not those events visited himself with justifiable pangs ? —even her way of turning , before she sat down , to present herself , as it were , to the room , she had as of yore
0	such was the announcement settembrini had made , that easter sunday
0	and here ’ s the libretto , he said , and gestured with his head toward a little case on the wall , filled with broad-backed albums
0	there is a case of a party of miners , buried and shut off from every possibility of knowing the passage of day or night , who told their rescuers that they estimated the time they had spent in darkness , flickering between hope and fear , to be some three days
0	as you grew , said jonathan to us , and you can easily prove it by feeling your elbows and ribs , you formed in your insides a solid structure , a skeleton which gives your flesh and muscles sta- bility , and which you carry round inside you - unless it be more correct to say it carries you around
0	the lady in front of him did , indeed , turn her head as he sat down , and measured him with narrow eyes
0	as your father says , you have time to consider , the frau consul continued
0	in my view theology can not be mod- ern - one may reckon that to its advantage , of course - and as for symbolism , i cann , dt see why one should take hell more sym- bolically than heaven
0	he despised , he scorned it , and himself ; but had reached the point where it obliged him , every few days , to take to his bed
0	leipzig , friday after purificationis s in the peterstrasse , hozlse the th most honourable , most illustrious , learned , and \-vell-beloved magister and ballisticus !
0	i have been with my brother -- on pressing business
0	ah , yes , it is well and truly dreamed
0	but how long , or how short , it actually is , that nobody knows
0	i generally take a match
0	after our roast fowl rudi schwerdtfeger could stand it no longer and made up his mind to let his light shine , as it says in the good book
0	but to continue with the most indispensable facts in my vita : my parents allowed me to attend our gymnasium , the same school where , two forms below me , adrian was taught
0	the knowledge of drugs possessed by the coloured races was far superior to our own
0	well , to arrive at the point , this young lady looked so charming as walter tell , wore her brooch and spoke her lines with such effect , that christian felt his heart swell with en-thusiasm , and tears rose to his eyes
0	vale , he said , and god be with you , leverklihn
0	but in social intercourse he was more apt than his son to draw the line rigidly and give the cold shoulder to strangers
0	uncle christian was the only person who did not display this grown-up arrogance
0	herr grunlich , on his side , bowed with deliberation , al-though one corner of his mouth seemed to go down
0	a little resigned curl of the lip , or a shrug of the shoulders in their blue sailor suit , would be the only answer
0	then everything grew quiet , the phenomena disappeared , and joachim let out his breath with a sigh
0	hans castorp and he sometimes made their daily round together
0	they passed among the hat- and coat-racks and entered the light , low-vaulted hall , where there was a buzzing of voices , a clattering of dishes , and a running to and fro of waitresses with steaming jugs
0	- let us not dwell on the odd circumstance , which became second nature to me , but drop it and return to buchel
0	true to our principle of making him out neither better nor worse than he was , we assert that he simply declined—not expressly and consciously , but quite naïvely , declined to let his judgment of his own sex be perverted by romantic considerations
0	the object , cried one , the other : the ego !
0	now dr mantelsack crossed his legs , still standing , and began to turn over the leaves of his notebook
0	he declared himself to the party of conservation and of life , and struck out against the decadent spirit which hid itself behind all that seraphic cant
0	are you making fun of me ?
0	dr krokowski ’ s smile retreated as it were , lost for the moment something of its genial warmth
0	a belief , a given conception of the universe , an idea—in short , a will , is always in existence ; which it is the task of the intellect to expound and demonstrate
0	at all events , the young man ’ s activity during these days confined itself to a visit to behrens ; a consultation of which joachim was aware , the result of which he could have accurately predicted beforehand
0	the candles burned down slowly in their sockets
0	the irritation was probably the same in kind as that which coloured her feeling toward herr settembrini , the humanist and haranguer , whom she could not abide , calling him arrogant , not hu—man
0	there were long sums that rovnred both sides of the slate with additions , subtractions , multipli-cations , and divisions , and had to come out to zero in the end ; otherwise there was a mistake , and they must hunt and hunt till they had found the little beast and exterminated him
0	hans castorp , on this subject , received a singular impression : it was that a certain fundamental fact of life , which is conceded the world over to be of great importance , and is the fertile theme of constant allusion , both in jest and earnest , that this fundamental fact of life bore up here an entirely altered emphasis
0	he was going to the wars : the rhythm changed , grew brisk and lively , dull care and sorrow might go hang !
0	he stood up at last , flung joachim ’ s coverlet on the bed , and got something out that sounded like a good-night : don ’ t freeze to death ; call me again in the morning , his lips hardly shaping the words ; then he staggered along the corridor to his own room
0	come here , tom , said frau permaneder uncertainly
0	yes , yes , she said ; this is very sad , tony
0	well , the bad thing about it is , that erica is a little bit inclined to be melancholy
0	yet hans castorp found the patience-players even worse
0	but he always ate a good deal , out of pure self-respect , even when he was not hungry
0	it had contracted almost painfully at the moment when the glass door slammed , for to that moment he had looked forward with his breath coming thick and fast
0	then came , in a long , black procession , the slow drive through the grey , misty streets out through the burg thor , along the leafless avenue in a cold driving rain , to the ceme-tery , where the funeral march sounded behind half-bare shrubbery on the edge of the little grove , and the great sand-stone cross marked the buddenbrook family lot
0	he went up to gerda , who sat there alone , reading , and put out his hand
0	she confided in herself to hold and bind him , in her
0	they are in a position to build a rival railway : east holstein , neuminster , neustadt -- yes , that is quite on the cards
0	as ye now are , my protean friend , i look to find you ready to quench my thirst for knowledge and concll\ively demonstrate your independent presence by telling me not only things i l { now but also of some i would like to know
0	national nation of industry , which some day can form a right and genuine european economic society
0	perhaps rudi would find it more understandable when he heard what he had to say
0	a youthful looking man with a blond pointed beard kept order down here : dr goldener , the dressy one
0	do you think i would carry it into court and sue my own mother , and add a public scandal to the family one ?
0	christmas came : the first christmas without the frau consul
0	but my mental state is only a variant of that which , aside from cases of ordinary self-interest or extraordinary stupidity , has become the destiny of a whole people ; and this destiny i am inclined to consider in the light of a unique and peculiar tragedy , even while i realize that it has been before now laid on other nations , for the sake of their o , vn and the general future , to wish for the downfall of their state
0	the cousins sat down on an empty bench to watch and criticize the game
0	his lips seemed to take a certain pleasure in forming the words
0	she had been in the family now for more than thirty years
0	he is a devotee of your vice
0	the gentlemen had seemed serious people to her , whereas painters were mostly a loose lot , without much feeling for the serious things of life - she did not mean the practical side , earning money and that , no , when she said serious she meant the dark side of life , its hardships and trou- bles but she did not mean to be unfair to artists : her lodgers , for instance , had been an exception to that kind of light-headed gen- try , he being a quiet , reserved sort of man , rather low-spirited if anything - and his pictures had looked like that too , the atmos- phere of the moors , and the lonely woods and meadows , yes , it was perhaps surprising that director stiglmayer should have bought one , the gloomiest of all , of course he was a financial man but maybe he had a streak of melancholy himself
0	there are assistant masters , you may know , and there are head masters ; but never by any chance a plain master
0	the buddenbrooks in broad street think she is very like him too
0	the trouble , a catarrh of the apex of the lung , then seemed to have been cured , and through- out the ten years that passed before the birth of her youngest , little nepomuk , ursula had been a capable wife and mother to her family , although the years of privation during and after the war took the bloom off her health
0	when pressed to speak , she con- fesses that this little dog is actually her own all-too-chaste daughter , who by reason of the unbending denial of her favour to a young man on fire for her had driven him to his death ; and now , in punishment therefor , she has been turned into this shape and of course constantly weeps tears of despair over her doggish estate
0	but herr albin was inexorable
0	one did not feel the cold , it might have been much less , for the dryness and absence of wind deprived it of sting
0	i was also irritated by the presence of bullinger , the manufacturer ; he , vas legitimated only by his high income tax , but he talked dogmati- cally on the loftiest cultural themes
0	nothing , answered the player , with a short shake of the head , more like the gesture with which one shakes off a fly
0	raising her fists , she hurled her curses down on our heads , repeating three times : jechants !
0	they were probably all his wardrobe could boast
0	was such a hope , after all , entirely vain ?
0	the frau consul , christian , clothilde , clara , and ida jungmann stood above on the landing to greet her
0	one always wills one ’ s fate
0	he had long ceased to be a beginner in music , that curiously cabbalistic craft , at once playful and profound , artful and austere , when he placed himself again under the guidance , direction , su- pervision of wendell kretschmar in leipzig
0	there was no size to the infinite ; in eternity was neither duration nor change
0	tell me : you did not like this herr gr�
0	and the honey , tom , i have always considered honey one of the very best of foods
0	ay , answered behrens , and shrugged his shoulders
0	many happy returns , herr se noter , many happy -- ' n ' one is rich ' n ' great , ' n ' t'other 's pore -- yes , yes , grobleben , you are right , that 's just how it is !
0	the car-riage stopped before the terrace
0	the classroom suddenly became full of noise and movement
0	in particular it did not suit frau stöhr , the skin of whose arms was too porous ; such a fashion was distinctly not for her
0	morten , said tony , sadly
0	but thomas betrayed himself to his sister tony , when they said good-bye on the street one thursday evening , and she alluded to the pbppenrade harvest
0	but , like the other easy men of pleasure in the community , he knew how to avoid trouble by wearing the proper expression and saying the proper thing
0	but before september was out she had returned , saying she did not feel well at home
0	he never , it is true , quite reconciled himself to tristan , though he eventually carried out gerda 's wish and made a very clever arrangement of the liebestod for violin and piano
0	what do you think -- where shall we put it ?
0	it is the end of everything , she burst out another time , in sheer despair , and flung her arms around her sister-in-law 's neck with loud weeping
0	clara comes into pleasant connections , in any case , and the position as pastor 's wife will be very suited to her temperament
0	but if they were , then , however impossibly small they were , they must themselves be built up , organically built up , as a law of their existence ; for the conception of a living unit meant by definition that it was built up out of smaller units which were subordinate ; that is , organized with reference to a higher form
0	and may one ask , he queried , whom , or what—you see i am all question , i ask even how to ask—whom , or what you envisage as the bringer of this—this—i repeat the word with some unwillingness—this terror ?
0	herr settembrini duly gave him a dressing-down , and did produce a temporary reaction of the conscience , even something like a promise to steer clear in the future of such abominations
0	it was midsummer before he made up his mind to go
0	gradually he widened the sphere of his activities
0	there was an elderly man from somewhere in the back blocks of austria , a one-time sculptor , with white moustaches , a hooked nose and blue eyes ; who had conceived a project , financial and political in its scope , and drawn it up most meticulously in a calligraphic hand , colouring the important points in sepia
0	are you a little girl ?
0	insights fundamentally remote from nly own na- tive easy-goingness he expressed in talk as casua aper
0	hanno 's and kai 's conversation was in striking contrast to that which went on ardund them , among their fellows
0	v be paid for
0	i am no country innocent , i tell you ; and the affair with babette would not have made me go off the handle like that , just by itself
0	yes , i know , the brenner frontier
0	one and all of them , but expressly the flowers , and of these more expressly the hosts of tuberoses , were there to palliate the other aspect of death , the side which was neither beautiful nor exactly sad , but somehow almost improper—its lowly , physical side—to slur it over and prevent one from being conscious of it
0	hans castorp might look forward to the pleasure of seeing him
0	dr faustus dear to me , one of which is the highly subjectivizing contrast feel between the nature of the artist and that of the ordinary man
0	and you are an out-and-out critic and sceptic , i must say
0	this child , sooner than any of us , was privileged to get an insight into the drafts of the score of ariel 's songs , on which adrian \-vas privately at work
0	and the latter answered indifferently : nothing new
0	is not it because there was crooked work four years ago ?
0	imself before the pub- hc through music , music being the occasion he took
0	a poor thing—but yours , he said , brow to brow with her , speaking down upon the pencil , stiff-lipped , so that most of the labials went unsounded
0	father , she said -- for in these conversations she never railed him papa -- father , how is our affair going on ?
0	but he was paralyzed
0	then , as one gets used to the place , a gradual shrinkage makes itself felt
0	the room was not much more than adequate , with some slight indication of middle-class amenity in the shape of a red plush cover on the square table in front of the sofa , where his books lay and he drank his breal { fast coffee
0	he realized at once that he had used the hard word buddenbroks instinctively to frighten her , and he added : he can work himself up again , of course
0	press your breast against it , as though it filled you with rapture
0	consequently one must take steps to warn people of what is coming and do one 's best to prevent it
0	you rather like mixing in matters that are not harmless , but you treat them as though they were and think to find favour in the eyes of god and man
0	he well knew that long letters were neither asked nor expected , it being no humanistic or literary circle to which he addressed himself down there , and the replies he received were equally lacking in expansiveness
0	cried herr gr� , springing to his feet
0	i did no work saturday , because the next day was sunday ; and i did no work on sunday , because it was sunday !
0	unconscious and tranquil , with his soft curling hair and voluminous pinafore frocks , he played in the garden by the fountain , or in the little gallery partitioned off far his use by a pillared tailing from the vestibule of the second storey -- played the plays of his four and a half years -- those plays whose meaning and charm no grown person can possibly grasp : which need no more than a few pebbles , or a stick of wood with a dande-lion for a helmet , since they command the pure , powerful , glowing , untaught and unintimidated fancy of those blissful years before life touches us , when neither duty nor remorse dares to lay upon us a finger 's weight , when we may see , hear
0	everything about him was sharp : the hooked nose dominating his face , the narrow , pursed mouth , the thick , bevelled lenses of his glasses in their light frame , behind which were a pair of pale-grey eyes—even the silence he preserved , which suggested that when he broke it , his speech would be incisive and logical
0	even the barbaric pair at the bad russian table had taken notice of the day : he by exchanging his leather jacket for a short coat , and the felt boots for leather shoes ; she , though she still wore the soiled feather boa , by putting on a green silk blouse with a neck-ruche
0	frau hagenstrbm whispered to frau sena-tor mbllendorpf
0	you ’ ll get off by the autumn , the old un has more or less committed himself to that
0	told of her respectable , tiresome husband , her no less respectable and tiresome children , who were precisely like their father , and for whom she had not been able to feel great warmth of affection ; of the half boy , half man with whom she had fled , whose poetic tenderness she never tired of describing
0	a man could know that and recognize freedom above and beyond all critique
0	so well-read a girl , one might say psychologically trained , keeping watch with a poet 's eye upon her own experiences must certainly have had an insight into the growth of her own feeling - however surprising , yes , un- believable the development might have seemed to her at first
0	they even went abroad together , took walks with herr ferge and wehsal , naphta and settembrini , those opposed spirits , whom they could hardly fail to meet
0	there did not lacl { much for their zeal in destroying the things of the spirit - a zeal that is entirely foreign to the masses - to have made sacrifice of the works of the hero of these pages , adrian leverktihn
0	the october terminus had slipped by and no man named it , neither the hofrat nor the cousins between themselves
0	the youthful listener would perceive the distinction , even the opposition , between foreign and domestic freedom ; also note the ticklish question , which unfreedom was soonest—he he ! —which least compatible with a nation ’ s honour
0	to put it briefly , my father had , before my sister 's mar-riage , a round sum of nine hundred thousand marks net , not counting , of course , real estate , and the stock and good will of the firm
0	said hans castorp , taken aback , and still seated
0	the troublesome child—that i have been for you , in your capacity as pedagogue—you remember , you came to speak of that on the first day we met , it is one of the associations you have taught me , the relation between humanism and pedagogy ; and there are many others i shall think of as time goes on
0	but on the whole i must say i find it cheap rather than dear , considering what they offer , and before second breakfast they went down to the management in order that hans castorp might acquit himself of his debt
0	he knew the name and circumstances of each patient
0	hans castorp regarded him earnestly as they drove
0	consul hermann hagenstrbm supports his considerable weight on the balustrade , breathes heavily into his red beard , and talks with senator dr cremer , the chief of police , whose brown beard , mixed with grey , frames a smiling face expressive of a sort of gentle slyness
0	the lawyer apparently no longer practised his profes- sion , he only read the newspaper , read it indeed all the time ; on hot days he permitted himself to do it sitting in his room in his drawers , with the door open
0	they sent for sister leandra , and she came
0	one was , indeed , compelled to recognize in the hierarchy a force making for freedom : had it not set limits to the boundless pretensions of monarchy ?
0	often enough , from his youth onwards , he had sternly brought his feelings into line
0	but then when he had shaken hands all round he came back and said good- bye again , quite simply , so that one was able to respond
0	the truth was , peeperkorn said , and lifted his head from the pillow , elevated the arabesques on his brow , and gave point to his remarks by the little circle and the upright finger-tips—the truth was , in the world of matter , that all substances were the vehicle of both life and death , all of them were medicinal and all poisonous , in fact therapeutics and toxicology were one and the same , man could be cured by poison , and substances known to be the bearer of life could kill at a thrust , in a single second of time
0	very good indeed , said the doctor
0	he would have been sought in vain within her walls
0	more than that , the estates had paid for themselves over and over , with the entrance fees drawn from the romantic curiosity of two helnispheres
0	even hans castorp laughed ; but this , however humiliating it was to his better feelings , was nothing compared to the tales that circulated about a certain lawyer from jüterbog , einhuf by name ; a man perhaps forty years old , with a pointed beard and very hairy hands , who had taken the swede ’ s place at herr settembrini ’ s table
0	the sound , that is , had thus been thrown up to the rather low ceiling of the hall , and it had seemed as though the notes , unlike any familiar to man , and in any case unlike any known church music , floated down thence and hovered angeli- cally above the heads of the assemblage
0	tony laid the wreath on the tablet , where her father 's name stood on the stone in fresh gold letters : then , despite the snow , she knelt down by the grave to pray
0	this simply was not the fact ; but she saw it , and it made her happy
0	an absurd remark , if you like
0	one doesn ’ t know what to make of it ; one wants to feel a proper respect for illness , of course—after all there is a certain dignity about it , if you like
0	for business reasons - this and that
0	he had heard his name often enough from frau antonie , and he threw a quick glance at his sister as he greeted herr permaneder in his most fascinating manner
0	i forgot to mention that there was in the schweigestill court- yard , adrian 's later home , and certainly not surprisingly , a stable- girl , with bosoms that shook as she ran and bare feet caked , vith dung ; she looked as much like i-ianne of buchel as one stable-girl does look like another , and in the reproduction was named walt- purgis
0	but here now was naphta on the side of the soul and disease , wherein alone true nobility and humanity resided , while settembrini flung himself into advocacy of nature and her noble sanity , regardless of his inconsistency on the score of emancipation from her
0	but hans castorp answered : let be
0	you must forgive me , then , and not think too hardly of me
0	he had been attacked by a stomach ailment , not yielding to any dietary measures , beginning 'with violent headache , lasting several days and recurring in a few more ; with hours , yes , whole days of retching from an empty stonach , sheer misery , undigni- fied , niggling , humiliating , ending in utter exhaustion and per- sistent sensitivity to light after the attack had { > assed
0	how can the herr consul say that after his speech in the assembly -- ?
0	are you making a complaint of him ?
0	he went in , whereupon the bell above the door began to give tongue , like a little watch-dog
0	albeit inasmuch as the glass is set and the sand has begun to run ; for this reason , my good man , i would fain come to an understanding with you
0	dh , that 's ton good !
0	he recalled the contemptuous gesture of the humanist when he spoke of the parthians and scythians in whose company he was forced to take the rest-cure
0	george looked more like his father too , while adrian physi- cally resembled the mother - though again there is a discrepancy , for it was adrian , not george , who inherited the tendency to mi- graine
0	but these experts are in the aforementioned box
0	two human beings , buried alive , their lungs full of pit gas , would here together—or , more horrible still , one after the other—succumb to the pangs of hunger , and thereafter the process of putrefaction would do its unspeakable work , until two skeletons remained , each totally indifferent and insensible to the other ’ s presence or absence
0	for well you knew that your proletarian soul could of its own strength bring no art form to birth ; and you hoped to defeat antiquity with its own weapons
0	how do i know ?
0	i will support the laws of the state and do justice on all alike , whether rich or poor
0	and when we talk about the excursion we are ac- tually on the subject - a subject about which you could oblige me very much
0	the youth of the place had got hold of the treatise before those of riper years ; studying it in part in groups , after supper , in their various rooms
0	everything possible for the vvagner of painting !
0	he was not more polite to one than to the other
0	he had not had the heart to leave her in the lurch at this hour ; and he now walked to the middle of thii room to meet their d guests , while tony remained on the sofa
0	people were beginning to find him a little ludicrous ; but perhaps their laugh would have turned to pity if they had even dimly suspected how much he was on his guard against their laughter !
0	listen to me , shouted the consul , stretching out both hands in front of him and shaking them in excitement
0	my cousin is just asking
0	i have nothing to do with it
0	come in , called behrens , stressing the first word
0	the ration- alism you call for has a good deal of superstition about it - of be- lief in the incomprehensibly and vaguely d
0	they ordered a bite from the obliging landlady : coffee , honey , white bread and pear bread , a sort of sweetmeat , the speciality of the place ; red wine was sent out to the coachman
0	it took a long time
0	i do not care about being made a fool of
0	then heir modersohn stood up and shouted in to the hub-bub : buddenbrook , you will do me a hundred lines imposition
0	rotbein conveyed all this in a whisper , and with great objectivity
0	the enormous difficulties which every rehearsal and perforlnance of leverktihn 's apocalypse presents , have di- rectly to do with all that
0	-- but do you think he kept his promise ?
0	armgard von schilling talked about the cows at home
0	he took out his notebook and turned over the leaves in silence ; but as the order in the classroom left much to be desired , he lifted his head , stretched out his arm over the desk , and waved his flabby white fist a few times power-lessly in the air
0	he doesn ’ t trouble himself about her ?
0	to-morrow is another day
0	popinet with a glance whenever the latter seemed about to take unto herself all the cold veal jelly
0	what a pedagogue it is !
0	herr settembrini has omitted to add , broke in naphta , that the rousseauian idyll is a sophisticated transmogrification of the church ’ s doctrine of man ’ s original free and sinless state , his primal nearness and filial relation to god ; to which state he must finally return
0	he was built on such a grand scale , hans castorp began again , that he considered it a blasphemy , a cosmic catastrophe , to be found wanting in feeling
0	that i point it out is all that speaks in my favour
0	perhaps there is nothing that applies to this case
0	you must bring about the obliquity the same way nature does , you must add illusion to illusion—and for that you have to know about the epicanthus
0	he sat down on the piano-stool , which he shoved up in front of the theatre , and began id give a performance , singing all the roles and the accompaniment as well , and gesticu-lating furiously
0	' now included in stories of three decades , translated by h t lowe- porter
0	pleasantly , courteously , it put the question : well , and what of it ?
0	it has such an infernally serious side to it , sort of ascetic , as you say—that was the expression you used , wasn ’ t it ?
0	you would gain an extraor- dinary unity and congruity , a sort of astronomical regularity and legality would be obtained thereby
0	he tried to catch his cousin ’ s eye , and saw that joachim ’ s sunburnt face had gone all spotted , as a tanned complexion will when the blood leaves it with suddenness ; his mouth too was pitifully drawn , and wore an expression that sent an indefinable chill of fear over hans castorp and made him hasten to change the subject
0	moreover there was nothing to say against it , pro- vided youth and its time understood each otler
0	you will call me when it is time , i suppose
0	for as he wrote he felt that nothing could be clearer than his presentation of the matter , and that there was no doubt it would meet with perfect comprehension at home
0	shortly after his ar- rival , and obviously out of some feeling of loneliness and for- sakenness , he had even proposed to me to join him ; and though some months would have to pass before i answered his call , i was at once ready , yes , probably would not have needed the invita- tion
0	he felt his breast lightened when , on his way home , the first chalets , the first abodes of human beings , loomed visible through the fog
0	nature vividly riminded me of a similar one of richard wagner , who at the time of parsifal added to his name signed to a letter the title member of the high consistory
0	the taste displayed by the hofrat in his choice of a model was too like hans castorp ’ s own for him to put great faith in the disinterested character of the affair , and the thought of the hofrat ’ s purple cheeks and bloodshot , goggling eyes only strengthened his scepticism
0	they hid be-hind uncle justus , and got him to send his wife ta her sister-in-law , the wife of ovcrdieck the lumber dealer
0	he had been in the employ of a fire-insurance company , and made constant extended journeys from st petersburg up and down the whole of russia , visiting insured factory buildings and spying out those which were financially suspect ; for it was a fact supported by statistics that the larger percentage of fires occurred in just those factories where business was not going too well
0	the passages of horror just before heard are given , indeed , to the indescribable children 's chorus at quite a dif-
0	but even that was enough to cast a shadow , rob their brilliant performance of some of its gloss , emasculate it , as it were , set up a cross-current perceptible to them all , though peeperkorn himself remained unconscious , or conscious to a degree impossible for them to guess
0	i regret to hear that your health is not so good as it should be
0	she would pass over from the particular to the general , and talk in her throaty voice about wicked people , interrupting her-self with the little cough that was due to poor digestion
0	yes , good night , lucky we can say it
0	above the aspiring lance-shaped tips of the fir-trees the sky gleamed deepest blue , the village down in the valley glared white in the heat , and the air was filled with the sound , half gay , half pensive , of bells , from the cows that roamed the slopes , cropping the short , sun-warmed meadow grass
0	dr krokowski would enter by the open balcony door at a quarter to four or earlier , greet the patient with manly readiness , put the usual professional questions , with perhaps a little personal touch as well , a jest or two—and if all this had a slight aura of the questionable about it , yet one can get used even to the questionable , provided it keeps within bounds
0	joachim had stepped down ; the technician changed the plate
0	that sound-sparkling ocean lights was in my eyes a very remarkable instance of hovv an artist can give his best to a thing in which he privately no longer be ] icves , insisting on excelling in artistic devices , vhich for his consciousness are already at the point of being worn out
0	it was a solemn ceremony : in the presence of the standard he would be sworn to it , literally , to the standard— you don ’ t say !
0	you do not know what you are talking about
0	the house in meng street was hardly emptied when a host of workmen appeared and began to tear down the back-building ; the dust from the old mortar darkened the air
0	i am asking that in order that you may not ask me
0	it em- barrasses me to play the languishing swain in the colnpany of others
0	he had very good looks and had kept his swiss manner of speech , pleasant to the ear , deliberate , formal , inter- spersed with survivals of old-gerlan expressions oddly solemn to hear
0	universal franchise , said the others ; heinrich hagenstrb am was one of these till others cried universal voting by estates -- and dear knew what they meant by that !
0	who is still in the salon ?
0	heavens , christian ! -- you have not swallowed it , have you ?
0	this friendship liad been recognized in the school for a long time
0	what a monkey he is !
0	it was scarcely sad at all—as things are not which have to do with the body and only with it
0	as he sat down , thomas buddenbrook briefly ex-plained what the trouble was
0	i have known herr settembrini for some time , more than a year , for years , in fact
0	i hope your civilian principles will not prevent you from knowing what you owe me—else i shall be forced to put these principles to a test that—
0	the hofrat , after his own fashion , had announced the day and hour of clavdia ’ s return
0	i am sending you a hundred thousand marks as a wedding present , and i will leave you another hundred thou-sand in my will
0	you are making a mistake about her
0	hans castorp thought he might go and come again and take up his business where he had left it off ?
0	it was remarkable that besides our priest , eccl
0	for how long must the undersigned exist without a glimpse bf his enchantress ?
0	it would have been penible too , considering their opinions of each other
0	did he say that ?
0	they would certainly be back by autumn , so you could hardly say they had left
0	and still , it is a great pleasure to the superior individual , just once - and where should one find this once , if not here and now ?
0	and that flickering glance—over which the frau directress , had she tried , might now have triumphed ?
0	two hundred years ago , settembrini said , you had a poet in your country , a magnificent old chatterbox who set great store in good handwriting because he thought it must induce a good style
0	this too i say only to characterize the fleeting , insecure times we lived in ; certainly not to direct the reader 's attention upon dy inconsiderable person , to which only a place in the background of these mernoirs is fitting
0	but i must drop out now , said the hofrat
0	seriously , on the other hand : i ’ ve had my share too ; but any so-called drunkenness to the contrary , i fully recognize the honour of helping such a tremendous personality to bed ; i am not so drunk i don ’ t know that in the matter of size i don ’ t hold a candle—
0	that stuff about the place of intercourse ’ was distinctly shady , not to mention anything else
0	since the blow he had then received , they had grown worse instead of better ; until now , at a time when prospects were brighter than ever -- when everybody was flushed with victory , the city had at last joined the customs union , and small retail firms all over the country were growing within a few years into large wholesale ones -- the firm of johann buddenbrook rested on its oars and reaped no ad- vantage from the favourable time
0	cards and counters were produced , they decided on some rounds of vingt et un
0	opposite him there had sat for a short time a very lean , light-blonde girl who emptied a bottle of yogurt on her plate , ladled it up with a spoon , and took herself off
0	the acrid , steaming shadows of the arm-pits corresponded in a mystic triangle to the pubic darkness , just as the eyes did to the red , epithelial mouth-opening , and the red blossoms of the breast to the navel lying perpendicularly below
0	it appeared that there had been wild and arbitrary exhibitions of power , like those in fräulein kleefeld ’ s room : knockings on walls and table , the turning off of the lamp , and these as well as further manifestations were being systematically produced and investigated , with every possible safeguarding of their genuineness , after comrade krokowski had practised the approved technique and put little elly into her hypnotic sleep
0	the senator himself , one thursday afternoon when the weinschenks were not present , had called it that , and frau permaneder quite relished the joke
0	i seldom do , even a card , and that is already stamped
0	and herr friedrich wil- helm marcus is present , of course
0	the consul went on foot every morning to his business in the old town—although he possessed more than one fine equipage—in order to get a little exercise , for he sometimes suffered from cerebral congestion
0	for instance , how else could i have endured to wait so long ?
0	there the tree rose to the ceiling , decorated with white lilies , twinkling and sparkling and pouring out light and fragrance ; and the table with the presents on it stretched from the windows to the door
0	hans castorp watched him
0	as for christian -- christian , through the good office of mr rirhardson , his former chief , had found a situation in london , whence he had lately telegraphed a fantastic desire to marry fraulein puvogel , an idea upon which his mother had firmly set her foot -- christian now be-longed , quite simply , to jacob krbger 's class , and was , as it were , a dead issue
0	no , no , i can not advise him either for or against
0	he had not heard me approach
0	for herr settembrini was a humanitarian , yet at the same time , half explicitly , he was warlike too
0	it must be stupid on the beach
0	does anyone doubt that i was there ?
0	he was a charm- ing lad , with a great wave of blond hair on his forehead and lovely blue eyes which now flickered in a frightened way
0	the warmth , the purring of the gas , and the drone of the reader 's voice lulled them all to a point where they were more asleep than awake
0	the icy gusts made his ears burn painfully , his limbs felt half paralysed , his hands were so numb he hardly knew if they held the staff
0	it merely gratified breisacher 'then a lady interposed and said she had not known that a census vas such a sin
0	she wrote romances for the family story-papers , un-der a dashing pseudonym
0	some of the foci are absorbed , the area is smaller and more clearly defined , which you are experienced enough to know is a sign of healing
0	his way of discovering thematic connections that the other kind of man does not see ; of perceiving the articulation of a short ex- tract in the form of question and answer ; altogether of seeing from the inside how it is made , confirms me in my judgment
0	he was told of the galloping form the disease sometimes assumed , which made the end an affair of not more than a few months or even weeks ; of pneumotomy , of the hofrat ’ s masterly surgery , of resection of the lungs , an operation which was to be performed to-morrow or the day after upon a severe case just brought to the sanitorium , a charming , or once-charming scotswoman suffering from gangrœna pulmonum , gangrene of the lungs , a green and black pestilence , which obliged her to inhale all day a vaporized solution of carbolic acid , lest she go out of her head from sheer physical disgust
0	he made proper protest
0	and , viii know how to carry it with dignity , he broke in
0	but instead of going to the good russian table , the unmannerly female glided noiselessly to hans castorp ’ s side and without a word reached him her hand—not the back , but the palm—to kiss
0	that 's a funny chord to strike
0	clavdia had been right in feeling herself dispensed from writing by virtue of the freedom her illness gave her
0	they went into the street
0	it went downhill , the steep sides grew higher , this fold of the earth ’ s surface seemed like a narrow passage leading into the mountain
0	for it is really the case that this music , wise and true and over-shrewd , here continually and painfully woos the folk-air
0	why should not he take a walk ?
0	a shrewd look came into his eyes : here was a question of money to be paid out
0	the mighty one was immensely pleased
0	while pastor pringsheim was delivering his sermon , he whispered to hanno : that was a crab-fashion imitation , johann
0	his predecessor had evidently gone out by another door
0	he was settled for the afternoon
0	but the result is what we see , the dynamic effect—he puts us in his pocket
0	adrian demurred , but rudolf knew how to plead and the recent du was strong enough to open the way for what was to come
0	oh , thou meanest because thou sayst to nobody thou , not even to thy jester gentilman , but only to the trusty play-fere , he who clepes thee b ) t the first name but not thou him
0	the visitors praised the abbot 's room warmly
0	sometimes it did well up insistently in hans castorp ’ s civilian breast , as though it must out
0	there is , how-ever , no rank and no discrimination before jesus ; and so cer-tain humble oddities were also guests at the jerusalem eve-nings -- for example , a little wrinkled creature , rich in the grace of god and knitting-patterns , who lived in the holy ghost hospital and was named himmelsburger
0	but i know the real reason why you are vexed : it is because you are not so firmly decided not to touch fhe business
0	dr faustus from unknown
0	he thinks she wears an expression as though musing on their encounter at the door
0	the silent sister ’ is a mercury thermometer without figures—you see , i got it all
0	for there was oftentimes heard by me all manner of instrument : an organ or positive , more delectable
0	how could such primitive unreason be reconciled with the conception of the universe which underlay their calling ?
0	who was ellen brand ?
0	but i tell you straightaway , a case like yours doesn ’ t get well from one day to the next : it isn ’ t a question of the miracle cures you read about in advertisements
0	- reason enough for the anxious cautiousness of a supreme com mander who had been elevated to his rank on account 'of his uncle , to order a general withdrawal
0	tell me yourself , tu whom ?
0	but then they had these penitential practices sung , delivered over to the sounding breath of the human voice , which is certainly the most stable-warm imaginable thing in the world of sound
0	it is this : i recall an exalted moment , when our acquaintance was very young , when i felt myself pleasantly impressed by your native parts , and stood ready to offer you the brotherly thou ; but then perceived that the moment was premature
0	young man , we are brothers
0	he did not smile -- he seldom did on such occasions
0	the invested capital is out of all proportion to the value of the property
0	there was too much candid cynicism in the community to permit a display of serious moral disapproval
0	if the spirit was recalcitrant , there remained the body , which could be got at
0	children played and exulted among the breaking waves
0	she still lived among us , in her mother 's house , and shared in the carnival gaieties
0	'all is over , he repeated
0	i heard him later at the roddes ' and schlaginhaufens ' , and got him to tell me how , as quite a little lad , before he had violin lessons , he had begun to develop this technique and never stopped whis- tling the music he heard , or practising what he learned
0	the duchamps , explained the consul
0	and now the whole at-mosphere of the house changed
0	while the guests continued to eat in the salon , with the pastor in their midst , the consul and his wife accompanied the young pair , who had dressed for their journey , out into the snowy , misty air , where the great travelling coach stood be-fore the door , packed with boxes and bags
0	let me lean upon you , my child !
0	even frau magnus ’ s ears were red , and she admitted that she felt as though life were running through her— which herr magnus seemed not over-pleased to hear
0	when i go to sit down in my chair in the rest-hall , whom do i find on my right hand ?
0	here i have climbed up some five thousand feet to get here—
0	she put her work down calmly and crossed the room , wilh her long heavy stride , to hanno 's bed
0	one may say they live separated , and she visits him now and again
0	i saw it confirmed that it is only a step from capitulation to pure abdication and the suggestion to the conqueror that he would please take over the conduct of the defeated country ac- cording to his own ideas , since for its own part it did not know what to do
0	the invisible character sang :
0	it was this that made me agree to his rejecting the proposal which dr ktirbis at that time in duty bound put before him : he recom- mended or asked consideration for a consultation with a higher medical authority ; but adrian avoided it , would have none of it
0	at least , you can , i ’ m sure—you are an upright man , settembrini said
0	her language , seasoned with dialect , with halt and fei and gellen 's ja , was yet not coarse
0	that gap which in exterior nature we vainly sought to close , that between living and dead matter , had its counterpart in nature ’ s organic existence , and must somehow either be closed up or bridged over
0	she sits and listens to him when he tells about his troubles -- dear me , i suppose he entertains her
0	on madame budden-brook 's account , the double windows had already been put in
0	those eyes had always , we know , been large and mild , but to-day , precisely on this very day , had seemed to grow larger and deeper , with a musing , yes , we must even say an ominous expression , together with the above-mentioned light
0	on the other hand , that belgian captain that was discharged cured the other day , he was simply alive with them , gaffky ten—and only the very tiniest cavity
0	prince esterhazy was an especial friend of this master art , but in the mass in c which beethoven wrote for him , the composer , after unsuccessful attempts , had not arrived at a fugue ; even socially considered , that was a discourtesy , but artis- tically it had been an unpardonable lack , and the oratorio christ on the mount of olives altogether lacked any fugue form , al- though it would have been most proper there
0	here too music played
0	he turned to his theatre
0	arrogant personal uniqueness - maybe you have to do that
0	the care-free piping rose toward the deep-blue sky , and beneath the sky stretched the branching , wind-tossed boughs of single ash-trees and birches whose leaves twinkled in the sun
0	he took a good look at them , from the side , as he walked with bent head , thinking about joachim
0	objects of porcelain , silver , gold , nickel , wood , silk , cloth , and every other conceivable material lay on the table
0	what does it matter ?
0	on the day when she first laid some piano arrangements from tristan on the music-rack , he played some twenty-five beats and then sprung up from the music-stool to stride up and down the room with disgust painted upon his face
0	it was so beautiful , that aida should have found her way to the condemned radames , to share his fate for ever !
0	'then the fellow ripped out his knife -- for some reason thomas never applauded these tales
0	at six o ’ clock in the afternoon he began making a strange continuous movement with his right hand , with the chain bangle on the wrist : passing it across the bed-cover , at about the hips , lifting it as he drew it back and toward him , with a raking motion , as though he were gathering something in
0	hans castorp turned the cylindrical coffee-mill about in his hands
0	but there was no idle watching , for visitors came : old senator duchamps , the dying woman 's brother , from ham-burg , with his daughter ; and a few days later , the consul 's sister from frankfort and her husband , who was a banker
0	i confess my weakness for flowers , and for nature in general
0	i am sure i have heard good things of your firm from my son , said the ' frau consul cordially
0	are you out of your head ?
0	music , vas after all too deeply and essentially bound up , vith the romantic ever to reject it without serious natural damage to itself
0	his pronunciation was perfect , for , as he explained , his business trips had taken him to england
0	rare museum pieces such as a pair of beautifully curved bronze lurer turned right and left , like steer-horns , were also to be found in leverktihn 's ware- house
0	then he has not taken a room at a hotel , so we ask him to stop the night
0	and then announced that he could stop eight days—a week , that was ; seven days—or perhaps six
0	but you see -- i am perfectly frank ; i am an honest woman and speak as i think , without making words -- which is splendid of you , tony
0	they spoke of the oberin and the doctors , of dr krokowski ’ s lectures , at one of which james would be present if he stopped a week
0	his throat contracted and a four- or fivefold sob went through and through him
0	no , they are no problems , neither is the problem of their aristocracy
0	this visible acoustic , wherein the simple and the mysterious , law and miracle , so charmingly mingled , pleased us lads exceedingly ; we often asked to see it , and not least to give the experimenter pleasure
0	if it were only this -- !
0	hang it -- he had been con-scious of powers -- and as the power is , so is the ideal -- as feuerbach says
0	and stop soon enough ?
0	it had not been three hundred years since european pharmacology made its acquaintance ; not a century since the alkaloid had been isolated which was its active principle ; isolated and , to a certain extent , analysed , for it would be too much to say that chemistry knew all there was to know about it , or was in a position to reproduce it synthetically
0	but he was no dry pedant , notwithstanding
0	your cousin has been too , hasn ’ t he ?
0	he spoke of the jeru-salem evenings and the sunday-school ; he gilded with matchless oratory the whole long rinh and happy earthly course of her who had left them ; and when he came to the end , since the word end needed some sort of qualifying ad-jective , he spoke of her peaceful end
0	i have dreamed of man ’ s state , of his courteous and enlightened social state ; behind which , in the temple , the horrible blood-sacrifice was consummated
0	they would probably blush for the ceremonial of former periods as an extravagant mummery , and not without reason , for it would be absurd to present their atheistic republicanism in the guise of a mystery
0	asia surrounds us— wherever one ’ s glance rests , a tartar physiognomy
0	imagine , on my whole left side , my nerves are not long enough !
0	and so it fell out
0	he felt that his whole being had unaccountably expanded , and at the same time there clung about his senses a profound intoxication , a strange , sweet , vague allurement which somehow resembled the feelings of early love and longing
0	they fled through the library
0	carducci had no use for the practice
0	you are in absolute danger of your life , he had bellowed at her , just like that , without making any bones of it
0	she would not have married him if she had not felt sure of his essential agreement with her in these matters
0	he was much more sprightly than he used to be ; there was a certain lack of re- straint in his roving eye , and he would ask ever so many times about gerda buddenbrook 's fiddle without getting any reply
0	buchel was a property of a size corresponding to the ownership of a team and cattle ; it was a good fifty acres of meadow and ploughed land , with communal rights to the adjoining mixed 'woodland and a very comfortable wood and frame dwelling-house on a stone foundation
0	this feeling he experienced anew in his dream , only a thousand-fold stronger than in his waking hour
0	but she merely expressed her amaze- ment at his use of her first name and repeated her farewell- the sound of her voice rings clearly in my ears : adieu , monsieur !
0	he would have let the subject drop , as it had after the previous lecture , had not hans castorp persisted , and demanded to hear details
0	yes , such consolatory promises must have been vouchsafed our young man before he returned to number thirty-four ; for he had had no word with frau chauchat on the day following , had not seen her indeed , save twice at some distance : once when the glass door slammed , and she had slipped for the last time to her place at table , clad in her blue cloth skirt and white sweater
0	so , then -- well , why should we , you know !
0	all that , lawyer paravant found , had been a bit strong for the ladies
0	not far from this group was hinrich hagenstrom , a square-built , fleshy man with a reddish beard sprinkled with grey , a heavy watch-chain across his blue-checked waistcoat , and his coat open over it
0	at any rate , here was a consoling thought for joachim during his five remaining months—in case he really got off with five
0	everybody remembered the sudden re-solve of thomas buddenbrook eighteen years ago , when he was thirty years old
0	friends are like that today
0	the authorities , of course , might have what notions they chose about fresh water
0	for therein lies goodness and love of humankind , and in nothing else
0	we should not ask—for in the time when it was made they never did
0	i mean her given name
0	then come leo and virgo , and then the autumn , the equinox , toward the end of september , when the rays of the sun fall vertically upon the equator again , as they did in march , when the sun was in the sign of the ram
0	i should like to know what kind of self-appraisement is at the bottom of the feminine answer
0	he expressed his satisfaction and , going back to joachim , warned him to draw in his breath and hold it until all was over
0	opposite her sat a czech , whom everybody called herr wenzel , as his family name was impossible to pronounce
0	it had nearly cost him his life to cut his first set ; the gums showed a constant tendency to inflammation , and there were abscesses , which mamsell jungmann used to open with a needle at the proper time
0	the conversation dragged on ; the rain set in again and veiled the prospect
0	would it be surprising if joachim ’ s agitation consisted only in part of joyful emotion , and also in part of dread—if it was not also the pang of parting with all this familiar life that made him stride thus up and down his room ?
0	long has it lasted ; or , rather , the pace of its contentual time has so increased that there is no more holding it , even its musical time is running out
0	it was impossible that all the effect which this had upon hanno should pass over into his audience
0	they could not get on without sarah semlinger !
0	do not , for one moment , imagine i addressed you with this form just now
0	not easily did these become discouraged ; it was the , vill and way of them to make light and they did so to their uttermost , so that the next stage of light 's exhaustion and retreat actually had more colour than the previous one
0	thus far , whenever we have referred to any questionable performances at the berghof , we have done so in what may have seemed a light and jesting tone ; this without prejudice to our real opinion as to the levity , or otherwise , of the performances , and solely for the usual obscure reasons which prompt other people to adopt the same
0	in making a mystery of the personality , you run a risk of idol-worship
0	in the first place , i ’ m not the proprietor here !
0	well , buddenbrook , so you are cutting the session ?
0	your interest in that ancient obstruction is due , i presume , to the fact that her decaying empire is a sort of mummy , as it were , of the holy roman empire of the german people
0	the route was bordered here and there by crumbling rock tufted with grass and flowers
0	in fact , there would be no sense in that at all !
0	and there was clavdia chauchat herself , charming , soft-stepping invalid , the property of peeperkorn—surely by choice and conviction , yet uneasy and sharptongued to see her carnival cavalier on such good terms with her sovereign lord
0	but she complains a lot about her temperature , and how relaxed she feels , and i ’ m afraid she is by no means a light case
0	i have no mechanical ingenuity , however sincere my respect for it
0	but neither was taken seriously
0	the holy , the feminine claims life makes upon manly honour and strength—
0	i saw him first at a distance : adrian showed him to me round the comer of the house , sitting on the ground in the kitchen garden at the back , between a strawberry and a vegetable bed , one little leg stretched out , the other half drawn up , his hair falling in strands on his forehead
0	both ladies proved receptive to the at- tention shown them , and welcomed with enthusiasm the plan for an excursion , of which i only said that i had not originated it- after dropping the remark that i was on the way to my friend leverktihn
0	a gift of life like music , i responded , not to say a gift of god , one ought not to explain by mocking antinomies , which only bear witness to the fullness of her nature
0	a second blackboard stood on an easel by the master 's chair
0	to military service he was not inclined
0	to myself , of course every word i write is of burning interest ; but what care must i take not to see this as a guarantee of the sympathy of the detached reader !
0	yes , sir , answered morten , trying to keep his face straight
0	you will get a free copy , castorp ; then you can project the secrets of your bosom on the wall for your children and grandchildren to see !
0	away to the mountains , away , away , share in our life , careless and gay ,
0	and they found him a disagreeable oddity , who did not care for horses or hunting or play or women
0	the likeness was plain as long as he was smooth-shaven , before he grew the heavy beard
0	they escaped her finally and went ; she kept on looking after them awhile , her body bent forward , her gaze so avid it seemed as though she would fairly suck them back with her eyes
0	what do we want of more ?
0	song was set according to the metrical laws of speech , it did not run articulated by bars and musical pe- riods ; rather it obeyed the spirit of free recitation
0	but it would have seemed too risky to put his opposition into words
0	until yesterday -- yesterday he was in a good mood , and asked me a dozen times if i loved him , and if i would put in a good word for him with you if he had something to ask you
0	he must have simply lapped it up
0	he sounded more than ever like a cracked plate and ended in a fit of coughing
0	was that artificial return simply a whim ?
0	at home , when i come down to breakfast , papa 's cigar-smoke is already in the room
0	it is , vritten by one not present , vhen he came , and only as clumsy words can approximate the scene
0	diederich schwarzkopf did not offer to shake hands with him
0	i would rather wash my hands of tke whole affair
0	this trouble with his teeth affected not only his spirits but also the functioning of all his other organs
0	squeal away , madame , squeal away , said he
0	it had flowered hangings and solid mahogany beds
0	but fet thee a cloak , a hat and rug
0	she talked well , she entertained her brother capitally
0	when do we lie down again ?
0	well , of course the dialectic of freedom is unfathomable
0	and his earliest researches in this kind discovered in himself an irremediable unpre-paredness
0	you may be right ; and , as i said , i am not going to press you
0	and where lllad- ness begins to be malady , there is nobody knows at all
0	things seemed in train
0	it was evening—and had just been morning
0	he forgot either to hang up or put down the picture he had been holding , but tugged it with him into the neighbouring room
0	it is certainly re- markable : a budding reputation such as had begun to attach it- self to leverkiihn 's name is unknown to the general , having its seat in the initiate sphere , on the heights of connoisseurship ; from those heights the invitation to paris had come
0	oh , you have company , he said
0	and truly the affair developed with precision
0	frau permaneder stood there , very erect , her shoul-ders rlevated , her black-bordered handkerchief between her folded hands ; and her pride in the chief role which it fell lo her lot to perform was so great as sometimes entirely to ob-scure her grief
0	the door was opened by a half-grown boy , in a sort of livery of gaiters and striped jacket , a little page , with shaven poll and rosy cheeks
0	sup-pose i were to marry again ?
0	i bought that knife in calcutta , of a blind wizard
0	even though with only half a discharge
0	what is the matter with them ?
0	he presented him to the guests : 'this is my son , studying to be a doctor
0	tell me -- i suppose the gentlemen you dance with are very agreeable ? -- no , no , that was not what i wanted to say
0	it was this he must let them know at home , even if only as a possibility ; he must tell the whole story , and not put them , or himself , off any longer with pretexts
0	a semi-circular niche in the remaining wall was occupied by the stove , which crackled away behind a polished wrought-iron screen
0	that future , to be sure , lookea quite different from the earlier dreams
0	a magic square , i said
0	it was no joke
0	it was not hard , with the help of sesemi 's bishop , to get acquainted
0	and more of the same kind
0	then she drew him into the bow-window and pointed
0	with the motif passed through many vi- cissitudes , which takes leave and so doing becomes itself entirely leave-taking , a parting wave and call , with this d g g occurs a slight change , it experiences a small melodic expansion
0	rudolf was not like that at all
0	i have long wished you would come to us on a visit by yourself , without your husband , so that we could be en famille together once more
0	i tell you , pfiihl , this music is less foreign to your inner self than you think !
0	yes , for us all , adrian said softly
0	yet can one quarrel vvith the jewish spirit when its quick hearing and recep- tivity for the coming thing , the new , persists also in the most ex- traordinary situations , where the avant-garde coincides with the reactionary ?
0	she is not taking much thought for her own condition , these days -- of course , of course
0	but in front of the build- ing i met a gentleman of the kridwiss group , the durer expert , professor gilgen holzschuher , who had also been at the concert
0	but to make clear what this last one , the old linden-tree , meant to him , is truly a ticklish endeavour ; requiring great delicacy of emphasis if more harm than good is not to come of the undertaking
0	she would reply : ah , very well
0	with pleasure , he said aloud , in the profound stillness
0	the interruption , indeed , had been insignificant , as he saw when he resumed his seat at table
0	certainly , as you say , it was he through whom the victory was achieved by harmony over counterpoint
0	they were many , varied , and hard to classify ; so interwoven and mingled they seemed , as almost to obscure any clear distinction between the concrete fact and the dreamed or imagined
0	the air is very strengthening to the nerves , and for the moment i am quite in order with my stomach trouble
0	he put it from him with manly sobriety , almost with regret
0	and this state of things showed itself by peculiar symptoms and strange whims , which he observed with surprise and dis-gust
0	ger- man youth , precisely as youth , represents the spirit of the people itself , the german spirit , which is young and filled with the fu- ture : unripe , if you like , but what does unripe mean ?
0	it was just like yours and mine , the bed on the side wall left of the door , and people were standing at the head , the relatives of course , the parents , talking soothingly at the bed , where you could see nothing but a formless mass that was begging and protesting horribly , and kicking about with its legs
0	the possibility has occurred to me that your symptoms were not necessarily to be referred to tuberculosis alone—because it is out of the question to refer them to it any longer
0	but the czech wenzel who operated it there was a not unmusical man , and would surely not injure or misuse the instrument ; hans castorp might hand it over without misgiving
0	but his frantic extravagance was a definite sign of an unbal- anced mind ; it had become intolerable ; and his powerlessness to govern had followed upon his unwillingness to govern : he had merely dreamed his kingship , refusing to exercise it in any normal form
0	chap-fallen , i see it every day , disgust and ennui are written on your brow
0	involuntarily the three paused here , the young girl first , to read the mournful inscriptions ; hans castorp stood relaxed , his hands clasped before him , his eyes veiled and his mouth somewhat open , young ziemssen very self-controlled , and not only erect , but even bending a thought backward ; and both the cousins stole a glance at karen ’ s face
0	as if lie down ’ isn ’ t just as good a word of command as stand up ’ !
0	they gossiped while they undressed -- in undertones , however , for it was ten o'clock and next door mlle
0	it was frau else schweigestill who advanced towards the travellers with dignified tread , met them at the gate , gave a friendly ear to their wants , and made lemonade in tall glasses with long spoons
0	they put up with his sllall tone
0	he was extremely surprised when i told him that fraulein gerda had actually given me ground for hope
0	that is bad , bourgeois nineteenth century
0	do you want to look all knocked up for the picnic ?
0	whither has the dream snatched us ?
0	for then spring is on the way again—the three-thousandth spring since the chaldeans ; and the days go on lengthening until we have come round the year , and summer begins again
0	she transmitted the desire of the whole family that they should come and receive the thanks due their gift ; and thus , on the next day but one , the deaconess ushered the two on tiptoe into leila ’ s apartment
0	to whom will you sell it , tom ?
0	you utter it so modestly—yet , taken with your person , it holds out such boundless possibilities
0	laughter , says the classic , is a sunbeam of the soul
0	don ’ t let them make too much of the funeral rites , don ’ t let them pay too much respect to such a simple fact as death—but without that simple fact , there would never have been either architecture nor painting , sculpture nor music , poetry nor any other art
0	with christian it was as with poor clothilde
0	oh , the thing is quite simple : christian busies himself too much with himself , with what goes on in his own insides
0	you insist on the incomparableness of the personal case
0	the humanistic grammar-school—you may call me reactionary , engineer , but in abstracto , generally speaking , you understand , i remain an adherent—
0	you wo not try a game , father ?
0	one goes off and keeps coming back , another stops long enough that he doesn ’ t need to come back
0	it is not a question of will-power
0	it was his ladies who kept up the feud now : not so much his good-natured wife as the three elderly damsels , who could not look at frau consul , or antonie , or thomas , without a spark in their eyes
0	you don ’ t play here ?
0	\ composi- tion can also use two or more series as basic inaterial , as in the double and triple fugue
0	but upon that darkness wherein he sought refuge from complete bewilderment , there broke the voice of herr settembrini , continuing to chant the praises of literature
0	do not say such things !
0	you must not talk like that , tom
0	he treads on the hand of a fallen comrade ; with his hobnailed boot he treads the hand deep into the slimy , branch-strewn ground
0	that 's tony , to the life , said the consul
0	but goodness , people do not die of a bad tooth !
0	dr faustus i curled angrily
0	but when i picture it to my-
0	even some of the more light-minded fathers of families , like justus kroger and , of course , peter dohlmann , were members , and police senator crema was here the first man at the hose
0	but seems to me you ’ ve made a splendid recovery , he said , shaking his head
0	the ladies , frau stöhr in the lead , with mesdames salomon , redisch , hessenfeld , magnus , iltis , levi , and the rest following hard upon , were taken in a variety of ways , some of them almost as badly as popoff
0	the man ought to be disciplined— disturbing the whole rest period with his gabble , and exciting the ladies so that it puts them back for weeks
0	she even visited and received natalie alone
0	malice , my dear sir , is the animating spirit of criticism ; and criticism is the beginning of progress and enlightenment
0	i am afraid i do not command the means of expression to bring my feelings and desires home to her
0	because i still feel so young , and still long to see life again
0	hofrat behrens personally instructed the novice how to sit and hold himself
0	only now and again there would be a sudden storm , a trifling mishap , like the following : herr stuht the tailor had made a new suit for each of the buddenbrook lads
0	\ uch rebellion in strict obedience is needed , much independence , much courage
0	naphta put in that herr settembrini was slightly disingenuous : his picture of thoth-trismegistus had a good deal of the reality smoothed away
0	only the neutral is free
0	there was some doubt whether he would then hold back his hand from the shedding of blood
0	this occurred at the end of his stay
0	a half-grown youth at the next table on the left , by his years a schoolboy , with his wrists coming out of his jacket sleeves , and thick , round eye-glasses , cut all the heaped-up food on his plate into a sort of mash , then bent over and gulped it down ; he reached with his serviette behind his glasses now and then and dried his eyes—whether it was sweat or tears he dried one could not tell
0	that was the gastrula , the protozoon , primeval form of all animal life , primeval form of flesh-borne beauty
0	it took time for the words to penetrate his consciousness
0	some people were slyer than foxes
0	these notes , that consoling and trusting offer each ether the hand ; that vveaving and winding of all things in likeness and change - of such it is , and adrian leverkuhn is its youthful naster
0	some seasons when the consul had business , there were long jour-neys
0	he misdoubted form , calling it pretence and play
0	have you forgotten what you learned in the schools , that god can bring good out of evil and that the occasiqn to it shall not be marred ?
0	a man who is capable of achievement over and above the average and expected modicum must be equipped either with a moral remoteness and single-mindedness which is rare indeed and of heroic mould , or else with an exceptionally robust vitality
0	he was conducting a lively correspondence with the flatland ; his resolve was ripening , his preparations drawing to a head
0	the occupants of the good russian table had withdrawn into a neighbouring small salon , separated from the card-room by a portière , where they formed a small and separate coterie , consisting , in addition to madame chauchat , of a languid , blond-bearded youth with a hollow chest and prominent eyeballs ; a young girl of pronounced brunette type , with a droll , original face , gold ear-rings , and wild woolly hair ; besides these , dr blumenkohl , who had joined their circle , and two other youths with drooping shoulders
0	she used no dialect , but enunciated clearly and with precision , stressing the consonants
0	all i can say is very long
0	and do not get irritated -- it makes for wrinkles
0	they went directly down to the entresol , where mamsell jungmann had laid the table and set the samo-var -- a real samovar , a present from pastor tiburtius and clara
0	but there was a bunch of flowers at tony 's place , the food looked inviting , and the drive had whetted her ap-petite
0	i can not recover , that is settled
0	it had been a mistake to suppose that two would be enough
0	slowly they went , in single file , up the narrow path that had been made in the snow , leaving the highest villas behind and below them , and watching the familiar scene unroll in its winter splendour , a little altered in perspective , and opening out to the north-west , toward the entrance of the valley
0	he meant it for a sort of compliment , i dare say ; but the truth is , you are a civilian—incurable
0	rather short on account of its ex- aggerated width , is flanked like a bier with gold candelabra
0	clarissa received the registered letter in pfeiffering , where after the close of the pforzheim theatre season she was spending a few weeks with her mother in the cottage under the chestnut trees
0	do you like to go to school ?
0	people do not say such things , she thought to herself ; and looked out to sea so as not to show her feeling by meeting his eyes
0	but suddenly she looked up , and her eyes had grown quite dark with tears
0	he said that the latter was characteristic of our intensely bourgeois age , our policy of molly-coddle
0	in freemasonry there are present a host of egyptian survivals , and there were , among the secret societies , some that called themselves eleusinian
0	my goodness , the sheets still have to be hemmed
0	on the contrary , he pointed out the high degree of significance which must be ascribed by god to this idea , when he had preferred to expose men and angels to sin rather than withhold freedom from them
0	as the gentlemen passed through the hall , they could hear from the landscape-room the first notes of the flute , accom-panied by the frau consul on the harmonium : an airy , charming little melody that floated sweetly through the lofty rooms
0	she finished , and furtively wrung her hands
0	i-ie felt a de- sire for more distant air , for surroundings of greater unfarrliliarity
0	he does not pause in his enthusiastic activity
0	i-ier mother was a parisian , a paralysed old lady , confined to her chair but full of mental energy , who had never given herself the trouble of learning german
0	i am merely stating our fundamental agreement with respect to the original , paradisial state of man , his freedom from law , and his unmediated relation with god , which state was lost to him by his fall
0	it seems to me i can not any more trust my five senses , and that i must confess disturbs me more than my cold feet and the heat in my face
0	you are repeating his words -- and i do not know that he would mind ; but even so i am not sure it was just the nicest thing to do
0	dans l ’ éternité , tu sais , on fait comme en dessinant un petit cochon : on penche la tête en arrière et on ferme les yeux
0	later she said she thought he would not have been allowed
0	he had lost a large sum of money in the affair -- but that had not been the unbearable thing about it
0	tony followed his gesture with her eye ; they sat , their hands lying close together on the bench , and looked into the distance
0	' n ' then i will be sittin ' on the sofa in a silk gownd , an ' you will be servin ' me
0	he had repeatedly to rest by the way , feeling the colour recede from his face , and cold sweat break out on his brow ; the wild beating of his heart took away his breath
0	but the tradition of the place held her in check
0	hans castorp felt an unwonted thrill—never before had he been so proud of his mother-tongue—yet at the same time experienced a temptation to offer up his pride on the altar of quite a different feeling—the rapture which filled him at the sound of her pretty stammerings and manglings of his speech
0	we met him in the person of fierr saul fitelberg , who appeared in pfeiffering one lovely day in late sudmer when i happened to be there
0	behrens is a regular dab at it
0	once more she repeated what comes next ?
0	they contained oxygen ; he had asked , and joachim informed him
0	you know , herr marcus , she said , about that man
0	i have always envied you when i saw you sit there and work , for it is really no work at all for you
0	why , certainly , herr settembrini—hans castorp hastened to abandon his forced and even peevish attitude , stop drumming on the bed-cover , and turn to his guest with friendliness , even with contrition
0	satisfying , but very hard
0	and you still have the family : cerda and me , and the buddenbrouks in broad street , and the krbgers , and therese weichbrodt , and clothilde -- that is , if clothilde will con- descend to associate with us , now that she 's become a lady of the order of st john -- it 's so very exclusive , you know !
0	it rained harder than ever
0	instead , he devoted himself for the time to the dainties that weighted down the table -- dainties such as he seldom saw the other side of the danube
0	my business is very flourishing -- ahem -- if i may be permitted to say so
0	ing the theatre season it was doubtless crowded with foreigners ; now , to our satisfaction , it was almost empty
0	but it is true that tony was the chief sufferer from the pious visitants
0	you shall see , engineer , the gayest gallants of the night , in brilliant rows advancing , he quoted , and went on in his most mocking vein , couching his gibes in sounding phrases , with a telling accompaniment of arm , shoulder , and head movements
0	but i ’ m not there yet !
0	he said : well , i am thinking of getting married , sooner or later
0	\ ou believe you can develop a just order out of the pure insight and reason of man , equating the just and the socially useful , and you think that out of it new political forms will come
0	how ’ s your cabbage-leaf , castorp ?
0	a , , ork-filled eternity of human life shall you enjoy
0	frau salomon from amsterdam would perch on the balustrade , hard pressed on the right by the knees of the thicklipped gänser , on the left by the swedish minion—who , it appeared , was quite recovered , but extending his cure for a little space before going home
0	their companions appeared with no great delay on the threshold ; peeperkorn ’ s kingly head seemed narrower ; he lifted his hat as he stood in a long , rather shabby ulster , by madame chauchat ’ s side , and his lips shaped a vague form of greeting to the company in general
0	the next morning he announced his willingness to take part m the evening seance ; and half an hour after dinner joined the group of familiars of the uncanny , who , unconcernedly chatting , took their way down to the basement
0	he remained in the salon , or returned stealthily thither , and played until deep in the night
0	let us not forget the condition of life as of narration : that we can never see the whole picture at once—unless we propose to throw overboard all the god-conditioned forms of human knowledge
0	yes , morten said , come and sit down
0	but for the rest , leverkiihn 's late work has little in common with that of his thirties
0	this door was at the end of the corridor , on your right as you came downstairs
0	i want my comfort
0	they had discovered that the process was facilitated by music ; and on these evenings the gramophone was pre-empted by the circle and carried down into the basement
0	i said , as lightly as possible
0	her birth , her childish illnesses , her first school , her boarding-school days at mademoiselle weichbrodt 's , her confirmation -- everything was carefully entered , with an almost reverent observation of facts , in the consul 's small , flowing business hand ; for was not the least of them the will and work of cod , who wonder-fully guided the destinies of the family ?
0	but first , a few brief explanations : the league for the organization of progress , mindful of its task of furthering human happiness—in other words , of combating human suffering by the available social methods , to the end of finally eliminating it altogether ; mindful also of the fact that this lofty task can only be accomplished by the aid of sociology , the end and aim of which is the perfect state , the league , in session at barcelona , determined upon the publication of a series of volumes bearing the general title : the sociology of suffering
0	this was clothilde , the daughter of a nephew of old buddenbrook who belonged to a penniless branch of the family and was in business at rostock as an estates agent
0	and ye could at the same time not exclude the theoretic possi- bility of spontaneous harmony between a man 's own needs and the moment , the possibility of 'rightness , of a natural harmony , j out of which one might create without a thought or any compul- sion
0	a man with a red beard arid brown tail-coat came in
0	your eyes , the master said , vainly seek to hide the fact that you are conscious of your state
0	ask anyone who is there , fetch some of your friends down from their balconies
0	time pressed ; there was no thought of preparation now
0	there was fräulein kneifer , ottilie kneifer , last year
0	he would utter the name of palestrina in the most dogmatic , awe-inspiring tone
0	ah , your good angel must have whispered you the thought !
0	sometimes julie 's brother hermann went to school at the same time with the two girls
0	well , that does sound most nice , he would ay when a tale was done ; but often he went to sleep with his head on the story-teller 's breast
0	but there was not a single white hair to be seen in her smooth red-blonde coiffure
0	schildknapp and i exchanged looks
0	said hans castorp , and flung off his covers
0	and it was nice of him to give me advice gratis like that— sine pecunia , as he put it
0	for such qualities , my dear chap , the inhabitants of the economic sphere do not contribute the necessary existential correspondences
0	but after all , a dying man has something in a way—sacred about him
0	and in the second monologue elements of the first are thus delightfully recalled to the mind
0	imagine , he talks about the earth being thirsty , and uses a fig- ure of speech like that , adrian related to me next time , in , von- der
0	stances in view of the times she lived in , this upsetting and under- mining social epoch , did it hold out any hope of satisfaction
0	but they were so close he had to slide sidewise from his seat , and then the three stood in a triangle , the centre of which was the chair
0	every one stood talking and laughing ; they all showed each other their presents and admired the presents of others
0	would he take after him , and be a drag , a conservative element ?
0	a physician cites a case of a twelve-year-old-girl , who fell asleep and slept thirteen years ; assuredly she did not remain thereby a twelve-year-old girl , but bloomed into ripe womanhood while she slept
0	but you must be sure to give it me back , after the period
0	you just change it
0	he had intended to be a priest ; but on account of his tendency to stutter and his leaning toward the good things of life he had become a pedagogue instead
0	they flew like lightning round and round each other , clacking all the while
0	the path had become level
0	and he suddenly gives a short groan , full of horror and affright , starts up in his chair , and acts as if he were trying to escape
0	but with the last word he lifted the fist that had been lying relaxed on the table , and brought it down with a crash , making our slim young hans castorp , overwrought as he was with wine and play , and the singularity of the whole scene , jump , and in startled awe look at the mighty one
0	it was very strange , partly painful and partly comic , to observe riedesel 's conservatism in contact with another brand of the same thing
0	he quenched one flame after another under the little metal cap
0	herr sonnenschein , with one black eye , a bleeding lacuna in the curling black locks about his brow , was led into the bureau , where he sat down , buried his face in his hands and wept bitterly
0	twenty-eight is free , so far as i know
0	in other words , they were in part the fruit of joachim ’ s presence , in part the result of hans castorp ’ s own moral compunctions ; but also , in part , they rested upon his sure intuition that social relations with frau chauchat , conventional relations , in which one made bows and addressed her as madame , and spoke french as far as possible , were not the thing at all , were neither necessary nor desirable
0	it would not only have tranquillized my indefinite concern , al- ways present , albeit silently ; and moreover it would have touched me deeply , for the sacrificium intellectus , which of necessity con- templation and knowledge of the other world carries with it , must be esteemed the more highly , the more powerful the intel- lect that makes it
0	on the one hand it is bad news , on the other grand news—and in any case a change
0	it was true that hanno had laughed
0	so much was certain , that by little and little they had now got well on in september , close on to the middle
0	hans castorp , still quite absorbed by that glimpse , instinctively tried to make his own eyes as large , as slowly gazing and meaningful as those of the dying man , walking on as he did so , toward the stairs , and encountering a lady who came out of a room behind him and overtook him at the landing
0	he half-way admitted that theology , as an empiric study , had disappointed him ; the reasons of course being to seek not in that revered science , nor with his academic teachers , but in himself
0	i am raging , you will
0	hans castorp for his part sat with bowed head , trying to reflect on what had been said and test his own understanding of it
0	well , well , what a long time ago that was !
0	on with the dance !
0	respectable townsfolk - and their pensive mood rejoices in the protection of halberdiers
0	it stands , vholly and entirely at the service of the regime which brought us into this war , laid the continent literally at our feet and replaced the in- tellectual 's dream of a european germany with the upsetting , rather brittle reality , intolerable , so it seems to the rest of the world , of a german europe
0	he was rich , he told them , and an orphan
0	this was hans castorp , who was supposed to answer
0	not that , even up here , they did not make jests on the subject
0	the excellent management , in its sleepless concern for the happiness of its guests , had considered matters , there in the bowels of the earth , had resolved , and acted
0	hans castorp was aware , and had even spoken of the fact , that madame chauchat ’ s profile was not her strong point , that it was no longer quite youthful , was even a little sharp
0	but there is—a line drawn , a certain—a withdrawal— which makes comprehensible madame chauchat ’ s—
0	half past nine—i say , did you get that ?
0	all of us up here are frightfully fed up , you can imagine , said joachim , and twisted his mouth into an expression of disgust that was as unlike him as the shoulder-shrug
0	to be sure , he had blithely said , and written , that he must spend the winter up here with joachim , because of what the doctors had discovered to be the state of his health
0	when they began to talk shop , they slipped unconsciously more and more into dialect , and used the clumsy but com-fortable idioms that ' seemed to embody to them the busi-ness efficiency and the easy well-being of their community
0	what we had here was conscious emancipation from the natural , a contempt for nature manifested by a pious refusal to pay her any homage whatever
0	what are these rumours that fly about ?
0	that seems sheer twaddle to me
0	but i won ’ t give way ; now i have begun , i won ’ t give him the last word if i can help it
0	however much i dislike hearing that conception of moonshine and cobwebs people call the soul ’ played off against the body , yet , within the antithesis of body and mind , the body is the evil , the devilish principle , for the body is nature , and nature—within the sphere , i repeat , of her antagonism to the mind , and to reason—is evil , mystical and evil
0	in every bar that one dares to think , the situation as regards technique presents itself to him as a problem
0	they tried another tack , invoked more powerful spells , came on the aristocratic problem , on popularity and exclusiveness
0	the mood of the piece in question was peculiar to itself , quite special—he suggested they should try it
0	what was there about the rolling up of a cloth to take to heart ?
0	it might be still finer , they ironically said , if only age were to judge youth and youth could only be the subject of outside observation , as though it had no share of objective mind
0	if it comes to exist—and i repeat that we labour with silent assiduity upon this great task—then indeed the religious creed of the freemason will be unanimous , and it will be écrasez l ’ infame !
0	and directly before the manœuvres he has been so on fire to go to
0	he had been fellow citizen and brother-in-arms to any people struggling for its liberties
0	i recall that as we drove and later while we took our evening meal in the cleanly hotel opposite the cloister we talked at length about the unhappy king ( why , really , unhappy ? )
0	sion of heterogeneous elements - as though it were not enough that i did not succeed better with what came before
0	it costs you nothing and you will have a lot of satisfaction from it
0	you make yourself a laughing-stock with your love affairs , your harlequinades , your diseases and your remedies
0	me either , on grounds similarly hard to justify ; and the same was true without reservation of the poet daniel zur hohe who was often present
0	it was fortunate , then , that the heads had their unchanging eyes upon him , that they knew how to read his face , and were ready to tide him over the hard place with new and fruitful diversions
0	mais va donc avec ton behrens !
0	one beer , six milks -- sweet milk , buttermilk , sour milk , clotted milk , herr consul ?
0	hans castorp laughed good-humouredly over the bundle of hay , likewise over the beautiful characters—or , rather , the drolly despairing way settembrini spoke of them
0	christmas eve came on apace , one day it was at hand , the next it was here
0	a child , at the last , it may be
0	but the responsibility is mine , and as such i feel it
0	tell me : you love your husband with your whole heart , do not you ?
0	herr gr� looked at his banker helplessly and beg ?
0	then slowly he retraced the path that more than a year ago he had first traversed with joachim
0	they do that too , then ?
0	he looked at it with the same avid curiosity now as then
0	think it over , gr�
0	bread of god , bread of sunshine , little pet name ; bread for the laving of man ’ s weary spirit
0	he perceived the lamentable failure of his occasional efforts : he knew they only strained the relations between father and son
0	i ca not undo my shoe-lace ; please , gerda
0	has it not been relaxed by an excessive flexibility ?
0	he put on a horn-rimmed pince-nez , the nose-piece of which rode high up on his forehead , and ordered champagne , three bottles of mumm & co , cordon rouge , extra dry , with petits fours , toothsome cone-shaped little dainties in lace frills , covered with coloured frosting and filled with chocolate and pistache cream
0	they received him into the club with open arms ; for , while neither business men nor scholars found him a genius , they recognized his amusing social gifts
0	but it is good to speak out , and it will help you to put all that kind of thoughts out of your mind
0	le-brecht kr� sat up as straight as he did at the beginning ; pastor wunderlich 's face was as pale as ever , his manner as correct
0	but this posture of his was familiar to everybody ; somebody had put some ink on the right spot , and herr modersohn 's small clumsy hand got all inky
0	the last candle burned lower and lower
0	but at the same time i had it in mind to connect those very qualities and charac- teristics with the abstract speculations to which i was exposed in the house of herr sextus i { ridwiss and to which i referred on an earlier page
0	but the great thing is that you are here
0	for whereas the sleeping hans castorp had more than once upbraided the organ-grinder to his face and done his utmost to drive him away because he felt him a disturbing influence , the waking one lent him an attentive ear and made an honest effort to minimize the opposition which his mentor ’ s ideas and conceptions persistently aroused in him
0	her hair came in disorder from under her close hat , and her face showed the pale yellow tint which it always had when her digestion took a turn for the worse
0	was it , as a conception , worth worshipping ?
0	furniture wagons stood before the door , and the old house was emptiej of its contents
0	and the bathing here was a different affair altogether from that in herr asmussen 's establishment
0	they were thinking how little they had expected such an outcome as this to their excursion
0	cried a voice flom the tiny audience , for the speaker could simply not get the word out , often as he had used it before , but kept on mumbling the m yes , of course , said he , released and relieved
0	what depiction of suffering !
0	dora the cd ok , about whose honesty tony had had her doubts , was busy in the dining-room
0	even to lift his stiffened lids to peer before him was so great and so nearly useless an effort as to offer him small incentive
0	it is the ultimate , the return to a state of nature , slightly mitigated by regulations which are chivalrous in character , but extremely superficial
0	i shuddered at the awful deed ; at the same tinle , in memory of myoid friendship , i felt almost , nay , i felt definitely proud that in all her sunken state she found the strength , the fu- rious energy to commit it
0	but it was herr settembrini who had demanded and introduced confession , and he , accordingly , who was responsible for torture
0	they played half the notes falsely ; they had no idea of rhythm , and they were badly in want of tuning
0	his snow-white locks streamed over his face , his chin pro-truded grimly , he succeeded for once in looking thoroughly hump-backed
0	neither one nor the other , he answered him- self ; they were parallel phenomena
0	they had exchanged the nike salon , where they had sat at first , for the ab- bot 's room , shutting out the light with blinds and hangings , so that it was as i had known it : at first complete night to the eyes , then they learned to distinguish more or less the position of the furniture and perceived the weakly trickling shimmer of the outer light , a pallid gleam on the walls
0	yet it was dreadful to see how his ruin as a citizen , the judicial correction , and the three years ' imprisonment , had operated to break down his morale
0	the people , de-lighted at the successful outcome of the revolution , were out in the gayest mood
0	we repeat that natural sympathy was in play here too , the close family tie and essential intimacy which not infrequently leaps over an intervening generation
0	heavens , how he must adore her , to go on like that , while she herself felt com-pletely indifferent !
0	they call themselves the half-lung club ; everybody knows them by that name
0	they hurried into their clothes
0	when we go into society -- for example , to kesselmeyer 's , or to consul goudstikker on the alster dam , or senator bock in city hall street -- we have to take a hired coach
0	the fourth month she faints during the examination
0	since he had understood in that new , penetrating sense why joachim had changed colour , the whole world seemed altered to him , he felt pierced for the second time by that feeling of extravagant joy and suspense
0	once he had added : with some liberties ( mit einigen preiheiten ) , in token that the rules he had of- fended against were well known to him
0	interesting sure enough , responded the hofrat
0	the amount must have been very small , continued the hofrat
0	jacobs could do it -- the upholsterer in fish street
0	beyond them still , young men were practising archery
0	but if other children came up to them on the mill-wall , as she sat with hanno on a bench , fraulein junginann would get up almost at once , make some excuse or other -- it was late , or there was a draught -- and take her charge away
0	it was not talked about ; no questions were asked of justus kroger ; but it got about that jacob had a position as travelling man in new york and was about to sail
0	supervision was exercised by a master in a slouch hat , who munched a ham sandwich the while
0	strange , strange , he murmured
0	if he refuses , we need not be discouraged
0	i am going away , she repeated , smiling with pretended surprise at his discomfiture
0	he grew red with pleasure , his tears seemed this time actually on the point of falling
0	and every-body knows how they do it
0	it must be nice to be in the university
0	even after a year or more he had got so little upon the frere et cochon footing with the seventy members that he did not manage to call them all by their right names or addr
0	schwerdtfeger was silent for a few paces
0	but so it stands , my friend , the masterpiece , the self-sufficient form , belongs to traditional art , emancipated art rejects it
0	she expressed herself in the most childish way
0	his manner was free and easy and like a man of the world 's , which did not fail to make a certain impression on madame permaneder ; the more so that he nearly always turned to her as he spoke
0	if you mounted the slope from the end of the sledge-run in the village , you could reach in some twenty minutes the picturesque spot where the wooden bridge of the path through the forest crossed above the run as it came down from the schatzalp , provided you kept to the shortest route , did not loiter about , nor pause too long to get your breath
0	i should like to think he was truly drawn to adrian , and that his own feeling was the source of the unerring and staggering self-confidence which finally made conquest of coldness and melancholy
0	when in her half-german , half-french letters she men- tioned the signora , she called her mere manardi
0	but one day he received rudolf 's confession - a singular busi- ness indeed
0	for goodness ’ sake , stop !
0	and after their first day this phrase became a convenient one
0	but it was astonishing how lax the angelic watch had always been in the case of god 's saints , at least so far as peace came in question
0	you have always been a better son to our parents ; but if you really stood so much closer to them than i do , you might have absorbed a little of their christian charity
0	but that would be only a mercy for him , a blessed relief
0	he saw himself and his brother christian , walking around the garden of the meng street house , involved in a quarrel -- one of those painful , regrettable , healed discussions
0	the consul had to come to her de-fence
0	he shoved back his chair , went into the salon , and lighted several burners of the chandelier over the centre-table
0	the son of the house of schweigestill , gereon , the same who had introduced the new danure-spreader , a young farmer rather disobliging and curt but obviously knowing his business , awaited the guest at the little station , on the box of a trap with a high frame and stiff springs
0	all the guests declared they could not bear to look any more at the snow , they were sick of it ; they had had their fill in the summer-time , and now these masses and heaps and slopes and cushions of snow , day in and day out , were more than they could stand , their spirits sank under the weight of it
0	they talked about it in glowing terms on the bourse for a whole week
0	a carpet almost covering the floor , only too necessary in tinter , soon hid the worn boards ; and to the corner bench , the only seat in the room besides the savonarola chair in front of the work-table , there was added after a few days without any fastidi- ous regard for style , which was not in adrian 's line , a very deep reading- and easy-chair covered with grey velvet , from bern- heimer 's in \unich , a commendable piece , which together with its separate stool , a tabouret with a cushion , deserved the name of chaise-longue ; it took the place of a divan , and did its owner al- most two decades of service
0	the second week was passing ; soon two-thirds of his holiday would be gone ; the third week would no sooner begin than it would be time to think of packing
0	when she sang isolde 's frau minne kenntest du nicht , and marked by an energetic downward thrust of her arms the ecstatic die fackez , war 's zeines lebens licht lachend sie zu lijschen zagt ' ich nicbt , it did not lack much for me , with tears in my eyes , to have knelt before the singer as she stood tri- umphantly smiling , overwhelmed with applause
0	but it was hardly carducci ’ s devil you had in mind when you spoke ; for he is on the very best of terms with hard work ; whereas yours , who is afraid of work and hates it like poison , is probably the same of whom we are told that we may not hold out even the little finger to him
0	well , come along , let me thump you about a bit
0	a little girl spoke a piece , a common soldier was with difficulty prevented from reading to the end a manuscript that began dear citizens and citizenesses !
0	there were citizens ' papers , with the seal and crest of the free hansa town ; insurance policies ; letters inviting this or that buddenbrook to become god-father for a colleague 's child : congratulatory epistles and occasional poems
0	as they went into the smoking room , herr kesselmeyer said vivaciously : have you had a pleasant journey ?
0	you had just come
0	one has to bear these things
0	in any case , laughed hans castorp , we have it all right before our eyes
0	frightfully funny man , is behrens ; killingly funny , makes you die of laughing
0	the corner of his eyebrow went up , and his cigarette moved from one corner of his mouth to the other : his thoughts were probably with the little flower-girl with the malay face , who had lately married the son of her employer and now herself carried on the shop in fishers ' lane
0	a brick , gentlemen , a brick , or at least half a brick -- crack !
0	do you know , he countered , when i came nearest to the 'strict style ' ?
0	bride for the first time into the landscape-room and took her to his mother , who received her with outstretched arms
0	thus the eating of the little book , which albrecht durer also boldly made the subject of one of his woodcuts , is taken alnst word for word from ezekiel , down to the detail that it ( or the roll , therein ianentation and mourning and woe ) in the mouth of the obediently eating one , -as as honey for sweetness
0	dark blue spots of congested blood on clarissa 's lovely hands and on her face indicated death by quick suffocation , the abrupt paralysis of the organs of breathing by a dose of cyanide large enough to kill a regiment
0	they will go away after a bit
0	he had a long consultation with the frau senator , and then hanno was summoned and put , half undressed , through a long examination of his status praesens , as dr langhals called it , looking at his finger-nails
0	what did the girl say ?
0	and the information the consul had had , the books he had examined -- ?
0	for theirs was a work of supererogation ( ex supererogatione ) in that they not only combated the rebellion of the flesh ( rebellio carnis ) , which after all was incumbent upon any average healthy human reason to do , but were hostile to even an inclination toward the things of the sense , toward love of self and love of worldly things , even where these had not been directly forbidden
0	in the act of leaving , however , and already at the door , frau-permaneder turns
0	anal- ysis has necessarily the appearance of coolness , even when prac- tised in a state of profound agitation
0	he lil { ed to say well : well , it was lovely
0	there was one new-comer , a hollow-cheeked , green-complexioned young man , who had been given a place at the next table on the right with frau iltis and the ivory-skinned levi
0	he is a most constant wooer
0	and at the end he asked to have money sent : a monthly cheque of eight hundred marks would cover everything
0	he paid frau stöhr compliments that made the vulgar creature bridle more extravagantly than ever , and become almost senseless with affectation
0	for you , personally , engineer , she is beyond all doubt dangerous
0	trina , the cook , who had never before been anything but loyal and dutiful to her mistress , had suddenly shown clear signs of revolt
0	any theoretic science which is without practical application to man ’ s salvation is as such without significance , we are commanded to reject it
0	to the utmost of their icy ability they dabbled in the organic ; and that jonathan could never get over , nor cease his more or less disapproving but also admiring shakes of the head
0	he asked , as they went down the steps
0	the rest of the guests were scattered in different coaches , with exception of the schlaginhaufen pair , the suabian-speaking old rentier and the foriler von plausig , who together with their friends fron the op- era made the trip by car
0	came a sudden cry , and herr albin nodded
0	oh , it 's you , hanno , he said
0	he was nearly as old as johann buddenbrook , and dressed in much the same style except that his coat was green instead of mouse-coloured
0	they held her by the arms , and i rushed over to rudolf , who had been stretched out on the now empty bench
0	but he spent more of his time at the club than in meng street , for life there was not made any too pleasant for him
0	frau stöhr , fräulein engelhart , hermine kleefeld and her friend the tapir-faced girl , herr albin , the young man with the finger-nail , and perhaps others among the guests—would stand together and watch him , with the corners of their mouths drawn down , fairly chortling , whilst he , poor wight , his face aglow with the heat that from the first had never left him , with the glittering eye the gentleman rider ’ s cough had kindled , would gaze , forlornly and frantically smiling , in one certain direction
0	what will you have to do now ?
0	what a charming sight altogether , this host of shawms in their highly developed stage of technical perfection , challenging the passion of the virtuoso in all of their forms : as bucolic oboe , as cor anglais well versed in tragic ways ; the many-keyed clarinet , which can sound so ghostly in the deep chalumeau register but higher up can glean in silvery blossoming harmony , as basset horn and bass clarinet
0	had he not once , who always sat so erect at table , loathed and despised the banging of doors , and never , never was tempted to gnaw his fingers , because to that end maria had been given him instead , had he not once taken deep offence at the unmannerly behaviour of frau chauchat , and felt an unconquerable sense of superiority when he heard the narrow-eyed one essay to speak his mother-tongue ?
0	on the contrary , naphta hastened to say
0	a return after this parting - im- possible !
0	everything is a matter of ripeness and of dear time
0	but after all , ° was unquestionably fever , even though no higher than the earlier record
0	space , rolling and revolving between him and his native heath , possessed and wielded the powers we generally ascribe to time
0	but in such a connexion it would be paradoxical to speak of time as passing slowly ; and paradox , with reference to such a hero , we would avoid
0	herr benthien , the draper , a prosperous looking man , had a large group of gentlemen around him , to whom he wad circumstantially describing what had happened to his show-window
0	let it go hang !
0	he : it is that extravagant living , the only one that suffices a proud soul
0	at all events , here was one on whom the authorities no longer needed to keep an eye , being assured that no wild or defiant resolves were ripening in his breast
0	are you willing to keep office hours and observe appearances ?
0	the occasion was to be signalized by the presentation of the gift to the head of the establishment , which accordingly took place , in the room with the optical apparatus
0	teredo but one has to admit that the domestication of sex , which is evil by nature , into christian marriage was a clever makeshift
0	can you see the hilus glands ?
0	hermann hagenstrbm would hardly have been the man for the job
0	the cousins smiled at the deception , and for joy at the wonder before their eyes—at this timorous and lovely assumption of protective coloration , as it were , on the part of these first shy returning motions of organic life
0	he went so far as to ask him to orchestrate the piano reductions of single acts from operas unknown to adrian , and the conparison of that , vhich the pupil tried , who had heard and read berlioz , debussy , and the german and austriall late ro- mantics , with that which grctry or cherubini had actually done made llaster and pupil laugh
0	what were they so jolly about ?
0	but she so hung upon them , with words and looks , that it was painful to see , putting forth all her powers to hold them only a little longer—it would have been cruel not to have vouchsafed her another few minutes
0	and now clara 's dowry is permanently lost , and her whole inheritance besides for an indefinite period
0	she never saw me , and i made bold to lay my hand on her sleeve , for my mind misgave me about the state of things
0	the world was upside down
0	i scarcely need to say that adrian was remote from the beginnings of the events i shall speak of here , being aware of them only to a certain extent and that only through me , who had much more social curiosity or shall i say human sym- pathy
0	his brother , george , now long since the master of buchel , was five years his senior
0	the young man came to the funeral , the arrangements for which fell to my lot
0	you must apply to your father-in-law
0	better go in the huesli and see the uncle
0	have you a heart to feel what i endure ?
0	their wet , mud-bespattered faces , framed between strap and grey-covered helmet , are flushed with exertion—perhaps too with the sight of the losses they suffered on their march through that boggy wood
0	amelia had a habit , at table , of moving spoons or forks to and fro in front of her eyes and repeating with a questioning intonation sotie word that had stuck in her mind
0	in short , as you know , betsy , i can only wish for the consummation of this match , which would be highly advantageous for the family and the firm
0	and , then , suddenly , abruptly , with a start , he awoke and felt as one feels on realizing , suddenly , a budding love in the heart
0	why should not he buy it -- you know ?
0	sitting very erect , he would turn the whole upper part of his body to speak to his neighbour ( with selfpossession , of course , and a little platt ) and he kept his elbows well in as he dismembered his piece of fowl , or deftly , with the appointed tool , drew the rosy flesh from a lobster ’ s shell
0	well , well , said tom , you can have a rest and the sea-baths
0	there was a birthday celebration , and he came home a little bit exalted , so to speak , and was guilty of a false step , an unseemly blunder -- 'thomas , said she , i do not understand you
0	this was a great pleasure
0	we have begun - monsignor hinterpfortner and i are no longer exceptions - to expect anything and everything from the , var technique of the anglo-saxons
0	they were good-sized , seating each ten persons , though not all of them were at present full
0	it goes against my sense of form -- it is a piece of bad taste , in short
0	do not lain it thus , as though you had not been long since expecting me !
0	his face white as a sheet , his coat spotted with blood—he might have been a murderer stealing from his crime
0	and then -- six glasses of milk and a glass of beer -- if i am not mistaken , herr permaneder ?
0	everywhere is adrian leverkiihn great in making unlike the like
0	he was wont to rest from these terrors and ecstasies in another number , brief , yet with a concentrated power of enchantment ; peaceful , compared with the other , an idyll , yet raffiné , shaped and turned with all the subtlety and economy of the most modern art
0	but outside they had probably not held their tongues ; for shortly afterwards frau schweigestill came quietly in , in her apron , , vith her smooth grey head , and stood near the door , with folded hands
0	something amazing , something dreadful , something at which the very actors in the scene themselves stood aghast and incredulous
0	then there was a woman named mathilde spiegel , dressed in the fashion of a bygone time : she wore a train trimmed with ruffles , and a fladus - a ridiculous corruption of the french flute douce , originally meaning flattery , but here used for a curious coiffure with curls and ornaments
0	a common word never crossed his lips ; and the most ordinary business expressions he would hiss between his clenched teeth , as if he were saying curses on you , villain , instead of some commonplace about stocks , and commissions
0	but he takes no offence at that
0	my first excursion was no great success
0	and yet he had an inward conviction that we ought to think about it , ought to realize what a blessed , what a well-nigh miraculous arrangement it was
0	the meadows were covered with silvery-grey webs
0	how happy she must be !
0	they went back along the path in the same order as they had come , through the draped , uncanny grove , to the high road and the waiting carriages
0	to make a new home , and a radical change in his outward life ; to pack up , to re-install himself afresh , to weed out all the accumulations of bygone years and set aside every-thing old or superfluous : all this , even in imagination , gave him feelings of freshness , newness , spotlessness , stimulation
0	this emmy , then , had been discovered in her room at one o ’ clock at night in company with another sufferer , a greek named polypraxios , the same whose shapely legs had attracted favourable attention the night of mardi gras—a young chemist whose father owned dye-works in the piraeus
0	afterwards , as the meal progressed , the hofrat made a little speech , incited thereunto by james , who unexpectedly asked him , down the whole length of the table , what was the process of physical decomposition
0	this industrious , solid citizen with the rough exterior and no social graces , who devoted himself with an obstinate sense of duty to his work alone -- this man was supposed to have been guilty , not once but repeatedly , of a serious fault : he was accused of , he had been indicted for , performing a business manoeuvre which was not only questionable , but directly dishonest and criminal
0	straight under the tongue , seven minutes , four times a day , and shut the lips well over it
0	that we shall soon -- we can soon see -- !
0	he would be so good , he was told , to have patience for a few days ; the hofrat was busy , there were operations and general examinations , suffering humanity must take precedence , that was a sound christian principle ; and as he was ostensibly in good health , he must get used to the idea that he was not number one up here , that he must stand back and await his turn
0	then , with a series of starts , she came to herself , blinked in her turn at the light with sleep-stiffened eyes and smiled
0	but it is she who sometimes visits him ; not often , once in the year for a little while
0	very much better than a knave
0	did the gentlemen know that he—the hofrat—had invented the summer season ?
0	but she saw that patience was her only weapon ; for it was long before her question drew out any reply
0	who else , i should like to know , is to speak of it today ?
0	what possible objection could there be ?
0	and did they really become him -- him , thomas buddenbrook , head of the firm of johann buddenbrook ?
0	good and evil , sanctification and criminal conduct , all mixed up together !
0	he rolled his r 's as if his palate were greased
0	dnly -- in the present case is not this consideration for the tradition a little exaggerated ?
0	in the first place , they would not let me ; and in the second place , i should never really know enough
0	don ’ t talk to me about literature , says he
0	it is settled now
0	and he would go on into joachim ’ s balcony
0	herr settembrini had no doubt that the speaker would find ways and means of reconciling his scorn of the golden age of rome with his office as teacher of latin
0	certainly , of course , he would hasten to remark , so that nobody might say of him that with all his elegance he was limited
0	mitique - there must be some peculiar and interesting psycho- logical association : i do not ask , i consider all possibilities , i frankly bring them all up , even the most fantastic
0	you can imagine we had much to talk about at the table , but we had left the old memories behind by the end of the soup , and went on to more serious and fascinating matters
0	i can imagine herr settembrini coming in suddenly and turning on the light , to let reason and convention reign—it is a weakness of his
0	but that is a delusion
0	a few details : the part of the whore of babylon , the woman on the beast , with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication , is , surprisingly enough , a most graceful coloratura of great virtuosity ; its brilliant runs blend at times with the orchestra exactly like a flute
0	certainly , papa , answered she
0	going slightly pale , and blinking , he expressed his admiration for the splendid ruby colour of his life-blood , as it mounted in the glass container
0	i remarlced again with unspoken arnusement the in- voluntary attention and more or less timid reverence paid to him
0	but on the other hand , he left the little angel ecstasies to sim- pler folk
0	moderate activity is all right ; but not too much craving for adventure , no coying with the bride of the storm
0	naphta sharply forbade settembrini to call himself an individualist , for so long as he denied the antithesis between god and nature , saw in the problem of man ’ s inward conflict no more than the struggle between individual and collective interest , and was vowed to a materialistic and bourgeois ethic , in which life became an end in itself , limited to utilitarian aims , and the moral law subserved the interest of the state
0	i must look it out
0	once at the bottom they would turn and trundle their toy sledges uphill again
0	why does almost everything seem to me like its ovvn parody ?
0	she uttered it with her shoulders lifted and her eyes rolled up
0	tom , she said ; and she looked at him , holding the paper with both hands , as if she hesitated to show it to him
0	the family went about rather subdued and did not speak much about it , with the exception of the chief actor in the affair , who , on the contrary , talked about it inexhaustibly , and was entirely in her element
0	you do reverence to a hollow mask
0	this basket had a border of head-work embroidery , done by little meta , the eight-year-old daughter , who now sat next her mother , dressed in a plain frock , her flaxen hair in a thick pigtail
0	as one would expect , from a man without passion !
0	first time , then the barber , performed their office upon our hero
0	inquired settembrini , who had lounged up among the other guests , hands in pockets , and now presented himself before hans castorp
0	can you find it in your heart to say : ' i despise you ' ?
0	yet each , in itself—this was the uncanny , the anti-organic , the life-denying character of them all—each of them was absolutely symmetrical , icily regular in form
0	first of all to show him attention and help him pass the time ; but also to be edified by the motions of the great man ’ s personality
0	there you have the whole thing , she was always like that
0	frau stöhr went about for days quite outraged on account of a loan of ten francs which she inadvisedly laid out for frau iltis at the meeting , and which the latter had forgotten to return
0	even so , not always , and so probably unintentionally , some loose strands hung charm- ingly down in front of the ears
0	she sat with her body turned to the right , staring with red , excited eyes out of the window
0	it was precisely the opposite , it was very physical , it was material , it could not possibly be called either holy , or pensive , or beautiful—not even mournful
0	in every other field you have a perception of the banal -- in music not
0	if you give gotthold a compensation for the house , you have started the hall rolling
0	and of which you owe me an explanation
0	what are you quarrelling about ?
0	i suppose there is nobody grand enough these days to occupy the whole thing
0	right , but as explanation does not go far enough
0	here was the object of his rigid devotion , whereas naphta with reprehensible looseness referred truth back to mankind itself , and declared that that was truth which advantaged man
0	in addition to the guests already named , i mention a few more of those present , at randolti and from mem- ory : the wealthy bullinger , leo zink , the painter , whom neither
0	you looked at the thick ash-blonde hair , rolled at the sides , drawn back above the little ears , and fastened on the top of the head with a broad tortoise-shell comb ; at the soft expression of her grey-blue eyes , her pretty upper lip , the fine oval and delicate colour of her face -- and you thought of three-and-twenty , perhaps ; never of thirty
0	he was vain , that is , not in a common , yay , but in poetic reference to the endless potential of happiness in the world , far outbidding his own power of resolution , for which he wished to keep himself young and handsome ; he was aggrieved at the tendency of his face to be prematurely wrinkled and weather-beaten
0	the striped brown blinds were down , the low , red-shaded lamp burned on the table , there was a faint smell of violets and fresh wash , and a delicious atmosphere of laziness and dreams
0	he repeated his inquisition ; and even added , of his own motion : pretty nice , what ?
0	in her whole insignificant fig-ure , in her every movement , there indwelt a force which was , to be sure , somewhat comic , yet exacted respect
0	in the mood that had come over him so unexpectedly , his goggling eyes blinked , and the bone of his neck stuck out , both more than ever ; his upper lip , with the clipped , onesided moustache , had taken on a querulous expression
0	he seemed not to have been listening
0	said he , pale in the face , but in his clear , scholarly , well-articulated , short-winded way of speaking
0	and the wedding day drew near
0	they possessed the most re-markable theories concerning inner light and intuition and the transmission of thought
0	you would come along and turn on the electric light and bring the young men back to the path of virtue—that ’ s what you do , isn ’ t it ?
0	when the service and the burial were over , and the seventy or eighty hired coaches began to roll back to town , gotthold buddenbrook asked the consul 's permission to go with him , that they might speak together in private
0	she had a thick pigtail , good-natured blue eyes , and a broad mecklenburg accent , and went about thinking just nothing at all on the subject
0	on the stair hans castorp said : that was awful
0	madame k�n , may i have the honour ?
0	and how does rosaline come to apply to the sharp-tongued , merry biron of the play such wisdom as : the blood of youth burns not with such excess as gravity 's revolt to wantonness ?
0	it hung by itself in a glass of water , werein jonathan had sub
0	she remained some time in the water , trying to contract some illness or other—alas , she was , and remained , quite sound
0	he looked pale and made the impression of a man who has had a heavy blow
0	the senator sat quite still and looked the speaker full in the face
0	no slightest adverse comment upon the said table being intended by the remark !
0	i could recite to any child - though not nearly so well as echo did - what the neighbours had to bear froin the hullabaloo those hurdy-gurdies kept up
0	willingly indeed did she go to her death , with the ex- press declaration that even if she were freed she would prefer the stake , in order to escape from the po , ver of the demon , so re- pugnant had her life become to her through ler subjection to her filthy sin
0	there is outcry over these crimes against culture , crimes that we ourselves invoked ; hovy strange it sounds in the mouths of those vvho trod the boards of history as the heralds and bringers of a world-rejuvenating barbarism , revelling in atrocity
0	the senator sat down at the round table and tried to read the jokes in a volume of fliegsnde blatter , flung down the hook , and pressed the cool silver handle of his walking-stick against his cheek
0	he made no bones of saying that in giving herself to him now , she was buying peace only for the moment , buying the trip to strasbourg , the betrothal
0	the solid parts are only twenty-five per cent of the whole , and of that twenty are ordinary white of egg , protein , if you want to use a handsomer word
0	yes , yes , he said , and nodded
0	she produced an invalid table , a marvel of one-legged equilibrium , adjusted it across his bed , and hans castorp banqueted like the tailor ’ s son in the fairy-story
0	monsieur would be spiteful , cutting ?
0	one must incorporate into the system all possible techniques of variation , including those decried as artificial ; that is , the means which once helped the wouldevelop- ment ' to win its hold over the sonata
0	he sent no letters thither , and received none thence
0	to restore it we must above all have at the head of our great or- chestras men of unquestionably german vievvs
0	she has already held firmly to her resolve never to marry
0	alas , one did not think so for long !
0	why , one could find a jelly-fish in it , any time !
0	well , in short -- it is sad , but the child reminds me too much of gr�
0	i am heartily sorry the child feels so pressed
0	anyhow , there was no doubt that this siegismund gosch was a remarkable and learned man
0	i set down here what i know of this extraordinary being
0	there were a thick ledger and a metal inkstand and sand-holder , full of well-sharpened pencils and goose-quills
0	of course i will go and see after the carriage
0	a suffering voice said come in , and he opened the door , to find frau permaneder lying on the bed fully dressed
0	she pouted and shrugged her shoulders
0	they did , in a half-humorous way , express his highly personal and intimate animosity to the great adversary
0	very droll it was : singing loudly , the people had set out to shatter the revolutionary tyranny for the benefit of reactionary princely authority—and this they did in the name of freedom
0	but this was not all
0	the music pavilion , standing in a half-circle of beech-trees opposite the main building , was still empty and quiet
0	no , my patience is at an end , christian
0	he even brought his wife , born st� and his three grown daughters : friederike and henriette , who were too tall and thin , and pfiffi , who was eighteen , and too short and fat
0	but by the fifth month she can not get about , she goes to bed and writes to her husband , out in the baltic provinces ; behrens gets a letter from him marked personal ’ and urgent ’ in a very firm hand—i saw it myself
0	to me , who could not believe in their belief or share their hopes , they will be brought no nearer by the present agony of their souls
0	she wore a long , shaggy , fur-trimmed travellingcloak , and a large hat ; she was all smiles , her arms were full of flowers , she too seemed possessed by the pleasurable excitement due to the prospect of change , if to nothing else , which was common to all those who left , whatever the circumstances of their leaving , and whether with the consent of the physicans , or in sheer desperation and at their own risk
0	lust go and dig up your bones again
0	tower , and invade the show-rooms
0	with stiff movements that no longer had in them anything of the charm that had been his , he had his fur mantle put about his shoulders , and laid his arm , with a careless merci , on that of the consul , who offered to accompany him home
0	please excuse us for keeping you waiting , kesselmeyer , said herr gr�
0	it was a bit complicated for me
0	the scene blurred more and more , it inclined the eye , gazing thus into woolly vacuity , to slumber
0	but ida jungmann was very reserved
0	home—the berghof—was the picture of an ant-hill in a panic : its little population was flinging itself , heels over head , five thousand feet downwards to the catastrophe-smitten flat-land
0	the record went on , came to the middle part , with skipping rhythm , the part about war and danger , gallant , god-fearing , french
0	but i talked a little this morning with old gosch the broker ; he did not seem dis-inclined to undertake the business
0	he would go down : first with the narrow-gauge road as far as landquart , then to romanshorn , then across the wide , bottomless lake , over which in the legend the rider rode , across all germany , and home
0	what was the sense of that ?
0	he tool { everything as a matter of course , without any words , as something that proceeded from him and lay in his nature , whose power of inertia and fixation on the semper idem persisted in the face of outward circumstance
0	he has been with god these many years
0	the hofrat ’ s son , knut by name , came for the holidays and lived with his father in the wing of the building ; a good-looking young man , save that his cervical vertebra was already too prominent
0	counting his mother 's inheritance and his share of the meng street property , he was still worth more than six hundred thousand marks
0	i ’ ll pay for both of us , she said
0	for the wood was not quite usual , it had a peculiarity which made it picturesque , exotic , even uncanny
0	it was the artist or half- artist world that gathered there , a house-brol { e bohemia , so to speak : , veil-bred yet free-and-easy , and amusing enough to fulfil the expectations that had caused the frau senator to move from bremen to the southern capital
0	and they will go on ; they will go on to the end , tom
0	then came the following episode
0	then it is not surprising that herr settembrini does not love to be reminded of the golden age of his order
0	i ’ ve been observing for some days that you thought you had
0	belshazzar , king of babylon , and that sort of thing
0	yet even to-day , among the ignorant , the mushroom passed for an aphrodisiac
0	i , as a numismatist , feel myself entirely incompetent in this situation
0	he wrote that he deeply regretted what had happened , but that he respected antonie 's wishes , as he saw that he and she had never hit it off
0	we ’ ve philosophized a lot of late , he and i and naphta
0	he took two big steps backward , bent his torso to one side , pointed with his fore-finger to the carpet and said in an awful voice : antonie !
0	you would do well , sir , to leave the good name of my house to me
0	her voice had the characteristic huskiness , but was sympathetic
0	they drove between the first houses , passed the church , and rolled along the front close to the water and up to a pretty little bouse , the verandah of which was overhung with vines
0	the spectators sat in small tribunes , or pressed upon the narrow path that had been shovelled alongside the course ; or thronged the wooden bridges which spanned it , watching the sleds that from time to time whizzed beneath
0	since my parents ' death we have kept on all three maids , not counting mamsell jungmann
0	in good old ger- man words , as ehrenfried kumpf would say , you have given it to me straight , without any mealy-mouthing
0	yes , we were privileged to look at your paintings , i remember the whole thing so well
0	but , as i say , you have been diligent , you have done your best -- and whoever does his best -- ; you may sit down
0	he asked after a while
0	these so-called reformers of humanity did indeed take the words purification and sanctification in their mouths , but what they really meant and intended was the emasculation , the phlebotomy of life
0	the reappearance of the templars , indeed , means nothing else than the entrance of such conceptions , the presence of irrational ferments in a world given over to rational-utilitarian ideas of social improvement
0	he doesn ’ t like to have people get out of it
0	and with their eyes he beheld the picture just as they saw it : below , an aging man , worn out and crotchety , sat at his window in the office ; above , his beautiful wife made music with her lover
0	from hamburg to davos is twenty hours—that is , by train
0	there was another brother too , named moritz , but he was sickly and did his lessons at home
0	ss 'them in the singular
0	that was here in this house , where he was born , in front of the middle dining-room window , and old pastor hezekiel was still alive
0	he inclined to believe in the permanence of the particular state or circumstances in which he for the moment found himself ; prized it for that very quality , and was not bent on change
0	the wonder-box seemed to seethe : it poured out the chimes of bells , harp glissandos , the crashing of trumpets , the long rolling of drums
0	in fact there was no doctor present , not among all those concert-goers , though doctors are usually music-lovers , so many of them being ] evvs
0	but the boy should not let himself be robbed
0	having thus made a free space for what he was about to say , let me , he went on , let me repeat , that i am far from reproaching this italian gentleman with any actual offence against the rules of chivalry
0	we must proceed to extraction , he said , after a while , and turned still paler
0	well , then , some time ago , it was , i got a glimpse behind the scenes—purely by chance—and i remember it as if it were yesterday
0	he made no effort to deceive even himself ; and of all the dull , confused , and rambling thoughts that filled his mind he clung to only one : the single , despairing thought that thomas bud den-brook , at forty-three years , was an old , worn-out man
0	we will mal { e it a saturday - so far as i know you have no classes on saturday this semester
0	the congress sat for a week , with banquets and festivities
0	a closed carriage , its top glistening with wet , its wheels clogged with mud , was before the door
0	he said that—all of it ?
0	he had continued to live in the old consul ’ s roomy villa in harvestehuder way , though he had been a husband and father for some years , having taken a wife from his own social sphere , of his own highly civilized and elegant type , with the same soft , quick , pointedly polite manner of speech
0	the pale , dark mexican mother begged them , with a few incoherent words , and chiefly by means of a pathetic gesture of invitation , to come and receive in person the thanks of her son—son seul et dernier fils , qui allait mourir aussi
0	for example , the boy teddy was discovered , one day—not one single day , of course , but only rather indefinitely from which day— to be a boy no longer
0	how painful , after an intellectual conversation , to have to go about with your mind so stirred up
0	thus we spent many a sun- day afternoon in the good time of year at the farm , where the town-dwellers gratefully partook of the good cheer of the coun- tryside with which frau leverktihn regaled them : the grainy dark bread with fresh butter , the golden honey in the comb , the
0	rejection , renunciation , disdain , vere not incapacity , nor uninstructedness , nor evidence of poverty
0	and she learned from his own lips that he had dade the journey thither on her account
0	to do this gives me the needed reassurance , still needed even as it was at the time when i was present with horror , amaze , consternation , and pride , at its birth - an experience that i suppose was due to my loving devotion to its author but ac- tually went beyond my mental capacities , so that i trembled and was carried away
0	he entered a yellow-brown house in mill street and went up to the first storey , where a brass plate on the door said , brecht , dentist
0	according to him , he had not closed an eye , his parched throat making him start up every five minutes from his pillow
0	we live up here , next door to the dying , close to misery and suffering ; and not only we act as though we had nothing to do with it , but it is all carefully arranged in order to spare us and prevent our coming into contact with it , or seeing anything at all—they will take away the gentleman rider while we are at breakfast or tea—and that i find immoral
0	her father continued to probe her with his eyes
0	he had begun of late to grow a little stout , the single sign of age in his carefully preserved exterior , and his cheeks , behind the pointed protruding ends of his moustaches , looked rounder than they used ; but it was a pale and sallow roundness , with-out blood or life
0	he did not know the lady , he said ; but he did not , in his turn , ask who she was , nor did edelmann give any explanation of his question , other than merely by saying : at all events , you have ( or meister has ) no warmer admirer than she
0	can you see spots on your plate , herr settembrini ?
0	where , then , were the guests , he asked , and his cousin answered : in the rest-cure
0	but your theo- logian in grain , your arrant wily-pie who speculates on specula- tion because he has speculation in his blood already from the fa- ther 's side - there must be foul work an he did not belong to the dive !
0	we know that wind
0	he could not say enough to display the genuine cult of the real and by no means abstractly universal , hence also not almighty and all-present god of the people as a magic technique , a manipulation of dynamic forces , physically not without its risks , in which mishaps might easily oc- cur , catastrophic short circuits due to lllistal { es and failures
0	eva is very sweet to me , and her husband , herr niederpaur , the brewery superintendent , is an agreeable man
0	ah , ida , i think so much about the past these days : about the time when criinlich first appeared , and the scenes he made me -- scan-dalous , ida ! -- and then about travemiinde and the schwarz-kopfs -- she spoke slowly , and her eyes rested for a while dreamily on a darn in erica 's stocking
0	hans castorp was right in referring to them , as he did , with bated breath
0	christmas , like other holidays in the course of the year , served them for a fulcrum , or a vaulting-pole , with which to leap over empty intervening spaces
0	no , he would have no news of her , so long as they were separated by the mystery of time and space
0	you keep trying to find an explanation for them , an emotion to account for them , a feeling of joy or pain , which would , so to speak , justify them
0	but how well you put it !
0	eyes at the same time , but the desire to laugh is irresistible - i have always had to laugh , most damnably , at the most mysterious and impressive phenomena
0	no , to speak frankly , i don ’ t find it so overpowering , said hans castorp
0	and the extent to which it offered points of departure could be seen from the circumstance that the lecturer had lately talked about botany— to be precise , about mushrooms
0	he could heighten the play , by playing with forms out of which , as he well knew , life has disappeared
0	at the back , his hat over his brows , sat the stranger , beside clavdia
0	no one dreamed he would continue ; with embarrassed smiles they watched this futile activity , thinking every moment it would cease
0	and he waited for , expected something , without asking himself what
0	he must have felt the need of sharing his heavy responsibility with some one , not much matter who , because he realized that the end was inevitable
0	it needs some kind of down-to-earth , empirical content or application or confirmation , some practice in obedience to god
0	you talk about humanity just like settembrini
0	the priest , all too familiar with this kind of mischief , and men being tampered with in their best strength , went to the higher authorities with klopf- geissel 's confession
0	on these oc-casions the three miss buddenbrooka from broad street loved to turn the conversation to tony 's former marriage and to dart sharp glances at each other while they egged madame griinlirh on to use strong language
0	i am my own master !
0	he had pre-empted the child for his scientific use , held sittings with her in his analytical oubliette , hypnotized her , it was reported , in an effort to arouse and discipline her slumbering potentialities , to make researches into her previous psychic life
0	and dr krokowski went on to speak of a mushroom , famous in classical antiquity and since , on account of its form and the powers ascribed to it—a fungus in whose latin name the epithet impudicus occurred ; and which in its form was suggestive of love , in its odour of death
0	ida gave a joyous shriek and answered with some polish gibberish
0	then you must take hold and lift four times
0	found him not very artistic
0	pale , trembling , too ex-hausted to think about what had happened , he closed his eyes and sank back in lethargy
0	yes , mademoiselle will see , she will pick up here fast enough , the housewife said
0	she is upstairs in her room asleep , frau schwarzkopf said with feeling
0	but you are so partial
0	men want something different , you know
0	his shoulders shook with laughter
0	you would be invited out every evening
0	the top of his chest of drawers was covered with combs , brushes , and toilet preparations for hair and beard ; while within it was the supply of body linen of all possible kinds , which was constantly changed , washed , worn out , and renewed
0	it was born strong and active , while josephine buried her blood-less face deeper in the pillows and passed away
0	yet they persisted into later life , as the elements of a perfectly conscious memory-picture , which defied expression or analysis , but was none the less positive for all that
0	you showed us the portrait you made of frau chauchat , simply first-class treatment of the skin—i must say i was very much struck by it
0	yesterday i had a long talk with gr�
0	breathless they told him they had something quite abnormal for him , an omniscient , a girl with voices
0	but i will remind him that through liturgy and her history music plays very strongly into the theological ; more practically and artistically , in- deed , than into the mathematical and physical , or into acoustics
0	he compromised himself and made a laugh-able spectacle -- laughable , precisely because what he did was actually so harmless , so impossible to take seriously
0	a morning came when the thermometer in hans castorp ’ s room registered ° , the next morning it was only °
0	the pretexts she gave to little johann would have led him to believe that all his con- temporaries were either scrofulous of full of evil humours , and that he himself was a solitary exception ; which did not tend to increase his already deficient confidence and ease of manner
0	he took him into dark little warehouse offices to confer with super-intendents
0	this courtier , a former cavalry colonel , who had been appointed to his present post simply and solely because it had been well known that he played piano a little ( hovv many centuries ago it seems , that one could become a general-intendant solely because one was noble and played tbe piano a little !
0	but how about you ?
0	il faut avouer , que tu es un petit rêveur assez curieux
0	he sat down on the table , keeping her hand in his , and went on : listen , anna ; we will be sensible to-day , wo not we ?
0	every pot stands on its own bottom
0	so much for the present about the daughters , with whom adrian came into relations as housemates
0	the truth is : in a certain point , in puncto puncti as young people like to say , i formed in the company a somewhat comic excep- tion and fell so to speak out of the frame ; namely , in my quality and way of life as a benedict , which paid tribute to what we half excusingly , half glorifyingly called nature
0	the words came , round , clear-cut , and as though newly minted , from his mobile lips , he tasted his own wellturned , dexterous , biting phrases with obvious and contagious relish , and seemed to be far too clearheaded and self-possessed ever to mis-speak
0	nobody 's face was beaming with joy , there was no lively conversation
0	it was easy for him to understand and respect hans castorp ’ s reserve—the more in that he shared it , even feeling his own position to be more difficult than the other ’ s
0	it would not be the truth if i should say no
0	a shiver ran over him , then several , one after the other
0	in a postscript he offered to make immediate restitution of the dowry
0	they achieved their ambition , and were re-spected by their stupider and lazier colleagues
0	by your own theory , you must be yourself more ailing than you look , you are so obviously possessed of esprit
0	no one could now stop him
0	the validity of the church ’ s teaching on the subject of science , which can be summed up in the phrase of saint augustine : credo , ut intellegam : i believe , in order that i may understand , is absolutely incontrovertible
0	all others bring debasement and degradation in their train , even when not directed to that end
0	these were masculine evenings , with the beer-glass on the floor beside the chair , a cigar in the mouth , and frequent bursts of talk , strange , dry interruptions in the middle of the language of music ; tapping of the bow and counting back of the bars when the players got out , which was almost always the fault of the singing- master
0	he had done so of his own motion , without telling anyone , on a solitary walk he took down to the platz while joachim was occupied with the weekly weighing or injection
0	i ( defiant , do not answer )
0	hans castorp ’ s hair and nails grew too , grew rather fast
0	the facial expression becomes dull , the mouth stands open , the eyes are without life
0	but what is to become of the reval agreement , ludovico , if your progressive turks are successful ?
0	once hans castorp had remarked this , he could not forbear corroborating it again and again
0	fräulein levi said she was willing to sleep with frau stöhr , for that abject creature confessed she was too frightened to go to bed alone
0	and the lion roared
0	knew how to extract from the pressure obviously resting on him
0	dr faustus fatigue , the capacity for disgust - all that was perfectly calculated to make a profession of the talent bound up with it
0	it was a horrid sight
0	hans castorp found that charming—most edifying
0	he washed his eyes and hands , brushed his hair , put his clothing to rights , and met joachim outside in the corridor
0	six candles burned in a candelabrum on the slender sewing-table beside her , and the chandelier was un-lighted
0	can he never be ready on time ?
0	you go about feeling ghastly , he said , turning to his brother and wrinkling up his nose
0	the father laid less stress on their intrinsic value than upon the general ability of which they gave evidence
0	i-ie put together his thoughts on theory and published them as a preface to the book of the turtle dove
0	what objection could be brought against a daily regimen like that , which so blandly took acquiescence for granted ?
0	he persisted in his sincere and respectful if also rather forward sympathy for this man on the grand scale , regardless of his partnership in the travelling-trunks of the woman of whom once , on a carnival night , hans castorp had borrowed a lead-pencil
0	he un-doubtedly had a few verses in his pocket for the present oc-casion
0	at least he clothed his discomfort in words which recognized the simplicity , good taste , and informality of our af- fair , the absence of customs and curtsyings as he put it
0	they shrugged their shoulders and gave it out as their view that it took two to play at such games , and that it was unlikely anything had happened against the will of either participant
0	the senator was dying
0	but what will you have ?
0	the extended summer trip which had once been customary with the buddenbrooks had now been given up for some years
0	herr settembrini ’ s question , and its delivery , were prodigious
0	but the drops will be hanging on the trees outside -- we can drink coffee in the verandah
0	do you know how you look ?
0	this is it , this is it !
0	if you were ill the last time , you could have had help in that part ; besides , if the first part dealt with the condition before the tribulation , and the second part with the tribulation itself , you could have told by counting on your fingers that the third part must deal with the con-dition after the tribulation !
0	how could she enter into joachim ’ s turbulent emotions , due in part to the sensation that he was come home , which for the moment outweighed all else , and in part to the stimulus of the incomparably light , empty , yet kindling air he was once breathing ?
0	will you permit me—not a word
0	maybe yelling commands in the service set up a locus minoris resistentiæ there
0	a hint lay in his suggestion that they might telegraph and let the parents know
0	he must soon have seen that he did not fit in very well ; but he concealed the fact under an increased assurance of manner , while the frau consul , uncle justus , and the senator -- though hardly the broad street bud den-brooks -- practised a tactful complaisance toward the socially awkward , hard-working official
0	in white flannel trousers and blue blazer , he would come back late from his treatment , neat and military ; would enter the dining-room , make his little bow , courteous and composed , in excuse of his tardiness , and sit down to his meal , which was specially prepared , for he no longer ate the regular food , on account of the danger of choking ; he received minces and broths
0	but she did not come : she was dead
0	i ca not be anything
0	on their heels came the parents of frau consul kr� , the lumber-dealer overdieck and his wife , a fond old pair who still addressed each other in public with nicknames from the days of their early love
0	the listeners almost died of laughter at his falsetto parlando , at the contrast between the deep voice and the tongue-splitting facility with which it rendered the words
0	space , like time , engenders forgetfulness ; but it does so by setting us bodily free from our surroundings and giving us back our primitive , unattached state
0	his trousers , of beautiful and lasting english stuff , flapped about his crooked emaciated legs
0	in sucll talk , with which he teased and irritated me , there was much that was merely imitative
0	hans castorp would shift his hands to behind his head , and reply to all he was asked , smiling in his turn
0	he advanced his head like a steer , with staring , bloodshot watery eves i won ’ t have it , he bellowed
0	never did a work come like that
0	just as real virtuosity in an actor shows up more brilliantly in a poor piece
0	i need do nothing more , i don ’ t count , i can laugh at the whole thing
0	hans castorp listened to herr settembrini out of a sense of duty and fairness , in the idea of hearing both sides ; with the best of intentions he tested the latter ’ s views on the subject of the republic , reason and the bello stile
0	copernicus will go down before ptolemy
0	thus might he return
0	you are thinking of the earthquake of messina
0	but whc-n tony , as chance offered , tried to come bark to the subject , he wrapped himself in silence , the more forbidding because of his inward mortification over having given way -- his inward bitterness at being , as he felt , feeble and inadequate to the situation in hand
0	classicism- yes , it is not sophisticated at all , but it is great
0	this was a stage higher than the mill
0	taking in this sense too , great as the whole piece itself , the fare- well of the sonata form
0	grouped and arranged itself in astonishingly precise and varied figures and arabesques
0	he gesticulated , he tore open his shirt to offer his yellow breast to the stroke of fate ; and continued thus , until an attack of coughing , which forced a thread of red foam to his lips , quenched his harangue and gave the cousins an excuse to go out , on tiptoe
0	he repeated them , softly , trying to reproduce the guttural , rustically formal syllables of the mountain tongue , as he climbed another stretch higher , above the hut
0	even so , there came an evening when joachim might behold his cousin the centre of a group composed of hermine kleefeld , gänser , rasmussen , and the youth of the monocle and the finger-nail , making an impromptu speech on the subject of frau chauchat ’ s peculiar and exotic facial structure , and betraying himself by his unsteady voice and the excited glitter of his eyes , until his listeners exchanged glances , nudged each other , and tittered
0	she was small as a child , with a long , oldish face—a dwarf , he realized with a start
0	dr faustus he gave this sense of the comic free rein , recal ] ing droll types among pupils and teachers , or describing his last cultural expedi- tion and some small-town opera performance , whose improvisa- tions could not fail to be a source of mirth , though without det- riment to the seriousness of the work performed
0	the genius , in the course of the conversation we have repeated , and elsewhere , called hans castorp a joli bourgeois au petit endroit humide , which might in some sense be considered a translation of the settembrinian epithet life ’ s delicate child ; and the question thus was , which constitutes of the mingled essence of his being would prove the stronger , the bourgeois or the other
0	i have so many worries ; everything is so hard for me
0	he taught the natural siicnces , but his own field was mathematics , in which subject he had the reputation of being an original thinker
0	he crossed one-leg over the other and slowly turned the pages of the notebook , reading dates and entries here and there , written in his own hand , and thanking the lord afresh as he saw how in every time of need and danger he had stretched out his hand to aid
0	in view of its historic charm that would be in the highest degree regret- table
0	and how tolerant you always are towards an idea !
0	will she say it to me , when i get to know her , do you think ?
0	yes , yes , he said abruptly , and his tone was rather mocking , an undisturbed night 's rest is a very good thing
0	a round table , its slender legs decorated with fine lines of gilding , stood , not in front of the sofa , but by the wall oppo-site the little harmonium , on which lay a flute-case ; some stiff arm-chairs were ranged in a row round the walls ; there was a sewing-table by the window , and a flimsy ornamental writing-desk laden with knick-knacks
0	perhaps i have , let me see
0	he ascribed it to atavistic memory , a blood heritage , that he very often dreamed of riding ; he was uncommonly convincing when he showed us how natural it , vas for him to hold the reins in the left hand and pat the horse 's neck with the right
0	they consoled themselves , to some extent , with the little weaknesses of the old frau consul and frau permaneder
0	she took the card , got out her sewing-glasses , and read it
0	we ca not all be alike
0	the scale was in the air again
0	she moved dumbly about the house , she laughed no more , she lost her appetite
0	the previous winter had done fairly well in that respect , but it had been as nothing compared to this one
0	for the time everything was at an end ; there would be no more emotional alarums , no more strain on the heart-muscles
0	oh , well , after all , there is some sort of difference
0	what an immense honour for me !
0	he came down the brehmenbühl , along the edge of the forest , and was in the dorf by half past five
0	nobody but jews have such puny figures
0	he played instrumental works by brahms and bruck- ner , schubert , robert schumann ; then by the later and the latest , tchaikovsky , borodin , and rimsky-i ( orsakov ; by anton dvoralc , berlioz , cesar franck , and chabrier , constantly challenging his pupil 's power of imagination with loud explanations , to give or- chestral body and soul to the insubstantial piano version : cello cantilena !
0	well , i am a jew , you know , fitelberg is undeniably a jewish name
0	he was a soldier
0	she could ad-just herself with ease and cheerfulness to any situation
0	i do not mean getting drunk : i mean the feeling you have the next day -- the after-effects
0	to make matters worse , it was a fish dish that had just been handed , and there was ground for fear that popoff , in his spasm , might choke on a bone
0	hans castorp was rather relieved than otherwise at this state of affairs ; for the pledge he had drunk with clavdia chauchat ’ s protector made him difficulties , in general conversation , of the same kind he had to deal with in the case of frau chauchat herself , namely the avoidance of the formal mode of address—as though , as peeperkorn said , they had eaten a philippina together
0	it was , as always , an imrompar-able expression of dissolute , impudent , lazy good-nature
0	written a third movement to ope i i i
0	i don ’ t know many , he responded , letting his hands flap finlike before his breast , and those i do i can ’ t tell , i ’ m so tired all the time
0	to them , before i leave the subject , i must certainly devote a few words ; they often affect one like at once a mockery and a glorication of the fen- damcn : : : al , a painfully reminiscent ironic treatment of tonalit
0	i get so tired of things
0	those were the genes , the living germs , bioblasts , biophores—lying there in the frosty night , hans castorp rejoiced to make acquaintance with them by name
0	the deepest silence reigned
0	and set him up as my vicar on earth !
0	but that was simply be- cause for the most part they delighted in a purely chordal texture of phrase , and their way of treating the polyphonic style had been miserably weakened by their regard for the harnnic factor , for the relation of consonance and dissonance
0	and it is true that this part of our story might , like an earlier chapter , bear the caption a newcomer
0	in fact -- what was it we were dickering over then ?
0	are we forced to live within the smallest limits we can ?
0	to explore and lay open all the windings of his emotions would keep us far too long ; suffice it to say that his observation of the mannheimer gave our poor young friend enough to think on and to suffer
0	or was he of more than one mind whether he should await the autumn up here or resolve on unlawful departure ?
0	that wasn ’ t the first time either , he said to himself , as though the thought were reassuring
0	therein , precisely , was the impropriety
0	but a changed idea , is that still an idea ?
0	he asked incensed , supporting himself belligerently on his cub
0	but now , he went on with his most charming manner , our warmest thanks -- cerda 's too -- for all your trouble , you good snul
0	the knoterichs had taken over inez rodde , now rich and settled and well wadded against life , into their own social circle from the little group vvho had attended her mother 's evenings
0	one asks oneself , had it not been better the other way about , settembrini went on ; you enjoying the kisses by yourself , and the rest-cure with captain miklosich— tehee !
0	hanno had , among his schoolmates , no intimates save nntj
0	i will do it !
0	then , to divert herself , she made a trip to zürich—there had been no other reason for her going , save simply to amuse herself—she had amused herself to her heart ’ s content , but found herself overtaken by the need to be filled up again and entrusted the business to a physician where she was
0	but when the frau consul looked at her , she could not deny that , despite the stately dowry and clara 's domestic prowess , it would not be easy to marry her off
0	in this case the sinners were also held together by a definite philosophy
0	i lay before the reader a testimony to my good faith in that i give space to the theory that i make difficulties because i secretly shrink from the tasl { which , urged by love and duty , i have undertaken
0	there was much in the world , much of the future , that seemed worth knowing , yet it was so difficult to choose
0	another minute -- there came hermann alone , swinging his lunch-box by the strap and smacking his lips
0	and yet she would say it , say once and for all , that it was twenty-eight fishsauces she could make
0	i was in despair , as you may imagine , over the trick my unreliable health had played me
0	the spirit of a world-famed violinist played as though behind veils a romance by rubinstein , to a piano accompaniment that sounded thin and cold , like a spinet
0	you can ’ t judge from the first day !
0	and our discussion comes to an end at the right moment , for here we are , settembrini said , and pointed out to the cousins with his stick the cottage before whose gate they had paused
0	extraordinary—displays great— in revenge , they looked at each other , pantomimed despair , angled for hans castorp ’ s glance ; but he refused to be drawn
0	for my part , my mind is made up
0	she heard it , and retorted by calling him a turkey-cock and bidding him keep his filthy jokes to himself
0	we were speaking of tolerance ; it is surely superfluous for me to emphasize that far from mere toleration , i feel for protestantism , as the historical opponent of the enslavement of knowledge , the most profound admiration
0	certain things are no longer possible
0	herr settembrini walked from the humanistic folding-desk in the little window , where he had been standing , up to the table , nearer his pupil , who was sitting on the cot against the wall , his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands
0	for herr settembrini belonged to the francophile party in his own country , which was not surprising when one recalled that his grandfather had compared the six days of the july revolution to the six days of the creation , and seen that they were as good
0	well , how is everything , my dear tony -- all right ?
0	schalleen , as hans castorp knew , had not only packed his presents , but bought them , after consultation with the uncles
0	herr settembrini was silent
0	what they heard had happened long ago , almost a hundred years
0	still , leaders have arisen , who like myself , who am a son of humanism , saw in this dictatorship the ultimate that can or may be laid upon humanity and moved their vvorld to a life-and-death struggle against it
0	but now , thanks to the development of hygiene and the increase in personal security , a natural death was the rule , a violent one the exception ; modern man had come to think of repose , after exhaustion of his powers , as not at all dreadful , but normal and even desirable
0	on the bier , i say to you beforehand , you will always find it lying on its face , and though you turn it five times you will ever find it on its face
0	you have such a kind , sympathetic cousin over there , went on the hofrat , motioning with his head in joachim ’ s direction and balancing himself on his heels
0	she praised the idea unreservedly
0	bble - the classicists made themselves thoroughly merry over it
0	a few days later she brought him , not information about the young russian , but a fresh and startling piece of news
0	crimson-faced , bare-headed , overcoatless , he stood at the edge of the platform as the train rolled in , beneath his relative ’ s carriage window , and told him to come on out , for he was here
0	the surf is seething ; wave after wave , with high , hollow sound , rears up , rebounds , and runs with a silken rustle out over the flat strand : here one , there one , and more beyond , out on the bar
0	and when one gets one 's wish too late , or works too hard for it , it comes already weighted with all sorts of small vexatious drawbacks -- with all the dust of reality upon it , that one did not reckon with in fancy
0	and the consul poured him a glass of the brown foaming porter , which he was accustomed to drink himself at midday
0	tired isn ’ t the word for it
0	dr faustus christian king , and which produced theologians like bossuet and pascal ?
0	he led hans castorp by the arm before the rows of dark plates on the wall , and turned on a light behind them
0	but perhaps i may be pardoned for letting him appear once more
0	after a few paces , settembrini said—having brought his head and neck to a natural posture once more : you must not be surprised to hear this gentleman and me indulging in long disputations
0	there , on the third landing of the wooded terrace , sat the principal members of those affiliated families , at two tables shoved close together , eating and talking with the greatest gusto
0	they drove up in the same sleigh to house berghof , and supped together in the restaurant
0	you have a crib in your book , he said as he name up
0	if certain musical features of the writing peculiar to adrian had not indicated the author , one could scarcely be- lieve that the same mind brought forth both
0	\y own weak- ness in this : field , which was only tolerably made good by joyful application in philology , made me realize that excellence in per- formance is naturally conditioned by sympathy with the subject and thus it was a real boon to me to see this condition - at least here - fulfilled by my friend too
0	the record had not run out before elly shuddered violently
0	his heart stood stock-still , it seemed not to beat
0	perhaps they took it as a whim , a rhetorical flourish ; it went something like this : esteemed , in especial dear and beloved brethren and sisters
0	he lived now the life of a private gentleman ; but , being rather ashamed of the fact , he always pretended to be overwhelmed with work
0	yet they were elegant too , even strikingly so ; indeed , despite writing-table and bookshelves the room hardly had a masculine look
0	and we did not get to paris
0	the horses , all four of them sturdy , glossy , well-fed beasts , with a blaze on each forehead , covered the excellent road at a steady pace
0	enthusiasm for size , being overwhelmed by size - that is no doubt a mental pleasure ; but it is only possible in connections which a human being can grasp
0	she was choosing a pot of flowers , examining , smelling , criticizing , chattering , and constantly obliged to wipe her mouth with her handkerchief
0	yes , self-conquest—that might well be the essence of triumph over this love , this soul-enchantment that bore such sinister fruit !
0	splendid , splendid , my dear jean
0	e song was already in progress ; when the tune
0	but the way it looks just here , in this light , in this connec- tion , something that has always been there may be new , new- alive , one might say ; original and unique
0	hia whole nose wrinkled as he spoke
0	t my friend into contact with a music somewhat more artistically organized th
0	the affair has spun itself out
0	my god , it is the revolution !
0	are the men here freer , more brotherly , more equal than in prussia ?
0	naphta and settembrini disputed over it a good deal without coming to any conclusion
0	'twere stolen from thine own opera !
0	but these later criticisms , levelled against pretence and play , in other words against form itself , seemed to indicate such an extension of the kingdom of the banal , of the no longer permissible , that it threat- ened to swallow up art itself
0	the inscriptions bore names from every quarter of the earth , they were in english or russian—or other slavic tongues—also german , portuguese , and more
0	but he drowned out the voice with his own , and herr settembrini , flinging up his hand with a swing of the arm—a gesture common in his own country , whose meaning it would be hard to put into words—and giving vent to a long-drawn eh—h !
0	it had been people of herr settembrini ’ s kidney , the doubters and critics , who had made the observation , and brought about the inquisition , which superseded the old naïve procedure
0	the guests were rnostly people in the finan- cial and business world
0	the a , which , forcing the resolution into g sharp , leads over from b major to e major , led him on , and so via the l { eys of a , d , and g he came to c ma jor and to the flat keys , as he demonstrated to me that on each one of the twelve notes of the chromatic scale one could build a fresh major or minor scale
0	the national state is the temporal principle , which you would like to ascribe to the evil one
0	make a few jokes !
0	no , twenty-eight , hans castorp said
0	a mild and pensive feeling stole about his heart
0	always at your jokes—but do sit down
0	he had come back once more to his mother 's house , and had a room on the corridor of the first storey
0	thirteen essays ( out of print ) joseph and his brothers i joseph and his brothers ( the tales of jacob ) ii
0	but the sweet , exalted splendour of the music had borne him away upon its wings
0	it is not right , it is not right , gerda , said old fraulein weichbrodt , perhaps for the hundredth time
0	body talked with somebody else , preserving all the social forms , while his mind was entirely absent , fixed on another person at whom he was looking
0	for hans castorp ’ s part , he straightway resolved to be present , in the first place out of courtesy , but also with unconcealed curiosity as to what he should hear
0	there was a quality of the perverse in the insatiability with which it was produced and revelled in : there was a sort of cynical despair ; there was a longing for joy , a yielding to desire , in the way the last drop of sweetness was , as it were , , extracted from the melody , till exhaustion , disgust , and satiety supervened
0	i have a right to dispose of my own property as i choose !
0	she sighed and shivered as the answer came
0	numerous local groups have been established in the various countries ; it is expected that they will exert an edifying and enlightening influence by means of discussion evenings and appropriate sunday observances
0	the thought is dear to me , i prize it , and in ex- change for that certainty i accept the terrors of the titne in which i myself continue to live on
0	am coming at once with erica
0	everything else is twaddle
0	the general rest-hall seemed to be full ; talking and laughter went on below
0	the softening , the effeminizing and falsifi- cation , the new interpretation put on the old and genuine po- lyphony understood as a combined sounding of various voices into the harmonic-chordal , had already begun in the sixteenth century , and people like palestrina , the two gabrielis , and our good or- lando di lasso here on the spot had already played their shanleful part in it
0	but there was an instrument - that is to say , a musical means of realization - through which music , while becolning audible to the sense of hearing , did so in a half-unsensuous , an almost abstract way , audible , that is , in a way peculiarly suited to its intellectual nature
0	he must study , i think -- he is witty and brilliant
0	a great art , so our reporter said in closing , which , as it were aloof from time and tine 's great course , could develop a little pri- vate history of this kind , and by forgotten side-paths lead to such exceptional beautitudes
0	yes , the movement becomes general , you flow away , so to speak—remember all that water !
0	we might even have been gratified , on the plain ground that a thorough-going sympathy with the experiences of our hero is precisely what we wish to arouse , and he , hans castorp , was himself not clear upon the point in question , no , nor had been for a very long time—a fact that has conditioned his romantic adventures up here , to an extent which has made of them , in more than one sense , a time-romance
0	nepomuk wanted to know how old the little spirit was when he was im- prisoned and then how old when he was freed , after twelve years
0	my beloved husband expressed in his final arrangements the wish that after his death you would put your loyal and well-tried powers at the service of the firm , not as an outsider but as partner
0	they stopped at a small station
0	her wish that it should be dissolved must be justified , to the mind of any reasonable person ; and her determination not to return to munich was entirely unshakable
0	the consul looked about him : every face was long and gloomy
0	he was a master tailor , and his wife bought and sold old clothes , and thus moved in the best circles of society
0	and , on the other hand , it was something in the highest degree fleeting and tenuous ; a thought , nay , a dream , the frightful , infinitely alluring dream of a young man whose unspoken , unconscious questioning of the universe has received no answer save a hollow silence
0	never shall i forget a scene in the living-room at buchel when we chanced to sit there together , the four of us : mother and son , kretschmar and i eisbeth was in tau { with the musician , who was puffing and blowing with his impediment ; it was a mere chat , of which adrian was certainly not the subject
0	that is the best after all
0	in town they said that the old man , before he left his house in winter warmed not only his coat and hat , but his walking-dtick as well
0	he was himself hastening his own end
0	morten made an entertaining companion , though his opinions were often dogmatic , not to say heated
0	the alien , fantastic nature of the deep-sea life , which seemed no longer to belong to the same planet vith us , was a point of de- parture
0	your poor sister has had a hard time
0	i do not say : for it is great , because there is such a thing as sophisticated greatness ; but this is at bottom much more intimate
0	we had spoken of it at table
0	in vain the girl implored him - on her knees at last - to spare her , to release her , not to make her pay for her peace with the betrayal of the man who loved her , whose love she returned
0	herr settembrini ’ s voice was full of mild resignation , it even trembled
0	in any case , barbel had fixed and restricted her heinz - not by means of any devil 's hocus-pocus but by the charm she had for him and the will by which she held him as by a spell against other temptations
0	my dear sir , settembrini answered him , there is a good deal up here that is positively mediaeval , as you express it
0	very well , proceed , then , said the senator , and shut his eyes more tightly
0	let it once dualistically isolate death , and death will become , in actual fact , actu , by this mental act of will , you understand me , a power in itself , the power opposed to life , the inimical principle , the great temptation ; whose kingdom is the kingdom of the flesh
0	but now i could see why schwerdtfeger kept his head mostly turned to the right so that i saw only his rather too blunt profile
0	for we do not set up as the young man ’ s encomiast , and prefer to leave room for the other view : namely , that his work stood somewhat in the way of his unclouded enjoyment of his maria mancini
0	hastily he sought to muster the words , the sentence structure
0	if only your mother 's family would hang on to their groschen a little belter !
0	held in the same plane with the ground , it was black and opaque ; but lifted against the light , it revealed matter for a humanistic eye : the transparent reproduction of the human form , the bony framework of the ribs , the outline of the heart , the arch of the diaphragm , the bellows that were the lungs ; together with the shoulder and upper-armbones , all shrouded in a dim and vaporous envelope of flesh—that flesh which once , in carnival week , hans castorp had so madly tasted
0	a soldier , and brave
0	and remember , when you were last with us , he went on , and hans castorp remarked that he did not use the form of address common to the civilized west—you promised to make visible to our mortal eyes some dear departed , whether brother soul or sister soul , whose name should be given to you by our circle
0	at the moment i feel quite indifferent to both of them-now i am here and y'ou have something to tell me
0	edhin krokowski ’ s lectures had in the swift passage of the years taken an unexpected turn
0	but what if it does the opposite ?
0	you have the right to , though
0	the frightened woman , with her scanty hair awry over her brow , her partly toothless gums , ran across to the main building and in half-choked words told frau schweigestill ; that experienced soul followed her with a manservant
0	he was settled , established
0	why should i behave as though i had not already , long ago and repeatedly thought of that strict schoolmaster and beginner in the art of song , at ephrata across the sea ?
0	he left his skis at the grocer ’ s , rested a little in herr settembrini ’ s attic cell , and told him how the storm had overtaken him in the mountains
0	i can assure my readers that i paid great attention to his archaic style and allusions , wbich he had always been given to but now even more frequently , or should i say ofttimes , came into his letters and even his speech
0	some distance outside the town , nearly as far as the first outlying village , lay a small farm , a tiny , almost valueless property without even a name
0	with which he passed round the glass partition into his loggia , where stood his own reclining-chair and side-table
0	it was almost like a professional visit—but gratis , you know—sine pecunia
0	he said : to me ?
0	well , and how have you spent your day , the first of your sojourn in this gay resort ?
0	and while the capital has grown smaller , the running expenses have not ; for the whole business is established on a certain scale , which it costs about so much to maintain
0	you are ruining him -- that 's buddenbr ddks it , is it ?
0	erica was allowed to sit next her grandmother , and ida sat up straight on a chair and began to knit
0	if one sat in an adjoining room and did not see the instrument , it seemed not otherwise than as though the artist stood in the salon in his own person , notes in hand , and sang
0	it ’ s against the rules to cry in public—they might all start !
0	the poor youth was still young ; he had never got over his schoolboy shyness
0	laying his hands upon the painting to unhook it , he eagerly began : yes , yes indeed , that is all very important
0	in a near-by trattoria they took their dinner at charge of a ltionthly sum
0	was he not in painful arrest from the hour of his birth ?
0	on another , less childish plane we would need people like him , just as his flock had need of him then : we need a system-master , a teacher of the objective and or- ganization , with enough genius to unite the old-established , the archaic , , vith the revolutionary
0	not long after he left , joachim would appear ready dressed , to greet his cousin , inquire after his seven o ’ clock temperature , and communicate his own
0	he spoke of an unfortunate occurrence , of suspicions that had proved justified , of the medical opinion that it would be best for him to remain where he was for a part , perhaps for all of the winter , since cases like his often proved more obstinate than those that began more alarmingly and it was clearly advisable to go after the infection energetically and root it out once for all
0	good lord , don ’ t the manœuvres come every year—and surely you know how time flies up here
0	hans castorp talked on awhile , feverishly
0	it seems to be hell in advance , which is already offered me on earth
0	such a christian young man !
0	in the yard was a tree , also rather in the way and preserved for sentimental reasons -not a lime tree , but an elm
0	one was an old-german dining-room , the other a living- and working-room , with woollen carpets , bookshelves and sofa , and a writing-table above which hung a pair of crossed swords and a student ’ s cap
0	i am going to ask you another time ; there is no hurry ; it has really nothing to do with me ; it is only curiosity
0	she proudly related the buddenbrook history , from the rostock tailor on ; and when she read out the old festival verses : industry and beauty chaste see we linked in marriage band : venus anadyomene , and cunning vulcan 's busy hand she looked at tom and [ } erda and let her tongue play over her lips
0	thomas agrees with me now , too , she went on ; for where will christian be better off than in his own father 's business , in tom 's business ?
0	i disagree with my late father on this point , the consul said
0	as for the witnesses : well , weinschenk 's own staff wo not be any too friendly to him , i am afraid
0	- a small rentier was another such freak ; he had a bulbous purple nose , and a big seal ring on his forefin- ger
0	they crossed the foot-bridge over the gorge , where the waterfall hung stiff and silent
0	thus he quarrelled with his lot and was an aggrieved man , a grunbler , visiting his unsuccessful career on his o , vn fanily 's head
0	here are helmet , sabre , and hanger—away , away , away with him , let him be off , let him be off , off to the barracks !
0	he was like something out of an en-chanted forest ; like grimm 's fairy tales , which ida read aloud to him
0	it happened with clara on just such an expedition
0	the holidays came , and there was not much trouble over the report , whirh had to be presented for papa to read , even at christmas-lime
0	for inasmuch as our weak human hearts are prone to forget thy priceless gift of the sweet , blessed jesus and so on for three pages
0	now , however , he had others
0	the senator was probably aware that he was robbing the child of the last remnant of his self-control
0	the one change due to the passage of time was an outward one
0	after conscientious destruction of the library , and leaving a time-bomb behind in the post-office , we made our exit with our heads high
0	so that is how it happens , hans castorp said
0	she was strangely excited this evening -- why , mother , you are fairly trembling , the senator said when he came in with gerda and hanno
0	a very large sum
0	thus they remained in silence a long time , while the sea sent up to them its soft enchanting whis-pers tony suddenly felt herself one with morten in a great , vague yearning comprehension of this portentous some-thing which he called freedom
0	they say he wears a corset—but that is little to the point
0	that is axiomatic , any court of honour would tell you the same , i swear to god they would
0	the mystery of life ?
0	names were suggested and rejected , others came up and were sifted out
0	but the other side was not so easy to come at
0	when you hear the will read , you will see just how much you are your own master !
0	c ’ est pourquoi je vais risquer un petit changement d ’ air
0	do you care to recall what it was ?
0	do i want to shed her blood ?
0	i know he includes the punishment in the sin and saturates it therewith so that one can- not be distinguished from the other and happiness and punish- ment are the same
0	the old man affected to be quite unmoved as he took the sealed blue paper
0	i thought it was different with you
0	for as she charmed me , so she bewitched me and forgave me in love - so i was initiate , and the promise confirmed
0	i feel as though one should callout to him , as to all those who are no longer with us and 'were not with us when it began : lucky you !
0	certainly , so far as my powers go , and wherever i have any influence
0	this resthetic interpreta- tion , however conveniently offered , was not tenable
0	are you here alone ?
0	the tram was full , two gentlemen stood clinging to straps at the rear
0	and i recall the cow- girl hanne , whose bosoms flapped as she walked and whose bare feet were always caked with dung
0	now , at least , on his bench by the rushing water , he had no more nose-bleeding— that was a thing of the past
0	she 's a good girl -- genuine good stuff
0	it has happened in my presence that during such a scene she left the drawing-room with flushed cheeks and shut herself in her room , at whose door after a quarter of an hour , as she had probably hoped and expected , rudolf knocked to ask why she had gone away
0	the approach of the final examinations demanded a decision , the election of a faculty , and he declared his choice : declared it in answer to his uncle , who raised his brows and said bravo !
0	in the years between and they had four children born to them : rosa , ezekiel , raimund , and nepomuk , pretty creatures all of them , and nepomuk , the youngest , was an angel
0	man , he went on to say , was the measure of things
0	now , as then , his heart could be seen hammering against his side
0	mynheer peeperkorn , at mention of the knife , had shifted his position in the bed , with a quick motion to one side , turning his face toward his guest , and looking him piercingly in the eye
0	for i did not , as i should have done , connect it with conversations i had with him at this time , or rather he had with me , when he gave me , quite circumstantially , with great anima- tion , accounts of studies and researches in fields very remote from my curiosity or my scientific comprehension : thrilling enrich- ments , that is , of his lcnowledge of nature and the cosmos
0	were the gods wishful to destroy him , when they moved him to embark on this foolhardy analysis of vice ?
0	to look at the relations between things must be the best thing , after all
0	he could court her , look at her to desire her , covet her as a christian wife , as we theologians say with justified pride at swin- dling the devil out of the carnal concomitant and making a sacra- ment of it , the sacrament of christian marriage
0	the senator led the two gentlemen out through the dining-room
0	ver did they procede from fatigue due to effort , but from satiety , from cold boredom , and , dear master and friend , sith i no longer am a young bachelor springing from branch to branch but have married me with one plot and one profession , it has truly gone hevyli indeed with me
0	lovely and pleasant it was to see the older ones show the younger , curly-locked novices , how to span the bow and take aim ; draw with them , and laughing support them staggering back from the push of the arrow as it leaped from the bow
0	this was what , as he fancifully put it , his familiar friend mr akercocke told him to do and demanded of him
0	furthermore , as our utmost effort can not conceive a final limit either to time or in space , we have settled to think of them as eternal and infinite—apparently in the hope that if this is not very successful , at least it will be more so than the other
0	it is reress , and we have mill six minutes
0	listen , son -- take my advice : do not think too much about such things -- theatre , and that sort of thing
0	but there really is not room to dance
0	fie saw , lastly , me , when i went to spend the week-end
0	but in being , the man is as he has wished to be , and as , until his last breath , he has never ceased to wish to be
0	he passed away last night , the consul said ,
0	it was a good shot
0	i remember that i used the word teasingly in talk with my friend ; remember too how he turned away with the odd short laugh pe- culiar to him , as though he wot ; lld have pretended not to hear
0	to which the uncle replied : pardon me , and hastily replaced the picture on its easel
0	they did not talk much ; uttered the phrases proper to the daily routine , and little else
0	but they learned that peeperkorn thought otherwise
0	the company began to rise from table , to move about , to pay visits
0	quite early , soon after my appointment at kaisersaschern , i married : need for regularity and desire for a proper establish- ment in life led me to the step
0	' a house divided against itself will fall
0	i do not say that mother would actually insist on it -- when there is a dispute over anything she usually avoids it and says 'assez !
0	then in a clap i am stricl { en by a cutting cold , even as though i sat in a winter-warm room and a , vindovv had blo , vn open to wards the frost
0	not with the thou , not old fellow , or man , by which forms they had addressed each other their lives long
0	he plunged the gaze of his brown , exotic eyes deep into ellen brand ’ s blue ones , and ran his hand down over her shoulder and arm , stroking her gently
0	after at most a year , when my military service should be finished , , ve would come together , one place or another
0	how full of dignity the young man ’ s head , with the little beard thrust upward , had lain upon his pillow !
0	et puis , said hans castorp , si je t ’ avais parlé plus tôt , il m ’ aurait fallu te dire vous ’
0	they strolled out to the noble domain , viewed the dunghill , the vegetables , the fowls , dogs , and guinea-pigs , and even went into thr house , where in a long low room on the ground floor , count eber-hard sat in defiant isolation , reading at a clumsy table , lie ; asked crossly what they wanted
0	for at least an hour he amused adrian and me and made us laugh ; and then , with his business unaccomplished - in so far as there had been anything so con- crete as business about it - he departed with complete equanimity
0	what i ask you is , have you resolved , bravely and joyfully , to lake up your burden ?
0	he had taken charge of the bank at first , but soon turned it over to herr albin and was understood to say that the charge of it hindered his unfettered enjoyment
0	i am sure he will enjoy it , betsy
0	the guests exchanged volumes from the loan-library down in the platz ; now and again there would be a book for which everybody scrambled , even the condescending old inhabitants reaching out their hands with ill-concealed eagerness
0	then came the day when the divorce was pronounced ; when the last formalities were gone through , and tony asked thomas for the family papers and set down this last event with her own hand
0	they were all startled ; favourably , yet with some alarm
0	it will be perfectly agreeable tn me , herr senator , if you come in to-morrow or next day , at whatever hour you like , and we can go on with the operation
0	out of the earth , i might better say , for the little one said it , ex- pressing his joy that heaven gave the firsty earff a drink last night '
0	the record took up the play at the second act , in the spanish tavern , in crude moorish architecture , a shawl-draped , roomy cellar like the floor of a barn
0	very funny , very amusing
0	is time a function of space ?
0	i won ’ t say that i make him out altogether , yet , but if we meet him often perhaps we shall ; i don ’ t think it at all unlikely we may learn something from the acquaintance with him
0	not at all , answered lebrecht kroger severely
0	ah , one did not speak out with gc-rda , one did not call her to account
0	ah , yes , where should we be without you ?
0	hp swallowed once and said , we have cornelius nepos , some accounts to copy , french grammar , the rivers of north amer-ica , german theme-correcting -- he stopped and felt provoked with himself ; he could not remember any more , and wished he had said and and let his voice fall , it sounded so abrupt and unfinished
0	it is a fact , in , vhich a profoundly observant friendship has instructed me , that the proudest intellectuality stands in the most immediate relation of all to the animal , to naked instinct , is given over most ithamelessly to it ; hence the anxiety that a person like me must suffer through a nature like adrian 's - hence too my conviction that the accursed adventure of which he had v/ritten vas in its essence frightfully symbolic
0	you do love him madly ?
0	the music stopped , so also the conversation
0	there were no limits to the subject—but they could not go on for ever
0	i really know more of them than you do
0	but the standard-bearer , the standard-bearer ?
0	the hall was done in that modern style which knows how to give just the right touch of individuality to something in reality very simple
0	but those are only our feelings ; they are not actual objections
0	for four hundred years all great music has found its satisfaction in pretending that this unity has been accomplished without a break - it has pleased itself with confusing the conventional universal law to which it is subject with its own peculiar concern
0	hans castorp smoked , frau chauchat as well ; the latter russian cigarettes with a mouthpiece , from a lacquered box with a troika going full speed on the lid , which lay to hand on the table before her
0	and yet it ’ s quite pretty up here ; i leave it to you if it isn ’ t , ziemssen , what ?
0	you must excuse my speaking of such a thing , but it reminds me of the conserve jars that our housekeeper in hamburg—schalleen , we call her , without any miss or mrs—keeps in her larder
0	but in the sense of freedom , goodness , esprit , then it is great , we can freely apply it to our talk about peeperkorn and the care and pain he causes you
0	she had died , he thought , fulfilling the holy duty of a woman : ' 'the love i bore to her would have passed over in all its tenderness to her child , he said to himself
0	her freckled right hand , loosely closed with the thumb uppermost , she held in front of her and waved it to and fro on the wrist , as though to say : come , make haste , don ’ t attend to what i say , but say what you have to and let me be off !
0	a human voice welled out from the casket , a masculine voice at once soft and powerful , with orchestral accompaniment
0	hans castorp had learned something of the plot , knew the main lines of the tragic fate of radames , amneris , and aida ; and when he heard it from his casket could understand well enough what they said
0	any further journey was for the time impossible
0	the frau consul left this unanswered
0	naphta , who regularly took his tea here , had ordered wine and cake , obviously a reminiscence from his student days
0	behrens a très exactement rendu ta peau , oh , vraiment très fidèlement
0	then morten sat on the rocks
0	but that is no better than measuring space by time , a thing only very unscientific people do
0	this bargain once struck , he turned out to talk not unentertainingly of his experiences in the life from which his illness had withdrawn him
0	christian buddenbrook , proprietor of the firm of h c f purmeister and company of hamburg , came into his brother 's living-room , holding in his hand his modish grey hat and his walking-stick with the nun 's bust
0	i bent over rudolf
0	eighty-two , said the consul , leaning forward
0	did you say that ?
0	how much is it ?
0	the name kai had given dr wulicke was known only to himself and hanno , and they took the greatest pains not to let any of the others overhear it , for they could not possibly understand
0	her husband 's income was more and more reduced by the fall of the exchange , in some circles so desired and promoted
0	i see that she wears no ring , no wedding-ring , he said
0	on practical as well as on ideal grounds , mankind was now about to redress it
0	is there another discipline at 'whose mere name we feel ourselves in such a degree set bacl { into the past , into the sixteenth , the twelfth century ?
0	such turns of phrase had come in the past only from the mouth of the consul
0	her face was as long , straight , and expressionless as ever , her hair as smooth'and ash-coloured , her nose as straight , but full of large pores and getting thick at the end
0	good lord in heaven , what a thing it is , that the flesh can crave the flesh like that , simply because it is not its own flesh , but belongs to another soul—how strange , and yet , when you come to look at it , how unassuming , how friendly , how almost apologetic !
0	why should i go fishing in troubled waters ?
0	to a genuine sacrifice two valuations and qualitative ingredients belong : that of the thing and that of the sacrifice
0	his friend , and mine too , was the yard dog , suso
0	the whole family was there
0	it was impossible for him to hear his own voice , still more for the others to catch a syllable of what he let transpire without its in the least transpiring
0	the lean , light blonde was in her seat , and spooned up yogurt as though it formed her sole article of diet
0	she was responsive to your feeling , murmured peeperkorn , with wry lips
0	but the majority sat at the small , white tables on the covered platform , while the more frivolous spirits , finding it too prim to sit upon chairs , encamped on the stone steps that led down into the garden , where they presently gave evidence of their high spirits
0	around it there gathered in these days , besides the parents , only little clara , npw ten years old , mamsell jung-mann , and clothilde , as humble , lean , and hungry as ever
0	but it was bound to come
0	from the first he possessed the eudden-brook hand , broad , a little too short , but finely articulated , and his nose was precisely the nose of his father and great-grandfather , though the nostrils would probably remain more delicate
0	they were now walking on the city pavement , the main street , obviously , of an international centre
0	lvlake haste , adrian , and decide
0	the cloud over his eyes showed that he was suffer- ing from headache
0	but chancing to turn away his eyes a minute , he looked back to find him vanished
0	the barometer has fallen a little , but the sky is still the most staring blue
0	with bent head and cautious breathing he managed to get under way ; but even thus forearmed , the slowness of his progress and the difficulty of seeing and breathing dismayed him
0	the prognosis was extraordinarily favourable , there was not the slightest risk about the procedure , so in any case it could do no harm to try it
0	the girl- you do not like the word - the woman , then , marie - i am not indifferent to her either ; and when i say not indifferent , even that is not quite the right way to put it
0	but the beginning and the end , birth and death , we do not experience ; they have no subjective character , they fall entirely in the category of objective events , and that ’ s that
0	he wrote it , no doubt , with his eye on beethoven 's ninth , as its counterpart in a most mel- ancholy sense of the word
0	the weather was cool , he sat in his overcoat , with a rug about him , and his hands were cold
0	our defeat was now only a matter of time , and of cost to the foe
0	indeed , hans castorp definitely , wilfully purposed that she should know something , or even a good deal
0	hans castorp asked , severely
0	tiber-tius does not need to live so very long , perhaps , and the money would come back after he dies
0	a quarter before eight , she answered , pointing with a thin , red , rheumatic-looking hand at the clock on the wall you must get along , hanno
0	hans castorp answered in the affirmative
0	in the old days the classical course had been thought of as an end in itself , to be pursued at one 's ease , with a sense of joyous idealism , but now the leading conceptions were authority , duty , power , service , the career ; the categorical imperative of our philosopher kant was inscribed upon the banner which drr \vulicke in every official speech unfurled to the breeze
0	she was well read , accustomed to articulate her inner life in speech ; as a girl she had even attempted verse
0	they had to be covered up and ignored
0	there , to the mystic horror of one sensitive to it , is realized a utopia in form , of terrifying ingenuity t which in the faust cantata becomes
0	there were older people , married couples , a whole family with children , speaking russian , and half-grown lads
0	in its con- i servative form , holding to revelation and the traditional exegesis , \ it sought to save , vhat was to be saved of the elements of bible religion ; on the other hand it liberally accepted the historico- critical methods of the profane science of history and abandoned
0	do you know the latest , betsy ?
0	i know what i have to do : in public , i shall act as if i had nothing whatever to do with the affair
0	it was the principle by which one stood or fell , the absolute of the time ; it was , so to speak , its own justification
0	there might be some among the bedridden and moribund ; but the only one visible was a hollow-cheeked business man , said to come from cuxhaven , who had been sitting for two weeks at frau iltis ’ s table
0	this gallows humour of his made his company just the right thing for our recluse
0	please do not be angry , tony , he said
0	but tom wants it
0	his presence en- hances the dignity of the occasion -- and , beyond a question , this occasion is worthy of every dignity !
0	his head roared , his eyelids were like lead , his heart went like a set of kettledrums , and he began to torture himself with the suspicion that pretty marusja , who was bending over her plate covering her face with the hand that wore the ruby ring , was laughing at him—though he had taken enormous pains not to give occasion for laughter
0	going on to invoke the usual blessings on their metabolisms , while he prevented their rising from their seats , as they would have done in his honour
0	hans castorp had never once thought of it
0	conscious of being the focus of all eyes , she kept her own discreetly cast down ; yet now and again she could not resist letting them stray over the assembly , in which she noted the presence of julchen mbllendorpf , born hagen-strb am , and her husband
0	but there had been weimar , and donaueschingen , aside from the swiss performances of leverkiihn 's youthful worl { s : it took no extraordinary intuition to guess that here was something to prize and to promote
0	there is one strange thing about the piece : cast in three move- ments , it has no key-signature , but , if i may so express myself , three tonalities are built into it : b-flat major , c major , and d ma- jor , of which , as a musician can see , the d major forms a sort of secondary dominant , the b-flat major a sub dominant , while the c major keeps the strict middle
0	makes me a scene over a month or so of time , as though it were aeons passing over our heads
0	i will offer myself to his bullet , that is all that honour can demand
0	but one thing you will ad- mit
0	in short , whatever the deed might be , it was in any case a poor way of making one ’ s meaning clear ; as also it contributed little toward the clarification of intellectual problems
0	am i right , or am i not ?
0	next the bathing-woman was interrogated , who denied it stoutly
0	he did the rinsing and pencilling , and then the senator went
0	he uttered his views frankly and cheerfully , tubbing his hands like a man whose mind is free from care , and leaning back sidewise against the arm of his chair
0	and now get back where you belong
0	of course you do , tom ; goodness gracious , yes !
0	she knew she was being looked at , and her pribislav eyes shifted their gaze nervously , almost squinting
0	we must forgive and forget -- havengeance is mine , saith the lord
0	that is the point
0	it is all arranged
0	it annoyed him to be in such bad form , and with the self-consciousness of youth he read signs of indulgent amusement in the warmth of the assistant ’ s manner
0	the two living buddenbrooks had in their turn their own idiosyncrasies
0	but it is a good thing he does , for it is her illness grants it to her—and whoever falls into our situation will do well to follow his example , and not complain , either of the past or of the future
0	i feel that it matters so little whether one is trained upon an instrument , and so much whether one knows something about music
0	it took an hour of such work to cover one meadow
0	peut-être en me faisant voir ces tableaux
0	and you , young man , on my other side , he said
0	i have suffered from it ever since i got up
0	these words leverklihn makes his testis , the witness , the narrator , announce in a spectral melody , built up of perfect fourths and diminished fifths , and set above pedal harmonies alien to the key ; they then form the text of that boldly archaic responsoriu'lz , which they unforgettably repeat by two four-part choruses in contrary motion
0	he rowed alone and slowly over the quiet waters , gazing to right and left at a scene fantastic as any dream
0	i know everything pretty well , my good friend ; i have an inventory already in my pocket
0	this pleasure resort , she said
0	dr mantelsack 's mood was so good that he simply selected one of his favourites , without troubling in the least about whose turn it was
0	the tree in the dining-room burned , crackled , and dispensed its fragrance , waking the minds and hearts of the guests to a realization of the day
0	it was she 'who , while playing the part of exemplary housewife and mother , managed the affair , manipulated and concealed the daily artifices and the double life , which naturally gnav/ed at her nerves and terrified her by threatening the precarious loveliaess of her looks : for instance , it deepened the two furrows between her blond bro , vs until she looked almost maniacal
0	within my heart it slips and raptures fill me—
0	they looked like snow—more snow—as though there were pressing demand for it !
0	the craci { , and tien the little arms pressed closer to the sides , the grinding spasm , cruel to see but perhaps no longer felt , twisted the little limbs
0	hans castorp felt only contempt for the revolted lover and expressed it by a shoulder-shrug
0	that is your character
0	he spoke of the small vexations and rewards of the service , of the wonderfully satisfying comradeship , of the sheepish loyalty of his bursch , of funny occurrences on the parade-ground and in instruction ; of inspection , of love-feasts
0	but one can not say that adrian met the little boy half-way
0	what was all this ?
0	think how he urged in the assembly the union of the hamburg diligences with the postal service ; and how in he forced the senate by continuous pressure to join the german-austrian postal union !
0	when you saw them together you felt that here was a rapidly aging man , already a little heavy , with his young wife at his side
0	but now i trembled at the thought that his chastity since then , since that embrace , since his passing contagion and the loss of his physicians , sprang no longer from the ethos of purity but from the pathos of impurity
0	ah , and the catastrophes , by virtue of which it thinks to manifest its vitality , the ever-delayed spectacular triumphs at which it is preparing to assist , and thinks one day to celebrate !
0	dr faustus room to hear the evening prayer
0	how often , in the course of the century , would there be a demand for such a house ?
0	the listeners heaved each a deep sigh—they had been holding their breaths during herr settembrini ’ s great replication
0	and the sympathicus caused his heart , hans castorp ’ s heart , to thump , in such a way that it was impossible to breathe except in gasps ; and shivers ran over him , due to the functioning of the sebaceous glands , which , with the hair follicles , erected themselves
0	i can only repeat that you must do what ynu think best
0	perhaps it would be well to make cautious application of that wisdom to the present case
0	he realized that he was talking to himself , and not too sensibly—for which he took himself to task , and then continued on purpose , though his lips were so stiff he could not shape the labials , and so did without them , as he had on a certain other occasion that came to his mind
0	self-control and personal reserve are both lacking in the same way
0	so hans castorp took up again his strange position vis-à-vis to elly ; the white light gave place to rosy twilight , the music began again , the pumping motions ; this time it was hans castorp who announced trance
0	hans castorp asked with drawn brows
0	well , my dear reuter , he was saying as he entered , what do you say—shall we break the neck of another bottle ?
0	and , moreover , i must admire the extent of your con-sideration
0	he paused by the table and turned toward his sister , drumming lightly on the surface with his bent forefinger as he said : i will tell you a little story , my dear tony , which will illustrate my attitude toward this affair
0	he folded his pince-nez and put it into his pocket , buttoned up his coat , and began to walk up and down the room with firm and rapid strides , which studiously betrayed no sign that he was giving the subject any further consideration
0	when did you come ?
0	no , the same appetite was evinced by the silent , gloomy ones as well , those who in the pauses between courses leaned their heads on their hands and stared before them
0	i can add this quite calmly , since i share with no small part of our population , even those hardest hit and homeless , the feel- ing that we are only getting what we gave , and even if we must suffer more frightfully than we have sinned , we shall only hear in our ears that he who sows the , vind must reap the whirlwind
0	that is what excites curiosity , and you have not , long as you have been squatting there , given space to the ques- tion in all your talk
0	the name does not come well to my ears , said the consul , quickly and harshly
0	it is not your way to linger with the finished work
0	that only means he is a better business man and a cleverer politician than i am -- there 's no reason at all for you to laugh in that scornful way -- but to come back to the house
0	then he fell again to musing , and the rapidity with which he drew the ends of his moustaches through his fingers was in remarkable contrast to the vacant fixity of his gaze
0	the banker sat opposite the host , the consul presided on the long side of the table
0	with us fat is only about five per cent of the body weight , in females it is one sixteenth of the whole
0	she was a plump child with short blonde hair , in a funny , shapeless , knitted frock of pale blue wool
0	for what had i , really , , vhat had my culture and ethics to do with these words and visions of a romantic poet , thest dreams of a child-world and folk-world vhich yet are for ever floating off , not to say degenerating , into the supernatural and spectral ?
0	you are expecting dispatches , engineer ?
0	despite all he could say , the gloomy disaffection gained ground , threats of unlicensed departure were the order of the day , were even put into execution , without regard for the warning afforded by the melancholy return of frau salomon to the fold , now a life member , her tedious but not serious case having taken that turn by reason of her self-willed visit to her wet and windy amsterdam
0	it said : oh , mademoiselles !
0	in such a case , the consul argued , he must accommodate himself to the surrender of whatever sum was necessary
0	the couple behind were quiet too , but their quietness was only apparent , for in reality tony and her bavarian guest were conversing in subdued and intimate tones
0	but this was not all
0	leaning forward , hands between knees , looking by turn at his hands and his mouth
0	the publication will in every case take as its norm the dignity and happiness of mankind , and seek to indicate the measures and remedies calculated to remove the cause of each deviation
0	she came from the baltic provinces somewhere—lymphatic , anæmic , but probably some more serious trouble as well
0	many of the guests had their hands curved behind their ears ; some even held the hand in the air half-way thither , as though arrested midway in the gesture by the strength of their concentration
0	she had not listened , not outside , not at the door , truly , truly she had not !
0	ing , adrian was busy with the conposition of some songs and lieder , german and foreign , or rather , english
0	but after the meal they spoke of it , and joachim freed his mind on the subject of that damned female who had put the thing in his head with her silly question and somehow or other set a spell on him
0	quite a taking little dodge—but as a matter of fact , the epicanthus can be traced back to an atavistic vestige—it ’ s a developmental arrest
0	the great confusion played havoc , moreover , with emotional conceptions , or states of consciousness like still and again ; and this was one of the very most gruesome , bewildering , uncanny features of the case
0	you can ’ t believe how the air up here sets me on fire
0	then there , vas the fear of being overrun from all sides , from which fate only our enormous strength protected us , our power of carrying the , var straightway into other lands
0	i too , vas just on the point of 'opening my mouth , to beg our friend to make an end of the introduction and play to us from the
0	but what is the matter with it , then ?
0	lastly , there were cotthold 's late angry letters to his father -- painful documents , to offset which was the poem written by jean jacques hoffstede to celebrate the
0	it reversed the possessive relation somehow and
0	you are a different cut up here -- holy sacrament !
0	they were attacked by inflammation , the neighbouring blood-vessels suffered by contagion
0	they saw his kingly features move in speech , the mouth form words , which were as soundless as though spoken into empty , etherless space
0	but oh , dear , tony -- if you do not like him , and if he wo not make you happy -- ida , i know life , and i am not a little goose any more
0	may i— then that ’ s settled , croaked the directress
0	and then you abuse your poor old father in the coarsest way rather than give up a few thousand thaler so he deigns to look down upon me as a business man , does he ?
0	she tastes like papier mâché , i do assure you—precisely as when one has a spoilt digestion
0	she was entirely without private means and dependent upon unfeeling relatives—once , in fact , they had taken her away , since she was sure to die in any case ; and only at the hofrat ’ s intercession did they send her back
0	to see the world as cleft into two opposing poles—that is spirit
0	you were afraid of death , and you stopped up here
0	at this ida jungmann actually shivered and changed colour
0	you call that of course ’ ; but if one once loses hold of the fact that it is of course , it is quite frightening , you feel like hanging on to something
0	at the same time there were now re- leased in her certain still keen desires of an unexhaustible and probably never satisfied love of life , in some humanly warmer sphere
0	and how many times had he answered it : in strong and purposeful hours with one answer , in weak and discouraged ones with another !
0	he held toward this chimerical goal , that often quite vanished in mist , and took an exhausting climb against the wind before it was reached ; finally drew near it—to discover , with what staggering astonishment and horror may be imagined , that it was only the hay-hut with the weighted roof , to which , after all his striving , by all his devious paths , he had come back
0	joachim expressed disapproval of the expenditure
0	it is the half-articulate art , the dubious , the irresponsible , the insensible
0	i myself , speaking as one who early submitted his own head and heart to the phenomenon of adrian 's cool and bafflingly self-contained ex- istence , have i the smallest right to mock at the fascination which his aloneness , the nonconformity of his life , exerted upon these women ?
0	there you have the pillars of the liberal world-republic
0	b , the letter b , came next
0	there was a lady sitting at his table , named frau stöhr , the wife of a cannstadt musician ; a rather serious case , she was , and the most ignorant creature he had ever seen
0	then my skirts will be cleared !
0	to which the person asked must reply : no , i ’ ve never seen the devil with a nightcap on , and then repeat the question in his turn , and so on
0	they degraded hilti to the status of a patient , shut him up in his castle by the lake , unscrewed the door-knobs and barred the windows
0	yes , what strange things do happen
0	the cousins were aghast
0	it would appear , then , that under conditions of bewilderment man is likely to under- rather than over-estimate time
0	they were silent for some way ; but the silence spoke of naphta , and hans castorp could wait
0	well , god bless us all !
0	refectory—oh , i say , that is good !
0	and here it was
0	when she looked him straight in the eyes—like that—she found his rather blurred and flickering ; and he looked , as he lay , not as though everything were in the best of order with him , she herself would hardly give him a clean bill of health
0	we are not either entertaining or going out just now -- no , but we have visitors very often -- for which i am not responsible , jean , as you know , though of course i am al-ways glad to see them
0	he was moved by his transports to a course that only the very violence of emotion could pursue
0	nothing was to be heard but a measured , peaceful sound which meant that the boy was raking the gravelled paths of the kurgarden below , and the buzzing of a fly that had got between the blind and the window and was storming the pane -- you could see his shadow shooting about in long zigzag lines
0	yes , yes , said the senator , making a gesture of repulsion with his hand
0	to the astonishment of the staff , the senator now often left his work during office hours , to pace up and down in the garden with his hands behind his back , or to work about , raking the gravel paths , tying up the rose-bushes , or dredging mud out of the fountain
0	we even confess that it is without great concern we leave the question open
0	it was as if he were addressing his remarks to god or to his own soul
0	tait tout a fait impossible de manquer - oh , yes , i speak german , he inter- rupted himself , with the same not unpleasant hard quality in his voice : not well , not perfectly , but i can make myself under stood
0	then they talked for hours about boarding-school days and the bed-time gossip ; nf arm-gard von schilling in mecklenburg and eva ewers in munich
0	of course he was far removed from the frowning brow or any avuncular that 's a good lad
0	yes ; i am glad you have come
0	no , don ’ t worry , i ’ ve forgotten all of it , answered hans castorp , the whole complex
0	one attends when one likes , at one 's own free will , sits down and listens , as in the theatre -- as in the theatre !
0	we all take care to say what will be pleasant to hear -- that is a commonplace well , you see they are the same thing , in a way
0	there you have again the thing i am talking about , and can see what it is like
0	blindly , enveloped in white , whirling night , he laboured deeper and deeper into this grim and callous sphere
0	and behold , as one looked , this martyr ’ s visage blossomed into wantonness
0	he would feel himself obliged to avert the catastro-phe , and to support b griinliuh at any price
0	frau senator rodde 's background was easy to imagine
0	and shall i say that the departure from the l\'lanardi house , however unwillingly i now as always left adrian 's side , vas accompanied with a certain private feeling of relief ?
0	you say she kicked ?
0	and elsbeth leverktihn although it too has seen its changes and in the course of my boyhood , my schoolboy , and my student years glided over , with that imperceptible effectiveness time l { now
0	the extraordinary man 's resolve was swiftly formed
0	but first he was to recite to papa a poem painfully learned by heart , with ida jungmann 's help , in the little balcony on the second floor
0	and yet hans castorp loved this snowy world
0	are you really thinking of visiting the man ?
0	you will see everybody gather round peeperkorn , and herr naphta will be sitting there alone with his cleverness and his city of god , though he may be uttering such penetrating wisdom that it pierces through marrow and cucumber , as behrens says—
0	i only mean that you must get to take the thing differently -- not so insulted -- a little more politic point of view
0	i feel as though i should like - as though i must - al- ways see her and have her about me
0	sons-in-law are always rogues , said frau permaneder , in a hollow voice
0	you must remedy it at the earliest opportunity
0	christian , however , rue- fully remarked that he had not much faith in the prescription ; and consul kroger had no need of it
0	but one of the sentries suddenly heard a short , discreet whistle from within the building
0	what a splendid morning !
0	in any case there had to be cuts
0	then there were storms so violent as to prevent one ’ s sitting on the balcony for the driven snow which blew in , in such quantity as to cover floor and chair with a thick mantle
0	that is a promise !
0	in the near future—after a proper interval for reflection—very good
0	alas , it went badly on both sides !
0	i must beg my good hostess for another slice
0	or put it the other way round : the special case behaving as though it were identical with the prescribed and familiar formula
0	in the first place , said hans castorp , speaking with dignity and dividing his remarks into categories , i can not comprehend why , with a harmless fever—assuming for the moment , that there is such a thing—one must keep one ’ s bed , while with one that is not harmless you needn ’ t
0	then he went , with herr gr� fluttering in front of and behind him to open the portieres , through the dining-room into the living-room
0	quick , get a wagon and fetch grabow , tony repeated breathlessly
0	but you did not see him
0	but he had also been kept informed of joachim ’ s progress ; hans castorp told him , whether asked or unasked , and he knew that joachim had been in bed in may
0	they did not mention the visit to lauro ’ s bedside ; even to themselves they refrained from comment on his behaviour
0	the consul walked up and down , sighed , shook his head , shrugged his shoulders
0	great ships passed by , and you signalled them with your handkerchief ; and you listened to the little waves slapping softly against the stones ; and the whole space about you was filled with a soft and mighty sighing
0	i have already suggested that the derivation of the lodge from that craftsmanly and honourable masonic guild is only a historical extension
0	now it was the aristocratic principle
0	tales berlin , s fiscber verlag
0	i learned this fact in michael- mas °- at the beginning of the next year wendell accord- ingly left kaisersaschern to take over his new position , and from then on the correspondence went forward between halle and leipzig , to and fro : kretschmar 's sheets covered on one side with large , scratching , spluttering letters ; adrian 's replies on rough
0	he loved and 'vas loved by a maiden named barbel , only daughter of a widowed sexton , and 'wished to marry her , but the young couple 's desire tilet 'with her father 's opposition , for klopfgeissel was poor , and the sexton insisted on a considerable setting-up in life , and that he should be a master in his trade before he gave him his daughter
0	he , naphta , was well aware that man ’ s inner conflict based upon the antagonism between the sensible and the supra-sensible ; it was he , not settembrini , who represented the true , the mystical individualism
0	on top of the fountain ( she continued reading ) there is a madonna , and sometimes she is crowned with a wreath , and the common people come with rose garlands and kneel down and pray -- which looks very pretty , but it is written : go into your chamber
0	he made a brief effort , rolling his eyes about , to awaken sympathy in the company for the misery in his side ; went early to the club ; and came back to supper , which was held after the prescribed traditions
0	and it was this : as soon as he began to think of his mortal end not as an in-definite remote event , almost a contingency , but as something near and tangible for which it behoved him to prepare , he began to investigate himself , to examine his relations to death and questions of another world
0	cried frau permaneder , enchanted
0	an indefinite ache is felt in all the bones
0	and naphta , without looking at him , or relaxing his contained manner , apparently could not refrain from saying , low and bitingly : i am glad to see that despite your enthusiasm for freedom and progress , you have some feeling for serious things
0	oh , un-cle , she replied , with amiable simplicity , to the old man 's gibe , which did not in the least disconcert her
0	he stood by and lent a hand , grasping the figure under the shoulders and helping carry it over to the coffin , upon whose coverlet and tasselled cushions joachim presently lay ensconced high and solemnly , among candelabra provided by the house
0	but it is not the most precious thing in life , thomas -- no , before god , it is not
0	still in the most fragile health , he worked ten hours a day and more , broken only by a short pause at midday and now and then a walk round the pond or up the hill , brief excursions more like flight than recreation
0	cried hans castorp , in his excitement availing himself of herr settembrini ’ s formula of assent
0	i was talking this afternoon with gosch the broker , a wonderful man , looking at everything with the eyes of a poet and writer
0	yes , you see—you mock at me when i—and then , when i—you say you will leave me—
0	hanno took up his position on the threshold of the living-room and let his arms hang down
0	i have not at all the feeling of having really got acclimatized—which would certainly be the first necessary step toward improvement
0	well , well , grilss gott !
0	about the horrors of impotence you have said things of such magnitude that i am quite confounded , as you see me sit here
0	of course it belongs to all of us , to you and me , and christian -- and , queerly enough , to pastor tiburtius too
0	every sunday he went to service down in the platz , and in the rest-cure he read devotional books with a chalice or palm branch on the front cover
0	and so were the other faces about them
0	he , vas equipped for conquest with nothing but a cheap and cynical eloquence , fine linen , and much black hair on his hands
0	as though pistols were not bad enough , that they must add these murderous conditions !
0	one could hardly see that he had risen ; he was one of the small and forward ones
0	and petersen did too
0	but if we are hardly justified in considering it a symptom of inental aberration when a man of average equipment avoids his fellows , why then should it be allowable to do so when the sanle taste is able to gratify itself on a regal scale ?
0	but the overdiecks are represented , and , indeed , by no less a personage than the head of the family , the venerable doctor kaspar over- dieck , reigning burgomaster , more than eighty years old
0	he said this rather low and quickly , with a short gesture , as though he were tossing something to his brother across the table
0	she wore a white sweater and blue skirt , and had a book from the lending-library in her lap
0	he was as simple as she
0	as far as breaking the rules goes , there are more forbidden things besides tennis that get played here—poker , and petits-chevaux , in this and that hotel
0	for you can unburden your heart , and tell me everything , and then we shall see how we can put things right , by taking thought , and by mutual forbearance and affection
0	i was ready to put up with the social revolution - yes , to agree to it - which would arise from such comradery
0	when the waves of tribulation went over him once more he would think of the sea and of the kurgarden , and of the sound made by the little waves , coming hither out of the mysterious slumbering distance
0	asked the old lady , after a pause
0	this they all knew beforehand—hans castorp even blurted out something of the sort , after his fashion , as they sat and waited
0	the old spinster said
0	his betrothal to fraulein huneus had just been announced ; whereby he married a considerable dowry and a place in the best society
0	i ca not sleep , i tell you , and my head aches for thinking
0	was it not very bourgeois , even pedantic , of him , to imagine they ought to write , when he himself had been of opinion that it was neither necessary nor desirable for them to speak ?
0	mouth in astonishment at my apologia , but i am the one who has the right to be surprised at you and not to understand how you
0	this is no everyday effort , but a product of emotion , and in so far feeling and mind are related , but also in so far inind gets its thrilling effect
0	from my soul i am grateful , frau consul , he said , and his look was indeed elo-quent with emotion
0	but he denied that useful functions were the essential objects and raisons d'etre of the state
0	figaro qua , figaro là , figaro , figaro , figaro !
0	the comparison is not pertinent—for our hero was no wehsal
0	his pointed chin rose almost up to his nose , his face expressed the most desperate resolution ; his grey hair streamed dis-tractedly over brow and temples ; his head was so drawn in between his shoulders that he really almost achieved his am-bition of looking like a dwarf -- and he rapped out : you behold me resolved to speak to the people
0	the broad echoing passage-way below was paved with great square flagstones
0	he paused , however , near the door
0	was not the idea of a material world existing by and for itself the most laughable of all selfcontradictions ?
0	look , here is a door , an outer door
0	that too was a transcendental dynamic discharge , occurring through negligence - the negligence , indeed , of l { ing david , who was too fond of playing the harp , and had no real understanding of
0	they were furnished with bedsteads and chests in the style of the painted one below , and only a fevv were supplied with the towering feather beds in peas- ant style
0	then hans castorp felt her press his two hands with a quick , firm pressure
0	the evening of the twenty-third came at last , and with it the present-giving in the house in fishers ' lane
0	herr stengel appeared in his sunday wig and his tallest choker , bristling with lead-pencils like lance-heads , and they sat on the sofa in the landscape-room , while christian hid in the dining-room and listened
0	he knew the business , and it was a light , agreeable job , in which a man could be his own master , write now and then in a note-book , and make thirty thaler by turning over his hand
0	i could tell as soon as i saw you—he spoke now directly to the young man—that you were a layman ; there ’ s something civilian and comfortable about you , not like our sabre-rattling corporal here !
0	hans castorp recognized the traditional phenomenon with a certain grim satisfaction—and even slapped his thigh in astonishment at this punctual general law fulfilling itself in his particular case
0	for since these people are actors , they must have a gift , and the gift itself is beyond cleverness and stupidity , it is after all a value
0	as antonie appeared , babette exclaimed something that sounded like jesus , mary , and jo-seph ! -- and jesus , mary , and joseph !
0	for himself , it was precisely because he did not know the answers that he put the questions
0	they were really quite right : it was an admitted fact that hanno -- this was the nickname adopted by the frau senator for her son -- at a time when he was able to call all the members of his family by name with fair correctness , was incapable of pronouncing the names friederike , henriette , and pfiffi so that any one could understand what he said
0	they walked awhile in silence , until joachim asked : well , how do you like the people up here ?
0	ah , what an apt phrase !
0	she had heard it with her owl ears
0	two or three times in the afternoon it looked as though the sun were coming out ; and a few acquaintances from town appeared -- people who enjoyed a holiday away from their families : senator dr gieseke , christian 's friend , and consul peter dohlmann , who looked very ill indeed , and was killing himself with hunyadi-janos water
0	not even the delicate tinkling of the music-box would he hear ; at once uttered his tortured 'nuff , 'nuff !
0	good heavens , thomas , it was a joke ! -- although , buddenbrdoks really -- christian hesitated , wrinkling his nose and stooping a little
0	je veux dire—c ’ est un rêve bien connu , rêvé de tout temps , long , éternel , oui , être assis près de toi comme à présent , voilà l ’ éternité
0	i need only mention the names of marie godeau , rudi schwerdtfeger , and nepomuk schneidewein to bring home to myself adrian 's receptivity , yes , weakness , for the magic of the eye , the black and the blue
0	the story was told of count eber-hard that when he rrst withdrew to his little farm , he devised a means of protecting himself from the importunities of ped-dlers , beggars , and busy-bodies
0	it is the soundless , tiny stream through the hour-glass , that solemn , fragile toy that adorns the hermit ’ s hut
0	it was decided that little erica should go to munich too , this being her mother 's wish , to which her betrothed warmly agreed
0	when the consul read these he could never quite forego a little smile ; for , notwithstanding all the real pain they showed , he heard an undertone of almost comic pride , and he knew that tony buddenbrook , as madame gr� or as madame permaneder , was and would remain a child
0	on the contrary , they but give it spice
0	do you remember , she said , a year and a half ago , at the rifle-club fair ?
0	it was true that corporal punishment was on the decline in certain countries which considered themselves in the van of progress : but the belief that such a decline was a sign of enlightenment became only the more comic the longer it persisted
0	and he had felt to some extent responsible for the turn adrian 's life had taken , because it had been he who had moved him to the swiss journey and thus brought about the meeting with marie
0	he had a hard struggle to free himself—but the inner compulsion proved stronger
0	a geneva , sir , repeated the dwarf , and spun three times round on herself , seeking a place for her jugs , which she finally deposited on hans castorp ’ s table , quite near him , obviously not wishing to burden herr peeperkorn with the same
0	a dull , booming roar came up from the ocean , whose waters now and then lifted a crested head of spray in the distance
0	but on the very next day she wrote to dr cieseke and summoned him to meng street
0	of the christening basin , and of grandfather
0	life is based on conditions and built up on foundations which are partly the result of experience , and partly belong to the domain of ethics
0	but what did he offer that was new ?
0	hofrat behrens did not show himself—he had probably ere now taken private leave of the traveller
0	was it likely it would ever dawn ?
0	he leaned against the piano , in his blue sailor suit with the white v front and the wide linen collar with a big sailor 's knot coming out beneath
0	he had not liked to press matters
0	this destructive sliding through the seven positions of the instrument !
0	if you will permit me , i will just do a little more rinsing and pencilling , to reduce the pain somewhat
0	mediocrity , in fact , has no theological status
0	you give out something he has not got to give , which seems to be favourable to my wishes and hopes
0	what has that to do with it ?
0	the kremlin is finer than that castle or monastery , or whatever it is , at the foot of the mountains—
0	tuny drew her brows together sharply at this , for some reason , and answered without looking at him , hoffmann 's 'serapion brethren
0	as they left , they met in the doorway a number of sailors , with two pilots at the head , from the wullenwewrr ' and the friederike overdieck , the two ships belonging to the firm which happened at the time to be in port
0	and he went off across the hall , on his stiff , crooked legs
0	she began , drawing back her lips and showing her rodent-like teeth , to drop hints and make insinuations on the subject of the relations of the three young people
0	it won ’ t insult this simple wine to drink it out of an ordinary tumbler— he poured out the wine , with hans castorp ’ s help , as his hand trembled slightly , and drank thirstily , as though it had been water
0	you are aware , of course , that there is only one sort of revolt against nature which may be called honourable ; that which revolts in the name of human beauty and human dignity
0	you will understand my anxiety , he said
0	they heard something charming : a pure , bell-like sound , coming from the bottom of the room and flowing sweetly , sensuously , with indescribably tender effect , on the sudden silence
0	hans castorp , all flushed and depleted from taxing his brains in the cold , shaky as to his capacity for clear expression , hot and cold with his own audacity , heard himself babble that always since a child he had pictured death to himself as wearing a starched ruff , or at least a sort of half-uniform , with a stand-up collar , while life , on the other hand , wore an ordinary collar
0	it is inexcusable that you are still here
0	her name was semlinger
0	then it was that , thus reproved , hans castorp had taken—and expressed—a resolve : he would visit their departed comrade , and discharge the last duty of silent respect toward his remains
0	don ’ t behave like that , he tells them , joachim answered
0	from time immemorial the hagenstroms and we have hren rivals
0	'ai dr ft\ustus i knapp
0	hermine kleefeld , bare elbows on the table , propped up her head , her cheeks in her hands , and showed the giggling ting-fu all the enamel of her front teeth
0	the head end was adjustable ; behrens stretched out full length , with his silver plate under his arm , closed his eyes , and began to snore like a saw-mill , giving out that he was fafnir with the treasure hoard
0	she might as well carry a key basket
0	then the con- versation split up and exhausted itself in disjointed speculation on the signs , if any , that this might come to pass
0	and his theological definition of free- dom was an apologia and a polemic against the more modern , that is to say more insipid , more ordinary ideas , which his hearers might associate with them
0	hans castorp went into his cousin ’ s room
0	the minute-hand on time ’ s clock had moved one space further on : not one of the large spaces , not one which measured the centuries or the decades ; it was only the year that had been shoved forward by one figure ; though hans castorp had been up here not a whole year yet , but scarcely more than half a one , it had jerked itself on , as does the minute-hand of certain large clocks , which only register by five minutes at a time ; and was now pointing motionless , awaiting the moment to move forward again
0	that was the only change
0	but at the moment it is not a matter of subjective emotion , but of fact
0	not that the broker had ever exchanged a word with her
0	service of love because you would be much more in your element than , let us say , serenus zeitblom
0	another vas the i < : lopstock phrase the drop to the
0	on his way through his forms at school , he had now and again to take one for the second time
0	what a fight that was , spring had to wage up here , before it finally conquered !
0	his clasp had been heart-felt to the limits of respect ; but it had in some indescribable fashion escaped him
0	a settled man like me scarcely felt at ease in it all ; and aside from personal and tempera --
0	not always—i am for it and against it , both by turns
0	but the odour of pipe tobacco pervaded the air of the lower rooms as it did at buchel ; and the owner and his wife , herr and frau schwei- gestill , were a father and
0	he merely thought that the man 's constant puffing and blovving had always been a bad sign
0	and what signifies sammael ?
0	strange to say , thomas did not meet this outburst by more anger
0	the guest of that day had long become the comrade—dr
0	i mean : our stage is that of civilization - a very praiseworthy state no doubt , but also neither was there any doubt
0	they were thirteen persons ; not counting the czech wenzel , whose function it was to serve polyhymnia , and who accordingly , after putting his instrument in readiness , squatted with his guitar at the back of the circle
0	her cheeks were flushed , and she chattered without stopping , probably in russian , while the rug was being arranged over her knees
0	you are a child , tony , a child , said he in a discouraged , almost pleading tone
0	did i beguile myself , or he me , that it was cold , so i might quake and thereby certify myself that he was there , i-limself in person ?
0	those eyes , under their long-lashed lids , blend the light blue of the father 's and the brown of the mother 's iris into a pale , indefinite , 'changeful golden-brown ; but bluish shadows lie in the deep corners on both sides of the nose , and these give the little face , which is hardly yet a face at all , an aged look not suited to its four weeks of existence
0	dld you ever see him , herr pastor ?
0	he was rather piqued by this expression of opinion
0	a normally constructed minister-presi- dent can govern a modern federated state even if the king is too sensitive to stand the sight of his and his colleagues ' faces
0	wouldamnable influences , the consul quoted
0	it could not deny inevitable growth ; but it took refuge in the sphere of the mythical and timeless , the simultaneous and abiding , wherein the saviour 's form as a grown man is no contradiction to the babe in the \ther 's arms which he also is ; which he always is , always before his worshipping saints lifting his little hand in the sign of the cross
0	l for suffering , and an exaggerated self-pity
0	thus now hans castorp was privileged to behold the good joachim—but with the aid and under the auspices of physical science ; and by his cousin ’ s express permission , so that it was quite legitimate and without gruesome significance
0	he , vas at a disadvantage because he , vas not in love : i never have loved her , i admit it openly , i alwa : rs just had friendly and brotherly feelings for her , and that i let myself in vith her like this and the stupid thing drags on because she clings to it , that is just a matter of duty and decency on diy side
0	likely , now , he ventured , likely , now , ye have taken a d silly fright , and are too damned scared of marriage ever to try it again -- hey , frau gr� ?
0	tony 's black frock gave her figure a maidenly slimness
0	whereas we , on the contrary—
0	to alter these shocking conditions , to which habit and ignorance had rendered those who saw them callous - for instance the indescribable filth of the village street , the utter lack of sanitation in the dwelling-hovels - would have amounted to a revolutionary deed , to which no single individual , certainly not a woman , could bring herself
0	hans castorp ironically asked his cousin , on the third day
0	now and then they flickered in a draught and dispersed a faint smell of wax over the table
0	pardon me , you were going to enlighten me further
0	but i swear to you , i pledge you my word of honour as a man , that i would carry you in my arms , that as my wife you would lack nothing , that you would live in hamburg a life alto-gether worthy of you -- tony sprang up
0	there were years in which we children of the dungeon dreamed of a hymn of exultation , a fidelio , a ninth symphony , to celebrate the dawn of a freed ger- many - freed by herself
0	frau permaneder was quite aware of the dignity , the repre-sentative bearing , which she owed to herself and the commu-nity in this hour
0	be quiet now ; it 's my turn
0	without that subcutaneous cell structure of ours , we should all be nothing but fungoid growths
0	you ’ ve learned something since you ’ ve been up here
0	it seemed that the two-year theological episode in halle had not weakened his bond with music or been any actual interruption to his preoccupation with it
0	she forbade her neighbour to use such words about clavdia ’ s profile
0	but first i must not fail to shed some light upon te personal condition of its creator , a man now fo
0	c ’ est ton cousin à qui tu penses en disant des choses étranges comme ça ?
0	just as much as in bach
0	they entered by slippery steps into a cellar-like vault with an earthen floor , which was used as a granary and provided with a rope for hauling up the sacks
0	i assume our gentleman will already have ordered them to put to the horses
0	very good , ziemssen , be off with you !
0	he sat down comfortably opposite the billiard-players , who leaned upon their rues across the tables
0	why you have it , i don ’ t know
0	what concerns you not , meddle not with !
0	don ’ t worry , we rest for an hour again before dinner , and then after it until four o ’ clock
0	listen , pf� would like to have you take him , if you will be so good
0	and it is like that at every company , before every expedition
0	not in the least , said adrian
0	his weariness rushed over him with renewed force at the thought
0	i forbid it , do you hear ?
0	you led up to a climax
0	truly , in his own physical person he was contaminate ; yet what mattered that , since his mind was untainted and sound—and quite competent to bring confusion to his priestly opponent in any discussion touching the body , or to laugh him to scorn over the soul ?
0	oh , now i am so new up here , i am still rather bewildered—you can imagine
0	the road to travem�irst crosses the ferry and then goes straight ahead
0	frau stöhr , for all her stupidity and ill breeding , was unquestionably worse off than he—not to mention dr blumenkohl
0	and though i hadn ’ t thought of it in that light , i may say that i agree with you , now that you mention it
0	while the rest drank their coifee he played the voilin , like a gipsy , passionately , with abandonment -- and with what dexterity !
0	such an idea would never have entered tony 's head of itself ; but since he said it , she believed it , and her feeling for him had thereby grown warmer and ten-derer
0	it is the last blow
0	and finally there were adrian and rudiger
0	one might , if one chose , describe it as deliberate rebarbarization
0	she did not even know the lady to speak to , nor could she boast a single common acquaintance
0	in my recollection they showed strong resemblance to ancient oriental writings , for instance the old aramaic ductus
0	he could not , so he told its author , express how it tool
0	he thought little or nothing of this
0	of course , when one heard the hofrat talk , one might easily conclude he had fever
0	that is a requisite , i suppose
0	little johann came out of his room , down the gallery steps , and across the corridor , on his way to ida jungmann 's room
0	your offer coin-cides with my motherly plans for my daughter ; and you on your side have not chosen badly -- that i can assure you
0	is that fair , i ask—or i would if i did not know that it is not a matter of justice at all—
0	so much for the moment as a description of nepo schnei- dewein , or echo as everybody , following his example , straight- way called him
0	how foolish all that was !
0	it is a metaphysical en- dowment , an essential factor , a structure , a conditioning
0	and between two wars , little johann played
0	hanno had grown sturdier in the past year ; but , despite his blue sailor suit , he still looked a little strange in the play-ground of the school , by contrast with the blond scandina-vian type that predominated there
0	joachim too looked rather uncomfortable , and settembrini lifted his eyebrows and said not a word , with an air of waiting politely for the end of his speech
0	she had slept very badly , and in the night she rang for ida jung-mann , who now slept in the back room of the entresol
0	he had a way of running one hand in between the buttons of his half-open undress coat and of sit-ting with his head supported on the back of his hand
0	what do you mean , tom ?
0	there is not a glory of the flesh i would not offer her , castorp , if it were only a matter of the body , not of the countenance , if it were not her accursed soul that will have none of me , without which i should have no longing for her body—that is the devil ’ s treadmill in which i eternally go round and round
0	in one breath , or rather in one breathlessness , he wrote down the three pieces , anyone of which would have been enough to make menlrable the year of its production ; actually he began with the draft of the trio on the very day on which he finished the lento of the quartet , which he composed last
0	by next morning the storm had ceased
0	it would impress anybody—couldn ’ t help it
0	i will wait for him here
0	when the nevvs comes that her sinful brother-husband is dead she breaks out in the remarkacle lament : gone is my hope , gone is my strength , my only brother , my second i !
0	\ y hand trembles as i vvrite ; but in quiet , collected words i will say what i know , always consoled to a certain extent by the thought to which i gave utterance above , the idea of choice , the thought that something obtained here like a bond of love , which lent to the coming together of the precious youth and that un- happy creature a gleam of soul though of course this consola- tion is inseparable from the other thought , so much more dread- ful , that love and poison here once and for ever became a frightful unity of experience ; the mythological unity embodied in the arrow it does look as though in the poor thing 's mind something an- swered the feeling which the youth brought to her no doubt she remembered that fleeting visit her approach , that caressing of his cheek with her bare arm , might have been the humble and tender expression of her receptivity for all that distinguished him
0	that is nothing , says behrens , her lung is perfectly satisfactory
0	let us sit here , and look on , as though in a dream
0	it is acquired root-treatment , he said to me
0	but even so , tom
0	but you have the right end of it after all , let me tell you
0	the disputant not only contradicted each other , they contradicted themselves
0	it would be a senseless thing to do , you admit it yourself , don ’ t you ?
0	it showed by irnplication that precedence belonged far more to the community ; that truth had the community as its goal , and that whoever would share in the conmunity must be pre- pared to scrap considerable elements of truth and science and line up for the sacrificiu intellectus '
0	but what ’ s the use of it ?
0	they had got up meantime to the berghof
0	but one day an indefinable malady had suddenly made itself felt -- at first in the form of a slight intestinal catarrh , for which dr crabow prescribed a mild diet of pigeon and french bread
0	at christmas time herr criinliuh appeared , to spend christmas in the buddenbrook family circle and also to take part in the celebration at the krbgers '
0	but even that be- came him , as did the curling lips that could whistle in so masterly a fashion
0	but a demonstrable hypothesis !
0	did we get into this wagon to discuss that subject ? -- dh , yes , i suppose you are right
0	and they knew in meng street , and at the club -- yes , the whole town knew -- who was responsible
0	joachim in particular felt relieved and enlightened by this explanation of his cousin ’ s startling curiosity ; it was in fact more on his account than on the hofrat ’ s that hans castorp had offered it
0	what is the physical being of man ?
0	gerda buddenbrook and the eccentric young officer met each other , naturally , in the world of music
0	at bottom , christian had said , at bottom every business man was a rascal
0	her digestion was obviously worse in these days
0	then he lifted the glass once more , and spilled half its contents , draining the remainder furiously at a gulp
0	his face , with the black almond-shaped eyes , displayed a slight grimace as he did so , but whether this happened in the effort to see more clearly or for other causes , he did not permit it to appear
0	or at least something very like that
0	he had a glass eye , which imparted a rather stony expression to his bearded face and belied his character , for he was of a lively and liberal frame and loved nothing better than play- ing the gallant with prima donnas and soubrettes in his drawing- room
0	we have mentioned the clairvoyante greataunt , of whom a melancholy tradition had come down
0	'that 's enouph , tony , the senator said softly
0	though in and for itself it went against ine too
0	he swept sister leandra with an icy stare , and seated himself in the chair which they placed for him by the bedside
0	but they might roll and seethe , weep and exult , foam up and enfold each other , as unnaturally as they liked !
0	but with a sort of horror at himself he saw it coming , that if he made this discipline his own , bound himself over , identified himself with it , he would very soon be disillusioned , bored ; get as sick and tired of it as though he had ladled it in with a cooking-spoon ( this gro- tesque simile also i recall literally )
0	he felt no unpleasant sensation , the blood-letting had had a soothing effect , but he found himself in a state of extraordinarily reduced vitality , so that when he exhaled the air , he felt no need to draw it in again , and lay there moveless , for the space of several quiet heart-beats , before taking another slow and superficial breath
0	mexican , you know ; doesn ’ t know a word of german and hardly any french , just a few scraps
0	his father so arranged it , and , though hanno was afraid , he made not a syllable of objection
0	settembrini says it is the law of love of one ’ s kind ; that sounds like his ancestor , the carbonaro
0	then the bril clanged loudly , and the pupils began to stream through the entrances into the building
0	how often had the normal day of the berghof renewed itself , since the faroff time when hans castorp lay and grumbled within himself because dr krokowski described an arc about him and left him on one side !
0	they helped him lift his unwieldy body from table , gave him the support of their arms , and he walked with wide steps between them bedwards , his mighty head sunk on his lifted shoulder
0	nothing worth listening to , herr settembrini
0	they knew that in the last day all our beloved gone before us to god will come with song and salvation to fetch us home
0	this is what i mean by the necessity for the terror
0	i refer , so far as the church is concerned , to the love-feast , the sacramental enjoyment of body and blood ; as for the lodge—
0	our prison , so wide and yet so narrow , so suffocatingly full of foul air , will some day open
0	they are a body of troops calculated as sufficient , even after great losses , to attack and carry a position and greet their triumph with a thousand-voiced huzza—not counting the stragglers that fall out by the way
0	often and often i thought of it , when the jacobin-puritan vir tue jargon , which four years long had disputed the , var propa- ganda of the agreed peace , became the current language of vic- tory
0	he sat in his place , cold , remote , and lofty , and answered the information that the carriage would be around at once by saying scornfully , in a voice that trembled more with bitter-ness than age : then the mob permits me to go home ?
0	as his master did not move or turn round or make any sign , the hump-backed apprentice shifted from one foot to the other , then made his outlandish scrape again and went down the back stairs
0	he would laugh at people who are much greater and better , and—more hu—man than himself and his—his ami bavard de la méditerranée , son maître et grand parleur— put together
0	i never have felt myself as firm as a rock , and my parents , both of them , dying so young—for i have been doubly orphaned from youth up , you know— herr settembrini described a single gesture , with head , hand , and shoulders
0	somebody , of course , ought to say : fire !
0	i believe i still do
0	last night there had been pineapple punch , and they had made part of a happy family circle
0	and with their united powers they knew hovv to set science in a light of such comic impotence that even the beautiful princes , in their childlike way , were bril- liantly entertained
0	this principle i intend to keep sacred , now as in the past , though one is sometimes forced to entertain a doubt , on con-templating the operations of people who seem to get on better without it
0	i ’ ve even thrown in a portrait or so
0	tell me , could i ?
0	he is a patriot , you must know , a democratic patriot
0	he said he found hans castorp looking very fit indeed , thanks to a stay that had been so much longer than anyone anticipated , and this being the case he supposed his nephew would travel down with him when he left
0	karen karstedt was not yet so far on as to display the self-deception that marks the last stage
0	he looked down at the floor , and spoke in a voice devoid of expression
0	well , and i assure you that the count altered his tune at once
0	i have read with pleasure the news of your meeting with christian in amsterdam
0	then josephus would be restored to his proper form and return to his kingdom , in which kai and hanno would be appointed to high offices
0	i was thinking of the hard times we were having
0	yes , those spirit lips , so close to her ear that they were like a caress , and tickled a little , making her smile , had whispered her what to do
0	all this was an exquisite activity to hans castorp ; he enjoyed the fragrant breath of the plants ; the soft warmth of the shop , after the cold outside , made his eyes fill with tears
0	tragic joy , triumphant sadness that was what made our ancestors leap and exult around the leaping flames : they did so as an act of homage to the madness of the circle , to an eternity without duration , in which everything recurs—in sheer despair , if you like
0	in short , i feel a sense of oppression—and for some reason or other , my cigar this morning hasn ’ t the right taste , something that as good as never happens to me , or only when i am seriously upset—and to-day it is like leather
0	its ambition is to make one believe that it is not made , but born , like pallas athene in full fig and embossed armonr from jupiter 's head
0	quant à moi , tu sais , j ’ aime la liberté avant tout et notamment celle de choisir mon domicile
0	well , give us your report card , the hofrat answered to joachim ’ s apologies , and took the fever chart out of his hand
0	clarissa hoped to succeed
0	but his body would have it otherwise
0	he felt a relief , which however bore within it the seeds of fresh disquiet , when he saw that hans castorp paid no heed , though he must have noticed the incident , but passed it over with an unconcern which was not so much tact , consideration , or courtesy , as it was the purest indifference , an uncanny invulnerability or complaisance , as though he had long ceased to notice or to feel surprise at such occurrences
0	i could call him out here no , you are right , jean ; it is better to wait , said madame buddenbrook
0	have i ever hated life -- pure , strong , relentless life ?
0	till , not to say on a lie , and were not only more and more challenged from
0	on the other hand he sketched for us the enchanting pleasure which even the visual picture of a score by mozart afforded to the practised eye ; the clarity of the texture , the beautiful disposition of the instrumen- tal groups , the ingenious and varied writing of the melodic line
0	it finished off with whist and music
0	now he has commanded his soldiery to drown in a sea of blood the attack on berlin and to shoot every officer who speaks of sur- render
0	he permitted only codeine
0	he asked dr krokowski
0	i was detained by business
0	the column was perceptibly lengthened ; it stood several of the black strokes above normal
0	i had been playing this afternoon , and felt a little queer
0	in speaking of rudolf 's inconstant nature - as one has to speak of it - one runs a risk of saying too much
0	i caught him at all that by mere chance , and even then he spoke mockingly of them before he made the above admissions
0	from him they learned the reason why the child 's skin was so pale and his strength so inadequate
0	she turned on him a pair of great distressed eyes , which slowly filled with tears as she said softly : no , morten , you should not think that of me -- you must not think that of me
0	peeperkorn ’ s manner was courtesy itself
0	it ’ s a fact—it is very lively !
0	then , with a voice that sounded as though he had just burnt his throat with hot grog , i am a simple sort of a man , and do not know much about landlubber 's tricks and skin games ; but if you mean , maybe , that -- well , sir , you can just set it down right away that you have got on the wrong tack , and are making a pretty bad miscalculation about my fatherly hopes
0	at length the little man uttered the single word : 'nuft
0	the consul 's wife smiled , well pleased
0	never once was the departed one shown looking directly ahead of her toward the observer
0	good god , it was the heart , it was joachim ’ s honour-loving heart , that hans castorp saw !
0	i flatter myself that in my dealings with these gentry i have not usually made the impression of a morally in-ferior exploiter ; to tell the truth , the boot has sometimes been on the other foot -- i have run across men who were far less scrupulous than i am !
0	he talks so , somehow
0	thus was the reluctant debtor outwitted , and at least this phase of the matter settled
0	look cut : he will flirt with you
0	when he turned round again , his sun-tanned visage showed an even darker shade
0	i still envy rudiger for having been the first to read aloud this tale to our friend , in the abbot 's room ; although i confess that if it had been myself the effect might not have been the same
0	you do not need to worry , tony , my child , she would say
0	the frau consul smiled forbearingly
0	her peevish face looked scarlet above her neck-ruche , and tiny purple veins showed in the cheeks
0	how well you do that !
0	she thus celebrates , he said , her cosmic aptitude for allegory ; for those elements were , as it were , the first and simplest materials of the world , a parallelism of which a phi- losophizing artist of a day not long gone by - it was wagner again of whom he spoke - had shrewdly , perhaps with somewhat too mechanical , too ingenious cleverness , made use , in that in his cosmogonic myth of the ring he made the basic elements of music one with those of the world
0	he , the infallible parent , had put the decision into her hands : he had confessed , almost humbly , to a sense of guilt
0	this house is a pearl , certainly a pearl -- ' if you can compare anything so large wilh anything so small , ha , ha !
0	his good-natured moustaches worked violently up and down
0	his wife , born langhals , wielded her lorgnon ; and , as usual , her hair stood up untidily all over her head
0	he shrieked , and stepped away from me again as though back to the cross
0	you see , i am spreading out my magic cloak
0	it was cer- tainly an element of our public life in the first half of the decade
0	the ladies were madame chauchat and marusja
0	then why should my heart be pounding like this ?
0	after the consul had received congratulatory handshakes on his success , he went up to his father-in-law
0	and that other , perhaps more intense , but strangely inarticulate language , that of tones - if one nay so designate music - does not seem to me to be included in the pedagogic- humanistic sphere , although i well know that in greel { education and altogether in the public life of the polis it played an ancillary role
0	he walked on his left side expressly ; and when there came a little rise to surmount , would help his cousin , who had grown by now unsteady on his feet ; would put his arm across his shoulder ; overcoming his shyness , would even leave it there a while , until joachim shook it off pettishly and said : don ’ t , it looks silly—as if we were drunk , coming along like that
0	speaking generally , it was altogether possible that her relations with the russian visitor had a disinterested and harmless character
0	hence the phrase perinde ac si cadaver , scoffed settembrini
0	i go into it in these pages because what happened did to some extent touch the life and destiny of my hero , adrian lever- klihn ; yes , in one of them , to my actual knowledge , he was in- volved and active in an obscure and fatal 'way
0	but i wanted to say something else : i wanted to point out the singular interchange which often takes place between the voices and the orchestra
0	his dis- like of his own very germanness ( it was that , indeed , which drew him to the anglicist and anglolnaniac schildknapp ) took the two disparate forms of a cocoonlike withdrawal from the world and an inward need of world-wideness
0	she turned to hans castorp
0	the music -- it was beginning again ; an idiotic racket , meant to be a galop , with the drum and cymbals marking a rhythm in which the other instruments all joined either ahead yf or behind time ; a naive , insistent , intolerable hullabaloo of snarling , crashing , and feebly piping noises , punctuated by the silly tootling of the piccolo
0	but between whiles he was silent ; we shall not say self-absorbed , for his attention was presumably directed outwards , though upon a single point
0	he responded little else than certainly , of course to the doctor ’ s blithe and hearty greeting , and was relieved when his nephew left him , passing by the balcony from joachim ’ s room to his own , after bidding him good-night and saying he would fetch him for eight o ’ clock breakfast
0	she stood there , in her paper cap , and looked him up and down , with a smile that betrayed no trace of pity , nor any concern for the ravages written on his brow
0	and the consul did feel the cold , felt it persistently , though his head was hot
0	then the spasm would relax in a merry , apologetic smile and things would run on again in almost uncanny fluency , for a while
0	one simply must draw the line somewhere !
0	up on the schatzalp there is a man , a greek peasant , an agent had him sent here from arcadia , he has galloping consumption , there isn ’ t the dimmest hope for him
0	after which tony 's husband , like most of the friends whom he met around the table in the hofbrau house , to play cards and drink his regular three litres of beer , limited his activities to the raising of rents in his capacity of landlord , and to an un-disturbed cutting of coupons
0	sometimes he entertained the company , not too badly , with his cello , accompanied by his wife , who came from germany and had once been a singer
0	his death agony was sore , for unlike his son , hans lorenz castorp had been a man of tough constitution , and firmly rooted in life
0	worse than i am -- come , that 's too much !
0	she would have a good home , where she could bathe and be in the fresh air and get clear in her mind
0	not that i wasn ’ t in a funk as well , because i was—i was just one large blue funk all over
0	this was now in its sixth year , and gradually coming to be no longer so much a cure as a fixed condition of existence , a residence for life in rarefied atmosphere , coloured by some activity as latin master in the davos gymnasium for slightly tubercular boys
0	ida sat down beside her , with her needle and the stocking drawn over the darner again in her hand , and bent over them the smooth grey head and the indefatigable bright brown eyes , do you think he is going to propose to-morrow ?
0	i am sick of it , that 's all
0	she was leaning back in her chair , with drooping wrists and finger-tips poised on the table-edge , her head bent on one shoulder , her eyebrows raised , her little mouth drawn down so that it looked even smaller , with a tiny smile that had something both silly and sly about it , and gazing into space with vacant , childlike blue eyes
0	loudly , behind his brother 's back he censured this pro- vocative licence and would not be talked round by his sister 's soothing words , to the effect that the advocate was a full-blooded man , in danger of a heat stroke , which made light clothing a necessity to him
0	but for the sake of her bourgeois security she took part in the festivities of a community which was just one great art- society , and this it was emperilled the security she sought
0	when he told his partner of the poppt-nrade matter , herr marcus had for the first time in his life been angry with him , and had washed his hands of the whole affair
0	say , rather , to the context
0	he spoke with enthusiasm of the theme , which gave opportunity to set the lout and natural alongside the conic sublime and make both ridiculous in each oter
0	they were so many and moved so rapidly that the changeful , flickering light on the staircase came in time to hurt the eyes
0	anyhow the occasion served to inform us , to our mo mentary surprise , that rudi , in his earlier life , had had an opera tion that cost him one of his kidneys
0	the senator measured the room throughout its length , and then stood at one of the windows and looked down into the garden
0	that it approaches , that it long since became inevitable : of that i can not believe anybody still cherishes the smallest doubt
0	in the way he had when some point of view was complete
0	/ take it too seriously ?
0	in such remarks there was always as much contempt as envy
0	thomas , my son , come here a minute , said johann bud-denbrook , taking his great bunch of keys from his trousers pocket
0	fetch your rescuer an ice and engage her for the next waltz !
0	tilda is already busy in the kitchen , went on the consul , and i should have been long since at work myself , if your mother and i had not been speaking seriously about a mat-ter that concerns our little daughter
0	then the bell rang , and they went up
0	our young people passed through the entrance and the crowd that , seated in ascending tiers , surrounded the course on three sides ; they found places for themselves , and sat down to look on
0	they played a movement of haydn , some pages of mozart , a sonata of beethoven
0	he would ask , the glasses of his spectacles flashing
0	phidias , or that other chap with the mosaic ending to his name , would have stuck up their noses at her style of physiognomy—hullo , where are you going with the ham ?
0	he even drew upon himself a rebuke from settembrini , for saying he thought the current conception in error which would have it that a philosophical credulity and belief that all is for the best is the mark of a sound nature , as pessimism and cynicism are of morbidity
0	chest trouble is the last thing one would accuse her of
0	in short , the woman had become deeply offensive to me after i knew and saw what she let herself in for
0	she leaned back , crossed one leg lightly over the other , and stared into space
0	mankind will soon perceive that it is not the task of true science to run after godless understanding ; but to reject utterly all that is harmful , yes , even all that ideally speaking is without significance , in favour of instinct , measure , choice
0	so is he growing up -- but jean !
0	you ca not stand it , you give way
0	not in cocaine , not in opium , not in vice as such does the viciousness lie
0	the gentleman , with a movement of decision , laid his hat and stick on the lid of the harmonium
0	but hans castorp good-naturedly took cognizance of settembrini ’ s point of view and tested by it his own inner experiences ; from which self-examination it principally appeared that the waking man has an advantage over the sleeping and dreaming one
0	he had a voice pure as a bell , that went straight to the heart
0	above are the bed , bath , and dressing-rooms and the servants ' quarters
0	sometimes , in those four years , he sat with me in the evening and read the paper
0	did kurz , the merchant , in bakers ' alley , who gets three or four votes at every election , will sit quaking at home on the fatal day , and listen to the shouting , but he will not be elected this time either
0	hans castorp kept his eye on it as he walked up and down waiting for his cousin
0	yes , it was high time you came home ; the climate over there would have killed you in the end
0	last night , between half past nine and ten , i was taking a little exercise in the garden ; i looked up at the row of balconies ; there was your light gleaming through the dark ; you were performing your cure , led by the dictates of duty and reason
0	and though he did not spare herr settembrini the pain of finding naphta ’ s gibes worth hearing , he had to admit that these were latterly going beyond all bounds and often enough overstepping the border-line of mental sanity
0	on the outside of it was written , in an oval border surrounded by red flowers and a profusion of gilt flourishes : on the occasion of my friendly participation in a delightful house-warming party given by the buddenbrook family
0	but here it became clear that his own powers would never take him over the stretch between him and the berghof ; and accordingly , as there was no tram and he saw no carriages for hire , he hailed a driver going toward the dorf with a load of empty boxes and asked permission to climb into his wagon
0	but after pronouncing this aesthetic judgment he lay silent in his deck-chair , not thinking of anything more suitable to sing in its place
0	fie set two poems by i ( eats , ode to a nightingale and the shorter ode on i\lelancholy with a string-quartet acconlpaniment , which indeed left far behind and below it the traditional conception of an accompaniment
0	that should have been a kind of reassurance to me ; indeed , it was that , for it went against me to imagine him as a candidate for the office of preacher or pastor , or even as councillor of the con- sistory or other high office
0	what language do you speak ?
0	indeed , i had scarcely set my pen in motion when there escaped it a word which privately gave me a certain embarrassment
0	for the whole form was aware that he gave way to the feeling of the moment , whatever that might happen to be , with-out the slightest restraint
0	do i want to kill her ?
0	have a good time—morning— morning— krokowski joined him as he sailed off down the hall , swinging his arms palms backward , directing to right and left the question about sleeping well , which was answered on all sides in the affirmative
0	and what did i tell you ?
0	there is at bottom only one prob- lem in the world , and this is its name
0	great physical changes had taken place since the mother ’ s coming
0	you mean he will refuse on account of the seventeen thou-sand marks current
0	if certain insinuations on herr settembrini ’ s part had angered hans castorp , the annoyance was quite unjustified , as also his feeling that the schoolmaster had been spying on him
0	ha ha , ha ha !
0	i implore you again : think what you are doing
0	i take it , he responded , that you use the word not as a com- pliment , but in a descriptive and critical way , as you should
0	it is , it is—engineer , said herr settembrini in a low voice , coming close to the young man as he addressed him , don ’ t you know there is something frightful in the way you fling the months about ?
0	so far as i am concerned , you can go
0	fie could say of a man nothing worse than that he thought and taught like a flatulent furriner
0	it was thus very daring of settembrini , who surely must have more command of the language than anyone else , not only never to appear , but to refer to the entertainment in most disparaging terms
0	assument pennas ut aqailæ ’ — voltaire himself approved of a war for civilization , and advised frederick to fight turkey
0	as for me , i felt sure that the peculiar tension between i { retsch- mar and adrian 's mother had reference to adrian ; i divined this because in the silent struggle that went on i stood in my own feeling between the two parties , inclining now to the one and now to the other
0	what had she meant by her look ?
0	in three or four months you ought to be as fit as a fiddle
0	i do not feel in the least like joking , adri - because in the first place it goes to my heart and makes me feel solemn , the role you assign to me in your life , and even before posterity
0	frau permaneder paused in the midst of her business , like one paralyzed
0	has he really insulted me ?
0	but hans castorp sensed rather than saw this , owing to the distance
0	i did so with pedagogic restraint , with a view to reducing the situation to the everyday , and determined not to be sentimental
0	the surface of the lying snow began to thaw , grew soft and porous
0	glad you think it ’ s like her
0	the tracl { round the sphere , of which there had been talk in those tor- turingly clever conversations at kridwiss 's , this track , on which regress and progress , the old and the new , past and future , be- came one - i saw it all realized here , in a regression full of mod- ern novelty , going back beyond bach 's and handel 's harmonic art to the remoter past of true polyphony
0	and if i don ’ t arrive , it will be some time before they notice it , you may be sure of that
0	it made a great impression on me , to see him fresh from such exacting and splendid work , in which he is so much the master
0	it ’ s plain why you never became a priest , joli jésuite à la petite tache humide !
0	dr krokowski greeted the new inmate with a jovial and robust heartiness , as who should say that with him all formality was superfluous , and only jocund mutual confidence in place
0	a loose bodice of soft dark silk , with satin rc-vcrs and flat lace epaulettes , gave her pretty bosom an enchanting look of softness and fulness
0	he : what , ne'er a word but mum ?
0	had not a researcher once , audaciously fanciful , referred to the beasts of the milky way , cosmic monsters whose flesh , bone , and brain were built up out of solar systems ?
0	my cousin and i—
0	he beheld the image of life in flower , its structure , its flesh-borne loveliness
0	but life has destroyed my faith in men
0	he had always been subject to feverish catarrh , and one day he actually spat blood ; whereupon he had been rushed off to davos , heels over head , to his great distress and affliction , for he had just then arrived within sight of the goal of all his hopes
0	nobody knew it this morning
0	yet the final result of his considerations was the desire to take his daugh-ter and her child home with him and let driinlich go his own way
0	overnight the guest has become the comrade
0	it may be that these grotesque memories are unworthy of in- clusion here - : am inclined to believe it
0	wait , said hans castorp
0	her second dowry , the eighteen thousand thaler so magnanimously returned by herr permaneder , lay waiting for erica ; and directly frau antonie 's practiced glanre marked the budding tenderness between her daughter and the director , she began to trouble heaven with a prayer that herr weinschenk might be led to visit them
0	it ’ s incredible—who would have believed it ?
0	they reached the courtyard and began to stroll up and down across the wet red tiles , among school companions of all ages and sizes
0	you are developing a theology there , in which you ascribe to man a highly honourable , if perhaps rather a one-sided religious function
0	but the classic adage : look before you leap h
0	yes , she found words for everything ; she gave full expression to all the accumulated disgust of her munich years
0	how did we come to speak of her ? —yes , herr hofrat , i remember as thought it was yesterday , how we met you in the garden , or , rather , you met us , for we were sitting on a bench—i could show you the very bench , to-day , that we were sitting on—we were sitting and smoking
0	hans castorp grieved for his cousin , reading in his eyes his pain at the approaching parting
0	in his two-fold guise
0	the senator stopped mechanically in his walk , asked mechanically about the concert and the spanish virtuoso , and said he was ready to go to bed
0	before the tribunal of reason , conscience , and common sense it could make no claims to be heard ; principally , of course , because when all was said and done , frau chauchat was an ailing woman , feeble , fevered , and tainted within ; her physical condition had much to do with the questionable life she led , as also with hans castorp ’ s instinctive reservations
0	for a chord combination that kretschmar rejected at first sight as being doubt- ful and awkward finally seemed to him more characteristic than what he himself had in mind , and at the next meeting he declared that he would like to take over adrian 's idea
0	our ecclesiastic here will tell you that the world of the medio evo is not complete when franciscan mysticism is not counterbalanced by the opposite pole of thomistic cognition
0	we are not satisfied wi ' things as they be
0	it was mid-april , two and a half years later
0	elly , it seemed , in her trance had promised to materialize the spirit of any departed person the circle chose
0	herr wiedemann , bleeding and frothing , his face brutish with rage , displayed a phenomenon hans castorp had never before seen and had always supposed a figure of speech : his hair stood on end
0	fie pointed out to him a middle part that came to nothing , a bass that did not move
0	i feel like that too
0	we shall see that no dressing-gown and no silver bread-basket gets away
0	i think it would be better to put off the party
0	it was a lusty , not too gentle race , that of these comrades of hanno and kai among whom they walked up and down
0	it scarcely needs saying that our good-bye was outwardly cool and reserved
0	for individualism belonged , singly and solely , in the realm of the religious and mystical , in the so-called morally chaotic all
0	but he ap-peared at the next children 's day , which took place at the kr�s ' , outside the castle gate
0	he said there 's foul work in- stead of there 's something wrong
0	well , isn ’ t it a pleasure resort , then ?
0	i love to go out there in the summer and walk in the undergrowth ; it would quite spoil the place to trim and prune its free natural beauty
0	he submitted some of them forthwith : the ever-present possibility that justice might err and judicial murder be committed ; the hope of reformation , which it was never possible to disregard ; the biblical injunction vengeance is mine
0	this man was so nervous that he jumped every time he heard a sudden noise behind him ; and tony delighted in making him jump every time she set eyes on him
0	the signature is an initial , that of the family nalne : the l , not the a
0	but when the day comes , you will be as moved as all the rest of us
0	experience has forced ne to ponder this problem so anxiously , so urgently , that at tilnes , frightful to say , it has seemed to me that i should be driven beyond my proper and becoming level of thought , and myself experience an impure heightening of my natural gifts
0	and now he strongly reminded me of the elder leverktihn 's musing mania for speculating the elements
0	how often in my strained observation of adrian 's ac- tivity i was forced to remember the early impressions we boys had got from that voluble stutterer , his teacher , with his antithe- sis of harmonic subjectivity and polyphonic objectivity !
0	ladies and gentlemen , the dutchman said , and lifted his sea-captain ’ s hand , with its nails like lance-heads , in entreaty and monition
0	so they got me in at last
0	i am no swell -- i do not care about scraping money to-gether
0	the furniture -- you have taken everything into consideration of course -- the things that belong to us , i mean to erica and me and the little one , they remain here with us ?
0	he had a cigarette in his mouth , and his hands in his trouser pockets ; and stood so to watch the lively little old russian lady , as she , with her lean grand-niece and two other ladies , took their seats in a carriage
0	the consul stared at her amazed
0	or more fun to sell this than groceries
0	i\ille choses a madame schwei-ge-still
0	only the non-fictional is still permissible , the unplayed , the un- disguised and untransfigured expression of suffering in its actual moment its impotence and extremity are so ingrained that no seeming play with them is any'lenger allowed
0	this demand was entirely foreign to the young man ’ s nature—so much so that he himself was disagreeably impressed as he heard himself make it
0	johann conrad beissel had been born of very poor parents at eberbach in the palatinate and early orphaned
0	you say that so ironically—with the right kind of irony , of course , that can not for a moment be misunderstood , the direct and classic device of oratory—you see , i remember the things you say
0	) ; with good cheer drank a glass of rosso ( bevi , bevi ! )
0	in this wise the duration of the main rest period was finally reduced to no more than an hour ; and even this hour was lopped off at its latter end , elided , as it were
0	ll they meant was : sehen sie dasl and he looked just like them
0	surely , surely , hans castorp said
0	a young female , lying outstretched , drawing with one hand her flowered robe high between her breasts , reached with the other in the air after a twig bearing fruit and leaves , which a second , a slender-hipped creature , erect at her head , was playfully withholding
0	every vacant seat in the senate must , according to the constitution , be filled within four weeks
0	such a result was as far as possible from frau ziemssen ’ s intention
0	the family likenesses wrre abundantly clear , even now
0	they passed the avenue that led id the little town , and rolled along thp front
0	he is asleep , she said
0	yes , he knew it was largely the promptings of conscience to which he hearkened ; to be precise , the promptings of a conscience not altogether easy—as he sat listening to the italian , one leg crossed over the other , drawing at his maria mancini ; or when the three of them climbed the hill from the english quarter
0	hans castorp was ready , now as ever , of his own free will to lend an ear to settembrini ’ s teachings , and by way of experiment to be influenced by them
0	he had carefully avoided unfavourable conditions of atmospheric pressure , and left it to uncle james to stultify himself ; yet an apoplexy carried him off after all ; and a telegram , couched in brief but feeling terms—feeling more for the departed than for the recipient of the wire—was one day brought to hans castorp where he lay in his excellent chair
0	her large mouth drooped tragically at one corner
0	he said softly : four years -- tony 's tears ceased suddenly
0	christian , sitting a little to one side , conned the second oration of cicero against catiline
0	but i quickly forgave him as we went on , and i heard the llving musical diction given to the parable in the purgatorio of the man who carries a light on his back at night , which does not light him but lights up the path of those coming after
0	they went at once
0	and when i twned round : i find , he said , that it is not to be
0	now he came lounging through the garden , wearing a check tail-coat , instead of his smock , and his stiff hat on the back of his head
0	thus he had grown used to his silent and remote relation to pribislav hippe , and considered it a regular feature of his life ; loved the emotions it brought in its train , the suspense as to whether he was likely to meet him that day , whether pribislav would pass close by him , even look at him ; loved the subtle and wordless satisfaction imparted by his secret , loved even the disappointments inseparable from it—the greatest of which was pribislav ’ s absence from school
0	this was on account of the mi- graine , which from then on hindered him in the little preparation he had to do
0	i did not fail , then , in friendly good will , even though i was prevented by nature from understanding in the sense of fellow- feeling
0	more than i ever was in all my life !
0	but if he shudders when he hears life 's voice , if the memory of that vanished scene and the sound of that lusty summons make him shake his head , make him put out his hand to ward it off as he flies forward in the way of escape that has opened to him -- then it is clear that the patient will die
0	hans castorp , like so many others , experienced it—always with drawn and frowning brows , for this particular form of debauch is never a merry one
0	joachim knew it already : it had been in full blast when he arrived the year before—but hans castorp rather dreaded it , however well he felt himself equipped
0	would you , as my friend , want me to spend the rest of my life in this cloister ?
0	but if , he sang , god should call him to himself , then would he look down protectingly on thee—meaning the singer ’ s sister , as hans castorp was perfectly aware , yet the word thrilled him to the depths , and his emotion prolonged itself as the hero sang , to a mighty choral accompaniment :
0	gerda had grown tall and splendid
0	that was the way his destiny was to be ful-filled he acted under the pressure of inexorable ne-cessity
0	after a while he added : ai though people ever heard what had been heard then !
0	from the win- terreise , with the perfectly heart-breaking stanza beginning : hab ' ja doch nichts begangen dass ich menschen sollte scheu ' n
0	then it is well at least if the master guesses and un- derstands the hidden leanings of the youth ; he may even be ironic on the score of them if he takes care not to stand in the way of their development
0	already the last week in july
0	he went on to speak of the crows ’ -eye tree of the coromandel coast , from the orange-yellow berries of which—the crows ’ eyes—was extracted the most powerful alkaloid of all , strychnine
0	but in fact , the torture was an invention of the human reason
0	hans castorp waited , blinking , his lungs distended
0	one ends , i said undeterred , by denying the works of god ; one becomes the advocate of nothing
0	he had , as he spoke , the feeling of a man who finds himself slipping , but for the moment contrives to keep his feet
0	presently dr blumenkohl came back in the same unobtrusive way , took his place , and went on eating
0	looking at her he could quite credit the malapropisms joachim told of
0	he attended one of dr krokowski ’ s conférences—that he should stop away was unthinkable
0	the child is not to have a governess
0	when one of the pupils played a prank , she would laugh so heartily that she nearly cried , and then sesemi would rap on the table and call out nelly !
0	a bell rang in the midst of the music , and the crowd would burst out now and again with shouts of encouragement and applause
0	know , then , said he , at the table , ye good and godly folk ( he said god and goodly ) , with your ndest sins and resting in goodes godness , for i have suppressed it so long in ide but will no longer hide it , that already since ill ) ' nventy-first year i am wedded to satan and with due knowing of peril , out of , , , ,ell
0	he explained certain de-tails of the procedure -- the examination of witnesses had now been interrupted by the christmas recess -- condemned the very obvious bias of the president , dr philander , and poured scorn on the attitude which the public prosecutor , dr hagenstriim , thought it proper to assume toward himself and the witnesses for the defence
0	i know nothing more stirring than the end , where it is as though there were tongues of flame from all four sides , a combination of runs and trills which gives the im- pression of a whole orchestra
0	that is an answer , at least , he said , turning to naphta again
0	at the door of the salnn he paused a moment for a glance into the mirror to order his cravat , and to refresh himself with a whiff of the eau-de-cologne on his handkerchief
0	said clara , looking out of the window and into the gossip 's glass
0	i leave it an open question whether dr edelmann himself , or only that associate editor of the anbruch who was a countryman of hers , could boast of her acquaintance
0	if they understood him aright , he considered the use of tobacco one of those over-refined enjoyments the cultivation of which robbed of their majesty the simpler pleasures of life—those gifts and claims to which our power of feeling was even at best scarcely equal
0	and he had favourites in his treasure-house , certain vocal and instrumental numbers which he never tired of hearing
0	but irony that is not for a moment equivocal ’ —what kind of irony would that be , i should like to ask , if i may make so bold as to put in my oar ?
0	we must wait and see what comes of it
0	and he ran the edge of his hand lightly over the bare neck and shoulders , the skin of which , especially by contrast with the exaggerated red of the face , was very white , as though seldom exposed
0	but no one gave the signal
0	death and love—no , i can not make a poem of them , they don ’ t go together
0	sorenson expressed it : she has a certain something about her !
0	thomas buddenbrook had played now and then through-out his life with an inclination to catholicism
0	and anyhow , you will want money sent
0	and then she told her story
0	and listened to the talk about weddings and trousseaux and bridal journeys
0	not only that he repeatedly went too far in his frankness about his relations with inez - but also he went too far in another direction , culpably and impishly too far , betrayed by the darkness , i might say , if the notion of any betrayal is in place and one ought not to speak instead of an impudent intru- sion of familiarity upon solitude
0	how is it possible ?
0	you have spoken to your pupils here of the bloody deeds of the church , her chastisements and her intolerance ; very foolishly so , for it stands to reason that the zeal of the godly can not be pacifistic in character—gregory himself said : cursed be the man who holds back his sword from the shedding of blood
0	he might have taken the large bronze plaque that stood on the etagere , but he seized instead a thin painted vase with flowers that stood next it , and threw it on the ground so that it smashed into a thousand bits
0	it went against his grain to eat butter served in the piece instead of in little fluted balls
0	the usual group of spectators stood about : frau iltis with her steriletto , the ivory levi , the inordinate popoff and his wife
0	and this is our son , he said
0	she said it to institoris , too , the suitor , when he behaved with something less than alacrity in his gallantries , or was slo , v in the uptake
0	what now happens to this mild utterance , rhythmically , harmonically , contrapuntally , to this pen- sive , subdued formulation , with what its master blesses and to what condemns it , into what black nights and dazzling flashes , crystal spheres wherein coldness and heat , repose and ecstasy are one and the same , he flings it down and lifts it up , all that one may well call vast , strange , extravagantly magnificent , without thereby giving it a name , because it is quite truly nameless ; and with la- bouring hands l { retschmar played us all those enormous transfor- mations , singing at the same time with the greatest violence : dim-dada !
0	and the frau consul could not resist stretching out her hand to their guest with her sweeping gesture , palm upward , while the bracelets gave a little jingle
0	it is coming out
0	as he finished , the plettenpudding was nearly consumed , and the malmsey nearing its end ; and then , to a universal , long-drawn ah-h !
0	he went with his cousin , rather bent and stiff in the knees , like a man bowed to the earth with fatigue
0	the longer the less 'till you be able and willing to let your- self in for contritio , sithence the extravagant life you will lead is a great indulgence , out of the which a man does not so simply find the way back into the good safe average
0	i should lose half the money i put into it
0	much in love with everything - just everything - made of notes not to burn to introduce to a pupil who knew how to listen as adrian did this world of shapes and figures , inexhaustibly rich in styles , national characteristics , traditional values , and charms of personality , historic and individual variations of the ideal beauty
0	they looked , most of them , like northerners , there might be hamburgers among them ; and hans castorp felt very shy of meeting his fellow townsmen
0	his father was a literary man too , you know , and , i believe , his grandfather
0	yes , said broker gratjens , it 's sad , when you think of the madness that led to their ruin
0	hans castorp and joachim ziemssen thanked him most warmly for all he had said , and mounted the berghof steps , while herr settembrini betook himself once more to his humanistic writing-desk , in the storey above naphta ’ s silken cell
0	' a kind papa , a worthy man
0	we knew nothing precise about what was occupying him , now that that music of the cosmos had appeared in print from schott 's sons in \ainz , under the same arrangerrlents as the brentano songs
0	he was as frightful in his smiles as in his anger
0	very good , very good indeed
0	you have waited this long
0	we say of time that it passes
0	but ferge , as second , and the neutral hans castorp , were beside themselves , and the latter fell heavily upon the wretched wehsal
0	when he went shopping with a lady he might point to something and say : well , i would not spend any money on that
0	you would always rather just have me bury myself out here , so i should never see a living soul
0	it fell silently , through air that was moderately cold , perhaps ten to fifteen degrees of frost
0	and on all these lying masses more snow fell , day in , day out
0	how does it depress you ?
0	hermann hagenstrbm was not the man to vote in the assembly for the application of large sums of money to preserve and restore the town 's mediaeval monuments
0	they will clutch their children to them when she approaches , to save them from the evil eye
0	ideas , my friend , are a bad lot , they have hot cheeks , they make your own burn too , in none too lovesome a way
0	and now at last , at last , he was off for the flat-land , for home and his regiment !
0	after that , settembrini took the floor—and well he knew how to avail himself of it
0	of these earlier owners , who died at about this time , i have little memory
0	he hissed when he talked , but his manners were cold and businesslike , and nothing betrayed the emotions of his soul
0	i have the honour , ma dame
0	the uncanny air of futility , or even a sort of sinister crackbrainedness , which hung about it was due to the addled fanaticism with which the former artist pursued and supported an economic idea , about which he was obviously so little serious that he made not the smallest effort to put it into execution
0	despite my dissimilar feelings i could but grant her a cultural sympathy
0	in the place where the four voices of the altar order the letting loose of the four avenging angels , who mow down rider and steed , emperor and pope , and a third of mankind , how terrifying is the effect of the trombone glissandos which here represent the theme !
0	her husband the brewer purported to have profited personally by a perusal , but regretted that his wife should have taken up that sort of thing , because such reading spoiled the women and gave them immodest ideas
0	i see i shall have to put on thinner clothes
0	in reality it had no end , it went on deep into the night , on and on , with bipolar position and historically conscious analysis , with extra-temporal qualities , ontological natural- ism , logical dialectic , and practical dialectic : painstaking , shoreless , learned , tailing off into nothing - that is , into slumber , to which our leader baworinski recommended us , for in the morning - as it already almost was - we should be due for an early start
0	we must repeat that , as for us , we have been speaking only of the lawful licence of a holiday , of fantasies born of leisure , of which the wellconducted mind wearies as quickly as a vigorous man does of lying in the warm sand
0	like the bathing cabins at the kur , and its walls were scribbled over with mottoes , initials , hearts and rhymes
0	the pity the well person felt for the sick—a pity that almost amounted to awe , because the well person could not imagine how he himself could possibly bear such suffering—was very greatly exaggerated
0	yes , they had all had to come : mbllendorpfs , kistcnmakcrs , langhals , dverdiecks -- before tony buddenbrook left her parental roof for ever , they had all gathered here , to offer her , despite driinlich , despite per-maneder , despite hugo weinschenk , their sympathy and condolences
0	a russian wave is rolling up ; it has taken vitebsk and now threatens l\linsk , the capital of white russia , after whose fall , so our whispering news service tells us , there will be no longer any stopping them in the east either
0	he was not too much inclined to believe implicitly all settembrini said ; he considered him too much of a windbag for that
0	but it is he
0	no , papa -- how can you say such a thing ?
0	his uniform-coat stood open over the usual white waistcoat
0	i every trace of care or disquiet had vanished'from madame buddenbrook 's face
0	now and then his mouth had to come to the rescue and fly open for a deep breath
0	i cite the propositions of molinos
0	what was monday to him ?
0	and i know father would not have done it -- cod forbid !
0	leverkghn , exchanged a word , vith anybody on the subject
0	but i observed that it made me unsteady , hare-brained , and in-capable -- and control , equilibrium , is , at least for me , the im-portant thing
0	yet obviously it came from an a , ved and astonished heart
0	heaven be praised , the corridors were empty
0	the bow-window was filled with palms
0	hans castorp , his head full of far-reaching associations , having to do for instance with the lame concierge , and that lady who had gone about for a week holding her ear , and need not have troubled herself , would have liked to put more questions
0	they all laughed again at this , through their noses , without a sign of feeling
0	sometimes it was the bark of the root that contained the principle , as was the case with a certain creeper growing in the malay archipelago , called strychnos tieuté , from which the natives prepared the upasradsha , by adding snake-venom
0	after everybody laughed , as if they agreed with me , there sat this hagenstrom and brought out with ridiculous solemnity , tor my part -- ' stu-pid fool !
0	the discovery had been made through the jealousy of another young girl , a friend of emmy , who had found her way to emmy ’ s room by the same route the greek had taken—namely , across the balconies ; and , distracted by her jealous rage , had made great outcry , so that everybody came running , and the scandal became known to the sparrows on the house-tops
0	probably she had risen too early
0	- the wine-merchant stood up and listened , with his mouth full of smoke
0	deaths in the family usually induce a religious mood
0	the people have certainly never done so
0	frau permaneder opened the door and called out good-bye !
0	pretty large concerns you occupy yourself with , nights when you do your cure
0	you do not want to know anything of each other
0	a quarter past two will pass for half past , will even pass for three , on the theory that it is already well on the way toward it
0	this treatment was directed towards the desperately violent acidity from which the patient suffered , and which klirbis , vas inclined to ascribe at least in part to nervous causes - that is , to a central influence , the brain , which here for the first time began to play a role in his diagnostic speculations
0	but our beis- sel is not after all any very striking example of it
0	none of that mattered now ; for death , with arbitrary and incomprehensible partiality , had singled him out , and taken him up , and given him an awe-some dignity and importance
0	there was a long pause
0	he could not have seen it , in fact ; everything swam before his eyes in the white mist , obliterating all contours
0	nay , more : the individual , of his own free will , would expose himself without a thought
0	yes , father leverkiihn was a dreamer and speculator , and i have already said that his taste for research - if one can speak of research instead of mere dreamy contemplation - always leaned in a certain direction - namely , the mystical or an intuitive half- mystical , into which , as it seems to me , human thinking in pur- suit of nature is almost of necessity led
0	her name is marusja , with your kind permission—it is the same as marie
0	frau stöhr , her broom under her arm and her hands on her knees , laughed like the charwoman she impersonated
0	and now this too -- this is the last straw -- the very last
0	my god , i was sick at my stomach
0	he drew out of the pocket of his jacket the end of a narrow gaily-striped rib-bun , and looked with a mixture of expectation and triumph into tony 's eyes
0	i , for one , have never in my life come across a perfectly healthy human being
0	the works of this preat roman orator make pretty difficult reading , eh ?
0	this was read by the munich dean on whom i called to get consent for the church service so intensely desired by the frau senator
0	the assembly listened respectfully
0	he was not here , he said , on their account ; he was not here to enjoy life , and to put up with his sojourn in the measure in which it furnished him agreeable change and diversion
0	dr anton cieszynski and stefan von rosinski , in connexion with the occurrences of the th of march , — , had after mature consideration come to the conclusion that the taking of the judicial steps which they recommended against m kasimir japoll for the calumny and detraction uttered against his wife jadwiga would afford him no satisfaction whatever , since
0	it is pleasanter out there
0	i had the enclosed letter and ring just now from griinlich , and my head aches fearfully from excitement
0	it was , he said , the most unstable , the most unreliable of man ’ s instincts , the most prone of its very essence to error and fatal perversion
0	let us assume that you spend another thirty francs for tips , if you are decent and like to have friendly faces about you
0	he watched his mother and herr pfu'hl with large quiet eyes ; and thus , so early , he became aware of music as an extraordinarily serious , important , and profound thing in life
0	oh , what a scare -- yes , tony said , she 's probably broken something again
0	they left ; hans castorp , going out behind joachim , looked over his shoulder
0	let us be accurate
0	hans castorp politely found that truly remarkable
0	he le- gitimacy of the state resided , he said , in its elevation , its sover- eignty , which thus existed independent of the valuations of indi- viduals , because it - very much in contrast to the shufhings of the contrat social- was there before the individual
0	gercla buddenbrook , frau permaneder , [ christian , and little johann sat under the big gas-lamp around the centre-table in the living-room , and worked industriously until far on into the evening
0	he played characteristic passages and a few complete scene se- quences : the first act , including the scene outside armado 's house , and several later numbers which he had partly anticipated : in particular biron 's monologues , which he had had especially in mind from the first , the one in verse at the end of the third act , as well as the prose one in the fourth : they have pitched a toil , i am toiling in a pitch - pitch that defiles ; which , while always preserving the atmosphere of the comic and grotesque , expresses musically still better than the first the deep and genuine despair of the young man over his surrender to the suspect black beauty , his raging abandonment of self-mockery : by the lord , this love is as mad as ajax ; it kills sheep ; it kills me , i a sheep : this partly because the swift-moving , unjointed , ejaculatory prose , with its many plays on words , inspired the composer to invent musical accents of quite peculiar fantasticality ; partly , also , because in music the repetition of the significant and already familiar , the suggestive or subtle invention , always makes the strongest and most speaking impression
0	you were making music
0	i don ’ t recall having tasted—oh , yes , once in my life i had pomegranate juice and soda ; it was too sweet
0	and more than that , it is profoundly contradictory that a man should have , as leverklihn did , some feeling for the human eye , which after all speaks only to the eye , and yet refuse to perceive the outer world through that organ
0	the standard is being lowered , he said
0	games were begun at two green extension-tables : at the one , dominoes ; at the other , bridge , and here only the young folk played , among them hermine kleefeld and herr albin
0	and what acoustic panic results from the repeated drum-glissandos , an effect made possible on the chro- matic or machine drum by changing the tuning to various pitches during the drum-roll
0	but he was delicate and nervous , suffered from his sympathetic nerve , in his solar plexus , from which so many anx- ieties and early fears of death proceed , and , vas an habitue of a sanatorium for the wealthy in l\eran
0	everything pattered , streamed , rushed , foamed
0	for there is no doubt that their triumph and the his- torical sanction to regulate this world according to their beastly will would have destroyed his life-work and his immortality
0	but what about that other kind of hubris , which perishes in a wanton trifling with the forces of unreason and hostility to the human race ?
0	dear , good nelly , what a child she is !
0	madame kethelsen now occupied the first storey of the house on the mill brink , and she herself the ground floor , and there they lived alone
0	for she looked at him , :vhile i was working myself up , as though she were listen- ing to him and not to me
0	he was a broad , stocky man with a red face , sea-blue eyes , and a bristling grizzled beard that ran fan-shaped from one ear to the other
0	it was done in front of that structure on the other side of which hofrat behrens had been standing when they entered
0	if the position had really been what he said , if it were true that the horrible thing was actually an invention of the human reason , that only showed how grievously she always needed sustaining and enlightening , and how little ground the instinct-worshippers had for their fear that things could ever be too much directed by reason on this earth !
0	he screamed , and began pounding with his fists on the table , till the dishes rang
0	we assume that a connexion subsists between the outer rind of the cerebrum and the vascular centre in the medulla
0	but for an artist nothing is easier , even if he is only standing in the vestibule to fame , i mean the sensational appeal
0	your cousin ’ s is a good and simple nature , most worthy of respect ; exposed to no intellectual perils , the sort that gives a schoolmaster not one anxious moment
0	and he looked sidelong at his cousin
0	i am not allowed , joachim answered
0	tony wept afresh ; and covering her eyes with both hands , in which she held the batiste handkerchief , she sobbed out : oh , what are you asking me , papa ?
0	and yet there is something else - some of us fear it at moments which seem to us criminal , but others quite frankly and steadily - something we fear more than german defeat , and that is german victory
0	here , i will give you a simple antiseptic—it may do you good , and she took a small packet out of the leather bag that hung from her girdle
0	he had a view of the square , the medixval city hall , the gothic marienkirche , whose domed towers were connected by a sort of bridge of sighs ; the separate red tower , a very re- markable structure , also in gothic style ; the statue of roland and the bronze statue of handel
0	horrible , he said suddenly , and a visible shudder ran over him as he got up
0	there is so much building , and the suburbs are spreading out , and we are able to have good streets and restore the old monuments out of our great period
0	he talks of youth con- descendingly too , as though he were not young himself ; as though he were incapable of including himself and fitting in ; as far as humility goes he knows very little about it
0	i hope you will enjoy it , he would finish in a dying voice , and quit the table , well knowing that joy would certainly not be their portion either
0	one day , after confirmation-class , i heard pastor prinpshpim tell somebody that one must just give me up , be-cause i romp of a derayed family
0	what i do is to prepare these pages for a time when the conditions for public interest vill be quite different , and certainly much more favour- able ; when curiosity about the details of so thrilling an existence , however well or ill presented , , viii be more eager and less fas- tidious
0	a tiny hole must be cut in it at once -- there was a peep-hole in the curtain at the theatre
0	in these forms , said the speaker , the subjective and the coventional assumed a new rela- tionship , conditioned by death
0	with his eyes red , his moustaches ruffled , his handkerchief in his hand , his coat wide open , hot and beside himself , he went out of the door and slammed it behind him
0	hans castorp hastened to do so , without looking round
0	lina , the maid-servant , came running through the hall and burst so suddenly into the room that ida jungmann called out sharply : i say , what do you mean -- ?
0	he has to content hirdself with deutsch-and that is a jewish nane , oh la , la
0	it was in high sum-
0	then thank ye kindly , and god be with ye , he said—the tears came to his eyes as he smiled and with that he would have been off , but instead sat suddenly down again with his hat and stick in his hand , being forced to the realization that his knees would not support him
0	do you still remember ?
0	our best respects to you , buddenbrook -- i repeat , our best respects !
0	there is no contradiction
0	but precisely about human- ity did schleppfuss speak , just that - of course in the sense of the classic centuries of belief on whose spiritual constitution he based his psychological discussion
0	all these raga-muffinly tricks tony buddenbrook was guilty of -- indeed , she seemed to perform them with the best conscience in the world
0	where are the young folk off to ?
0	even clara burst out laughing
0	i never can understand how anybody can not smoke—it deprives a man of the best part of life , so to speak—or at least of a first-class pleasure
0	the italian went on , without pausing for breath
0	the longest period of separation followed thereupon : the years when after a short stay in munich he was in italy with his friend the silesian schildknapp
0	hans castorp , laying aside traditional reserve , lightly touched with his lips the icy forehead of that which once was joachim ; and though conscious still of mistrustful sentiments toward the man behind the scenes , yet submissively followed louisa ziemssen from the room
0	the consul listened as long as he could
0	you under-stand -- the thing is this : in short , they have reached a point where hagenstrom demands immediate arrest or else a bond of twenty-five thousand marks
0	i must tell you of them when i see you ; otherwise i should kill myself writing
0	this it was which lent freemasonry a new brilliance and charm , and explains the great number of recruits to it at that period of its history
0	probably he would have loved her much more passionately with the fish-tail she was born with than with those extremely painful legs
0	his voice , when he greeted gerda buddenbrook , was low and hollow , as though a bite were stuck in his throat : good morning , honoured lady !
0	there were those who wanted to make him healthy , to make him go back to nature , when , the truth was , he never had been natural
0	settembrini doesn ’ t care for her , and certainly she has her unpleasant side
0	the concerts will suffer a decided loss of personal appeal
0	he was much drawn to his uncle , even in the first two weeks ; b ) t the rime i got there it was plain that he clung espe- cially to adrian and wanted to be with him
0	the room lay in yellow daylight that came in thrnugii the striped blind
0	hans castorp had the more ground for horror , in that he himself fell a temporary victim to the plague—was , indeed , one of the severest cases
0	some navvies ' , in the service of the consul , took off their caps
0	the content of his dream entirely changed , and he stood trying to shoulder settembrini away from the spot where they stood , the italian smiling in his subtle , mocking way , under the full , upward-curving moustaches—and it was precisely this smile which hans castorp found so injurious
0	you are fond of anecdote—i could serve your turn
0	but had he suspected in what direction leo naphta would have altered his intentions beforehand , or at the decisive moment , not even the prevailing temper , of which all this was the outcome , could have driven him to let the affair go on
0	he sat with his brother on the back seat of the high , ungainly old coach , one short leg crossed over the other -- and , wonderful to relate , he was gentle and conciliatory
0	i write it down in a mood of self-defence ; and another emotion seizes me : the memory of that pandemonium of laughter , of hell- ish merriment which , brief but horrible , forms the end of the first part of the apocalypse
0	he sat in the dining-hall with the seven tables when there came a great crashing of glass as the verandah door banged , and madame chauchat entered in a white sweater , one hand in her pocket , the other at the back of her head
0	the head was roguishly on a side , the still open lips wreathed in wickedly suggestive smiles , the sybaritic little dimple appeared in one cheek—he was again the dancing priest , and jerked his head as before , mockingly , in the direction of so much cerebration , as they heard him say : ah , yes , yes , absolutely !
0	wehsal all at once began to weep bitterly , from some unplumbed depth of wretchedness
0	so much of our hans ’ s table-mates
0	nothing can come of me , that is perfectly sure
0	twilight was falling as they came up to the ocean temple , for the autumn was far advanced
0	the rest is not my affair
0	they will precisely fit the fact if i say that your way of misleading unsettled youth , of dissipating and undermining his moral and intellectual powers , is infamous , and can not receive a stronger chastisement than it merits
0	then quiet again -- and suspense
0	frau permaneder stood there , very erect , her shoul-ders elevated , her black-bordered handkerchief between her folded hands ; and her pride in the chief role which it fell to her lot to perform was so great as sometimes entirely to ob-scure her grief
0	that is what i would call 'strict composition
0	for the present , she repeated , running her tongue over her upper lip
0	i an looking , he wrote to me , i keep asking round about and hankering for news of a place bur- ied from and untroubled by the \\rorld , , vhere i could hold speech alone , with my life , my destiny
0	whether there were people going driving ( certain expeditions had in fact been undertaken , among others by the half-lung club , which had gone in a body to clavadel )
0	as for the plate , its far greater antiquity could be read on the inside : the date was engraved there in ornamental figures , framed in curly engraved lines executed in the modern manner of the period , florid and capricious devices and arabesques that were something between star and flower
0	who , deuce take it , had all that time to waste ?
0	i am damned , and there is no pity for me for that i destroy all and every beforehand by speculation
0	i doubt if it is a question of sheer chance
0	as i said , for days they might keep the child from him , be- cause he was busy , or perhaps a headache shut him away in si- lence and darkness
0	he received his piece of money with gratitude , none the less
0	the humanist was put out
0	one of them , rooted in the steep bank at the side of the torrent , thrust itself aslant into the picture , with bizarre effect
0	val quarters in the cathedral were a good half of the time taken up with talks on philosophy and poetry
0	scientific exactitude forbade them to think of any such arbitrary going in and out
0	it was a mystery how much good and nourishing food that poor clothilde could absorb daily without any result whatever !
0	it would not be hard to imagine the existence of creatures , perhaps upon smaller planets than ours , practising a miniature time-economy , in whose brief span the brisk tripping gait of our second-hand would possess the tenacious spatial economy of our hand that marks the hours
0	from early on we had an eye on you , on your quick , arrogant head , your mighty ingenium and
0	there was a dull taste in her mouth , and she felt so weak that she made no effort to dry the slow , hot tears that kept rising every minute
0	at length , as no one else seemed able to settle , hans castorp , with his finger on the glass , supporting his cheek on his fist , said he would like to know what was to be the actual length of his stay up here , instead of the three weeks originally fixed
0	peeperkorn ’ s gestures were conclusive , peremptory
0	there is something so awfully sprightly about him !
0	he was standing with his sleeves pushed back before the roomy wash-hand-basin , the taps of which shone in the electric light , and gave hardly a glance at the white metal bed with its fresh coverlet
0	that was hard for all concerned ; the gentlemen could understand how hard it was , for one who came from cultured surroundings and had the delicacy of feeling of the upper classes
0	the inclu- sion of expression in the general appeasement is the innermost principle of musical pretence
0	the condition is as regular as it is pathetic , this forgetful , credulous self-deception , that attacks even masculine spirits at the hour when the lethal process nears its culmination
0	it came from the fact that in his neighbourhood steril-
0	never in all his life had hans castorp heard the word uttered so many times on end as he was hearing it now
0	hanno gentled , tamed , and en-nobled kai , who loved him tenderly , admired his white hands , and , for his sake , let ida jungmann wash his own with soap and a nail-brush
0	but the ruling powers , in their penuriousness , had the fire go out directly it stopped snowing—an idiotic rule , an insult to human intelligence
0	they avoided each other , and for weeks exchanged not a single word
0	would be a thousand pities if one did not do everything to open to this young scholar the way to the heights of knowledge
0	the young man set to work in his loggia , clad in one of the light summer suits he had brought up with him when he came—another sign that his first year was rounding out its course
0	inez 's consent , however , which she - on psycho- logical or shall i say material grounds , that is to say for common- sense reasons - had always been more or less ready to give , had been the readier because clarissa , toward the end of the previous year , had left munich and entered on her first engagement in celle on the aller , so that her sister was left alone with a mother of , vhose bohemian leanings , tame as they , vere , she disapproved
0	dh , you wait ; i sha not come short
0	the old lady trembled and locked out of the window whenever she heard a wagon
0	slept right well , did you ?
0	did i not knovv , like her , that shudder at the spiritual vacuity which reigned in the average gathering , in glaring contrast to the fever- ish excitement induced by the wine , the music , and the under- currents of human relations ?
0	that is no reproach , tony , the consul said sternly
0	yesterday we had sorrel and currants , but i wish i had not , for permaneder objected so much to the sorrel -- he picked the currants out with a fork -- that he would not speak to me the whole afternoon , but just growled ; and i can tell you , mother , that life is not so easy
0	institoris might assert that only human beings with strong and brutal in- stincts could create great works ; and inez would protes
0	he now prescribed l { arlsbad effervescent salts and a diet of the smallest possible volume , so that the fare consisted of ahnost nothing but tender meat
0	i do not see why you fail to recognize that
0	elsbeth spoke to her son , in the still melodious voice which all her life long she had refrained from song
0	was it to her , tony buddenbrook , that all this was happening ?
0	but that ’ s all worth hearing
0	yes , my dear sir !
0	he had not heeded the silent entry of the tenth month , but he was arrested by its appeal to the senses , this glowing heat that concealed the frost within and beneath it
0	the czech wenzel , who had introduced an enlivening variation by closing the gramophone and striking up very expertly on his guitar , laid that instrument aside
0	in adrian 's place - but there is really no sense in putting myself in his place ; i would not have tolerated some of the things rudi said
0	it was eleven o'clock in the morning
0	this style , this technique , he said , admitted no note , not one , which did not fulfil its thematic function in the whole struc- ture - there was no longer any free note
0	we hadn ’ t mentioned it
0	he sat now with his lips closed , his hands folded in his lap , one leg in its check trouser flung over the other , slightly swinging the foot , which he regarded with an austere expression
0	the consul read it , letting the long ends of his moustache run through his fingers
0	lieutenant joachim , laughing and excited , burst upon his cousin in the evening rest-cure
0	popinet had had nightmares again last night -- ah , quel horreur !
0	it came to pass that he heard from her own lips the tragic formula ; and being forearmed , preserved a suitable demeanour and was satisfied with himself afterwards
0	they fell out , exasperation on religious and philosophical grounds ensued and grew more and more embittered ; the upright cleric had everything to endure from the irritability , captiousness , scepticism , and cutting dialectic of young leo
0	for his part , indeed , he had an enig- matic smile on his lips , a smile that vas far from confirming me as his representative
0	indeed , to give expression to all that we suspect or divine , we think it not unlikely that hans castorp hearkened to herr settembrini ’ s discourse in order to get from his own conscience an indulgence which otherwise might not have been forthcoming
0	they passed along the row of tables , the hofrat letting fall a pleasantry at nearly every one , till a wave of merriment followed in his wake ; and so down the steps among the young folk , the female element of which straightway trooped up sidling and becking about dr krokowski , while the hofrat honoured the sabbath by performing a stunt with his bootlaces before the gentlemen ’ s eyes
0	his hat rolled a little way off down the road ; his fur coat was wet with mud and slush ; his hands , in their white kid gloves , lay outstretched in a puddle
0	will you have some wine ?
0	dh , probably not , the consul said thoughtfully , not ad-dressing anybody in particular
0	but you do not blame me -- ?
0	very early , and in close correspondence with his own averageness , the philis- tine established his personal standards of reasonable behaviour
0	yes , uncle justus , i thought it was better
0	herr permaneder let the chance slip and confined himself to laying the blame on herr criinlich , with such violence that his very chin-whiskers bristled
0	his nose sat like a tiny flat button in his face , his rheek-bones stood out , and his grey eyes , usually drawn close together and blinking about rather stupidly , could at certain moments widen quite extraordinarily , and get larger and larger , pro-truding more and more until they almost sprang out of their sockets
0	but after all , it seemed , the physician had nothing particular in mind when he asked the question
0	what is to happen now ?
0	while i stood profoundly moved at the door
0	the town was a bishopric in the tenth century , and again from the beginning of the twelfth to the fourteenth
0	more than that , the news should be to you no news
0	a violent gust of wind whistled between the houses , lashed the window-panes with rain , and howled down the chimney
0	and then where can we go ?
0	he shook his head , and pointed several times with violence toward the ground
0	you are right , ida
0	the situation is not quite clear ; for the dilatory muscles which are presumably set in action by the vasomotor nerves haven ’ t yet been demonstrated in relation to the blood-vessels
0	here i lie ; can you find it in your heart to say to me : ' i despise you -- i am leaving you ' ?
0	the possibility of—of a twenty-ninth of february could only be ascribed to feminine receptivity on the basis of the man ’ s choice already made
0	it is a regular death-bed , a common death-bed
0	these are conscientious scruples which—
0	the greeting he had exchanged with clavdia chauchat had overcome the mortifying depression ; it was at bottom the consciousness of this which had lain at the root of hans castorp ’ s gratification
0	then she went bathing in the lake—it was the beginning of may ; we were having frost at night ; the water was not precisely ice-cold , say a few degrees above
0	may we set it down on the credit side of hans castorp ’ s account , that he had been strengthened in his vicious time-economy , his baleful traffic with eternity , by seeing that all his cousin ’ s zeal , called doggedness by a certain melancholy blusterer , had but the more surely brought him to a fatal end ?
0	he took him on business expeditions down to the harbour and let him stand by on the quay while he spoke to the dockers in a mixture of danish and dialect or gave orders to the men who with hollow , long-drawn cries were hauling up the sacks to the granary floor
0	but in the evening—ah , in the evening there were festivities in the hall and the reception-rooms , in the course of which—but we alone know to what , thanks to hans castorp ’ s enterprising spirit , these carnival gaieties led up in their course ; and we do not mean to let our knowledge betray us into indiscretion
0	from the alphabet to syntax and grammar , from the progression of numbers and the first rules to the rule of three and simple sums in proportion , from the memorizing of little poems ( and there was no memorizing , the verses were straight- way and with the utmost precision grasped and possessed ) to the written setting down of his own train of thought on themes out of the geography - it was always the same : adrian gave it his ear , then turned round with an air that seemed to say : yes , good , so much is clear , all right , go on !
0	yes , of course , hans castorp said
0	poor little show-window , in which only a few pots of onions stood on a green glass slab
0	he continued and said :
0	but was-servogel grunted louder than ever , and a handful of peas went rattling against the window and bounced back into the room
0	i can still hear you say it , and i thought then that you were right , for i was elected senator , and was fortunate in my business , and this house seemed to spring up out of the ground
0	of course , it is probably immoral of me that i can not very well attend to what you say to me about morality for being so happy that we are sitting here as we once did , and then never again , even since you came back
0	one might think so
0	when frau permaneder opened the dining-room door in passing , to call a good night to her brother in the living-room , she saw that the whole storey was lighted up , and that thomas was walking up and down with his hands behind his back
0	it may be helpful to you if i tell you that at your age , both in antwerp and bergen , i formed a habit of making myself useful and agreeable to my principals ; and this was of the greatest service to me
0	five million subscribers , it was calculated , would in the course of twenty years deliver a quantity of old newspaper valued at the enormous sum of million marks ; of which two-thirds might be reckoned off to the new subscriptions , which would thus pay for themselves , the other third , amounting to about a million marks , remaining to be devoted to humanitarian projects , such as financing free establishments for tuberculous patients , encouraging struggling talent , and so on
0	it will be perfect , she said
0	she was a thick-set country-bred creature , with coarse lips and fat red cheeks
0	thomas was not in the mood to think about it
0	then he suddenly felt the blood rushing to his face as he recalled another memory , from farther back in the past
0	he wears a black coat -- an old one of the consul 's -- greased leather top-boots , and a blue woollen scarf round his neck
0	perhaps i am not masculine at all—certainly i am not in the sense which i tend to call social , i don ’ t exactly know why
0	it is comprehensible that johann buddenbr oak 's first im-pulse was to refuse his son-in-law any considerable payment
0	your cousin ’ s a different sort , quite another pair of shoes
0	and he held your brother by the coat and begged to be allowed to stop at home -- dh , my brother took him , did he ? -- yea , that is a hard moment , ida
0	he burst out laughing , in a high , half-smothered titter , in his glee at being able to make fun of the catechism
0	doctor gieseke , said tony
0	it was like the bursting of a dam -- an assertion of desperate integrity ; something elemen-tal , a force of nature , that brooked no restraint
0	and he consented to be present at a spiritualistic sitting , a tabletipping , glass-moving game which they had determined to undertake with ellen brand , behind dr krokowski ’ s back , and in defiance of his jealous prohibition
0	but that was no proper uniform he wore
0	you are certainly right about that , tom , said frau permaneder , letting fall her work and looking at her brother sidewise , past her glasses but not through them
0	he could see nothing , but he struggled , he came forward
0	the beech groves came in sight
0	he only laughed scornfully as he went off , and in a few minutes returned with the revolver in his hand
0	said frau gr� , folding her ffands in her lap and gazing up at the ceiling
0	and even with the first rumour of the old man 's death , the great question had at once sprung up : who was to succeed him ?
0	and his heart began to thump
0	he sat up and lighted the bedside candle
0	it was my duty , my friend , replied the consul
0	as for adrian , he answered in the negative the question put by the viennese
0	on the evening when i first had the pleasure of making your acquaintance , he said , beginning in a singsong tone , and letting his voice fall at the end , as though embarked on a long recitative , we had a little celebration , sat very late eating and drinking and making merry , and then , in an elevated mood , of spirit free and unrestrained , arm in arm we sought our beds
0	of the scandalous courses of that royal personage the whole neighbourhood still talked ; but rhadamanthus had shut his eye—both eyes , in fact—and behaved every inch a hofrat
0	the entresol has three rooms , he explained -- the breakfast-room , my parents ' sleeping-chamber , and a third room which is seldom used
0	they went down after tea to the basement for the monthly examination
0	the lively old maid was also invited to meng street on occasion to partake of a haunch of venison or a stuffed goose
0	they all thought for a while of this strange thing , and then suddenly frau permaneder burst into tears
0	and all of them , even herr settembrini , felt how fortunate it was that they had come in two sleighs
0	composing means to commission the za-
0	later on , i will show you what an imitation in the strenge satz involves
0	in- vitations were declined by the faithful landlady on the telephone , or even remained unansvvered
0	but we are not indulging in flights of fancy
0	there are impressions which , unimportant as they seem to the reason , work on in the subconscious mind and there exercise a decisive influence
0	christian would by himself never have found out the book ; but he was impressionable and accessible to every influence ; so he also read it , found it wonderful , and described his reactions with all possible de-tail
0	frau permaneder quickly looked him over and summed him up
0	one particular dream , however , hans castorp dreamed twice over during the night , both times in precisely the same form , the second time toward morning
0	the chances and changes of life itself would have called up in them no other reaction
0	he would open his eyes and look with eager pleasure at the old-fashioned furniture of the cleanly little room
0	in the long vacation of and still from kaisersaschern , i , with my young bride , visited adrian and schildknapp in the nest they had found in thr sabine hills
0	you know , betsy , there is another thing i ca not emphasize often enough : in these last years we have not been doing any too brilliantly
0	how would it be if we were to go out and take a little walk ?
0	why that particular one ?
0	you are right , young man , or , rather , you mean it well
0	again , how involved were the relations between the various members of our group !
0	dh , tom , i do not feel much like chatting pleasantly about trifles !
0	hanno sat still a moment , his rhin on his breast , his hands in his lap
0	he wore his sinewy throat uncovered and had no love for city clothes , which did not suit his looks , particularly not his hands , those powerful , browned and parched , rather freckled hands , one of which grasped the crook of his stick when he went into the vil- lage to town meeting
0	and now came on , as come it must , what hans castorp had never thought to experience : the winter of the place , the winter of these high altitudes
0	for liars and lickspittles mixed us a poison draught and took away our senses
0	white blood-corpuscles were attracted to the seat of the evil ; the breakingdown proceeded apace ; and meanwhile the soluble toxins released by the bacteria had already poisoned the nerve-centres , the entire organization was in a state of high fever , and staggered—so to speak with heaving bosom—toward dissolution
0	he is hardly even a relative !
0	but why do i talk so much about elegant society and its itches ?
0	as though circumstances which to herr albin were but an opportunity to enjoy the boundless advantages of shame , were to the young officer a source of chagrin and self-contempt
0	his father strongly reprehended them
0	well , young un , i must get on
0	i would not even suppress my suspicion , held on psychological grounds , that i actually seek digressions and cir- cumlocutions , or at least welcome with alacrity any occasion for such , because i am afraid of what is coming
0	see you at breakfast !
0	but frau permanrder was not listening
0	but their conviction , endorsed by the governing power of the state , had shattered his selfesteem to such a degree that he could not look anybody in the face
0	dull-eyed and breathless , he stood at the table , collected his despairing senses with a jerk , and began to put together the books he was likely to need to-day , murmuring in an anguished voice : religion , latin , chenb istry , and shuffling together the wretched ink-spotted papei volumes
0	of course i made no use of the medical attendance , he said , but that was my own affair
0	he rubbed one hand over the piano 's polished surface , gave a shy look at the company , and , somewhat emboldened by the gentle looks of grand-mamma and aunt tony , brought out , in a low , almost a hard voice : the shepherd 's sunday hymn , by uhlanj
0	then he too stood and wept , tears ran down his cheeks , like those that had smarted the skin of the english officer of marines : those clear drops flowing in such bitter abundance every hour of our day all over our world , till in sheer poetic justice we have named the earth we live in after them ; that alkaline , salty gland-secretion , which is pressed from our system by the nervous stress of acute pain , whether physical or mental
0	young and good-looking , according to all accounts , the schoolmistress answered ; she could not say from her own observation
0	herr settembrini , i am only a student as yet , i am just beginning
0	also there was active in halle at that time an outstanding latinist , i-ieinrich osiander , at whose feet i ardently desired to sit ; and more than that , as i heard from adrian , the course in church history given by professor hans kegel , dd , included an extraordinary amount of material for a student of profane history , which i wished to avail myself of , as i intended to elect history as my subsidiary course
0	but if the method is beyond him , if he has not enough gift , he will learn absolutely nothing
0	so far as it came into practical consideration with him , it was regulated by a healthy sense of the fitness of things , which made him as little likely to discuss it as he was to talk about other functional indecencies of which we are all aware , by which our life is conditioned , but on the subject of which we yet preserve bienséance
0	but there is little or nothing else im-ported
0	i would just as lief quit , said christian
0	he took leave of joachim in a spirit of enterprise , when his cousin addressed himself , after breakfast , to the usual round as far as the bench by the watercourse ; then , swinging his walking-stick , he took his own way down the road
0	he saw what i was looking at and took away the slip of paper with fie on a gentleman and brother !
0	these announcements were no sooner sent out than the old man refused to set foot in the office ; and his apathy so in-creased that it took only the most trifling cold to send him to bed , one march day two months after the death of his wife
0	there is a female arm , you can tell by its delicacy
0	for , after all , three weeks , twenty-one days , is a considerable stretch of time , too long , at least , for one to see the end at the beginning
0	if hans castorp was aware of these sentiments they could hardly escape his charmer ’ s feminine intuition
0	or else , not very differently from the pastor : ah , dear little one , little blessed one !
0	hans castorp sometimes pondered over the literary things the italian had said about illness and despair—which he had found incomprehensible , or at least pretended to himself to find them so
0	it turned out that this woman had been present , mingling unobtrusively in the audience wherever people had been bold enough to perform any of adri- an 's music : in lubeck , at the much-ridiculed premiere of his opera ; in zurich , in weimar , in prague
0	everything went according to custom and arrangement , tony brought out a hearty yes , and herr gr� gave his little ahem , beforehand , to clear his throat
0	i made use of the very evident stimulus of your presence to stir him up to the point of saying his last word on a certain subject
0	he made a face as if he were on the bourse and somebody had made him a doubtful proposition
0	the metal casket was hermetically sealed and covered with flowers , the candles burned in their silver holders , the house filled with people , and , surrounded by mourners from near and far , pastor pringsheim stood at the head of the coffin in upright majesty , his impressive head resting upon his ruff as on a dish
0	we amount to something even without the 'senator
0	sometimes i find christian a little strange , said madame griinliuh to her brother thomas ,
0	sold me time too , four and twenty years , boundless to the eye , and promised too great things and much fire under the cauldron , to the end that not withstanding i should be capable of the work although it were too hard and my head too shrewd and mocking thereto
0	but to the cousins ludovico settembrini talked of himself and his early life ; whether on the walks they took together , or during the evening in the salon , or perhaps , in the dining-room itself , after a meal , when most of the patients had left and the three sat together at their end of the table , while the waitresses cleared away and hans castorp smoked his maria mancini , which in the third week had regained a little of its savour
0	all went as before
0	even christian was disinclined to talk or joke
0	and your cousin , monsieur ?
0	to say good-bye to adrian , whose personal detachment from the whole scene was the most understandable thing in the world to me , i went out to pfeiffering , whence the son of the house , gereon , had already departed with several horses far his base
0	there would be no tread upon the ceiling , not even a chair would move -- simply a soundless , speechless , deceiving , secret silence
0	th ' air or th ' earth ?
0	dr faustus a folio bearing the name of hippocrates
0	hans castorp thrust out his head among ten others , filling the little open windowframe
0	he paused at the window and looked out into the early dusk
0	but she took it up in earnest , whereupon he considered the matter seriously and agreed to make a trial
0	her face expressed nothing but ill-nature and ignorance
0	what human beings have fought for and stormed citadels , what the ecstatics exultantly an- nounced - that is not to be
0	but his son did not meet his glance : the long , gold-brown laches lay deep , deep upon the delicate bluish shadows beneath his eyes
0	our desires and our performance are conditioned by certain needs of our nervous systems which are very hard to define in words
0	we must be forbearing ; yet in these things a frivolous feeling of fascination is very much to be regretted
0	you only need to touch the blade ; it goes into your flesh like cutting butter
0	der kleine herr friedemann [ little herr friedemann ]
0	leave me , my son
0	herr ballerstedt had left the room , and his place was taken by a small , weak enervated little man who stood straight and severe on the platform
0	he must thus have made the discovery that music afforded possibilities for the extension and realization of the kingdom of the spirit , in a way of which young herr ludwig never dreamed
0	imagine your not seeing that at all
0	asked herr settembrini , strolling up to the cousins ’ table , toothpick in mouth
0	it is the row that goes beforehand that i hate !
0	you would be obliging me very much by this friendly serv- ice , he ended , with a curious formality
0	your diviningrod twitches , and knocks
0	his uncle , nikolaus leverklihn , his father 's brother , a respected citizen of kaisersaschern , de- clared himself ready to receive the lad into his house
0	tony was naturally often in the society of her town friends , or drawn into some assembly or boating party
0	he stood at the bedside between his sister and his sister-in-law ; with his bald head , his sunken cheeks , his drooping moustaches , and his huge beaked nose , he stood there on his bertt legs , looking a little like an interrogation-point , and gazed with his little round deep eyes into his brother 's face , as it lay so silent , so cold , so detached and inaccessible
0	the marriage was solemnized in the columned hall , as on that other occasion when it was frau criinlirh who wore the myrtle
0	here i break off , chagrined by a sense of my artistic shortcom- ings and lack of self-control
0	he had heard the news of the sen-ator 's stroke in the club , which he had left at once
0	he pretended hardly to have read it
0	our young man was sitting on a painted garden chair , with his back against the wall , talking with his cousin , whom he had forced , against his will , to come outside ; in front of him ; by the balustrade , frau chauchat stood smoking with her table-mates
0	and now i must go ; please excuse me -- i am busy -- but herr gr� stood in front of her
0	or you always hear about it soon enough !
0	or else you are not worthy the friendship he feels for you
0	'you are conversing ' -- when we were not at all
0	i see you know your own mind , and so much is certainly true , that it is your affair and not mine
0	he is no beau , god knows
0	these temporary gains had been confirmed in possession , in union ; in so far as possession and union were possible in duality , in so far as a broodilg femininity could secure them
0	it almost seemed as if the laugh were at his expense , as if they were laughing at him
0	but to get this one expressed , one could only say straight out that pieter peeperkorn , with his kingly mask , and bitter , irregular mouth , was both , now this , now that ; both seemed to fit him and to neutralize each other when one looked at him—both this and that , the one and the other
0	and that story about the girl that went bathing in the lake , the one they gave the silent sister ’ to take her temperature with—i have often laughed at it , all by myself
0	this , of course , was after second breakfast , for otherwise the daily programme left no time sufficient to go down into the platz
0	last night it was almost °—that was your arrival
0	in the distance they could see the rigging of a ship
0	there was no troop of poor retainers to receive shoes and woollen underwear , and there were no choir-boys , when they assembled in fishers ' lane on the twenty-fourth
0	i\iust not my hand tremble , must i not feel cold in the pit of my
0	he even said the divel 's sow , the pope , and was in every way an intolerable boor , although a great man
0	but , of course , both times the men were to blame !
0	now there was no doubt at all that , despite reminders from his mother , he connected vvith my appearance no memories whatever
0	she had gone with her husband and children to most of the large din-ners given in the town , and presided no whit less elegantly than her daughter-in-law when the buddenbrooks themselves entertained
0	fourteenth century , answered naphta
0	for to be man was to be ailing
0	madame , my companion , has no great opinion of him—you may have seen
0	the tapestries in this room had a sky-blue background , against which , between slender columns , white figures of gods and goddesses stood out with plastic effect
0	it can not last long
0	pfiihl , she would say , be reasonable , take the thing calmly
0	how it strengthened my devotion to him , mingling , vith it - can one understand why ?
0	he went on to speak of the lymphatic tubes and absorbent vessels ; described the secretion of the breast milk , which collected lymph from legs , abdomen , and breast , one arm , and one side of the head ; described the very delicately constructed filters called lymphatic glands which were placed at certain points in the lymphatic system , in the neck , the arm-pit , and the elbow-joint , the hollow under the knee , and other soft and intimate parts of the body
0	they are satisfied with the condition of her lung
0	business man he had been , he was so no more , he was nothing more in the world , but he was still an anti-semite
0	let us leave out the formalities , said the consul
0	if father could only see this -- it is just dreadful that he can not !
0	there are shops and people , and one can buy what one needs
0	yes , it is—and its charm lies in its very abandon
0	that devil on two sticks in there has handed mine out to me already , herr settembrini said , and carried his hand to the side pocket of the inevitable pilot coat
0	deep creases furrowed his blond brows , and his face was contorted as he turned to reply to his neighbour
0	the position of the sun was hard to recognize , veiled as it was in haze
0	how is he ? -- god wo not let the worst happen , i know
0	they had been considering fiissen and neu-schwanstein
0	he : alas , no , i regret not to be able to gratify you
0	and thus , in the tumult , in the rain , in the dusk , vanishes out ot our sight
0	with the facile curiosity of inquiring youth on its travels , he had studied this new demon , yes , had even discovered in himself an alarming aptitude , in common with the rest of the world up here , to pay him extensive homage
0	anyhow , he , rudolf , had no reason to be sympathetic , fur rudiger had been rather rude to him
0	in a word , he took the approaching visit with utter composure ; announced it to hofrat behrens and the management , engaged a room—joachim ’ s , it being still vacant—and on the next day but one , at the hour of his own arrival , towards eight o ’ clock—it was already dark—drove in the same uncomfortable vehicle in which he had seen joachim off , down to station dorf , to meet the envoy from the flat-land , who had come to spy out the land
0	but i only happened to mention it
0	they are now approach- ing the centre of berlin
0	i am on my way to brecht
0	after twenty paces he felt nauseated
0	said thomas buddenbrook , almost aloud , and buddenbrook felt his breast shaken with inward sobs
0	for i have dreamed it out to the end , i have come to my goal
0	the little town of waldshut , devoid of interest or charm , lies on the garmisch-partenl { irchen line , an hour from munich
0	but we must not suppose that he consciously practised on his uncle with the strange properties of the place
0	she clamoured , do you know me ?
0	it would be a good thing if you would open the window on your side , said herr kroger
0	he nodded as he did so , not with his head but with his whole torso , and said between his teeth : si , si , si , like herr settembrini
0	and , apropos : your sister needs rest , especially at night , and mamsell severin has not time to give her all the rest she needs
0	speak more low , he begged , whispering to show them how
0	is it not playne to you that the conscious speculation on the charm which great guilt exercises on goodness makes the act of mercy to the utter- most unpossible to it ?
0	the homeward journey was a quiet one , if only out of respect for the slumbering tantchen
0	even she , she assured them , had been only temporarily affected , only a slight and superficial case , when she was quite a young girl
0	as he finished , joachim would return , and it might be as late as half past two before the latter went into his loggia , and the hush of the main rest period fell upon the berghof
0	you came back to me with him ?
0	ferge professed his respect for the choke-pear , and the whole silent activity
0	after which he had to listen , with a mixture of enjoyment and impatience , to a rejoinder from herr coach , which lasted some two hours , during which the broker sounded , as it were , all the registers of his character
0	she was filled with reverence for herself : the familiar feeling of personal importance possessed her , heightened by all she had been reading : she felt thrilled and shuddery
0	he was dressed in an open frock-coat of soft grey material , which he habitually settled at the waist with his short-fingered , wrinkled hand
0	for hans castorp loved like music the sound of rushing water—perhaps he loved it even more
0	and finally he gave it all up -- he left it all to god
0	business ability is one thing -- but it is not everything
0	of course he had brought flo , vers
0	her first conversation with adrian had been a gratifying
0	he was and remained her attached friend for many years
0	what a way is that to address a lady whom one hardly knows !
0	of course , it hurt , and the involun-tary answer was the right one -- look !
0	all this is the sheerest commonplace ; but the commonplace becomes remarkable when it springs from remarkable soil
0	the little man rounded his r 's on his tongue ; he paused between syllables ; he accompanied his words , in a way i have never seen before in a child , with vague but expressive explana- tory ges
0	but the frau consul made more demands upon herself than upon her children
0	was it as certain , then , as it had seemed to him yesterday that he would be called up in latin and chemistry ?
0	then he began to play again , but broke off suddenly and became serious , as though a mask had fallen over his features
0	i grieve to have incurred your displeasure
0	from the middle of the ceiling hung the well-cut model of a ship under full sail
0	joachim paid scant honour to the meal
0	contrary to what you say , your system seems to me more calculated to dissolve human reason in magic
0	these chains of trills !
0	the cement that bound them together was - as the reader is already prepared to hear - morphine
0	i\any found it chilling , even repellent and revolting , and these were the better , if not the
0	yes , he nodded , with a certain amazed recognition , he is pretty far along
0	hans castorp did not know this—or rather , he did not know that joachim knew it ; as for himself , he knew it well enough , did this venturesome spirit , this delicate nursling of life , this schoolmaster ’ s plague !
0	only that one winter , after his re- turn from italy , did i live at any distance from him , for at easter i had got my position at the freising academy , our family 's catholic connection being useful in this respect
0	i fainted ; i had three faintingfits one after the other , a green , a brown , and a violet
0	his opponent , naphta retorted , displayed no lack of the same qualities
0	let us call them the si : lister possibilities of luman nature in general that here colne to light
0	settembrini looked at him , a melancholy gleam in his dark eye
0	his early infancy was a struggle for life , and his family was in constant anxiety
0	you know no end of stories
0	and thrice he smites , and thrice his blows deal death , before him fly his foes… ’
0	on the box next the coachman sat the malayan valet , a yellow little man with a fur collar to his overcoat , and a bowler hat
0	yet he straightway felt her eyes upon him , turned , and gazed so ardently that she smiled and looked away
0	and what he said was but an expression of the strength of that prevailing temper , whose tool and underling herr settembrini ’ s fine understanding had become
0	we all know them ; their emotional inanity ran true to type
0	but herr hofrat , how long do you mean that i— ?
0	when they were joined by a k ferge and wehsal , which often happened , they formed a group of six , and before this considerable audience the two opposed spirits carried on an endless duel , which we could not reproduce in any fullness without losing ourselves , as it did daily , in an infinitude of despair
0	this , he said , was a priceless evening , so festive , so out of the ordinary
0	nearly as bad as in , the year of the great flood in st petersburg
0	the dining-room was nearly full , though the winter season did not actually begin until october
0	the bed curtains were flung back , the down quilt was underneath her back , and a medicine bottle stood on the night-table
0	it dught not to be possible for me to have such a thought in my mind , i know ; but you leave me nothing else to think , tony
0	he advocated the bringing of light into the unconscious mind and explained how the abnormality was metamorphosed into the conscious emotion ; he urged them to have confidence ; he promised relief
0	for it is in accordance with these laws that time seems to us just as long , or just as short , that it expands or contracts precisely in the way , and to the extent , that it did for young hans castorp , our hero , whom our narrative now finds visited with such an unexpected blow from the hand of fate
0	so much is certain , that we have been up here years
0	oh , said joachim , i hear it every day , you don ’ t need to describe it to me
0	for despite his keepsake , the macabre trophy he wore next his heart , he leaned upon herr settembrini , set great store by his character and opinions ; and the thought of being cast off would have weighed upon his spirit more heavily than that remembered boyish feeling of being left behind at school and not counting any more , of enjoying , like herr albin , the boundless advantages of his shameful state
0	and as a matter of fact—i say taking it just as a matter of fact , he repeated , pressing his forefinger so hard against his nose that he bent the end of it quite round , it is motion , isn ’ t it , motion in space ?
0	kai 's face burned , and he cast down his eyes
0	but about death—no one who came back from it could tell you anything , because we don ’ t realize it
0	a walk followed , to warm oneself up , along the beach to sea-gull rock or ocean temple , a little lunch by the beach-chair ; then the time came to go up to one 's room for an hour 's rest , before making a toilette for the table-d'hote
0	in actual fact i have sometimes pondered ways and means of sending these pages to america , in order that they might first be laid before the public in an english translation
0	i only had a glimpse of her hat , but it looked frightfully bad taste
0	virginis , in my peterstrasse , where i found forthwith fresh from the station , on the next way into the town , fitting lodging and accommodation
0	un po ’ di ragione sa !
0	the frau consul mentioned the disastrous fire which had swept hamburg in may of the year
0	and it was nothing but his own inward weakness and despair that broke out in this scene before mother and sister
0	the provocation to vice proceeding from the sacrosanct was the essential thing about it , it was the thing itself , betrayed for instance in the characterization by apostates of the virgin as the fat woman , or by extraordinarily vulgar interpolations , abominable filthinesses , which the devil made them mutter to themselves at the celebration of the \ ass
0	consul bud-denbrook stood with his hands in his trousers pockets and listened to their footsteps as they died away down the empty , damp , dimly-lighted street
0	i perceive that freemasonry has something quite military and jesuitical about it
0	prospects that made the heart of young hans castorp leap and contract , yet without actually issuing in action ; for against their doing so lay certain obstacles of a nature partly military , partly civil
0	but all this confusion must be reconciled ; and if you don ’ t think so , why then you are dividing the world up into two hostile camps , which , i may tell you , is a grievous error , most reprehensible
0	i had to laugh , in all my frozenness , at his metamorphosis into the old familiar
0	nobody could be-l ; rvp it , just living a couple of weeks at piippenrade
0	between times he had that look , first here and then suddenly there
0	johann buddenbrook did not even look at him
0	i listen with involuntary pleasure , young man , to your fluent little phrases
0	he glanced slantwise upward , and blinked
0	many of the audience were upset by this , for now they had lost their means of conveyance to the station
0	again , would the impossible by then have become any more possible ?
0	the fever was too much for his shaken heart , and in five days , notwithstanding all dr heidekind ’ s care , he died
0	but v\till that diminish its im- portance , or dim the glory which in private belongs to it ?
0	then , seeing a new face , she paused and waited , nodding gently as they came up to her ; obviously she found it of importance to learn if the stranger was acquainted with her sad case , and to hear what he would say about it
0	there were hours when he grew confused , no longer realized his condition , and spoke of an early return to the colours , spoke even of the autumn manœuvres , which he imagined were still going on
0	it was thursday , the day on which all the members of the family living in town assembled every second week , by esta-blished custom
0	frau stöhr found his remarks équivoque and unfeeling : she rose under protest to the toast , and as the other tables were being emptied , they followed the general movement toward the drawing-rooms
0	paper caps were mounted ; they , like the trumpets , were to be had of the concierge
0	then what lovely apparitions of the springtime revealed themselves !
0	his charmer came regularly late to meals ; he did the same , with intent to waylay her
0	despite his scornful repudiation of the idea that he might lie down and be covered up with hexagonal symmetricality , something within him maundered on , sense or no sense : told him that the feeling of duty which bade him fight against insidious sensory appeasements was a purely ethical reaction , representing the sordid bourgeois view of life , irreligion , philistinism ; while the desire , nay , craving , to lie down and rest , whispered him in the guise of a comparison between this storm and a sand-storm on the desert , before which the arab flings himself down and draws his burnous over his head
0	oh , let us not be indiscreet !
0	you left it to the drones to make , and rightly
0	a complicated process , laughed the italian
0	cried edmund pfiihl , hen edmund pf�he organist of st mary 's , as he strode up and down the salon with great activity , while gerda , smiling , her head on her hand , sat at the piano ; and hanno listened from a big chair , his hands clasped round his knees
0	when you as madame so-and-so finally vanish into your proper sphere , one is left to sit on the rocks all the rest of one 's life
0	disquieted by an indefinite something , either emanating from his nephew , or caused by his own unsettlement after the long journey , james looked about him , not able to descry much of the landscape ; he drew in a deep breath of the strange air , exhaled it , and pronounced it magnificent
0	but you can ’ t call that slight fever , joachim said
0	at bottom , and boldly confessed , the desire does not exist ; it is a misapprehension precisely as impossible as the thing itself , as we should soon see if nature once let it happen
0	imagine , my feet are cold all the way up to my knees
0	so he began to live : brooded over by his father 's reserved tenderness , clothed nnd nurtured under his mother 's watchful eye ; prayed over by aunt antonie , presented with tops and hobby-horses by the frau consul and uncle justus ; and when his charming little perambulator appeared on the streets , it was looked after with interest and expectation
0	the company had urged anton karlowitsch ferge to regale them with the story of the pleura-shock ; but his tongue was too thick , he could not manage it , and honourably avowed his incapacity , which was greeted by the company as occasion for another drink
0	the crown broke off , herr senator
0	i only married you for your uddenbrooks money ; and it was not nearly enough , so you may as well go home
0	and this kesselmeyer -- he was going to get a shock too
0	when adrian 's father opened certain books with illustrations in colour of exotic lepidoptera and sea creatures , we looked at
0	naphta had been listening
0	times are changing , wenzel , and we have many responsi-bilities toward the new age
0	dr krokowski stopped with joachim two or three minutes ; then he went on down the row of balconies , and hans castorp heard his cousin say that it was time to get up and make ready for tea
0	i can explain it to you as we go
0	i no- tice i begin to forget them ( he was twenty-nine at the time )
0	she gains the house at the corner of bakers ' street , she rings the alarm-bell at the vestibule-door -- fire , murder , thieves ! -- she shouts at the maid who opens : they are coming , kathrin , they are coming , takes the stairs , and storms into the living-room
0	so when this young girl -- she was then only twenty -- had come back with his children from a visit to western prussia , as a sort of charity-child , the old man had made his son a scene for the act of piety , in which he spoke hardly anything but french and low german
0	asked his uncle , letting pass the rest of the child 's metaphorical language
0	pressed , without effort or break , smooth as though prepared for the press , with faindy ironical turns of phrase ; and he spoke not from the platform but somewhere at one side , half-sitting on the balustrade , the ends of his fingers interlaced in his lap , with the thumbs spread out , and his parted little beard moving up and down
0	this year the buddenbrooks took no holiday during chris-tian 's and clara 's vacation
0	the meal was as faultlessly prepared as it was abundant
0	at that dr krokowski ’ s smile burst forth triumphant ; he shook the young man ’ s hand afresh and cried briskly : well , sleep well , herr castorp , and rejoice in the fullness of your perfect health ; sleep well , and auf wiedersehen !
0	she screwed up her brown eyes and stood her knife and fork upright on the table and moved them back and forth
0	his teeth had been particularly bad , and had been the cause of many painful illnesses and difficulties
0	i did not understand the allu- sion until i recalled that at cracow , in the sixteenth century , courses were publicly given in magic
0	we have left it to him to describe the unlooked-for guest , and he has not come badly off—we could scarcely add anything essential to the picture
0	a general chilling of your life and your re- lations to men lies in the nature of things - rather it lies already in your nature ; in feith we lay upon you nothing ne '' '' , the little ones make nothing new and strange out of you , they only ingeni- ously strengthen and exaggerate all that you already arc
0	he held it toward the light ; it proved to be a photographic negative
0	for you must know that when a soul is drawn violently to evil , its gaze is ven- omous and like to a basilisk , and chiefly for children
0	and the bell would soon ring
0	still , it was in a way a break , the end of one chapter , the beginning of another ; and if he seemed not to be conscious of the fact , i was , with a certain pang , , veil aware of it
0	the company will excuse me , he said ; i have some work down at the pilot-house
0	yet during the two and a half days , vhich i once spent with him and adrian at buchel , i observed in her bearing towards the organist a certain reserve and restraint , held in check but not quite done away by her native friendliness
0	then he went ; but the day after the arrival of the great man , the patient died
0	she would never be able to write home to announce new ventures and new successes
0	the meaning of the word varies ?
0	a piece of gross insubordination
0	a little mountain air at kreuth , a little seashore at glucksberg or travemiinde -- but they do not seem to work
0	joachim warmly agreed , as he saw his cousin was in earnest in his desire and his project
0	the gentlemen on 'change nodded at each other
0	for the pres-ent i have nothing to add
0	several times he restlessly shifted his position , even went into the reading-room to listen from there ; then took up his stand close to behrens , with his hands behind his back , and an enigmatic expression on his face , fixing the casket with his eye , and observing the simple operation of it
0	things any more ; for he had the ark conveyed as the philistines did , by wagon instead of on bearing-poles according to the weil- founded prescript of the pentateuch
0	it weighed upon her
0	our relations—or , rather , my relation to her was never the social one ; i can only say of it that its beginnings are shrouded in darkness
0	good , he answered , and rose
0	for his cousin to speak to frau chauchat was almost the same as his doing it himself—and yet how altogether different !
0	but it is not a fit subject for discussion
0	the school became a state within a state , in which not only the masters but the pupils regarded themselves as officials , whose main concern was the advancement they could make , and who must therefore take care to stand well with the authori-ties
0	they are also open at the base , of course , and communicate with the excretory duct of the bulb , which runs into the ivory middle part
0	mes respects , monsieur le professeur
0	our smallest unit is the month
0	cher maitre , he began , with a smile , rattling off his speech with a harsh accent but uncommon fluency : comme je suis heureux , comme je suis emu de vous trouver !
0	that ’ s the practice i ’ ve had , joachim answered , holding the thermometer between his teeth in order to speak
0	and you , who put such large words to such empty uses , don ’ t forget that you sometimes reproach me for being rhetorical
0	all hands , it was plain , took pains to observe sunday and distinguish it from the rest of the week , management and guest seconding each other in their efforts to this end
0	oh , answered joachim , it isn ’ t so out of the question , more ’ s the pity
0	the dowry of hia oldest daughter , indeed , was gone , and the losses which the firm had suffered in the bremen failure in had been h heavy blow
0	if god should summon me away ,
0	she stood upon the threshold , humped and tiny , her old hands clasped before her childish bosom , the green silk cap-ribbons falling over her fragile shoulders
0	they spent the evening of the twenty-fourth at the senator 's house , without the old krb'gers and without the misses buddenbrook ; for the old children 's day had now ceased to exist , and thomas buddenbrook did not feel like making presents to everybody who used to attend the frau consul 's celrbration
0	where , in heaven ’ s name , had the holiday gone ?
0	dr faustus understanding its opposite - at least not before it has been ex- plained to him
0	the landscape , rather severe and sparse , though brightly sunny , looked like a framed painting as viewed through the arch of the loggia
0	shaggyhaired goats leaped from ledge to ledge of the rocks , while the young goatherd , wearing perched on his brown curls a little hat with the brim turned up behind , stood watching them from a height , one hand on his hip , the other holding the long staff on which he leaned
0	he showed us the system of fingering on the clarinet and the seven-holed bas- soon with its twelve closed and four open keys , vvhose sound blends so readily with that of the horns ; instructed us about the compass of the instruments , the way to play them and more such matters
0	and enjoy , all else excelling ,
0	his face changed , his molions relaxed
0	in order to get some reply from the old man he went on to talk about the revolution in lively tones
0	it had been thought blameworthy , in the germany of that time , to send a boy to school unless he was to be a priest ; and this popular-aristocratic scorn of the literary arts was always the sign of fundamental nobility of soul ; the literary person , true son of humanism and bourgeoisiedom , could always , certainly , read and write—whereas the noble , the soldier , and the people never could , or barely—but he could do and understand nothing else in all the wide world , being nothing but a latinistic windbag , who had power over language , but left life to people who were fit for it
0	and then covers the corpse with kisses from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head , so that her knights , unpleasantly impressed vith such exaggerated grief , see themselves constrained to tear their sovereign lady away from the dead
0	that is the last thing in the world i should expect of him , and we can rely on him too in a business way , for i really think he makes a good deal with nappe at the niederpaur brewery
0	for now he need not feel that it so beat of its own accord , without sense or reason or any reference to his non-corporeal part
0	his sister stood looking on indulgently : clearly she had ex- pected nothing different , being used to see everyone fall in love with the youngest of the family
0	i have read that question sonlewhere , i anl not sure precisely where , but in some very prominent place
0	i know now what you mean
0	i mean , of course , the ceterum renseo of my dear father : the custams union
0	i shall stop here , said gerda , and sank with a deep breath into the reclining chair beside one of the beds
0	he had not failed to cover them
0	i have not only the old scars that come from my school-days , but the fresh places that give me my fever
0	adrian seldom failed the afternoon municipal concerts in piazza colonna
0	but i knew or feared that the till tomorrow would not be adhered to : that after i left he would sit down and work out what had so unsummoned flashed into his mind as we talked
0	the precision of the characterization showed objectivity and poise ; it dislodged the schoolmistress from her position
0	fie would not like to have rudolf in- vite them , but rather laid stress on doing it himself , though even so not too directly
0	as a mature woman who knew life and was no longer a silly innocent , she found herself unable to believe in their irreproachable sanctity
0	herr gr� looked at him blinking , with unconcealed mistrust
0	directly the head went out , the guests sat down to cards , the russians occupying , as usual , the small salon
0	they did so cautiously , for most of them were unmusical , as a tone now and then betrayed
0	in the adagio the violin sang like an angel ; but gerda took the instrument from her chin with a dissatisfied air , looked at it in irritation , and said it was not in tune
0	adam weishaupt formed his secret benevolent order entirely upon the model of the society of jesus
0	but i can not listen— have you my x-ray portrait ?
0	the bud-denbrook ladies from broad street also came ; and their love of truth compelled them to say , as usual , that erica grim huh was not growing well and that she looked more than ever like her wretched father
0	thick in the distance , next the wooded slopes , but in the foreground a mere sprinkling at most ; the stretches of discoloured and winter-killed grass were dappled or sprigged with white
0	the balkan federation will go through , engineer , all the information i receive points that way
0	what was one day , taken for instance from the moment one sat down to the midday meal to the same moment fourand-twenty hours afterwards ?
0	it happened quite simply that he had been summoned , one wednesday , from the first rest period , to go down to the basement and be weighed by the bathing-master
0	suddenly frau permaneder flushed deeply
0	he had traditions , his name was old and good , they would certainly have to reckon with him one day , as a political factor
0	dne arm rested nn her father 's knee , the hand hanging down limply
0	also several gentlemen -- senator mb willendorpf , doctor overdieck , consul kistenmaker , gosch the broker , c f kbppen , and herr marcus in the office , have asked to be remembered
0	they walked towards the klammerweiher and round its banks
0	herr modersohn blinked afresh
0	and tact was needed
0	my memory preserves pregnant and disquieting images of this time : i see us , the roddes , the knoterichs perhaps , and myself , after a particularly brilliant performance of a tchaikovsky symphony in the zapfenstosser concert hall , standing in the crowd in one of the front rows and applauding
0	open the window , tilda
0	whenever it was mentioned , the old frau consul discreetly averted her light eyes
0	it will be seen that we mean to say everything that may be said in hans castorp ’ s favour , yet without fulsomeness , not making him out as better , or worse , than he was
0	was he sound again ?
0	tom talked with the pilot-captain about the wullenwewer , now undergoing re-pairs in the town
0	let me tell you for the last time that , if you can not bring yourself to recognize the justice of my claims , i shall no longer be able to respect you as a christian , a parent , or a man of business
0	it was practised by the most civilized nations
0	go on sleeping , so you will look fresh and pretty
0	and how many months did the chief knock you down for ?
0	hen this has to happen
0	grandfather could command nine hundred thousand marks in his best time ; and we have made great efforts since then , and had successes , and made fine coups here and there
0	the senator planned to transfer the business offices to his new building , which would , of course , leave empty the ground floor of the house in meng street
0	hans castorp felt no surprise to see that she was puzzled , even a little put out , by joachim ’ s liveliness , his rapid breathing and headlong talk , which were probably foreign to his manner either at home or on the journey , besides giving the lie to his actual condition
0	he said : i try to introduce a little logic into the debate , and you answer me with lofty sentiments
0	in others , the male parent reached with his arm down the gullet of the female to deposit the semen within her ; after which , bitten off and spat out , it ran away by itself upon its fingers , to the confusion of scientists , who for long had given it greek and latin names as an independent form of life
0	i would like to die , kai !
0	yes , you can say that because you are a soldier , and your existence is purely formal
0	he laughed and said again : come along out , it ’ s all right !
0	and now i hear herr settembrini is a mason !
0	hotels and pensions , amply equipped with covered verandahs , balconies , and reclining-halls , lay on both sides of their way , also private houses with rooms to let
0	settembrini listened , and nodded ; nodded after hans castorp had come to an end , for the present , of his pronouncement and fallen silent
0	but what are you about down here ?
0	but for me it is too abstract
0	their glance was unsteady and flickering
0	there was nothing to them
0	nobody—he had simply assumed it , with such tranquil certitude as to render absurd the bare idea of not being present , which , accordingly , james hastened to disclaim with a quick certainly , of course , as though anxious to show he had never for a moment considered it
0	such things ought not to be ; yet one can not wish not to have them
0	then coming out of the farming region into that of mostly graz- ing land , to follo , v the storied , beech- and pine-covered ridge road , the rennsteig , which , with its view deep down into the werra valley , stretches from the frankenwald to eisenach on the horse !
0	what spoke in them , what gloriously triumphed in them , was a technique amounting to an ascetic religion , a technique elevated to a lofty sacrament , to an absolute end in itself
0	oh , mon vieux -- he 's always the same , is not he , betsy ?
0	and it was of fatherly authority that the young man now felt an uneasy need
0	her nerves are upset
0	my brain feels quite dead now
0	thus must every upright man speak
0	the happy board did not hesitate to pre- scribe to justice , which had to say the last , vord and pronounce the judgment , the same self-abnegation which they themselves practised
0	he called it an outrage , frightening harmless strangers like that , piping at them with her pneumothorax !
0	rather the remarkable and profoundly significant thing was that though the human being , both male and female , was endowed , vith sex , and although the localization of tj : le d
0	settembrini cried with ardour , and enlarged upon the cult of the word , the art of eloquence , which he called the triumph of the human genius
0	he went devotedly to early mass , and took part in the sunday service with a fervour which must have been gratifying to his priestly teachers
0	he came upon them organically , logically , legitimately—that fact can not be overemphasized
0	what is there in notes themselves , that is altogether new ?
0	he laid out his little garden after virgil ’ s own plan—and all that he said was sane and beautiful
0	for a long time hans castorp had silently reckoned with the possibility of an advance from the flat-land , and even been fairly sure what personal shape it would take
0	from pranzo he stalked off with a sour countenance , down the street at dario 's side to the farmers and philistines , and i stopped by myself
0	the corridor made a bend at the point where the stairs mounted to the second storey , and then went on to the back stairs , where there was another , a side entrance into the dining-room
0	naturally , he could not fail here to come into contact with persons suffering from the disability of which he was free ; and so it came to a scene , at which hans castorp was present , and which will serve us as further illustration of our theme
0	then he flung himself into his chair , and drew out his keepsake , his treasure , that consisted , this time , not of a few reddish-brown shavings , but a thin glass plate , which must be held toward the light to see anything on it
0	you say nothing save things that are in ine and come out of me but not out of you
0	even if the act of confession aroused nothing but disgust , and involved great humiliation , still it insured a moment of intimate contact with the beloved object
0	his eyes were larger than usual and he carried on with her a long and gentle conversation , in the course of which they both stood still , and clara , with a serious , calm voice said her yes
0	behrens will finally have to make up his mind to the injections , to get rid of my infection ; my temperature sticks at ° to four , five , six , and even seven
0	oh , please , please not !
0	he and his wife had a way of taking each other 's side like this , out of sheer politeness
0	dazed and grievously afflicted i went up into the fatal room
0	but i may say that almost song for song they follo , ved my own wish and expectations
0	others had eyeballs projecting on stalks ; probably in order to perceive at the greatest possible distance the faintest gleaill of light meant to lure or warn
0	voigt has a great deal of taste
0	ah , what all i have seen in these days ! -- the pinakothek and [ ) the glyptothek and the hofbrauhaus and the court theatre and the churches , and quantities of other things !
0	of the mediterranean , naples , sicily , he knew nothing
0	she did well , and thrice well , to chastise as unlawful all unconditioned striving after the pure ’ knowledge of things—such striving , that is , as is without reference to the spiritual , without bearing on man ’ s salvation ; for it is this unconditioned , this a-philosophical natural science that always has led and ever will lead men into darkness
0	the sen-ator 's bemired clothing hung over a chair
0	will you have some tea ?
0	only a few lines remained when the servant came through the garden at four o'clock to call him to dinner
0	tall and broad , he bent toward his neighbour ; paused and maintained a marvellously expressive silence
0	it is not to be , goodness , joy , hope , that was not to be , it would be taken back , it must be taken back !
0	thus she spoke ; and , finishing , sank back exhausted in her chair and stared again out of the window
0	such an interim form of liv- ing , the entry of city folk , brain workers , into the primitive coun- tryside and back to mother earth , with the knowledge , after all , that we must - or might - soon return to our usual and natu- ral sphere of middle-class comfort : such voluntary screwing down and simplification has easily , almost necessarily something artificial , patronizing , dilettante about it ; of this we were humor- ously aware , and knew too that it was the cause of the good- natured , teasing grin with which many a peasant measured us on our request for his hayloft
0	not all the snow would melt : on the heights to the south , and on the north in the rocky ravines of the rhatikon , some would still remain , and through the summer months more was sure to fall , though it would scarcely lie
0	but it was high time he came , in any case , behrens says—well , and since then the mother goes about—whenever she is not sitting with them—and if you speak to her , she just says : tous les deux !
0	he walked so comme il faut , so much as he had always been ; he greeted people with his wonted courtliness , he set store , as always , by his outward appearance and bienséance—and he belonged to the earth
0	joachim , who laid deliberate stress on such occasions , had decorated his place with a few flowers ; but there was no great ceremony about the greetings of the other guests , these were almost what they would have been after a separation of three hours instead of three weeks
0	gerda , sitting with her embroidery or her book , just beyond the portieres , followed the course of the lessons
0	my thoughts took me far back in our , in his past
0	for is it mere hypochondria to say to oneself that everything german , even the german mind and spirit , german thought , the german w ord , is involved in this scandalous exposure and made subject to the same distrust ?
0	let them look , i look with them
0	curtains , yellow with smoke , hung before the window , on whose panes the rain beat unceasingly
0	to adrian , spen- gler made clever politenesses about the brentano song cycle , which he had bought and studied at the piano
0	his nose was of the same shape , above his grizzled moustaches
0	this oft-repeated phrase set the key for all the running comment with which he accompanied his production of gesture—gesture that by now , in all conscience , had grown more than a little burlesque
0	he was a better man than herr jonathan or teary trieschke
0	i flung up my hands , i know , when he came into the management
0	it seemed to me that he really did drag one foot , but people disputed it ; i could not al- ways be sure of it when i saw him walk , and would rather ascribe my impression to a subconscious association with his name
0	nobody understood metabolism , nobody understood the true inwardness of the functioning of the nervous system
0	and the organist began to play
0	he made a vigorous ges-ture and drew himself more erect than before
0	it is easy to say that a modem theologian takes him symbolically
0	i am completely discouraged
0	but then , to avoid giving pause before a miracle—for life that built itself up out of , and fell in decay into , the same sort of matter as inorganic nature , would have been , happening of itself , miraculous—they were driven to believe in a spontaneous generation—that is , in the emergence of the organic from the inorganic—which was just as much of a miracle
0	have you made up your mind yet about the material for the wedding-dress , tony ?
0	in this disk here are the six cartridges
0	it would not do
0	well , what do you say to that ?
0	hans castorp lent him one of his camel ’ shair rugs , in addition to james ’ s own plaid ; he himself found one cover quite enough this fine autumn weather
0	no one knew the actual point whence it sprang , where it kindled itself
0	sledges would skid and upset , rolling their riders into the snow—and the onlookers would take photographs of the scene
0	until another time , then !
0	you ’ ll have to make that a little clearer
0	he heard another voice , a deep , cold voice , saying : i ’ ve seen him a long time
0	one ’ s not allowed to choose one ’ s table-mates—that would lead to goodness knows what !
0	hans castorp , in his simplicity , would sometimes take part
0	you know what you must do and what leave undone , and that 's an end of it
0	get along with you !
0	it happened that at the table with adrian sat the old schlaginhaufens , jeanette scheurl , schildknapp , my wife and myself
0	the frau consul answered only with sobs
0	you spoke of a sphere of practical activity , where you were intending to enter shortly on certain duties
0	and then holger the spirit began to poetize , and kept it up , copiously , circumstantially , without pausing for thought , for dear knows how long
0	for my cousin here , it would be unprofessional to discuss politics ; and as for me , i willingly forgo the privilege
0	then , seriously , if perhaps a little perfunctorily , thank you very much , my dear family
0	influences from not far off gave him strength
0	during this exposition , the consul had turned his back on his brother , and stood with his hands in his pockets , describing figures on the floor with his foot
0	but the enterprise of experimenting on nature , of teasing her into manifestations , tempting her , in the sense of laying bare her , vorkings by experiment ; that all this had quite close relations with witch- craft , yes , belonged in that realm and , vas itself a work of the tempter , such was the conviction of earlier epochs
0	youthful thirst for adventure , inpatience to be off , were naively mingled with satisfaction at an early re- lease from school
0	he went upstairs , where fraulein clementine had some luncheon ready for him , washed , and ate
0	becoming conscious had asserted itself against the world , whether or no the latter had not been quite undecided for recognition
0	on the ground floor , vas a restaurant , then a piano warehouse ; the doctor 's house occupied part of the upper storey , a porcelain shield with his name on it being downstairs in the lobby
0	and that was the difference between religion and morality—he was aware that he had put it very badly
0	but it was just this keeping everybody in ignorance of his mortification , his hatred , his powerlessness , that was so cruelly hard !
0	you would have to see the minuscule grandezza of his bear- ing as he imitated the two quaint little gentlemen meeting each other on the beach :
0	as long as division yielded organic units possessing the properties of life—assimilation and reproduction—no limits were set to it
0	would i sit here if i were constituted a moral judge over you ?
0	his mood was obviously good , and a wave of relief ran through the classroom
0	come , let me have it ; we will lean it against the wall
0	tony started up indignantly and made a movement to flee into the next room
0	yes , there is a crib in it
0	because your companion and i can exchange no kisses on the brow , hans castorp responded
0	the patient raves no longer : who can say whether his spirit is sunk in empty night or whether it lingers , remote from the flesh , in far , deep , quiet dreams , of which he gives no sound and no sign ?
0	bout a year arter i received in naumburg the letter i quoted froill adrian ; soillcwhat more than a year , that is , after his arrival in ijeipzig and that first sight of the city of which the letter tells
0	true , kaisersaschern lies in the midst of the na- tive home of the reformation , in the heart of lutherland
0	the catastrophe will and must come—it advances on every hand and in every way
0	a protecting deity , an egeria , a soul-mate ?
0	prometheus too was guilty of hubris— and his torture on the scythian cliffs was from our point of view a holy martyrdom
0	even riekchen severin was looking insulted at the bottom of the table , and old consul kroger ivas the single one of the company who gave even a subdued snort
0	this breathless moment of absolute calm came without warning , like some unexpected , soundless , awful event
0	it is probable that he was merely indulging himself in the regal luxury of being thus supported and piloted ; presumably he could have gone by himself
0	frankly , it took me some tine to understand that on the one hand , indeed , the church did not \ish to see her- self put on one side ; but on the other she was not ready to give her parting blessing to a declared suicide , however honourable a one
0	hans castorp and joachim ziemssen , arrayed in white trousers and blue blazers , were sitting in the garden after dinner
0	his breath came shorter , he began to cough , hans castorp , with his eyes on his goal , and his breathing apparatus apparently in splendid trim , gave little heed ; and joachim , having recognized the situation for what it was , drew his brows together and kept step for step , feeling it out of the question to let his cousin go on alone
0	for the enemy , aware of their advance , have concentrated a barrage of shrapnel and large-calibre grenades upon the way they must come ; it crashed among them in the wood , and howling , flaming , splashing , lashed the wide ploughed land
0	there is nothing left but to pity and shrug one ’ s shoulders
0	let him come here if he dares
0	what can you have to say against the body ?
0	somebody there to be chloroformed , and he has just been eating bean salad
0	i feel so sorry -- i understand so well , you know
0	my dear sir , he said , with the greatest of pleasure
0	oh , herr consul , god forbid !
0	as they went along the corridors hans castorp said to his cousin : confess that it was a good idea of mine
0	the snow-white cloth of woven damask on the round table had an embroidered green runner across it , laid with gold-bordered porcelain so translucent that it gleamed like mother-of-pearl
0	i know it by heart
0	i took the place next the coachman and schildknapp made good his threat of being dragged on skis behind us - the driver had brought a pair
0	she put out her hand and tipped her head on one side
0	yes , i confess that in my simple human
0	tony related the good progress of the little erica , and christian wrote eagerly of his life and doings in london
0	don pizarro , in enormous puffed sleeves , was striking a permanent and awesome attitude , and the minister , in black velvet , approached from behind with hasty strides , to turn all to happiness
0	and by his own fault , one must admit
0	that would have meant denying to the
0	i did not invite you
0	we can ’ t deny that you had a weakness that way ; we make no bones of it , even if it is as good as cured now , and it may easily be that it runs a little in the family , as behrens suggested
0	we wander— wander—watching the tongues of foam lick upward toward our feet and sink back again
0	for the time element in music is single
0	to-morrow we must certainly get you a pair of rugs
0	the heat was turned on
0	and when the high official had turned to go , he had turned round again and with tears behind his gold glasses had pressed her hand again with the words : thank you , thank you , for your understanding and good- ness , but he meant understanding for the bowed-down parents , not for the girl
0	element of its exterior surface amiability ; and which one must take from it , tear from it , to have it alone , utterly alone , alone in the most final sense of the word
0	the naiad , the halmstadt , the friederike ( jverdieck -- why , if you know those , my son , at least that 's soiiething !
0	hans castorp did not keep inward count of the time , as does the man who husbands it , notes its passing , divides and tells and labels its units
0	there he lay , and dictated to his attendant letters that betrayed extreme depression
0	i ’ ve just come from an unequal duel with saw and scalpel—great thing , you know , resection of ribs
0	it ’ s so in the majority of cases , at bottom—i know what death is , i am an old retainer of his ; and believe me , he ’ s overrated
0	here i will follow on with a letter i had from him two months after i entered the service at naumburg
0	it is as though some-thing had begun to slip -- as though i have not the firm grip i had on events -- what is success ?
0	hans castorp thought it a disinterested horror , yet with something too of a personal kind , something that touched the kingly creature near : fear , perhaps , but not of any mean or narrow sort ; that was very like panic flickering up momentarily in the eyes
0	let him stop up here a bit , look about him and get used to things , he would change his tune
0	and now , good appetite , and a good morning
0	with outraged virtue and dignity she would call by name all those persons who had played havoc with her life and , in consequence , with the prestige of the buddenbrook family ; the list had grown long with time : teary trietschke !
0	what you mean by it all is to sh
0	the dreary , tossing sea was covered far and wide with foam
0	the whole occurrence , however , took a peculiar cast , offensive even beyond the horror of it , through an association of ideas due to dr krokowski ’ s latest lecture
0	well , do you think i can depend on that ?
0	theie was a half-circle of potted plants , arranged alternately with high silver candelabra ; and against the dark green leaves gleamed from a black pedestal the marble copy of thorwaldsen 's christ , which belonged in the corridor outside
0	he said , with a sad head-shake
0	let us change the subject
0	permit me to put another question , or rather , with your kind permission , make a suggestion
0	there 's nothing good to be looked for from christian , and i am finished
0	she spoke of the free and frank dis-cussion which the constitution ordains must be held over each name upon the list of candidates , and vivaciously wished she might be present when hermann hagenstrom 's character was being pulled to pieces !
0	the ladies ’ palpitation and cold extremities , the forced hilarity of the men , arose from their knowledge that they were come together in the night to embark on an unclean traffic with their own natures , a fearsome prying into unfamiliar regions of themselves , and that they were awaiting the appearance of those illusory or halfrealities which we call magic
0	she was admitted into the salon , where thomas buddenbrook lay upon his bier
0	he slipped into it and assumed an air of having been here from the beginning
0	the clock strikes twelve ,
0	no need here to hang the head , here is no cant nor sanctimoniousness , nothing but the blithe and manly spirit of disinterested research
0	item , she has much of the laboratory and the insistent ac- tivity of the alchemists and nigromancers of yore , which also stood in the sign of theology , but at the same time in that of emancipation and apostasy ; it , vas apostasy , not from the feith , that was never possible , but in the feith ; for apostasy is an act of feith and everything is and happens in god , most of all the falling from him
0	alone with his cousin , hans castorp heaved a sigh
0	i owe that to my family and the firm , she added earnestly
0	then frau per-maneder breathed such a heavy sigh that it sounded like a sob
0	no doubt hans castorp , were he wishful to do so , could without any great trouble have reckoned himself into certainty ; just as the reader can , in case all this vagueness and involvedness are repugnant to his healthy sense
0	it was not meant for people who went out in the snow and got lost and night-bound in the mountains
0	your tales cf the whip-cracking and sprjnging to order , the curry- combing and spit-and-polish , have made us heartily to laugh : above all that one of the under-officer , vhich even as he planes
0	he said we should sitty down and so we did , with the manikin between us in the grass , and looked at his picture-book vith him
0	his father , of whom he spoke with respect , obviously with the feeling that he was now remote enough from his native scene to view it with impartial benevolence , had been the village schochet , or slaughterer—a calling different indeed from that of the gentile butcher , who was labourer and tradesman , whereas leo ’ s father was an official , and the holder of a spiritual office
0	and since , in order to remain within the moral code , such a man had always to correct justice in the second sense by justice in the first , where then was the absolute , the radical , in the conception ?
0	he shows an unpretentious façade , and behind it gives free rein to tastes— such as a prince of the church—
0	directly the doctors had left the scene , the word had gone round for a dance , already the tables were being pushed back ; spies were posted at the doors of the writing- and music-rooms , with orders to give the sign in case the old man , krokowski , or the oberin should show themselves
0	he went about with that dry flush on his face and hummed continually under his breath—being in a state of mind when music particularly appeals
0	the sufferer 's words dragged , perhaps unconsciously , and he moved his lips so idly that what he said was badly articulated
0	ever since i came up
0	everybody has that kind of vanity ; do not you think so ?
0	opposite her sat a chattering french girl who looked like a negress , with huge
0	i was still happier over the altogether successful shaping of the address , only nine lines long , of the poet to his allegorical song , which speaks so darkly and difficultly , with no prospect of its hidden sense being understanded of the , vorld
0	he asked , after silence had reigned some two minutes
0	but however genuine his fear of the elements , he refused to take premature flight ; his being scarcely the sportman ’ s attitude , who only meddles with the elements so long as he knows himself their master , takes all precautions , and prudently yields when he must—whereas what went on in hans castorp ’ s soul can only be described by the one word challenge
0	so james broke off , and to his nephew ’ s further , mildly interested query answered : oh , nothing
0	no , thomas , you simply ca not understand what a splendid creature she is -- and healthy -- she is as healthy -- !
0	yes , the sleeping-sack , hans castorp said
0	now look at the skin—the epidermis
0	a nice , amusing young man—but what was the result ?
0	i repeat , it is astounding
0	he stood there near the figure of thorwaldsen 's christ and wrung his hands before his face or spread them out in blessing ; while below in the street , before the house door , beneath a white wintry sky , stood the hearse drawn by four black horses , with the other carriages in a long row behind it
0	those were comparatively dull hours , and the tedious kegel could by no means vie with kumpf
0	the window was down , the afternoon grew cool , and he , a tender product of the sheltered life , had turned up the collar of his fashionably cut , silk-lined summer overcoat
0	the richest children were pointed out , the prettiest and those from well-known families : there were the little daughter of a dutch multi-millionaire , the son of a prussian prince , and a twelve-year-old lad who bore the name of a champagne known the world over
0	and i should say that discretion plays some role in the affair too
0	it had been standing here , in immovable dignity , while she had thought of it as a dream worthy only to be forgotten
0	joachim made a right-about turn
0	i beg your pardon , i will ask another question ; i ’ ll put it more simply and generally
0	and mynheer peeperkorn came to the point
0	whereupon the young man laughed , blushed again , and looked at tony 's plate
0	a drive bordered with chestnut trees went from the garden gate up to the ter-race ; and on either side of the gate a gilt-topped lantern was burning brightly
0	a door was slammed—it was the one on the left , leading into the hall , and someone had let it fall shut , or even banged it , a thing he detested ; he had never been able to endure it
0	i have already spoken of adrian 's inner cosmopolitanism
0	and when she tries to dissimulate , she is incomparable
0	tony was speechless with envy and humiliation
0	that is strong language , ida , but that was really the truth of it
0	he held these offices in high regard
0	the kind i mean consists in making a good use of favours received
0	the volumes were heavy , unhandy
0	before tea was finished drinking , up above and down below , it was well on the way toward five o ’ clock ; and by the time joachim returned from his third daily round and looked in on his cousin , it would be near enough to six to reduce the remaining rest period to no more than a single hour—reckoned always in round numbers
0	upon my word , one has only to speak of her to make you blush !
0	but hold—you need a bag , a fur sack !
0	for twice such a turn had come , in his dream and fantasy , as had made him start up—once from horror , and again for rapture
0	but so long as this is the case , heinricy , you can not expect to make any improvement , and so i warn you
0	this was all that was lacking to set the crown upon the whole
0	this undress threw into even greater relief the splendid humanity of his head on the pillow ; in it he looked more remote than ever from the conventional and middle-class , suggesting on the one hand the homme du peuple , on the other a portrait-bust
0	was it that he missed the orange perfume ?
0	hans castorp felt how very odd indeed the word sounded in the mouth of sharp , skinny little naphta
0	just tell me that , if you can
0	psychology - god warrant us , do you still hold with it ?
0	it covered his cheeks and left his chin and lips free
0	now between these keys the work plays most ingeniously , so that for most of the time none of them clearly comes into force but is only indicated by its propor- tional share in the general sound-complex
0	and laughing , confused , in the excitement of arrival and meeting , hans castorp
0	there is a difference
0	he made him ac-quainted with his own nearest friends on exchange and en-tertained him in every way
0	faustus the idea that i had fufilled my duty to my fatherland and would do better to serve in myoid place the caust ; of education
0	he determined to shut himself up to-morrow and give a performance all by himself , and already in fancy he heard his little figures singing : for he was approaching the theatre by way of his music
0	dn the thirtieth of may he went to rostock , whence he drove in a hired wagon out to the country
0	i ( retort angrily ) : no
0	it was capable of healing certain diseases which were latent in every human being , though its first effects were strongly favourable to these , and by dint of a general organic compulsion , upwards and outwards , made them come to the surface , brought them , as it were , to a triumphant outburst—beg pardon—triumphant ? —yes ; had he never felt that an outbreak of disease had something jolly about it , an outburst of physical gratification ?
0	take your cousin and put him to bed
0	his housemate and antagonist was no better off
0	the hangman 's helper in a flowing jacket and a codpiece pours the boiling oil over the back of my neck from a long-handled ladle , as i duly and devoutly squat
0	je t ’ ai tutoyé de tout temps et je te tutoierai éternellement
0	o lord of heaven , hear my prayer !
0	he ca not go away without speaking to you and your mamma , and if you did not want him , you should have sent him away before now
0	she realized who i was , looked at me , and burst out : 'farewell , farewell !
0	but herr albin had already come out to go up to his room : very young and lanky , with a rosy , childish face , and little strips of side-whisker close to his ears
0	you have there ensenbles which begin as speaking choruses and only by stages , by the way of the most extraordinary transitions , turn into the richest vocal music ; then choruses which pass through all the stages from graded whisper- ings , antiphonal speech , and humming up to the most polyphonic song - accompanied by sounds which begin as inere noise , like tom-toms and thundering gongs , savage , fanatical , ritual , and end by arriving at the purest music
0	they had him between them , and he turned his head to assent first to one and then to the other ; now and again he stood stock-still on the path , tipping his body back from the waist and gesturing with his fur-lined glove as he made some quite inadequate contribution to the talk
0	we are international- but we are pro- german , like nobody else in the world , simply because we ca not help perceiving the role of germany and judaism on earth
0	we must look about among the world-famous conductors to interpret - we shall not need to look long
0	herr weinschenk 's visits followed each other in quick succession , and by january -- january of the year -- he permitted himself to make a brief and manly offer for erica crunlich ' a hand
0	my sympathetic readers and friends : let me go on with my tale
0	i will try , in as small space as possible , to sketch the essential of these experiences , which our host rightly found enormously im- portant and which daniel zur hohe accompanied with his stere- otyped oh yes , yes , yes , not so bad , yes , certainly , one may say so , even when it did not exactly go so far as the plundering of the world by the tough and dedicated soldiery of cbristus n- perator maximus
0	then there were cavaliers of herr albin ’ s kidney , monocled youths of seventeen , a spectacled , rosyfaced young dutchman with a mania for collecting postage stamps ; certain greeks , with pomaded hair and almond-shaped eyes , inclined to overreach at table ; and a pair of young dandies who were nicknamed max and moritz , and bore a great reputation for breaking out of bounds
0	in july he was as sound as a berry , weeks long
0	while the departure of the civilian hans castorp became impossible precisely because he had to wait for clavdia chauchat , whose return , as yet , was not even thought of
0	for instance , frau salomon from amsterdam , despite the pleasure she got from displaying her lace underwear at examinations , despite the fact that she was not improving , but getting steadily worse , took an entirely mad and illegitimate leave for the flat-land
0	and so some wind has blown you all the way up here ?
0	you can see the tree line almost everywhere , it is very sharply defined ; the fir-trees leave off , and after that there is absolutely nothing but bare rock
0	best thanks for your trouble , herr senator , he said
0	his hand trembled , he was plainly in a nervous state
0	words of twelve letters , cer- tain combinations and interrelations of the twelve semitones , series of notes from which a piece and an the movements of a w
0	baroque easy-chairs with little pads on the arms were , grouped about a small metal-bound table , and behind it stood a baroque sofa with velvet cushions
0	timm clutched his brow , rolled up his eyes , sighed winrtilv , and said with a dazed smile : i get all mixed up , herr doctor , when you stand so close to me
0	i ’ ve sometimes asked myself if i ought not to have become a clergyman—in a certain way it wouldn ’ t have suited me so badly—i hope i didn ’ t make any mistake in my french ?
0	during the meal her mother had told her that thomas was aware of her expected arrival ; and she did not seem particularly anxious to meet him
0	white traces lingered after every storm in the crannies of the rocky rhätikon , the chain that seemed to guard the end of the valley , and the distant monarchs to the south were always in snow
0	he thanked me in the words , spoken so far as i could hear without humour : well , you see , it is a good thing after all to have reliable friends
0	and yet there were troubles which had , at times , the power to lame his courage for hours , weaken his elasticity , and depress his mood
0	i had that amount of consideration , yes
0	dreamily , the glass spelled out the word tranquil
0	tony , your position is not comme il faut , remarked the frau consul
0	you are quite right in assuming i don ’ t know the work of that pope—i take it innocent iii was a pope ?
0	it would be as though one held a single note or chord for a whole hour , and called it music
0	guard marguerite within thy shelt ’ ring care !
0	he varies , the consul said drily
0	since then he encompassed in his reveries this nervous , exceedingly reserved lady , to whom he had not even been presented : he lifted his jesuit hat to her , on the street , to her great surprise , and treated her to a pantomime of cringing treachery , gloating over her the while in his thoughts as a tiger might over his trainer
0	i can speak openly with you
0	man is intoxicated by his desire , woman demands and expects to be intoxicated by it
0	his youthful moustaches , colourless as the hair which covered his long head , were scarcely visible ; and he had a complexion to match , a tint like translucent porcelain , which grew pink on the slightest provocation
0	his feet looked large , his legs very thin , they seemed to be bound or wound as for the business of sport more than war
0	but christian went on , his eyes wandering back and forth
0	i won ’ t call it a focus of softening , but it is certainly a moist spot , and if you go down below and begin to carry on , why , you ’ ll have the whole lobe at the devil before you can say jack robinson
0	i must have got stiff from lying ; i shall be better as i move about
0	are you pleased with ida ?
0	he repeated ; and he made a vague , awkward , fervent gesture outward and down-ward , not toward the side where the coast of mecklenburg narrowed the bay , but in the direction of the open sea , whose rippling blue , green , yellow , and grey stripes rolled as far as eye could see out to the misty horizon
0	i started at the word
0	toward the end of the month the valley lay deep in snow ; but then it thawed , just as certain experienced or weather-sensitive among the guests had prophesied it would : frau stöhr , the ivory levi , but equally the widow hessenfeld , smelt and felt it simultaneously , before ever the smallest little cloud showed itself over the top of the granite formation to the south
0	they were favourable only for skiing
0	and up there to the right of the schwarzhorn , that tooth-shaped peak , there is a glacier—can ’ t you see the blue ?
0	his eyes had been quite dead before
0	it was so easy , so safe , to tease poor , limited , modest , lean and hungry clothilde , that , harmless though it was , he felt it rather beneath him
0	you ca not play it twice -- with all due respect , my dear fellow , and my highest re-gards
0	you see i make it all myself , it tastes twice as good—did you think it was ambrosia ?
0	i did eat more than usual for breakfast , but that can not be the reason , for she usually tastes particularly good after a too hearty meal
0	he is a good lad , betsy , a lad of principle , but -- after he had failed twice in the examination , it seemed best -- he did not like the law himself , and the position in the post-office at wismar is quite suitable
0	tall , broad-shouldered , long-legged , nar-
0	we are giving the classical gifts of life their due , staggering in their honour
0	master-builders and builders on a building
0	joachim could never have done so—good joachim , who saw the whole affair now in its true light , after the false one hans castorp had first cast upon it ; saw how the wool had been pulled over his eyes ; and with a murmured recognition applied himself to help look at the painting
0	and he favoured them with some repulsive details of his condition , to which christian listened with dreadful interest , wrinkling his nose as far as it could go and countering with a brief and forcible-account of his misery
0	for beyond that portal , in the council room , in fourteen arm-chairs arranged in a semicircle sit the electors , who have been chosen from the senate and the assembly and await the proposals of the voting chambers
0	didn ’ t aristotle place in the individual the reality of universal ideas ?
0	the musical followed and admired the art of his phrasing , his breathing-technique
0	theol- ogy was to them something given - and something historically gi ven it certainly is
0	it ’ s not only since yesterday that i ’ ve been thinking about it
0	behrens studied the spots and the lines , the black festoon in the intercostal space ; while hans castorp gazed without wearying at joachim ’ s graveyard shape and bony tenement , this lean memento mori , this scaffolding for mortal flesh to hang on
0	his hair , pale brown and very soft , began to grow rapidly , and fell waving over the shoulders of his full , pinafore-like frocks
0	it was a beneficent pause , relaxed , and filled with peaceful satisfaction in respect of work already accomplished
0	it means angel of death
0	it was joachim who came back to it ; for hans castorp , moved by native tact and delicacy , seemed to wish to forget it up to the last moment
0	he was a young man of not very independent judgments , and glad to be encouraged in certain feelings he had , upon which both reason and conscience united to frown
0	no , they were not all brown : two of the ladies were , on the contrary , distinctly pale ; one of them thin as a lath , and ivory-white of complexion , the other shorter and plump , disfigured by freckles
0	a trembling ran through her , she sighed , the upper part of her body sank forward so that her forehead rested against hans castorp ’ s , and her arms , together with those of her guardians , began to make extraordinary pumping motions to and fro
0	and we are shrinking shadows by the way-side , shamed by the security of our shadowdom , and noways minded to indulge in any rodomontade ; merely led hither by the spirit of our narrative , merely to see again , among those running , stumbling , drum-mustered grey comrades that swarm out of yonder wood , one we know ; merely to look once more in the simple face of our one-time fellow of so many years , the genial sinner whose voice we know so well , before we lose him from our sight
0	the man whose strength is unexhausted climbs boldly up into the lofty multiplicity of the mountain heights
0	the cigarettes , those biting little trifles with the yellow mouthpiece , were tom 's passion
0	he stood and watched her laugh as she spoke , precisely as pribislav hippe had laughed as he spoke , that time in the school yard : she opened her mouth rather wide , and her slanting , grey-green eyes narrowed themselves to slits above the cheek-bones
0	three times daily , at least , she passionately embraced her future sister-in-law
0	after an introductory c , it puts a c sharp before the d , so that it no longer scans heav-en 's blue , mead-owland , but o-thou heaven 's blue , green-est meadowland , fare-thee well for aye , and this added c sharp is the most moving , consolatory , pa- thetically reconciling thing in the world
0	the human body— yes , i ’ ve always had an uncommon turn for it
0	here it would have been in place for our two male visitors to take off their hats , had they had any on
0	i was already thinking of all these things when at the beginning of this work i made an exception to my general profession of friendliness towards the jewish people , confessing that i had run across some pretty annoying specimens , and the name of the scholar breisacher slipped prematurely from my pen
0	they went back to their guests
0	he had made this observation when he had visited asylums for the insane
0	in brahms as a song-writer my friend valued above all else the peculiarly new and austere style in the four serious songs written for bible texts , especially the religious beauty of tod , wie bitter hist du !
0	it is very damp and foggy
0	her upper lip had the most touching expression
0	he filled her glass , also his neighbour ’ s and his own , ordered three more bottles , and clicked glasses with wehsal and frau magnus the inly wasted one ; they two seeming to stand in most need of enlivenment
0	on exchange he had been meeting measuring side-looks out of jovial , mocking old eyes , that seemed to be saying so you are taking it on , my son !
0	we are sunk enough here , aren ’ t we , lieutenant ?
0	old dog in the manger !
0	i will sit here awhile and smoke my cigar in the regular way
0	hermine kleefeld , as well as herr albin and captain miklosich , played fantastic rôles—the last carried off frau stöhr in his fury , and was pierced through and through with a lance by lawyer paravant
0	is that a reason for embarras , in a sphere where there reigns unlimited freedon from prejudice ?
0	he , thomas buddenbrook , as a business man , was taking advantage of the market -- and he would , by god , when he sold , know how to do the same
0	the truth was that his very destiny had been marked by stages , adventures , insights , and these flung up in his mind suitable themes for his stock-taking activities , and these , in their turn , ripened him into an intuitional critic of this sphere , of this its absolutely exquisite image , and his love of it
0	so 't is ; yes , they do say so
0	and had not the establishment of the morning star been , precisely , a military academy , the pupils of which were drilled by divisions in military and spiritual decorum , a mingling , so to speak , of stand-up collar and spanish ruff ?
0	the latter was sitting , for the time , alone on her side of the table , for the other three places were free
0	ripe for home ’ again
0	edmund pfu'hl was an organist of no small repute , whose reputation for contrapuntal learning was not confined within the walls of his native town
0	what made him say that ?
0	the conversation paused for a while on the subject of the approaching wedding
0	young man , he said , positively
0	our readers may remember the greedy schoolboy in the round spectacles , who sat at frau salomon ’ s table and had a habit of cutting up all the food on his plate into a sort of mess , and gulping it down , now and again wiping his eyes with his serviette behind his heavy spectacle-lenses
0	and as settembrini brought it out , he flung his small , yellow-skinned right hand in the air , as though proposing a toast
0	as the year ] drew to a close , something frightful indeed happened
0	he had his hands behind his back and a smile on his intelligent face
0	are you waiting for ah official invitation from gr� ?
0	as the regular performance of a task it l { ept me busy and filled the years vvhich vvould have been still harder to bear in idleness
0	three great lorries were being driven through , one close behind another , piled high with full corn sacks , with the firm name written on them in big black letters
0	the thirteen brentano songs are also to be regarded in this light
0	but i must devote a few words to another figure among our teachers ; the equivocal nature of this man intrigued me , so that i remember him better than all the rest
0	he pressed her to find out new and interesting facts about madame chauchat ’ s personal affairs , her origin , her husband , her age , the particulars of her illness
0	in his country they cultivate good relations with the english balkan committee
0	she held conferences with various people about the funeral , which must of course be conducted in the most re-fined manner
0	this was what brought nepomuk schneidewein to pfeiffering
0	blatant self-confidence lured everyone on to try his hand
0	all i want to say is that our objections - if they are meant as objec- tions - would not count against the fulfilment of the old , the ever repeated demand to take hold and make order , and to resolve the magic essence of music into human reason
0	i have my eyes in my head and see how things are ; i am not a stupid goose any more , i am a divorced woman -- and i am made to feel it , that 's certain
0	for you have not done that -- with me -- i swear it
0	and now , on a sudden , there remained of it no more than a miserable three or four days , nothing worth mentioning
0	so while these youthful lips meet in their russian kiss , let us darken our little stage and change the scene
0	in the morning he went to the office at about the same time as thomas , and sat opposite his brother and herr marcus in a revolving arm-chair like theirs
0	he had what he had
0	did not the very fact that he was sitting at the bad russian table witness a certain abandon ?
0	he came to her rescue and launched out once more upon the old story
0	thank you so much , professor naphta
0	between them there had appeared , lifting his top hat , a gentleman of scarcely medium height , with one light eyebrow higher than the other and the pointed ends of his moustaches extending beyond his pallid cheeks
0	his voice sounded weak and tearful with suppressed laughter
0	yes , they were mostly empty , replied the hostess
0	he asked in a lower , well-nigh reproachful tone
0	the atmosphere up here is so international
0	i hate it , as you know ; i have no respect for it -- here the consul began to laugh , leaning back in the sofa with a piece of bread and herb cheese in his hand
0	the curtains of the three large windows were still drawn , and the gas was burning in the chandelier with a soft hissing noise
0	baku—in some german baths , in spain
0	thus adrian describej hill to me and thus i see him
0	i found that unconsciously i had fonned quite decided opinions
0	it was nearly six o'clock
0	he understood only now and then what they were saying , and the music itself was mostly far above his childish understanding
0	but all that is an old story , he said
0	what will become of you if you go on like that ?
0	as long as i am alive it wo not happen
0	this is not just a machine , he went on , taking a needle out of one of the gay little metal boxes ranged on the table , and fitting it into the holder , it ’ s a stradivarius , a guarneri ; with a resonance , a vibration—dernier raffinemang , polyhymnia patent , look here in the inside of the lid
0	tell me one thing , tom : would not it be like a nightmare to you ?
0	we are all weak creatures with sinful hearts , and when they begin to look down on me for a poor worldling i laugh in their faces
0	i know what you would say : that the views you represent are not , of necessity , your own ; that you have only chanced upon that one of all the possible ones there are , as it were , in the air , and you try it on , without personal responsibility
0	hanno 's feeling for his teacher was one of boundless gratitude and devotion
0	- i do not mean they were my personal choice , nor will the reader find them so
0	and i , on the other hand , assert that the question of freedom—the question of cities , to put it more concretely—has always been a highly ethical question , and is historically bound up with the inhuman degeneration of commercial morality , with all the horrors of modern industrialism and speculation , and with the devilish domination of money and finance
0	say -- you know franz , the ramsau franz , he had his name-day to-day , and we are all half-seas over
0	hans castorp was in his loggia , studying a plant which , now that the astronomical summer had begun , and the days were shortening , flourished luxuriantly in many places : the columbine or aquilegia , of the ranunculus family , which grew in clumps , with long stalks bearing the blue , violet , or reddish-brown blossoms , and spreading herbaceous foliage
0	yes , he said , joachim would find there had been changes in the population of the berghof , there were new people , but on the other hand , some that had gone away were come back again
0	i say , that ’ s pretty steep , he cried
0	ncipated her from the sphere of a small-town speciaeti and piping and brought her into contact , vith the great , voric !
0	christian would look at her with his nose all wrinkled up , as if to say are not you ashamed of yourself ?
0	she became gradually transparent , soon she was only visible as an ascending current of warm air , then not visible at all , so that ellen ’ s path was clear
0	and here are the tele-grams , tom , the first ones to come -- the personal ones of course ; the others have been sent to the offire
0	let us hope she recovered her strength when she went back to her husband
0	' n ' then , adds the buddenbrook partisan , did not the burgomaster his own self stan ' godfeyther to his son ?
0	he fell upon his face , beneath which , presently , a little pool of blood began to form
0	still so early that i had on that same day looked over almost the whole to , vn in the first flush of arrival- this time really with a guide , to wit the porter who fetched my portmanteo from the station ; hence at the last the farce and foolery of which i spalce and may still reherse
0	as papa said the other day , they are the coming people ; while the m�ndorpfs , for example -- and one ca not deny that the hagenstrbms are clever
0	but let 's go up
0	do wet the compress again
0	birds of paradise , i tell you , and regularly out for adventure
0	he answered as no one had expected him to answer -- not dr gieseke , nor the frau consul , not thomas , nor antonie herself
0	these were such singular times
0	and it lasted—with interludes of single resplendent days—all through the month , and on into september
0	adrian laughed - not , of course , out of sur- prise
0	i won ’ t go so far as to say that the whole natural order of things , for instance the size of the earth , the time it takes to revolve on its axis and about the sun , the division between day and night , summer and winter—in short , the whole cosmic rhythm , if you like to call it that— was especially arranged for our use and behoof ; that would be cheek , i suppose , and simple-minded into the bargain
0	war , echoed settembrini , war , my dear sir , has been forced before now to serve the cause of progress ; as you will grant if you will recall certain events in the history of your favourite epoch—i mean the period of the crusades
0	precisely this it was that frightened hans castorp ; for frightened he was , in the same sense as when , in the consulting-room , he had looked from joachim ’ s nude body with panic-stricken searching up to his eyes—only that then the grounds of his fear had been pity and concern , whereas here something quite different was in play
0	except for the first greeting , he had had no opportunity to speak with christian , but he had looked at him , during the service , and noted that he seemed unusually serious , and even more restless than common : in the course of pastor pringsheim 's discourse he had left the room for several minutes
0	and thus it was , in this connexion , that the learned gentlemen , speaking with his drawling , typically eastern cadence , and his softly mouthed r , came upon the subject of botany ; that is to say , upon the subject of mushrooms
0	you are a woman , you see , so you take everything personally
0	peeperkorn summoned the dwarf and in his most impressive manner ordered wine—white chablis of , three bottles for a start—and dessert , whatever pâtisseries and dried fruits were to be had
0	and bruckner 's opinion of brahms was very low
0	and who knows , yet , how much you are doing for him ?
0	asked herr kesselmeyer , looking at him through his glasses , with his nose wrinkled up
0	he was accordingly gratified to learn that grandfather settembrini had not underestimated the importance of such matters
0	water roared in the abysses on the right ; on the left , among rocks , dark fir-trees aspired toward a stonegrey sky
0	at the festival in baden , in co-operation with hans platner 's famous marionette theatre , they gave all five pieces of the gesta ranorun - an experience ravishing the feelings to and fro between pious emotion and laugh- ter as never before
0	people who passed him noticed that his eyes were watering and that he held his mouth sh'ut in a peculiar cautious way ; it was twisted a little to one side , and one could see by the musrles of his cheeks and temples that he was clenching his jaw
0	was not he himself used to lie long hours out of doors , in snow and frost , by night as well as day ?
0	his face grew slowly red -- such a dark red that his beard looked pale-yellow by contrast
0	that ’ s too absurd for words
0	oh , you , with your cassandra prophecies !
0	hans castorp set himself against it—or at least he tried , only to discover , in affright , that even he was powerless to do so
0	his thoughts , whenever he paused in his address , obvi- ously made him inaccessible to them
0	his lowest stage was in the mill , the second on the ploughed field , the third , and most commendable—don ’ t listen , settembrini ! —was upon the bed of repose
0	at seven o ’ clock next morning , the sun showed no sign of making an appearance above the mountain ; yet day was dawning , difficultly , in a reek of mist , as hans castorp , after a restless night , left the berghof to go to the rendezvous
0	shall we be friends , shall we make a league—not against but for him ?
0	finally it was a fact that the whole development of music in gerlnany strove towards the word-tone drama of wagner and therein found its goal
0	the moon stood high and small between fleecy clouds , and the little fountain splashed in the stillness over the over-hanging boughs of the walnut tree
0	after that he went often
0	vvell , lnstitoris did not shriek , on the contrary he spoke rather softly , , vith a lisp , even , vhen he celebrated the italian l : tenaissance as a time that reeked of blood and beauty
0	the weaknesses of my character are beyond question
0	they are to be had everywhere here , joachim said , even in shops where you would least expect it
0	as regards the disinfection , they must show a neat profit there , they never could have used ten francs ’ worth of hco to smoke the american woman out
0	his natural , un- concealed , and amusingly parodied fear of not getting enough to eat was irresistibly comic ; with goggling eyes he chewed a tongue sandwich in imitation of a starving man
0	but it is his own fault , the consul almost shouted , and then , with a glance at the dining-room door , lowered his voice
0	oh , yes , you must
0	what i heard , what i took in , is quite irrelevant
0	i am a woman steeled by adversity ; i have learned to bear the truth
0	since he came back for good , she seems to have taken to him
0	settembrini took the other from ferge ’ s hand
0	sometimes , when he took counsel with himself on the possibilities of a shift , he had , during these years , considered choosing mathe- matics , in which , when he was at school , he had always found '-good entertainment ( his very words )
0	and tool { it for a gift , with the bearing of one who had certainly said he would not give money for it
0	do you mean what you say ?
0	that , vas feeling : despite everything it tempted me to give his hand a stolen pressure
0	if it were just a visit to amsterdam that you were thinking of -- but to leave us for ever -- !
0	the dressmaker confessed to the same temperature , but she on the contrary felt excited , tense , and restless , as though some important event were about to happen , which was certainly not the case ; the excitation was purely physical , quite without emotional grounds
0	an odd man , and of great personal weight , though incoherent
0	yes , i vvould go so far as to reckon , vith the possibility that i-ielmut himself knevl the truth : a certain admixture of cul- tured decency , deprecating and regretful toleration , and -love of peace , speal { s for the supposition , and it does happen far from seldom that society takes the spouse for the only blind one , while he thinks that except for limself no one knows anything
0	the flesh , ladies and gentlemen , is—not another word
0	principles and premises re-mained unclear , and his mind , unpractised in such readings , was not able to follow certain trains of thought
0	at the schwarzkopf a ' ?
0	and what i am calling your attention to is the fact , which i observe with indignation , that you are still dividing the world up into opposing factions
0	it was a great success , not least for rudi himself
0	and that mazurka—or whatever her name is—seemed rather silly to me
0	it would neither please nor displease him -- he would simply be mildly surprised , that is all
0	i depend upon you
0	this meant in a way a de- parture from the abstract universal letter-script , not bound up with speech ; in a way a return to the word-writing of earlier peo- ples
0	followed by a troop of guests , two singular figures entered
0	they were present at all these scenes ; space was annihilated , the clock put back , the then and there played on by music and transformed into a juggling , scurrying now and here
0	the voice dwelt on the word human—dreamily , fanatically ; and accented arrogance on the final syllable
0	voltaire ’ s attitude was that of a worthy descendant of those old gauls that shot their arrows against the heavens
0	for it was plain that when one set about it like that , one could go pretty far without shocking anybody
0	the munich i speak of is the munich of the late regency , with only four years between it and the war , whose issue was to turn its pleasantness to morbidness and produce in it one sad and gro- tesque manifestation after another ; this capital city of beautiful vistas , where political problems confined themselves to a capri- cious opposition between a half-separatist folk-catholicism and the lively liberalism professed by the supporters of the reich ; munich , with its parade concerts in the feldherrenhalle , its art shops , its palaces of decorative crafts , its recurring exhibitions , its bauern-balls in carnival time , its seasonal marzhrliu carouses and week-long monster fair on the oktoberwiese , 'where a stout and lusty folkishness , now long since corrupted by modern mass methods , celebrated its saturnalia ; munich , , vith its residuary wagnerism , its esoteric coteries performing their resthetic devo- tions behind the siegestor ; its bohemia , well bedded down in pub- lic approval and fundamentally easy-going
0	in the evening , after he had drunk his beer , hans castorp felt heavier in the limbs and more chilled and exhausted than on the day before ; toward nine o ’ clock he bade his cousin good-night , drew his plumeau up to his chin , and slept like the dead
0	you are still a very young girl , you know
0	he does not hate anybody
0	but he was silent
0	one comes , even if one is an im- presario , first of all to salute a great man
0	scious being , ichthyosaurus-being , was no good , and today one must consciously not be wanting , one must assert one 's specific form of life with an articulate feeling of self
0	the military always has to reckon on coming to grip with death , just as the clergy has
0	that was a piece of majestic tomfoolery—when one is moved one can say things that sound crass and irreverent , but are after all more solemn than the conventional religious formulas
0	he could see now that this had been very reasonable advice ; settembrini had been wrong to sneer at it as he had—settembrini , with his republic and his bello stile
0	'what do i care about your damned fiddle ?
0	they refuse themselves to our understanding , and will , painfully enough , continue to do so
0	his trousers were of an indefinite grey-green colour and too short
0	the chairs cost twenty-five marks apiece
0	or , more probably , for what profession are you preparing yourself ?
0	that is— he said
0	indeed he seemed not far from a sudden determination to fling his paper upon the chair he sat in , to escape by the hall door and exchange the empty gaieties of the salon for the frosty solitude of his balcony , and the society of his maria
0	't is all about they , -- now
0	will you sub- stantiate the report of your stupidity and wear a bell even as a cat , that you will base business and promise on so elastic , so en- snaring a concept as love ?
0	lust of the flesh
0	he had probably come hither to get more money out of his mother , besides the passage money his father sent him
0	surpassingly brilliant , in the grand sty ie , he presented the mythology of music at the same time with that of the world ; in that he bound the ltiusic to the things and made them express themselves in music , he created an apparatus of sen-
0	the hofrat , as he examined , continued to let fall remarks , in resigned and dreary tones—for he was such a master of auscultation that he could listen to a man ’ s inside , dictate what he heard to his assistant , and talk about something else all the time
0	this death , which could at no time have moved him greatly , and after the lapse of years could scarcely move him at all , meant the sundering of yet another bond with the life below ; gave to what he rightly called his freedom the final seal
0	and there could be on earth nothing more tender than the next number he chose : a duet from a modern italian opera , a simple , heartfelt mingling of emotion between two beings , one part taken by the world-famous tenor who was so well represented in the albums , the other by a crystal-clear and sweet little soprano voice ; nothing more lovely than his da mi il braccio , mia piccina and the simple , sweet , succinct little melodic phrase in which she replies
0	for long before i dal- lied with the poison butterfly , my froward soul in high mind and arrogance was on the way to satan though my goal stood in doubt ; and from youth up i worked towards him , as you must know , indeed , that man is made for hell or blessedness , made and foredestined , and i was born for hell
0	he rows the messengers to the stone of penance and they cry up to it : gregory , thou man of god , come down to us from the stone , for god wills for thee to be set up for his vicar upon earth !
0	in his wizened red hand he holds a bunch of pale-coloured roses , which are a little past their best , and slowly shed their petals on the carpet
0	hans castorp expressed it : a cigar like that is alive—it breathes
0	when it was over , the cousins walked down to the platz ; joachim seemed preoccupied ; hans castorp was in an agony of snuffles and cleared his rasping throat continually
0	the two clasped hands through the open window
0	yes , you bought me a glass of lemonade from the next booth
0	then the senator got up from his chair , which fiete drew away behind him , and went with shuffling steps into his office to get a cigar
0	thus he grumbled on , and could endure to grumble , for had he not maria ?
0	clavdia brushed hans castorp ’ s table with the folds of her new gown , and crossed the room to where young gänser and the kleefeld were sitting
0	but mamsell jungmann only replied , you will see , child
0	rickchen severin , ida jungmann 's successor , who now reigned over the frau consul 's household and managed the servants , had a peasant 's instinct for hard facts
0	as they left the last houses behind , tony bent forward to look at the lighthouse ; then she leaned back and closed her tired and burning eyes
0	thoughts like these , un-christmaslike though they were , troubled everybody in the room
0	the desperate dance , in which thy fortunes are caught up , will last yet many a sinful year ; we should not care to set a high stake on thy life by the time it ends
0	his reddish-blond hair was grown so thin that nearly all the cranium was bare
0	it , vas easy to say that it came from the devil
0	rudolf as bishop of olmiitz was to take place , could not possibly be kept to
0	peter d�ann nearly fell over with laughing when he saw christian with the bouquet
0	if we had a little frost , or snow , now -- but rain , filth -- very , very unpleasant
0	he asks , and winks
0	but he was mindful of them ; i could not shake off the conviction
0	i know you are poking fun at me
0	says the one labourer to the other
0	one sees now that it did not happen so soon
0	so , courteous and beloved brothers and sisters , have i borne me , and let nigromantia , carmina , incantatio , veneficium , and what names so ever be all my aim and striving
0	he might say it with his head thrown back , his nose wrinkled up , mouth wide open , hands swishing about in the air , with a long-drawn-out , nasal , metallic sound , like a chinese gong ; or he might , with still funnier effect , toss it out , gently , en passant ; or with any one of a thousand different shades of tone and meaning
0	during those days of stifling expectation , when the nerves of europe were on the rack , hans castorp did not see herr settembrini
0	once in a while a big flounder gave such a desperate leap that he sprang right off his slab and fell down upon the slippery pavement , among all the refuse , and had to be picked up and severely admonished by his possessor
0	if it should be the case that your feelings did not bind you indis-solubly to your husband -- she looked at him with uncomprehending , tear-streaming eyes
0	the balcony ran across the house and was divided into small separate compartments by opaque glass partitions , which did not quite reach to the balustrade
0	there is in all this monstrousness nothing that could appeal to the likes of me as goodness , beauty , greatness ; and i shall never un- derstand the glory-to-god mental attitude which certain tem- peraments assume when they contemplate the works of god , meaning by the phrase the physics of the universe
0	she held a large cup in both tiny hands , entirely concealing her face , and drank her milk with little sighs of satisfaction
0	thus they came upon the subject of torture—introduced by wehsal , to whom , it seemed , it made a particular appeal
0	could any one help it , i ask you , tom ?
0	it gradually came about that chris-tian freed himself largely from the constraint of office hours
0	but what was lliat to him ?
0	but it was not alone this lack of formality and absence of distinctions that made her feel strange and unsympathetic
0	it too had probably come into the house through the offices of the keen-nosed rosenstiel : it was the ecstatic nar- rative of viechthiid of magdeburg
0	rudi took his stand on the interpretation , not so much popular as bourgeois and official , that the king was completely crackers as he put it
0	it is a good long journey from munich !
0	i am sweating somewhat , he said
0	but tony and morten spent the afternoon in a distant spot , at the edge of the yellow loam , where the waves hurled their spray as far up as sea-gull rock
0	it was a feat , and he could perform it
0	the revival of ritual music from a profane epoch has its dangers
0	they make quite a joke of it
0	i saw it at our first meeting
0	dr faustus the opportunity for comparison and study
0	but from the very first day after our marriage you have sat with me only in the evening , and that only to read the paper
0	worth dwelling upon , communing with in the depths of one ’ s—in order to—understand me , my child : as a term of endearment—the pet name
0	as i told you , he is personally poor ; that is to say , without possessions
0	without the cholesterin , it is hard to imagine touching the human skin at all
0	she came to him
0	but listen , professor , it seems to me then , he has no occasion to stick at the terrorism in my cousin ’ s profession
0	you know how shrewd and resourceful i am
0	he refrained from saying that he had been up here since a good deal longer than yesterday
0	the dizzying problem of identities grew grander in its scale
0	under certain conditions , human heads , faces , full-length phantoms manifested themselves before the eyes of the experimenters , even within certain limits entered into contact with them
0	the fresh morning bloom disappeared from her cheek , and she even grew a little pale
0	look at that , for instance
0	the sky was blue , with a few light floating clouds in it , silvered by the rays of the sun , the strength of which was indeed not so great but that the stove was already going , behind the polished screen in the landscape-room
0	he was nervous ; visibly started when he saw the cousins , and seemed embarrassed over the necessity of passing them
0	shall i confess that , privately and apart from the his- torical point of view , i felt a deep , intimately personal shame ?
0	thus he betrayed the direction of his plans for a profession : it turned out ( i pur- posely repeat the expression i used to describe the moment when by a chance word he betrayed his religious inner life ) , it turned out that he intended to study theology
0	why , even the lamps are not lighted
0	risks were taken now and then
0	they talked for another quarter-hour while hans castorp unpacked his night and toilet things , smoking a large , mild cigarette the while
0	it would probably be better to paint her from memory , instead of having her sit
0	to his earlier reports he added that joachim had now taken to his bed ; that he had said nothing , but the wish to have his mother by him could be read in his eyes , and hofrat behrens agreed that it would be well
0	fragnents of grown-up language came too : if he had not remembered something , he said it had slipped his mind
0	german make , you know , we do them far and away better than anybody else
0	for some while , for purposes of comparison , he tapped by turns on the lefthand side near the collar-bone , and then somewhat lower down
0	it must be clever , witty , and effective , must at one and the same time wound him to the quick and impress him tremendously
0	the return of the pencil was of the simplest formality , quite after hans castorp ’ s heart— indeed , he prided himself on it no little , in the vainglorious state his intimacy with hippe produced
0	this lower lip came out rather strong and full under the short , slightly drooping moustache , with a smile which made a most charming harmony with the blue eyes , a little severe , but a little smiling too , their gaze half absent and half shy
0	she departed in anguish and despair , deaf to all the consolations her parents could give
0	looking back upon the school life now ending ,
0	the young men in their turn thanked their host and took their leave , urged by naphta to come again
0	he is already old—yes ; but even so , i could well understand how you as a woman could love him madly
0	did the soul go to heaven im-mediately after death , or did bliss first begin with the resur-rection of the flesh ?
0	he himself declared his health to be perfect , magnificent ; and one could read in his eyes the , creative energy with which he daily arose to his task
0	others were fishing , lying prone on a jut of rock , waggling one leg in the air , holding the line out over the water , approaching their heads in talk
0	here , suddently , the consul , to his own great surprise and chagrin , burst out laughing
0	that prince who gave behrens his title always did it , they say
0	let us go together , our way is the same : the path on the right that shall lead to the halls of the mightiest dis ’ —ah , virgil , virgil !
0	they and the writing-table or , rather , roll-top desk , which stood between the windows , were of carved mahogany ; the glass doors of the bookcases were lined with green silk
0	there were for instance monkish figures , the invention of popular fantasy , who , quite in the spirit of luther , had set up wine , women , and song in opposition to the ascetic idea
0	he said it aloud and snorted through his nose , bent over , sobbed , and could not control himself
0	i was sure that you , as a literary man— settembrini put out his hand , laid his head on one side , and closed his eyes
0	and this also was confirmed by the chorus amid an ever-increasing tumult
0	true , the sundays , particularly the fortnightly one with the concert—it was the second hans castorp had spent in this situation—gave him a fixed point
0	i recall that we paused by the cow trough , took a few steps away from the path and looked into it , with the reflection of the setting sun in our faces
0	he kissed her again , on the lips and the eyes
0	not too clear-headed himself , he turned his wineglass about on the table , one hand in his trouser pocket , one eye clipped shut against the smoke of the cigarette he held in the corner of his mouth
0	clarissa , she said , loved her profession and did not falter in pursuit of it , despite a certain coldness on the part of the public , carping critics , and the impertinent cruelty of this or that producer who tried to distract her by calling tempo , tempo !
0	it is , if i am not mistaken—look , ladies and gentlemen , look , my child
0	we , the bourgeoisie -- the third estate , as we have been called -- we recognize only that nobility which con-sists of merit ; we refuse to admit any longer the rights of the indolent aristocracy , we repudiate the class distinctions of the present day , we desire that all men should be free and equal , that no person shall be subject to another , but all subject to the law
0	is it not well done that our language has but one word for all kinds of love , from the holiest to the most lustfully fleshly ?
0	but the theological ones , which i - though not regularly - at- tended on his account , were for me a more doubtful pleasure ; and i went to them only in order not to be cut off from what occupied him
0	twenty-five years ago at the very last moment we escaped that fate
0	the out-of-town families , from hamburg and frankfort , came to the funeral and , for the last time , re-ceived hospitality in meng street
0	it is the same thing , i suppose , as when you have fever—there are pretty lively goings-on in the system then too , to talk the way you do ; it may easily be that one involuntarily tries to find an emotion which would explain , or even half-way explain the goings-on
0	the thunder strikes , does it ?
0	the strict observance meant the broadening and deepening of the traditions of the order , it meant referring its historical origin back to the cabalistic world , the so-called darkness of the middle ages
0	she disliked to interfere , but hans castorp would forgive her if she suggested that they had had enough for the time
0	i-ie was also a good fellow and an artist , and the fact that adrian and he were later actually per du and called each other by their first names i should like not to regard as a cheap triumph of schwerdtfeger 's mania for pleas- ing people , but rather to refer it to his honestly recognizing the value of this extraordinary human being
0	frau stöhr became almost hysterical
0	herr modersohn pulled up the chair with trembling hands , and the director sat down beside the dais
0	do you think that jealousy dwells in the height and not also , , in 'the depths ?
0	but he does not see them , this fat man with the snub nose !
0	frau permaneder 's dignity became majestic , and the smile of the misses buddenbrook more and more pointed
0	he added after a pause : i should not like to be going with it
0	he did not even consider going to the courts with it
0	that might have been rough on all of our corns !
0	he answered and answered wildly -- the quarrel reached a height far greater than the one that had signalized herr permaneder ?
0	my words , i say , betray a state of mind in anguished conflict between a pal- pitating impulse to communicate and a profound distrust of lly own adequacy
0	no , our prospects are not too bright
0	for one brief hour after the evening meal social relations of a sort did obtain
0	we never put a penny by
0	but the reader need not fear that in him another occasion for pedagogic strife has arrived upon the scene
0	when you postulate independent being for individuals , when you transfer the essence of things from the universal to the particular phenomenon , which thomas aquinas and bonaventura , as good aristotelians , did , then you destroy all unity between the world and the highest idea ; you place the world outside of god and make god transcendent
0	of the caricature of humanism not adrian but shake- speare was guilty , and from shakespeare too come the ideas wrenched out of their order in which the conceptions culture and barbarism play such a singular role
0	and there was a stink—the shock went to my sense of smell and i got an awful stench of hydrogen sulphide , the way it must smell in the bad place ; with all that i heard myself laughing as i went off—not the way a human being laughs—it was the most indecent , ghastly kind of laughing i ever heard
0	he let out a stream of ha ha 's all run in together
0	but to return : it was not alone these meetings that sustained the relation between master and pupil
0	these last had been purchased by the director , and were nearly all still-lifes of edibles or nude figures of women , for such was hugo weinschenk 's taste
0	but i have told you this in order to ask you if you think i should have the right , or the courage , or the inner self-confidence to behave in the same way to herr von maiboom if , when we met to discuss the bargain , he were to forget to offer me a chair ?
0	but even so—we live here close together , a sympathy springs up between man and man , intellectual and emotional sympathy—it has been a full week that we have not seen you
0	item : vve struck a bargain , and the churl shewed me every- thing , two whole hours , took me everywhere : to the paulnskirche with wondrously chamfered cloisters , the thomaskirche on ac- count of johann sebastian , and his grave in st john 's , where is also the reformation monument , and the new cloth hall
0	but one must fight against them , after all , for they are two-faced , they are in the highest degree equivocal , everything depends upon the point of view
0	but the distinction was not such a simple one to make
0	in short , it might even be said that such an excursion was more fitting , morally spoken , than many another , than the cinematograph or the bob-sleigh races , for example—and surely it was no more than proper to make those lying up there a visit once in a way , as a comradely attention , provided one did not regard it as in the same class with an ordinary walk or excursion to a point of interest
0	i will not assert that i have understood all your involved german ideas ; but it sounds human and good , and you are good , a good young man
0	she loved and looked up tu her brother , who had felt for her pain in that departure from travemiinde , and she respected him as the future head of the firm and the family
0	it was hardly out of shyness that tony had refused the kiss
0	that kind nature held sleep ready , to take up the con- versation and rock it in forgetfulness , was a grateful circum-
0	well , i get behind him , and i manage to keep close behind his back whichever way he turns , the old mystic !
0	they gave themselves over to a blissful far niente , enlivened by scraps of conversation in which , out of sheer high spirits , no one hung back
0	they had asked permission of the monks to sit there and it had been benignly granted
0	the fact makes little claim upon our emotions , the change being so slight between his one state and his next
0	i mean the formal manner you assume toward madame—and toward no one else in our little circle , on our walks and excursions
0	in any marriage , the important thing is , on which side the moral ascendency lies
0	stop petting your condition and talking about it !
0	the salon , which takes up the whole other half of the parterre , has new yellow blinds now and looks very well
0	next came the turn of little erica
0	you fired in the air , naphta said collectedly to settembrini , letting his own weapon sink
0	what did i think ?
0	it would seem perfectly weird to me
0	after all , his father 's second marriage had been of much the same kind
0	there is a letter which adrian at about the time of the bullinger dinner wrote to schwerdtfeger , who should of course have destroyed it but which , partly out of sentiment , partly as a trophy he did in fact preserve
0	we may hope that the reasonable frau ziemssen drew comfort therefrom ; his assurances , at least , were in a very large degree justified by the event
0	he hardly even ought to be up here , he has no cavities at all
0	a pleasant man , commented the frau consul innocently
0	how pretty , she said uncomprehendingly
0	once more he had lighted a maria mancini , and this time he smoked it to the end , no matter how it tasted
0	this late summer is treacherous—it can turn to winter inside an hour
0	if there is anything he can not abide , if there 's one thing in the whole world he can not stomach , it is destructive criticism
0	well , suddenly there was the whole audience !
0	thus the sonorous melody presses on up to nearly the height of a climax , which , in accordance with the law of economy it avoids at first , gives way , ] eav
0	ye would forsoothe sit there against me on the sofa and speak outwardly to me in good kumpfish , in old- german snatches ?
0	a relative of the pastor 's shot him somewhere in the heart of russia , and now he stands below in the vestibule with a card-tray between his paws
0	they also sang a few verses out of the hymn-book , accompanied by the frau consul on the little organ
0	the papers , already half-unmuzzled , register the truth
0	she must get it from me , tom
0	frau schwarzkopf ran off and made coffee , and they supped in the green verandah as they used to -- only all of them were a good ten years older , and morten arid little meta were not there , she having married the magis-trate of haffkrug
0	do you want to be bank-rupt too ?
0	ellen , rooted to the spot , half joyful , half terrified , cried out : oh , sophie , is that you ?
0	there , he said , when hans castorp lay at last limbless and cylindrical in his chair , with the yielding roll at the back of his neck , quite worn out with all these gymnastic exercises ; there , nothing can touch you now , not even if we were to have ten below zero
0	he seemed to be of opinion that two years ago he had been per du with adrian ,
0	how extraordinary the word sounded , in schlepp- fuss 's mouth !
0	his eyes—in their leaden sockets—went from the little object to clavdia ’ s tartar physiognomy
0	the medium , dr krokowski went on , obviously addressing his words to hans castorp in particular , no longer needed to be put in the trance by the physician
0	like the most ridiculous kind of farce ?
0	still waters were known to run deep
0	she insisted that , if the two children wished to be together , kai could visit hanno instead
0	this en passante my condition , vas clear and direct , determined by the legitimate jealousy of hell
0	he did him up—the right phrase for it—and there , in the autumn sunlight , in a chair whose qualities should be sung rather than spoken , he let him lie , until a clanging gong summoned the patients to the midday meal
0	my friend , said he , probably they have not been waiting for me to say so ; but that is a perfect piece of music
0	he it was who had sharpened the wits of the florentines , taught them the art of language , and how to guide their state according to the rules of politics
0	it might be better to talk a little oneself
0	you know he is a very good , hard-working man , and in a way a model husband ; he ne\cr stops in anywhere , but comes straight home from the office and spends all his free time with us
0	summer holidays at the seashore !
0	i really must root out some old volume of botany or other , and polish up my knowledge in this field—my hat , how gay it ’ s getting to look in the world !
0	are you in your senses ?
0	she occupied herself with no art or science , but laid stress on acting as daughter of the house
0	or do you think you would be disturbing me ?
0	i am sure you wo not take it ill of me for confiding in you
0	and our schoolmaster himself ?
0	no , you don ’ t , said he , suddenly , between his teeth , and halted
0	i do not say , went on dr grabuw , in his gentle voice , that your dear mother will be walking out to-morrow
0	it will be interesting to see what happens then
0	the old man had seen it , and stormed so you could hear it all over the place
0	the silence of the crowd , as the illusion passed , had about it something nerveless and repellent
0	been impossible either to do away with these or to prevent them from gaining ground ; in the end the dear baroness had had to be placed in professional care
0	his contemplation of its inner aspect was bound up in the young man ’ s mind with a host of problems and discriminations , not of a kind the good joachim had need to concern himself with , but for which hans castorp had come to feel as a civilian responsible
0	he has sunk down in the bed , with his knees wide apart
0	i remember this conversation most vividly
0	at five o'clock frau permaneder let herself be carried away by her feelings , and committed an indiscretion
0	for at that depth light has codle to an end ; or rather , a new , un- known , irrelevant , vorld here begins , irrto which adrian with his guide , vent down to nearly fourteen times that depth , some thirty-six hundred feet , and there remained for half an hour , al- most every molllent painfully awarc that a pressure of five hun- dred thousand tons rested upon their shelter
0	tony , who looked forward extravagantly to life in a large city , had expressed the wish to settle in hamburg itself , and indeed in the spitalstrasse , where herr gr� 's office was
0	the servant came through the hall , knocked on the glass door , and waddled in to bring the frau consul a visiting-card
0	but if they had no sun , they had snow
0	however , there was no doubt everybody in the circle knew that hans castorp was hard hit by the wholly unforeseen circumstance , which frustrated all the hopes he had cherished against the return of his carnival partner
0	i see , he said , my dear child , that you are actuated by good and praiseworthy motives
0	but they both set to work to talk him out of the idea , and he let himself be moved on
0	oh , give me a kiss , tom , she said , sat up to offer him her cheek , and then sank back again
0	it was near the end of october , the weather , still dry , was already raw and gloomy
0	dazed he sits in the long grass and rubs his eyes—a man who , despite many warnings , had neglected to read the papers
0	on thursday at four o'clock the usual guests came
0	shrieked josephus as they passed through the waiting-room
0	he came to the conclusion that fritz rotbein ’ s sex was , so to speak , neutralized by his mortal state ; also that there was no need of a birthday to serve as excuse , since the dying are to be treated as though in enjoyment of a permanent birthday
0	but with august bad weather set in , cloudy and damp ; with first a sleety drizzle and then actual snow
0	his curiosity was for the time quenched
0	the air was warm and sweet ; it seemed as though the peaceful sounds about him strove to lull him to sleep
0	he asked how many there are of us , and things like that
0	on closer acquaintance , indeed , one got the impression that her reason had suffered on the rack of continual boredom
0	with april , cold , wet , cloudy weather set in
0	hans castorp hastened to carry frau chauchat ’ s portrait into the next room and hang it once more on the wall
0	then he added aloud : go to bed , tony
0	and in them it is united to a rare degree with a brilliant cosmopolitanism , an elegance , an aristocratic bearing , which i find most attrac-tive , frau consul
0	yea , verily , as fas-
0	still he smoked on , as he watched joachim making ready for his cure , putting on his house jacket , then an old overcoat , then , armed with his night-lamp and russian primer , going into the balcony
0	he was grown strong and sturdy , and his manly clothes made him look still older
0	in this building lights were beginning to show
0	so much for tonight about the national sanction
0	it took place in the break between the last two periods , a history and a drawing hour for hans castorp ’ s form ; the pupils were walking up and down , or standing about in groups , or lounging against the glazed abutments of the school-building wall
0	then he too went away—to tell truth , hans castorp was not sorry to see the backs of them both , the narrow-eyed one and the pedagogue ; he could the better devote himself to the singing , and draw comfort from the reflection that all over the world , even in the most extraordinary places , music was made—very likely even on polar expeditions
0	well , that ’ s a long time ago
0	could i help it ?
0	the frau senator , of course , felt a joyous satisfaction with the good bourgeois settlement her child was making , to which she had materially contributed by the entertaining she did and the social activities of her home
0	frau chauchat had crossed one leg over the other again , and her knee , even the whole slender line of the thigh , showed beneath the blue skirt
0	the synopsis , he said , softly and politely , craning his neck forward with a nervous smile
0	i should never have admitted it to you if you had not , as you put it with such old-world poetry , let me read in the book of your heart
0	nowhere do the wind instruments cover up the strings , but always allow them to have their own say and alternate with them ; only in a very few places are strings and wind instruments combined in a tutti
0	the village carpenter , vas called in to measure the space beside the doors in the abbot 's room for shelves to hold adrian 's books , not higher than the old panelling under the leather hangings ; also the chandelier with the stumps of wax candles was wired for elec- tricity
0	and yet to have the privilege of listening to herr settembrini , to get the benefit of his good counsel , i could almost wish to keep my fever , and stop up here with you indefinitely
0	me—no , said his uncle
0	not only with the little sea-aid 's knifelike pains did leverklihn at the time of his worst state of health compare his own torments
0	the relations between the head of the firm and his younger brother had not improved
0	if it has done me good to be up here ?
0	then he got up
0	since the previous morning they had not spoken of what lay before them , and silently now they moved down the corridor together
0	he attended lectures in philosophy and the history of music ; read and t : xcerpted in the
0	i was really ashamed for him
0	the thing to do was to write , to write this evening -- not on the business paper with the firm name , but on his own personal letter-paper with senator buddenbrook stamped across it
0	i have begged driinliuh again and again to get a coupe , for it is really a necessity out here
0	here no one can follow me who has not as i have experienced in his very soul how near xstheticism and barbarism are to each other : xstheticism as the herald of barbarism
0	he was a man of medium size , with thin grey hair , a curled olympian beard , and short-sighted prominent sapphire-blue eyes gleaming behind his spectacles
0	without it , how could the word have been written down that pressed to be vvritten do , vn : pray for me !
0	through adrian 's letters , as well as by word of mouth when i came home in the holidays , i shared in these conquests , and i will not deny that sometimes , despite my knowledge of his facility , i was concerned for his strength
0	many tourists and sportsmen were said to have arrived and taken up residence at the hotels in the dorf and the platz
0	are they pleasant people ?
0	i-iereupon she offered her guests coffee and pound-cake ; but schildknapp and adrian preferred to spend what time they had left looking at the house and grounds , if she would be so good as to show them
0	we must begin to say good-bye
0	it lies , though we do not say so , be- tween rome and florence
0	mais oui , certainement , let us sit down , many thanks , a thousand thanks !
0	spirits were very high at all seven tables when the guests assembled for the evening meal ; there was every indication that the fun begun abroad would continue in the same key within doors
0	what do you mean , uncle niko ?
0	theologically speaking , kumpf was a representative of that middle-of-the-road conservatism with critical and liberal traits to which i have referred
0	hans castorp knew—without putting it into so many words—why he lent an ear to herr settembrini
0	she vas a stately roman matron , with arched upper lip , not very dark , the good eyes and hair were only chestnut brown , with at most a faint silver network on the smooth head
0	i could not help marking my farewell by ' calling him by name - his first name , as was natural to me , but he did not follow suit
0	he smoked his pipe , talked in his curious dialect , and displayed an inexhaustible power of sitting still
0	hans castorp , indeed , had so much food for thought in the events of the past three weeks , so much to ponder in his present state and what might come of it , that although two bound volumes of an illustrated periodical from the berghof library lay upon his night-table , he had no need to resort to them
0	hans castorp sat near the open door to the music-room , with his back to the portières , on a chair that happened to be standing there , a plush-covered chair in renaissance style , with a high straight back , and no arms
0	he had his father 's deep-set blue observant eyes , though their expression was perhaps more dreamy ; but his features were clearer-cut and more serious , his nose was prominent and aquiline , and his cheeks , half-covered with a fair curling beard , were not so plump as the old man 's
0	tell me , for pity 's sake !
0	these are the impressions i got this morning
0	on the right , at the height of a storey above the passageway , a scaffolding of ungainly but neatly varnished rafters thrust out from the wall , supporting the servants ' quar-ters above
0	i was not able to prevent it , clavdia
0	what are you crying about ?
0	here there was another quick withdrawal of the hand which he had tried to take as he pleaded with her
0	she saw ; and beside her , hans castorp saw too
0	yes , you will see , that 's what i shall do
0	tubercles developed , the size of a millet-seed , composed of cells resembling mucous membrane , among or within which the bacilli lodged ; some of these were extraordinarily rich in protoplasm , very large , and full of nuclei
0	miss weichbrodt did not have a large number of pupils
0	what have you against the body ?
0	the consul compressed his lips again
0	in brief , he had cast such an equivocal light upon the disease that his hearers were bound to see , in popoff ’ s seizure , an illustration of the lecture , an awful manifestation and mysterious scandal
0	ac- cent lay had always to be presented by a master , the unac- cented by a servant
0	he thought , and thrilled
0	christian , with artless indiscretion , had made a highly un-desirable , a compromising remark , which a number of people had heard ; and thomaj , furiously angry , irritated to the last buddenbooks degree , had called him to account
0	the lady from minsk , who shattered her health on the point of a quarrel with her corsetière , the raging schoolboy , wiedemann and sonnenschein , the polish earboxes—drearily he thought of them
0	he could al-ways get the last word and have the laugh on his side
0	well , said the senator , harshly , there is no pleasure in that
0	but on the other hand , they would be taken up with packing and leave-taking
0	kaisersaschern harboured more than one such specimen ; the most popular , most teased and feared was cellar-lise , so called because she lived in a basement in little brassfounder 's alley - an old woman whose figure had so assimilated itself to popular prejudice that even the most unaf- fected could feel an archaic shudder at meeting her , especially when the children were after her and she was putting them to : flight by spitting curses
0	and now and then his breast heaved as he caught his breath and was seized with his bronchial cough
0	the horrid details of the death were kept as much as pos-sible from the family , but they flew about the town , and were discussed at length on the bourse , in the club , and at the harmony , in all the business offices , in the assembly of bur-gesses -- likewise at all the balls , dinners , and evening parties , for the death occurred in february of the year ' , and the season was in full swing
0	it was march by the calendar , therefore it was spring , which meant as good as summer ; and they pulled out their summer clothes , to appear in them before autumn should overtake them
0	what were the examinations you have just passed , if i may ask ?
0	she would say to a pupil : don- not be so stu-upid , child , and give two quick knocks on the table with her knuckle
0	this accomplished , they all sat down with good consciences to a lengthy repast , beginning with carp and butter sauce and old rhine wine
0	and she made a very roguish face , and ran her tongue over her lips , a trick she had when she thought of some prank or other
0	the thought of the rules and history dates which he had to get by heart had not lost its power to ! )
0	far beneath us the sea respires slowly , and murmurs a long whispering in its dream
0	you would have to go over
0	to our all-important topic , the opera , and the scene in the fourth act , with the text of which we had been joking , and which , vas among those i definitely wanted to leave out
0	but still more beauties were preparing
0	he doesn ’ t take much stock in me because i don ’ t confide in him enough
0	they fling themselves down before the projectiles that come howling on , then they leap up again and hurry forward ; they exult , in their young , breaking voices as they run , to discover themselves still unhit
0	all honour to thy philosophy , my little german hänschen , she said , and lightly stroked his hair
0	here is the dream hans castorp dreamed : he lay on his back in a sunny , flowerstarred meadow , with his head on a little knoll , one leg drawn up , the other flung over—and those were goat ’ s legs crossed there before him
0	a sapient citizen remarks that if the voting continues to be even , it will be necessary to appoint five arbitrators
0	he drew him to him by the arm and began to tap and listen
0	it wants a bit more cleaning up -- yes , the truth is , we must not let the grass grow under our feet
0	the first lesson , herr ball erst edt 's class in religious instruction , was comparatively harmless
0	we all know that the noble lied sounds rather differently when given as a concert-number from its rendition in the childish or the popular mouth
0	the poetic youth ’ s defection was as a spur to himself and he began to take occasion to perform what services he could for the unhappy woman , in the repeated visits he made to her room : services that required no nursing skill , as , for instance , feeding her the midday broth after his own meal , giving her to drink when the food stuck in her throat , helping her to change her position in bed—for to add to everything else she had a wound from an operation , which made lying difficult
0	by his account , the society was exclusively composed of officers on fire with zeal , moved by the single thought of distinguishing themselves ( insignis esse , in latin )
0	let 's rent the parterre and the second floor , and still we will have a good house , where we can sit and eat our bit of pig 's meat without screwing ourselves up anil putting on so much lug
0	but the ones they did not know i can not see either
0	but these effects were as legitimate as the train of thought pursued by the mind of the learned gentleman , and for that he might claim that it was not only consistent but even inevitable
0	it all seemed to him now quite strange and far away , and he shook his head a little
0	dr mantelsack called on somebody , anybody -- he had lost all desire to test any one
0	the air here con-sumes one -- it accelerates the process of metabolism
0	for next day he would begin again at daybreak
0	in other words , under cover of the bourgeois propriety she had so nostalgically longed for as a refuge , inez lnstitoris lived in adultery with a man in years , a y
0	where would the world be if maturity were the last word ?
0	it was an ordinary consulting-room , like thousands more ; but with certain temporary special arrangements
0	i heard in the 'harmony ' about a remark of yours that you dropped in the club last evening
0	but alas , by that time herr stengel had forgotten their crime
0	if i only knew , i can hear adrian say , breaking the silence , how it is we are so unripe , so young as you say we are , i mean as a people
0	she had made desperate outcry , and the position of the bed had to be altered at once , though it caused her to lie with her face to the light , and thus disturbed her sleep
0	hp looked big and strong enough , but was most unmilitary in speech and manner
0	after all , they belong together
0	that is fat , the hofrat said concisely
0	at nine o'clock the party sat down to supper
0	at last you have come to see us again
0	it was the same when he could not go to adrian in the abbot 's room
0	out of the question to get even a glimpse of any mechanical possibility of explication of such performances on the part of the cell-substance
0	study of the score shows that the most subtle knowledge of the string-quartet medium is involved
0	but that could not prevent buddenbrook the consul from experiencing all the sudden coldness , the reserve , the mistrust at the banks , with friends , and among firms abroad , which such an event , such a weakening of working capital , was sure to bring in its train
0	he is an ass , of course ; but at least he knows some latin
0	it gives it such nobility , i think , such a sort of disinterestedness , and feeling , too , and—and—courtliness—it makes a kind of chivalrous adventure out of it
0	then , at last ; at last , in the weariness after excess , a long , soft arpeggio in the minor trickled through , mounted a tone , unsolved itself in the major , and died in mournful lingering away
0	it would have been useless anyhow
0	they would go with him to his grave -- but were ideals , after all , meant to be realized ?
0	an enterprising female , that
0	he put his finger to his long sharp nose and drew a paper from his coat pocket a profound silence reigned throughout the room
0	the italian had been the only one of the guests after whom hans castorp had expressly asked in these days
0	he was a very good young man
0	how did we do that ?
0	yes , herr ferge was out of bed
0	it would be hard to say what went on in johann budden-brook
0	but that was another matter , and one which hans castorp did not allow to prejudice his judgment
0	and the holy man quite especially so ?
0	music can do that too ; she is an old hand at using opiates
0	had his unwonted irritability , his threats of taking un-sanctified leave , anything to do with marusja ’ s departure ?
0	was all he answered
0	a fly had settled on the quiet brow , and began to move its proboscis up and down
0	hermann hagenstrom looked the city man to the life : an imposing slock exchange figure , in a coat the fur of which seemed a foot long , standing open over an english winter suit of good fuzzy yellow-grepn tweed , he was so uiicom-monly fat that not only his chin , but the whole lower part of his face , was double -- a fact which his full short-trimmed blond beard could not disguise
0	the rosenstiel had begun it differently
0	i could sit for hours and just look at the curtain
0	first editions in germa
0	she made two steps backward and feverishly dried her eyes
0	cried out naphta sharply
0	why , i do not understand you , rudolf , i cried
0	and have you made a rough calculation , tom ?
0	i can see already that our town lawyers will band together to fight him tooth and nail , and that dr hagenstrbm ' a hearers will already be prepossessed in his favour
0	no , mynheer peeperkorn was not the man to be the bearer of logical confusion
0	but hans castorp felt that during these three weeks they ought to have paid more attention , to have kept better watch , as joachim did in his daily measurings , during which the seven minutes seemed like a quite considerable stretch of time
0	a large table was set up under the centre chandelier , chairs and serving-tables put about
0	the rest scarcely interrupted what they were doing as herr ballerstedt came into the room , hung his hat on the door , and betook himself to the platform , he was a man in the forties , with a pleasant embonpoint , a large bald spot , a short beard , a rosy complexion , and a mingled expression of unctuousness and sensuality on his humid lips
0	she talked about voting cham-bers , ballots , and electors , she weighed all the possible eventualities , she could recite verbatim and glibly the oath taken by the voters
0	he breathed upon a crystal and , looking out , saw a thick mist abroad
0	what you say is very well worth hearing— and could not be more—more plastically expressed , i should think
0	he had got free of it in sleep , but the blush had made it set in again
0	but at the same time the seamstress addressed him with a remark , and he had no time to see who the transgressor had been
0	the curtains have been drawn over the window and the verandah door , but somewhere there is a little crack , and through it the red gleam finds its way , not hot , but dazzling , and falls upon frau chauchat ’ s face , so that she shields it with her hand as she sits talking with the concave countryman on her right
0	the doctor finds himself under the necessity of casting about for another cause
0	dh , dear me , no ; quite the contrary !
0	it had to come out— and i suppose i even helped it on myself
0	i preach mathematics—better here , the rhonchi are gone—i tell them that if they will occupy themselves with the study of mathematics they will find in it the best remedy against the lusts of the flesh
0	he struggles , he behaves as if he were really wrestling to express something supremely delicate and difficult
0	shrewd and resourceful , are you ?
0	instead of gradually he said by a little and a little ; instead of i hope he said i hope and trow ; he never spoke of the bible otherwise than as codes boke
0	the consul 's sister was a divorced wife , even if one did not quite give up hope of her re-marrying
0	it should be remarked that these masonic conferences between the pupil and the two mentors took place separated in time , before joachim ’ s return
0	the young frau consul certainly knew how to entertain !
0	you said it was good when there was some other relation besides the lyric—i think that was the word you used—the artistic , that is ; in short , when one looked at the thing from another point of view—the medical , for example
0	it ’ s good for people to be serious , once in a way
0	she seemed to be seeking , to be struggling ; falling this way and that , whispering now to hans castorp , now to the kleefeld , something they could not catch
0	that was what they called the last service of love ; but it happened rather as a service to the survivors than to the dead
0	you can console your- self that there was plenty of play for the fancy you put high above the law , in the free use of the servant notes
0	if it were true that she had suffered during those years through him , he begged her to forget and forgive
0	it asserts itself against impressions that would weaken its force , it will not admit them , it wards them off
0	winged by his genius for flirtation , and , as i fully believe , all unconscious that in substituting his own wooing for adrian 's , his declaration of love remained bound up with an offer of marriage which of his own motion , considering his nature , would never have entered his flirtatious head
0	now , if that keeps on a year or two , and all goes well , the lung gets healed
0	the sound of voices met the consul and his companion a they entered through the narrow door
0	i beg your pardon ?
0	but i also think that a pre- cise account is no longer useful or desirable
0	the servants had more respect for her than for any one else in the family ; it was she who held the services morning and evening now , for the consul could not read aloud without getting a feeling of oppression in the head
0	but they had done well to don overcoats , driving would be cool
0	he wants nothing , buys nothing , and gives nothing away
0	but really one might ask if this were just the right time for so many large words
0	imperceptibly that leaf had turned
0	fhe salon vvas not seldom the scene of small social affairs , into which adrian let himself be dravn , at
0	all the gentlemen turned a moment to press the hands of the sons and brother of the dead once more
0	a sudden noisc'behind him made him start and turn around
0	he whispered ; then his eyes overflowed , he saw no more
0	i will not pretend to being more sharp-sighted than i am
0	without adrian we covered the first hour through the flat and frozen countryside , beguiling the time with sandwiches and red wine brought by my wife
0	the other trees of the region , whether towering or stunted , were evergreen pines and firs , invincible against the assaults of this irregular winter , which might scatter its snow-storms through all the months of the year : only the many-shaded , rust-red tone that lay over the forest gave notice , despite the glowing sunshine , of a declining year
0	so that is why you called him padre !
0	his large nose screwed into countless tiny wrinkles
0	his nerves were terribly affected by the sleepless night he had spent
0	here on the left side , the lower jaw
0	goodness , how fast they got through
0	the cracks in this door were carefully stopped with cotton-wool , and there was nothing to be seen through its panes but the whitish-grey mist beyond
0	no , all that is not quite right
0	with all due reserve it must be asked whether a man who himself belongs among the ailing can give himself to the cure or care of others as can a man who is himself entirely sound
0	pushing and shoving -- entirely without courtesy or elegance
0	he communicated with the husband , and a plea of mutual incompatibility was set up as ground for the divorce
0	but when you get silent : when somebody says something and you are suddenly dumb , and withdraw your-self , quite elegant and remote , and repulse people like a wall and leave the other fellow to his shame , without any chance of justifying himself -- !
0	after all , did they not in a sense belong to the family loo ?
0	but so far there are only the acoustic indications ; real diagnostic certainty we shall only arrive at when i am about again , and the x-ray and photography have taken place
0	consul d�ann cried out , in his broadest accent
0	are you subject to them ?
0	he : let that be
0	and so , when the year was almost half gone , in the month of may , leverklihn , by various means , invited a company to pfeif- fering , all his friends and acquaintances , even some , , , horn he knew but little or not at all , a good many people , as many as thirty : partly by written cards , partly through me , and again by sonle of those invited passing on the invitation to others
0	if you asked her , she would turn this way and that way , and consider -- but she would find nobody
0	i admit that you can ’ t talk about his cleverness
0	he did not , indeed , appear at the early meals of the day , but took them , in company with madame chauchat , in their salon , as they often did of late
0	by the new year he would be promoted to a subalternship—and sent a photograph of himself in the uniform of an officer
0	you once got permission from father -- why , tom , said christian reflectively , i would really rather study
0	but he has a sparse whisker , you could almost count the hairs ; and his eyes are very small and pale , hardly any colour to them at all
0	i suppose they are very respectable affairs—except possibly they get a little drunk , but nothing like what it is at the corps-students ’ —
0	green shades diffused the light over the three rows of desks
0	servant , mademoiselle , he said , as he carefully lifted tony from the caleche
0	oh , it is so sad , so hard !
0	erica rejoiced at every crow she saw ; and ida jungmann , wearing her mackintosh and carrying her umbrella , as she al-ways did even in the most settled weather , rejoiced with her like a good governess who shares not only outwardly but in-wardly in the childish emotions of her charge
0	but after such a day , when he had not seen echo , he liked to go when the child was put to bed , softly , hardly seen , to his
0	and there they found his lifeless body , the mouth still full of half-masticated cake , the crumbs upon his coat and upon the wretched table
0	likewise the parents , retired major gerngross and wife , were touched and pleased ; and since it was impossible , for them , as complete strangers , to guess the givers , fräulein schildknecht could not—she confessed it— refrain from revealing the cousins ’ identity
0	he was an eccentric , hardly ever seen by anybody , busy on his dunghill with his dogs , his chickens , and his vegetable-patch : a large man in top-boots , with a green frie/e jacket
0	vvhen he went to work , he would no longer be free
0	yet again , when he came to speak of the unification and universal well-being of the liberated peoples , there mingled a sound—he neither knew nor willed it , of course—as of the rushing pinions of eagles
0	but it ’ s a pity you won ’ t be here in the winter—you ’ re stopping only eight weeks , i hear ?
0	as far as i am concerned , i can manage
0	there was the morning inquiry , as to whether he had slept well , itself purely rhetorical and summary ; and that aside , the hofrat did not address him with any particularity ; while adriatica von mylendonk—she had , at the time of which we write , a stye in a perfect state of maturity—did so seldom , in fact scarcely ever
0	but this very alternation of vagueness and clarity , of dull incompre-hension with sudden bursts of light , kept him enthralled and breathless , and the hours vanished without his looking up from his book or changing his position in his chair
0	cause it seemed a strange thing for him to do
0	some-times , entirely by accident , perhaps on a walk with the family , he would go into a mill for a chat with the miller , who would feel himself much honoured by the visit ; and quite en passant , in the best of moods , he would conclude a good bargain
0	his classes were much too entertaining
0	no , here i must really corroborate herr settembrini , hans castorp mixed in the dispute , which he had been following as they went , regarding attentively each speaker in turn , with his head on one side
0	one accepts part payment to convince oneself for the time of a debtor 's ability to pay
0	but she lost no time in selling me an excellent thermometer ; if you would like to convince yourself , you can ; it is there on the wash-hand-stand
0	in order to do so , hovvever , one would have to preserve for them while ascending the same tremendous atmospheric pressure they were used to and adapted to in their environment - the same that rested on our diving-bell - a disturbing thought
0	then he mustered his english to inquire of his neighbour on the right what sort of tea she was drinking ( it was made of rose-hips ) and if it tasted good , which she almost passionately affirmed ; then he watched people coming and going in the room ; the first breakfast , it appeared , was not regarded as a regular meal , in any strict sense
0	it may be that , it can only injure it , unless by simply speaking with it , and so lingering it out
0	what did herr settembrini think about delusions ; which were a mixture of actuality and dream , perhaps less strange in nature than to our crude , everyday processes of thought ?
0	but at the middle of the month he had crocked up again , and complained bitterly of his luck
0	it was most agreeable to hear him
0	hans castorp put a dash of cognac in his , to make it more palatable
0	it was a type of face which in this instance , far from seeming an abnormality , was distinctly pleasing , though odd enough to have won for him the nickname of the kirghiz among his schoolmates
0	a gloomy irony lay , i believe , in his , vords
0	of which i have never seen - though in all conscience that does not mean much , since the present writer is little versed in the precious material things of this world
0	madame kethelsen was about forty-eight years old
0	the old couple had given up their bedroom to the frau consul for the time being , to make things easier for the servants , and were sleeping in the unused room in the en-tresol
0	what remains with me is chagrin - and the knowledge that i deserve to be whipped
0	suppose he has outstripped me in business , and even now and then got ahead of me in some public affair ?
0	the rain did not stop
0	how was it justifiable for them to leave people in such uncertainty ?
0	and with joachim it was the same
0	between the hands , half-shrouded in their lace cuffs , their visibly cold , dead fingers artfully arranged to simulate life , was stuck an ivory cross
0	kai came up to him and put his arm across his shoulders
0	i will croak if i do not drink my bottle every day -- i have got as far as that ; and i will croak if i do
0	dh , wait , that is not what i am going to say , nor what i accuse you of
0	thus , or in some such way as in these sinister dreams , can the narrative go to work with time ; in some such way can time be dealt with in a tale
0	she whistled from somewhere inside , and looked at him with her silly , half-shut eyes—it was an extraordinarily unpleasant whistle , harsh and penetrating , yet hollow-sounding ; a long-drawn-out note , falling at the end , like the sound made by those rubber pigs one buys at fairs , that give out the air in a wailing key as they collapse
0	vrsel leverkuhn had already begun to take them on
0	not in the least
0	they lie in the raw-throated north and seem to have been a sort of compensa- tion for the rawness
0	he did not doubt but the matter could be settled to the satisfaction of everybody concerned
0	the buddenbrook ladies marked the look
0	that was why he was against the claims of modesty which were always put forward by those disadvantaged by nature , and declared that only good-for-nothings are modest
0	on the other hand , the contentual time of a story can shrink its actual time out of all measure
0	the reform and revision of the lodges which then took place was in the direction of strict observance in a definitely irrational and mystical , magical-alchemical sense , to which the scottish rite owes its existence
0	but dear me , hans castorp could carry his own coat , couldn ’ t he—and much preferred to ; he had only let the poor creature take it now and then out of sheer good feeling
0	and after adolf todtenhaupt , another pupil , who was but moderately prepared , and did not even know what patula , jovis arbore meant , had been railed on , buddenbrook had to say it
0	he probably had it made after his own design
0	but frau chauchat— tut , she won ’ t , won ’ t she ?
0	it is certainly a desperate situation , and the religious man asks hilllself whether the world really is the single work of a be- nevolent god and not rather a combined effort , i will not say with whom
0	joachim availed himself of his fur sack , and was not deterred from the service of the cure ; but hans castorp took refuge in his room , pushed up a chair to the hot pipes , and remained there , looking with frequent head-shakings at the enormity outside
0	he laughed with his mouth open , in spasms , without a trace of scorn , even good-naturedly , looking at the consul as though he were in-viting him to join in the fun
0	and all the time the man himself must have , if i may say so—you get such a surprise when you first enter his room and see all that silk— ah , yes , smiled settembrini , the taste is very characteristic of him
0	the snow blew inside his collar and melted down his back
0	scarcely daring to venture , but following an inner compulsion , he passed behind the statuary , and through the double row of columns beyond
0	behrens is a cynic himself—but he ’ s a great old bird after all , an old corps-student
0	but not for long
0	but one has to live -- so now there are notes and other debts -- five thousand thaler
0	they laughed over these erudite jests , and looked at hans castorp , who laughed back , raising his glass to his virgil
0	may i beg for admission into this charmed circle ?
0	he gave his short laugh
0	it comprehends all hermetics , all alchemy , it is nothing else than the receptacle , the well-guarded crystal retort wherein the material is compressed to its final transformation and purification
0	indeed , she had small ground to be cheerful ; for the way she debased herself was a sorry sight
0	he turned -- he would not hear any more -- he opened the door
0	dr faustus the railway line to the village of the passion play is for most of the distance the same as the garmisch-partenkirchen line , only branching off at the end
0	the enchanting turn , which we would not touch too nearly in bold words , comes on the phrases upon its branches fair , a message in my ear , yet ever in my breast ; and each time the tenor rendered them , in his clear , warm voice , with his excellent breathing-technique , with the suggestion of a sob , arid so much sensitive , beauty-loving intelligence , the listener felt his heart gripped in undreamed-of fashion ; with an effect the singer knew how to heighten by head-tones of extraordinary ardour on the lines i found my solace there , and for rest and peace are here
0	when you go home to supper , you feel thoroughly satisfied -- satisfied in every limb
0	and now the shimmering chorus of the brasses , from the trim trumpet , visible symbol of the clear call , the sprightly song , the melting cantilena , through that darling of the romantics , the vo- luted valve-horn , the slender and powerful trombone , and the cornet-a-pistons , to the weighty bass tuba
0	good-morning , he greeted her , i hope you slept well and dreamed of your charmer ?
0	then he catches a fish , in whose belly he finds the key once sunk in the depths of the sea
0	are you vexed with me ?
0	she is bathing her doll -- of course , not in real water ; i mean-� she is a wax-doll , she only -- of course
0	then he was silent , gazing at them all ; and finally , with a last murmured strange !
0	he still gazed somnambulantly , but his brows were gathered
0	only later did i learn to understand the composition of the spring festival as what it was : a plea to god , an atonement for sin , a work of attritio cordis , composed , as i realized with shudders , under the threat of that visitor insisting that he was really visible
0	but if , for example , erica should -- if she lives and prospers -- marry here , i should have nothing against it ; that i must say
0	dr faustus sabbath , had once ridden over as an onlooker at the house of wor- ship of those pious folk
0	nearly everybody seemed in good spirits , probably on no other grounds than that they were in numerous company and had no immediate cares
0	my first visit to him was very telling
0	the man who used to come and sit on his sofa and nod at him in the twilight had happily not recurred of late
0	of course , it was scarcely like a real orchestra playing in the room
0	thomas , to whom such orders were familiar , ran off and soon came bark with the two bottles , covered with dust and cobwebs ; and the little dessert-glasses were filled with sweet , golden-yellow malmsey from these unsightly receptacles
0	as for the name of the lively little old lady , joachim , as long as he had been up here , did not know it
0	but there is a sort of irony about it , after all -- irony ?
0	no , in the genuine religion of a genujne fo ] k such co ] ourless theologi- ca ] conceptions as sin and punishment never occurred , in their merely ethical causal connection
0	and now , just as if no one else were here -- you remember ?
0	grobleben is a work-man in one of the consul 's granaries , and he has an extra job , too , at the house , as boots
0	after the meal christian sat downat the little harmonium that stood in the dining-room and imitated a piano virtuoso
0	i ’ ll just sit tight a few minutes and look at these blood-stains—i mean wine-stains—on the sheet
0	the male voice began to choral accompaniment : now the parting hour has come
0	but you can ’ t make me believe you ’ ve still got anything like that the matter with you !
0	he and his sons got up and shook hands with the stranger
0	they have already overflowed the level , rain-lashed land ; the high road , the field road , the boggy ploughed land ; we shadows stand amid and among them
0	gerda is content to have it so , and thus it is settled
0	a group about the punch-table watched the hofrat , who was introducing a new diversion
0	rrhe accommodating local train drew up at the little pfeiffering halt
0	near the bell was a small plate , with the name of lukaçek , ladies ’ tailor
0	his heart beat with a feeling of adventure and audacity , a conviction of the good sense of his modest enterprise , to which , privately , he ascribed a certain symbolic value
0	but we suggest that a young man with a wellregulated conscience and sense of fitness could not , whatever else he did , simply rejoice in frau chauchat ’ s proximity
0	service of the truth and a freely arising conviction of god
0	i ’ ve spent a little money myself to push it
0	mme de tolna was the wealthy widow of a dissipated nobleman , who however had not died of his excesses but in a racing accident
0	and the other , sitting at the table five paces off , nodded to signify that he did
0	i am convinced that our entry into the customs union , so far as the senate is concerned -- herr k�n flung down his cue
0	and all this hans castorp let pass , with perfect equanimity , as much as to say that it was all regular and true to form
0	he was taken from us , that strangely seraphic little being was taken from this earth - oh , my god , why should i seek soft words for the harshest , most incomprehensible cruelty i have ever witnessed ?
0	isn ’ t it—what is the word ?
0	why not take your revenge ?
0	madame buddenbrook put her hand on her daughter-in-law 's arm and looked down at her lap with a giggle
0	he looked across to the landscape-room , as though the real grandmamma might appear there the next minute
0	began the consul again , picking out and fastening his small , deep-set eyes upon a bow-legged young labourer of about two-and-twenty , with his cap in his hand and his mouth full of bread , standing in front of the steps
0	hardly a night passed that little johann did not start up in bed , wringing his hands with every mark of un- bearable anguish , and crying out piteously for help , as though some one were trying to choke him or some other awful thing were happening
0	his round at this time lay not through the corridor , but along the balconies , and he had come through the open door of the loggia with an effect of having flown through the air
0	many that the gentlemen whistled through their teeth and the ladies cheered as well as they could for amazement
0	somewhat later settembrini appeared on the terrace
0	he talked to them about biopsychical projections of subconscious complexes into the objective ; about transactions of which the medial constitution , the somnambulic state , was to be regarded as the source ; and which one might speak of as objectivated dream-concepts , in so far as they confirmed an ideoplastic property of nature , a power , which under certain conditions appertained to thought , of drawing substance to itself , and clothing itself in temporary reality
0	he looked at his cousin , who kept his eyes cast down ; then he said : you take my words far too literally , herr settembrini
0	but despite all that , he knew he had a gentleman before him : the stranger ’ s easy , even charming pose and cultured expression left no doubt of that
0	the principle of the hollow cylinder was illustrated in the structure of the tubular bones , in such a way that the static demands were satisfied with the precise minimum of solid structure
0	the outraged feelings of amneris at this priestly severity had to be imagined , for here the record broke off
0	it was only too natural that they should not enjoy seeing these things so com- petently and carelessly dismissed
0	he felt a sure intuition that the moment was come to break the ban
0	yes , i will play -- i suppose -- though i ought not
0	this poor creature had perceived that , thanks to his sensibility in the matter of slamming doors , a certain emotional attitude toward the russian lady was come to subsist in her young neighbour ’ s mind
0	he was a soldier , was at present in training for an officer
0	we live and learn
0	passions are stirred , ambition and vanity wrestle together in silence
0	settembrini paid it homage
0	but i was feeling febrile even then—for the air up here is not only good against the illness , you know , it is also good for it , it sometimes brings it to the surface—which is of course a necessary step in the cure
0	but they are capable of contracting and dissipating the larger , the very large timeunits , to the point of reducing them to nothing at all
0	but if this first part - in the case of the piece o wie wobl ist zir am abend - had reached the repeated ( 'glocken liiuten and begun the illustrative ding-dang-dong , it now formed the bass not only to wenn zur ruh ' , which the second voice was just then singing , but also to the beginning ' : , < tvie wohl , with which , consequent on a fresh nudge in the ribs , tne
0	and how did the father take this affair ?
0	social relations in the polish group were so elegant , so courtly , so polished , that one could only elevate one ’ s eyebrows and be prepared for anything
0	the mountains held it embraced , theiï tree-clad foot-hills running down to the sea ; they reached in half-circle from the middle distance to the point where he sat , and beyond
0	what a con- frontation was there !
0	now , he said shortly , let us get to the point
0	and consul hagenstrbm appeared in meng street , accom parried by herr gosch , who held his jesuit hat in his hand , crouched over like a conspirator , and peered past the maid into the landscape-room even while he handed her his card
0	this ( ) was the year of the high and miraculous harvest of chamber music : first the en-
0	but also—forgive me the reservation—not free from prejudice
0	he made up for this by his stolen commerce with the schoolmistress at table , when he would sit supporting his chin after the manner of old hans lorenz , and tax the spinster with her weakness for the charming invalid , until her face positively flamed
0	he asked , his voice shaking
0	every one of his remarks showed that he considered the genre of tone-painting , of nature moods , to be fundamentally out of date
0	herr kisten-maker , in fact , had been appointed administrator by the terms of his deceased friend 's will
0	the mother 's telegram announcing the peaceful passing of jonathan leverktihn , the speculator of the elements , found his son standing at the bier of that equally quiet and thoughtful smoker vvith the other dialect
0	above all , the league will strive its utmost to aid with the material at its disposal the political party of progress in every country
0	yes , let ’ s , hans castorp repeated , mechanically
0	logically , of course , each mild case was thus driven to think slightingly of itself ; yet preserved its individual self-respect by merging it with the general , as was natural and human
0	anyhovv , we are not speaking of me but of marie godeau
0	one is carried along -- you see
0	but there were other deaths , and more important ; deaths down in the flat-land , which touched , or would once have touched , our hero more nearly
0	here it is just the other way : , these creatures have put their solid structure outside , not as frame- work but as house , and that it is an outside and not an inside must be the very reason for its beauty
0	and i miss the fish
0	the seconds dragged out , each a martrydom
0	i suspect it is a combination of animal and vegetable poisons , the most powerful known , for it must have worked like lightning
0	on the wall opposite the door were several tall hat-racks with hats and coats
0	they were to dine with gerda , as likewise were the krogers , the weinschenks , and the three misses buddenbrook from broad stieet , while the senator , willy-nilly , must be present at the dinner in the ratskeller
0	then you can not imagine the annoyance and disappointment it is for anyone like me , who have smoked from my youth up , and taken such pleasure in it
0	if i am to sum up the whole impression : it is as though one were lured from a firm and famil- iar setting-out into ever remoter regions - everything comes con- trary to expectation
0	herr andreas pringsheim , pastor marianus , succeeded thus young to the headship of st mary 's after old rolling 's sudden death
0	hans castorp remained silent , and nobody spoke in his place
0	but it seems to me that in the first place you must get out a little , have a little change , and brighten up a bit
0	she keeps giggling and stuffing her handkerchief in her mouth
0	on the contrary , joachim ’ s rash departure did—in honesty—offer his cousin a support , now , before the impossible should become utterly so , a guide and companion on a path which of himself he would never , never find again
0	then they could take mine , and i could find something larger for myself
0	then again they would spend long hours together ; taking walks hand in hand as far as the little one could go , strolling in friendly silence or chatting in echo 's little language , through the countryside lush with the season in which he had come and sv/eet with scents of lilac , alder-bush , and jasmine
0	you know that the photographic plate often shows spots that are taken for cavities when there are none there ?
0	well , the chief came into the office -- there we all lay , eight of us , like flips , and smoked cigarettes to keep the mosquitoes away
0	there are many kinds of torture , castorp , and whichever one you are under , your one desire and longing is to be free of it
0	went along a narrow cross-street into fishers ' lane
0	her elbows rested on the coverlet , her chin was in her hands , whose fingers were buried in her upper lip , and she gazed into the face of her protector
0	then he let them fall against his thighs
0	but grown men behave like that too , sometimes , and it ’ s deplorably feeble of them , of course
0	for your humanity is to-day nothing but a tail end , a stale classicistic survival , a spiritual ennui ; it is yawning its head off , while the new revolution , our revolution , my dear sir , is coming on apace to give it its quietus
0	it vias more like a constant tyranny : the flashing up and stating of a problem , the task of composition ( over which he had heretofore always lingered ) , vas one with its lightning like solution
0	it spelled out something very queer , which none of them succeeded in fathoming , it made the word , or the syllable go , and then the word slanting and then something about hans castorp ’ s room
0	such was the story that consul peter d�ann told at the club that night ; it flew about the town like lightning , and reached the ears of the head master , who asked for an audi-ence with consul buddenbrook
0	i am basted properly , like a roast , a hell-roast ; it is worth seeing , and you are invited to mingle with the deeply interested persons behind the barrier , the magistrates , the invited public , partly in turbans and partly in good old-german caps with hats on top of them
0	he entered and was greeted by marie with surprise and pleasure ; she was about to inform her aunt when he told her , to her increasing if obviously not unpleasant astonish- ment , that her aunt knew he was here and would come in after he had spoken with herself on a weighty and wonderful theme
0	i say no more
0	every pull is a disappointment , there is no sense in forcing it
0	consul dbhlmann added a lewd witticism , with the result that all the gentlemen laughed once more , through their noses
0	you have a sense of satisfaction in it ; you feel easy and comfortable -- you can sit quite still without feeling bored
0	what i do see is the last feeble stirrings of the instinct of self-preservation , the last remnant at the command of a condemned world-system
0	he has had it for years , and goes away in between , but soon has to return again
0	oh , spare me your talk about fate !
0	perhaps she was distressed by his stutter , which just for that reason got worse in her presence and in direct conversation with her
0	of the tears in my father 's eyes , when he said : 'and yet they are dead !
0	oh , no , it was not , not at all !
0	he was looking , it seemed with
0	hich i had only to copy down , actually did not leave my sometimes trem- bling hand any faster than the earlier ones which i composed my- self
0	and naphta sat there , tense and motionless , his lean hands in his lap
0	not al- ways , in fact only seldom were they admitted , which put neither of them off
0	hans castorp later recalled that madame chauchat was wearing that day a goldenyellow sweater , with large buttons and embroidered pockets
0	a story which read : time passed , it ran on , the time flowed onward and so forth—no one in his senses could consider that a narrative
0	the contradiction you imagine you see is at bottom always the same
0	your clavdia appears to be making bread pills
0	you can judge for yourself
0	but there , that is just what it is , she went on , folding her arms , putting her head on one side , and tapping the floor nervously with her foot
0	we might just as well—or more accurately—say it is short , since it consumes whole spaces of time without our living them or making any use of them as such
0	there was nothing against herr permaneder 's good heart
0	the reader can picture adrian 's nlirth at the drolly dejected reproduction of scenes experienced with youthful intensity
0	well , when it is already ten minutes too late , he remembers his appointment and comes upstairs , always two steps at a time , although he knows he will get palpitation at the top
0	am i right , herr settembrini ?
0	i ca not do it
0	he had filled her too full !
0	he spent hours in linking up , in the smallest possible space , chords that together contained all the notes of the chro- matic scale , without their being chromatically side-slipped and without producing harshnesses in their progression
0	ah , it is so brilliantly clear , so overwhelmingly simple !
0	she held her hand out to him ; and lo !
0	inform yourself , but don ’ t try to express your views
0	the consul came at six o'clock
0	and there was a time when you preferred novels and poetry and all that
0	joachim sought for a reply
0	the latter , of course , james assured her
0	he did not give any details of his industry with mr richardson of threadneedle street
0	ursula had thought of adrian
0	i thought , he said in a low , confidential voice , and turned to me suddenly , taking a step forwards and looking at me with a lost , forlorn gaze i shall never forget , i thought he would concede this much , after all , maybe just this ; but no , where should he learn mercy , who is without any bowels of compassion ?
0	and she is a woman of the rarest charms , and i am only an ailing old man
0	it goes through waldshut and pfeif- fering
0	eh bien -- what are you standing there for ?
0	herr albin asked , severely directing his gaze over their heads into vacancy
0	handel said of gluck : my cool { understands more about counterpoint than he does - i love this pronouncccnt of a fellow-musician !
0	let us make a little company , play , and eat and drink
0	but one must never forget that as it stood , straddle-legged , firmly planted on earth , hands behind the back , chest well out , it was the embodiment of irreligion
0	she had in her boudoir a whole tableful of photographs of european celebrities , gratefully dedicated to the reiff hospitality
0	the evening before , the last evening he was about , hans castorp saw him talking to marusja , marusja of the ready laugh , the orange-scented handkerchief , the bosom fair to outward eye
0	i-ie had good prospects of being called one day to the university , of becoming professor , member of the academy and so on ; especially when he , a bachelor from a solid wiirzburg family , in expectancy of a good inheritance , should have enhanced his dignity by setting up a household of his own where he could gather society about him
0	look , it is curious - that is , of course , there is nothing curious about it , but when you make it out the first time for yourself it is curious how it all hangs together and leads round in a circle
0	herr ballerstedt had been too often associated with hanno 's uncle christian in all too purely human affairs , id make him inclined to conflict with johann in an official capacity
0	it finished with cheese straws and bon-bons , to which the guests added coffee and liqueurs
0	repeated the consul , shaking his bent head
0	do you see a way to do that ?
0	as for the last , he liked to make fun of people who are constantly having a little change , constantly getting brown and strong - and nobody knew for what
0	he ran over with friendliness and displayed great tact in chatting with the frau consul and thomas , a� well as with gerda and tony , and even with little erica
0	that shows you how tired i sometimes feel
0	naphta made a wry face
0	at home his favourite tales were about his office in val-paraiso
0	only settembrini was unmoved
0	i once occupied myself with these ideas , at a time when the competition was small |it has since distinctly increased ) , and i made some experiments in 'them
0	take the c-sharp minor nocturne op
0	his eyelashes were colourless by contrast , and so were the eyebrows , one of which he had a habit of lifting expressively
0	yes , castorp , he said—this was the first time he had called the young man simply by his last name—the thing works out præter propter as i thought it would
0	our pharmacology need not be too arrogant over its science ; for the state of its knowledge on the subject of quinine was a fair example of the rest
0	sneezing was much the same thing
0	crresus entertained some fifteen guests at seven-o'clock dinner ; he kept open house , with a trained staff , and a lady housekeeper who presided with affectedly elegant manners and obviously would have liked to marry
0	but she goes on , scorching him with her scorn , mocking him , taking his place and showing in pantomime how at the sound of the horn he lost what little sense he had
0	for a mo- ment i had listened , standing at the door , but not quite liking this i went forward and asked him what he was doing
0	do not venture to measure what it would mean if in this our uniquely frightful extrenity the dam should break , as it is on the point of doing , and there were no nlore hold against the boundless hatred that we have fanned to flame among the peoples round us !
0	so it is decided
0	in the allegro con fuoco the polyphony is given free rein in long lines
0	but your attitude toward suffering can be a european attitude ; it should not be the oriental , which in its soft abandonment inclines so readily to seek this spot
0	and the cold , rejoined the hofrat , where does that come from ?
0	in all the town there was no pleasanter topic of con-versation
0	it drove him on , in hanno 's presence , to self-assertion
0	and still , in those eyes , especially when they gave a side glance , as they often did , there was that timid and defensive look ; while the mouth closed with the old , woebegone expression which he had had even as a baby , or went slightly crooked when he explored the recesses of his mouth for a defective tooth
0	she dismissed the cousins with thanks and expressions of friendliness , which could not but touch them , considering her distressed state , and the bill for oxygen her departed husband had left behind him
0	youths were at work with horses , running hand on halter alongside their whinnying , head-tossing charges ; pulling the refractory ones on a long rein , or else , seated bareback , striking the flanks of their mounts with naked heels , to drive them into the sea
0	it is remarkable what charm this modest yet picturesque corner
0	mortal thinker , influential down the millennia , to whose mediation and sense of history vve owe our knowledge of the pythagorean conception of the world !
0	for the earlier selections , we may flatter ourselves , perhaps , that we have been able to communicate to the reader some understanding , more or less precise , of hans castorp ’ s intimate emotional participation in the chosen numbers of his nightly programme
0	it was a harmless little stone , the size of a hen 's egg , flung by the hand of some chris snut or heine voss to cele-brate the revolution ; certainly not with any bad intent , and probably not directed toward the carriage at all
0	the worst , the actually torturing thing , was the silence
0	but in a few minutes his eyes had roved from the printed page , and he sat for a long time without changing his position , gazing straight ahead of him between the portieres into the darkness of the salon
0	we want freedom , morten said
0	the rack , the pincers , the screws and tongs you saw in these chambers of torment and martyrdom represented the effort of a childish and deluded fancy to emulate what it piously believed to be the sufferings of the eternally damned
0	when , from the point of view of those up here , he considered life as lived down in the flat-land , it seemed somehow queer and unnatural
0	) , i bayed like a wolf , and i can still remember how glad everybody was when it got looser
0	progress , up to now , had had to do , in hans castorp ’ s mind , with such things as the nineteenthcentury development of cranes and lifting-tackle
0	with the intention of detracting from its weight , and so causing it to be forgotten - or more correctly , probably , to make it , out of pride , look as though that were the idea ; for i do not believe the intention existed that i , the reader , should overlook the core of the letter
0	soon after the holidays herr gr� went back to ham-burg , for his flourishing business demanded his personal at-tention ; and the buddenbrooks agreed with him that tony had had time enough before the betrothal to make his ac-quaintance the question of a house was quickly arranged
0	he had succeeded to the headship of the school after the death , soon after , of the genial and benevolent old gentleman under whose guidance hanno 's father and uncle had pursued their studirs
0	listen to the obsolete chord ; even by itself alone it stands for a technical general position which contradicts the actual
0	in its simplified form the melody is sung straight through ; whereas in the original art-song , the key changes to minor in the second of the eight-line stanzas , changes back again with beautiful effect to major in the fifth line ; is dramatically resolved in the following bitter blasts and facing the tempest ; and returns again only with the last four lines of the third stanza , which are repeated to finish out the melody
0	and as i have never forgotten it or the knowledgeable old codger who coined it , i think it must be counted to his honour by the posterity he invoked as witness against his spineless and torpid fellow-critics
0	i myself had seen the good child with adrian in the abbot 's room : he reclined in the bernheim chaise-longue while she sat very stiff-backed in the savonarola chair at the table and in touchingly plaintive , painfully high-ger- man schoolgirl accents read aloud out of a discoloured old card- board volume
0	thus he could take in the child- like solemnity and esoteric mystery of the magic flute , the for-
0	an immortal soul- but why ?
0	look here , have you seen my picture-gallery ?
0	soual democracy is at the door !
0	she raised her arms and let them drop , and then she fell on her knees at her mother 's side , burying her face in the folds of her gown and sobbing bitterly
0	severin ! -- what filoux , all of them , thomas !
0	that would be witty , rather than humorous , naphta retorted
0	you only want to have spirit synonymous with democratic progress
0	this had not at all altered with the years
0	as a business man , believe me , i am better informed than the diplomats , and the fear that we should lose independence and freedom of action is simply laughable in this case
0	at this point a darkening of hans castorp ’ s brows made wehsal desist , though it had more reference to the presence of the good-natured ferge , with his shrinking from the higher flights of conversation , than to any moral censorship on the part of our hero
0	i heard your name once or twice -- you heard my name ?
0	he walked down here with me
0	when they met someone he would put out his
0	my dear betsy , he said -- and he spoke as deliberately as possible , to gain time to muster his excuses -- do you think we need a man-servant ?
0	he often looked pale , and that not only on days when the hereditary migraine laid him low
0	i actually want to—
0	he sauntered over to his nephew 's place , with a diamond ring on his finger , a present from his mother ; and his pleasure in the toy theatre was as unaffected as hanno 's own
0	then he leaned back his head and closed his eyes
0	went through the audience , and one lady , radbruch the publisher 's wife , was encouraged by zur hohe 's words to say : one thinks one is hearing poetry
0	morten shouted , quite insulted
0	but you mean well , you mean much better , and more to my mind , than that knife-edged little jesuit and terrorist , apologist of the inquisition and the knout , with his round eye-glasses—though he is nearly always right when you and he come to grips over my paltry soul , like god and the devil in the mediæval legends
0	i know you mean a person can ’ t be proper with the devil supporting him from behind—but what i mean is , is he proper as a jesuit ?
0	yet with the sense of it i was entirely in sympathy
0	he was entirely estranged from his young wife , she lacked the fundamental conception , and she gave up trying to get it
0	was he walking by the sea , the philosopher to whom this thought first came , walking by the sea , with the faint bitterness of eternity upon his lips ?
0	clavdia chauchat had exchanged the customary sweater for a frock with a hint of the fanciful about it , suggesting a national costume—russian peasant , or balkan , perhaps bulgarian ; a light-coloured , flowing , and girdled arrangement , embroidered , and set with tiny tinsel ornaments
0	he had—that is , the house possessed among its volumes of records—a certain song , from gounod ’ s faust , valentine ’ s prayer , baritone with orchestral accompaniment , very appealing
0	you ’ re going to see some things you ’ ve never dreamed of—just wait
0	it tastes vile , but i know it ’ s good , and that will have to do me for to-day
0	herr gr� , betsy -- a friend of mine and a keen man of business
0	the water was running !
0	scarcely did it leave him time to follow with the pen the haunting and hunting inspirations which gave him no rest , which made hiln their slave
0	you are telling the truth
0	to work at his play , to play at his work , to bend an ambition that was half-earnest , half-whimsical , toward the accomplishment of aims that even to himself possessed but a symbolic value -- for such blithe scepticism and such an enlightened spirit of compromise , a great deal of vitality is necessary , as well as a sense of humour
0	ast one but oftener two or three
0	it was a lady who was passing through the room ; a woman , or rather girl , of middle height , in a white sweater and coloured skirt , her reddish-blond hair wound in braids about her head
0	because i ca not get anything else
0	here and there were new buildings , but also open spaces , which preserved a view toward the valley meadows
0	he felt for his watch ; his numbed fingers could scarcely find and draw it from his pocket
0	and wilh-oul more ado , having perceived the mood of the hour , he proceeded to accentuate it
0	but old johann did not weep
0	hp was re-ally feeling more or less miserable , and they would probably remain till there was a little improvement
0	listen to which a man in extreme agony of soul had called to- gether his fellow-men - an act of fantastic good faith , moreover , for one 's fellow-men are not meant or made to face such truth otherwise than with cold shivers and with the conclusion that , when it vvas no longer possible to regard it as poetry , they very soon unanimously and audibly came to about it
0	angrily i ask : can not you away with this nuisance , this icy draught ?
0	one , two , three , and you have finished with the whole stupid thing
0	and her soul will have absolutely nothing to do with mine , nor her body either , and thence come , oh , god , the torments i suffer , and therefore is my desire condemned to shame , and my body must mortify itself for ever

0	the torture was recommended to reason , as a means to an end , the end of bringing out the indispensable confession
0	the father , herr hagen-str�had married a wife from hamburg , with thick , heavy black hair and larger diamonds in her ears than any one had ever seen before
0	the frau consul called after him
0	the stamp of old-world , underground neurosis which i have been describing , the mark and psychological temper of such a town , betrays itself in kaisersaschem by the many originals , eccentrics , and harmlessly half-mad folk who live within its walls and , like the old buildings , belong to the picture
0	the union , to be frank , could hardly be called a love-match
0	that is madame chauchat , she said
0	was it one of those so mightily
0	all at once everything was still
0	i am a bit fastidious
0	but it had become the rule for cerda , little juhann , and fraulein jungmann to spend the holidays at the kurhouse , in travemiinde , for the sake of hanno 's health
0	out of the question , cried hans castorp
0	a teacher is the personi- fied conscience of the pupil , confirming him in his doubt , ex- plaining his dis
0	no , thank goodness , his head was turned in the other direction , and he seemed to be preaching in general to all the faithful
0	i shan ’ t lie out on the balcony at night , hans castorp declared
0	you are darning , ida -- funny , i ca not imagine you doing anything else
0	the third day brought the blessed release
0	somewhere in the thick of the graves , near the heart of the acre , lay a small , flat , levelled place , the length of a man , between two rounded mounds with wreaths of everlasting hanging on their headstones
0	she wore her 'at as rakish as could be
0	she looked wonderful as she played , and although i have no notion of violin playing , i know that she knew how to sing upon her instrument ( a real stradivarius ) so that the tears nearly came into my eyes
0	work , pray , and save
0	my name is permaneder -- alois permaneder , from munich
0	her tendency to the macabre and bizarre made her interesting to the masculine world which paid her homage
0	good lord , thomas , mother could not have any actual right -- but i saw it from her point of view , and had consideration for that , as long as she lived
0	frau consul budd en brook , she that was a stiiwing , uncle gotlhold 's widow , passed away
0	altogether , out of pride she held with superiority , looked out for it , and showed herself highly surprised when she thought it did not get its due
0	did you see the strands ?
0	hans castorp was alone among four walls with his wonder-box ; with the florid performance of this truncated little coffin of violin-wood , this small dull-black temple , before the open double doors of which he sat with his hands folded in his lap , his head on one side , his mouth open , and let the harmonies flow over him
0	as if hans castorp had been intending to handle it carelessly or keep it after the hour !
0	and , in short , one can not , by their very nature , speak of these impressions otherwise than vaguely and confusedly
0	senator buddenbrdok followed the two gentlemen , old dr grabow and young dr langhals , out of the frau consul 's bed-chamber into the breakfast-room and closed the door
0	his partner , herr bur-meester , had died quite suddenly of an apoplectic stroke , in the spring of the year
0	the cross-bearer and the acolyte hesitated , and couldn ’ t get in
0	he did not hasten to let adrian know the result of his visit , overjoyed as he was to have saved his own face by the honest admission that he was not himself indif- ferent to her
0	for- eign commissions inspect those incredible photographs every- where displayed , and tell their countrymen that what they have seen surpasses in horribleness anything the human imagination can conceive
0	as it is , the cry is smothered in our throats ; like i ( ing claudius 's prayer , it can never to heaven go
0	i am going to die , he said to himself
0	the snow-laden firs , dark-green to blackness , went marching up the sides of the valley , and beneath them the snow lay soft like down pillows
0	for it was clear that the deviations and idiosyncrasies presented by his everyday appearance were due to incomplete , perhaps even unsuccessful adaptation ; they were the not quite eradicable vestiges of grandfather ’ s pure and genuine form
0	for it was all only a confirmation of what he had always known
0	she had cherished him fondly , read him fairy stories , and told him about the uncle who died of hiccoughs
0	just now , for instance , i am on my way to visit my overfilled
0	not any thin ' to do , dear frau senator , said frau schweige- still , one finger on her cheek , shaking her head , at sight of the half- sitting , half-lying figure
0	justus is certainly a charming personality , but business is not his strong point , and he has had bad luck too
0	'there comes fike dahlbeck , said senator gieseke
0	this was a fixed postulate , with which they must for the present reckon
0	to judge from the shadows that drove across the sky-light there must be clouds in the sky
0	a man of the world , just singed by our flame , weary , mildly interesting , no more
0	it appears that the debate in the chambers will not die down ; the struggle is so bitter that up to now not one single unanimous choice has been put before the council -- otherwise the burgomaster would at once announce an election
0	it drew to itself all the elements which were weary of the rationalistic twaddle of the century , and thirsting for a stronger draught of life
0	j�wants to study , but he still has not come up for his finals ; and they are not very well satisfied with jacob , at dalbeck and company
0	my poor lad , she thought , as she watched him and his cousin abandoned to mirth , telling each other a hundred anecdotes , asking each other a hundred questions , throwing themselves back in their chairs with peals of laughter
0	we all take care to say what will be pleasant to hear
0	and undertook to pierce him with her eye
0	i wonder if you really wanted anything different ?
0	soon or late , division must yield units which , even though in composition , were not organized , and which mediated between life and absence of life ; molecular groups , which represented the transition between vitalized organization and mere chemistry
0	as sole adornment she wore below the neck ruche a chain made of old silver coins
0	since i willl here , i replied , i will come with you
0	one day she happened to meet on the street frau consul julchen mollendorpf , born hagenstrom , into whose face she looked with a challenging , triumphant glance ; it actually dawned upon frau mbllendorpf that she had better speak first , and she did
0	he recalled the monday of two weeks ago , and his solitary walk , which had done him so little good ; and committed himself to the view that it was that walk which had revolutionized his system and brought to the surface the latent infection
0	i am not in the mood for it
0	a hungarian student played spirited gipsy waltzes on his fiddle ; and hofrat behrens , who chanced to be present for a quarter-hour with dr krokowski , got somebody to play the melody of the pilgrims ’ chorus on the bass notes of the piano , while he himself operated in a skipping movement with a brush over the treble , and parodied the violin counterpoint
0	but there are so many of them , swarming on—they can survive a bloodletting and still come on in hosts
0	not only from jeanette scheurl did suggestions like the last proceed , but also from the general-intendant , excellency von riedesel , whose patronage of the old instrument and old music did not indeed , as with kranich , stem from scholarly or antiquar- ian interest , but was purely conservative in its origin , a great dif ference of course
0	tony had moved with erica into the rooms in the second storey which her parents had occupied in the time of the elder buddenbrooks
0	and the time he had fixed was already past
0	surely that must mean—
0	moreover , in consequence of his father ’ s taking another position , pribislav left the school and the city ; but that was all one to hans castorp ; he had already forgotten him before he went
0	in his condition he could do nothing sharper than to act as though he had a slight case of tuberculosis pulmonum—it was always present anyhow
0	thanks to the exertions of the soloist , who gave all that he had to its execution , the piece fully asserted both its fascination and its intellectual appeal
0	the fanatical worship of this worthless trifle , this scrap of melody , this brief , childish harmonic invention only a bar and a half in le-ngth , had about it something stupid and gross , and at the same time something ascetic and religious -- something that contained the essence of faith and renunciation
0	tell me , did you ever know a single one of them ?
0	for this time it is not a question of a brilliant match , but just one that will make good the other one
0	they spoke in low tones , so that joachim , despite the fact that the glass partition only half separated them , could not make out what they said—indeed , made not the slightest effort to do so
0	no , he is a dear good man , and a great friend of the family and all that -- but he is no great light
0	ho saw herr brecht , with the forceps in his sleeve , bend over him , and noticed that little beads were standing out on his bald brow , and that his mouth was twisted
0	why did the donl { ey have to tell ?
0	what sort of theatrical ending is that , johann ?
0	no one from then henceforward heard anything from him
0	vorl { of the soul , in a court of appeal interceding , mediating , itself instinct with poetry ; where spirit and desire interpenetrate and appease each other in a way not quite free from illusion ; it is a stratum of life peculiarly informed with sentiment , in , vhich , i confess , my own humanity feels at ease , but which is not for i ; tronger tastes
0	then , as the shameless disturbance did not stop , she had with trembling hands kindled a light , had left her bed , thrilling with horror , repulsion , and despair , had opened the door and hurried out on to the landing in her slippers , the light in her hand -- to the top of the ladder that went straight up from the house door to the first storey
0	and he got up , pushed back his chair , and turned toward the door
0	but then , voe to hirn !
0	naphta had flung his fur cloak on the ground , so that its mink lining showed
0	own age and only in a later one receive historic honour
0	we have to let him instruct and correct
0	and that , sometimes , it shows no spots although there is something there ?
0	hans castorp looked at her , with his chin in his collar , like his grandfather—it was laughable to see how like the old man he looked
0	in the first plane , i have never done any business with herr von maiboom , and this would be a rather strange way to begin
0	in certain islands east of dutch new guinea , youths and maidens prepared a love charm from the bark of a tree—it was probably poisonous , like the manzanilla tree , or the antiaris toxicaria , the deadly upas-tree of java , which could poison the air round with its steam and fatally stupefy man and beast
0	the ecclesiastical policy of indulgence practised by the spirit he designated as love—this to refute the nihilism of the ascetic principle
0	but there was not a white hair in the smooth coiffure beneath the mourning cap
0	look at his heart , and the hofrat lifted his huge hand again from his thigh and pointed with his forefinger at the pulsating shadow
0	thus in my friend 's musical fabric a five- to six-note series , beginning with b and ending on e flat , \\lith a shifting e and a between , is found strikingly often , a basic figure of peculiarly nostalgic character , which in differing harmonic and rhythmic garb , is given now to this part no , v to that , often in its inversion , as it were turned on its axis , so that while the intervals remain the sanle , the sequence of the notes is altered
0	many false conceptions are held concerning the nature of tedium
0	you find him so ?
0	i have held your signatures as long as johann buddenbrook was good -- in the meantime i could write up the interest on the capital and increase the per cent
0	more plainly than ever this characteristic came out during my visit and to me , i can not say why , it was as though the touch me not !
0	the others called him the socialist , because the social was his passion
0	as he paused , after that , hans castorp asked , affecting surprise : against what ?
0	and now herr settembrini stood here in the suddenly illuminated room—hans castorp , who had raised himself on his elbow and turned blinking toward the door , recognized him and flushed
0	i put in the form of a question what is nothing more than the description of a condition that has its explanation in the thing it- self as well as in its artistic and formal aspect
0	what was going on ?
0	you must not imagine they are in despair over my defection
0	my shop , as we students said , was in the hansastrasse , a narrow lane behind the church of st moritz , which might well have run its anach- ronistic course in kaisersaschern
0	even his burning face , his trembling limbs , the peculiar and half-intoxicated mingled sensations of excitement and fatigue were pleasurable , reminding him as they did of that familiar feeling induced by the sea air , which could sting one like whips , and yet was so laden with sleepy essences
0	you are quite right , he said
0	and i love erica very much , although griin-lich says i am not fond of children
0	no , c ’ est vraiment une bonne âme , a simple nature , not exposed to intellectual dangers , tu sais
0	it is uncommonly kind of you—i must ask myself if i really—that is , if there is anything—
0	mazurka ’ is capital , he said
0	desire , says my dream
0	tell me first what freedom is , he went on
0	suous simultaneity - most magnificent and heavy with meaning , if a bit too clever after all , in comparison with certain revelations of the elemental in the art of the pure musicians , beethoven and bach ; for example , in the prelude to the cello suite of the latter - also an e-flat major piece , built up in primitive triads
0	they exchanged experiences upon the best way to keep cigars—particularly imported ones
0	the wall before him , studded with single groups of trees , was steep , but looked as though one might wind to the right and get round it by climbing a little way up the slope
0	yes , joachim said , i must go lie down
0	when the moral courage to make decisions and distinctions between reality and deception degenerates to that point , then there is an end of life , of judgment , of the creative deed : the process of decay sets in , moral scepsis , and does its deadly work
0	and here , at the source and fount so to speak , with two specialists in the house—it would have been very strange— of course , of course
0	it is really beautiful to be an artist
0	they had a glimpse into the tiny sleeping-chamber , merely a short and narrow bedstead in the corner under the sloping roof , and a small drugget on the floor beside it ; then they turned again to the study , which was no less sparsely furnished , but orderly to the point of formality , or even frigid
0	one day she might relate that frau salomon was wearing the most costly lace underwear in preparation for her examination , and prided herself very much upon her appearance before the physicians on these occasions
0	i found in him no understanding for my un- easiness
0	to hans castorp , this was an experience like the one with wiedemann ’ s hair
0	christian mocked herr gr� so cleverly that they all had to laugh , even the consul
0	then the youth sat down at the round table , resting his elbow on it , and seemed , without noticing his mother , wlio was sitting at the dark window mending stockings , to busy himself with the wretched news-sheet which had nothing in it except the an-nouncements of the silver wedding of consul su-and-su
0	no , that is certainly news to me
0	the world , this narrow , lofty , isolated world up here , looked now well wadded and upholstered indeed : no pillar or post but wore its white cap ; the steps up to the entrance of the berghof had turned into an inclined plane ; heavy cushions , in the drollest shapes , weighed down the branches of the scotch firs—now and then one slid off and raised up a cloud of powdery white dust in its fall
0	our friend , two months deep in his second year , had been given a new place by the management at a near-by table , diagonally to his old one , between that and the good russian table
0	and keep an eye on my father
0	in such matters he was accustomed to command , and the weight of his personality would always have been decisive , even if he had not been , as he was , master and mover of the expedition
0	i am afraid so , herr sc noter
0	oh , good heavens , because i could not endure him , she cried out in a passion
0	and still i did not know whether i should give the preference to these fantasies on the light in light or to the introspective , more- thought-than-seen pieces - those where all is rejected questioning , wrestling with the unfathomable , where doubt springs at the foot of truth and even the cherub who looks into god 's depths measures not the gulf of the everlasting resolve
0	for vvhat mall-invented one should she choose , to ex- press herself in ?
0	he had never heard of the ecclesiastical conception of indulgence , under which was to be classified one of the sacraments of the church—namely , marriage , not in itself an absolute good , like the other sacraments , but only a protection against sin , countenanced in order to set bounds to sensual desire ; that the ascetic principle , the ideal of complete chastity , might be upheld , without at the same time opposing an unpolitic harshness to the flesh ?
0	i heard that up in the woods , and i shall remember it all my life
0	that date , of course , is the point , , , here i now stand in my actual writing and not the one up to which my narrative has pro-

0	so it was said in the town
0	look : the most powerful , most varied , most dramatic succession of events and activities , but only in tilne , consisting only of time articulated , filled up , organized - and all at once almost thrust into the concrete exigencies of the plot by the repeated trumpet- signals from without
0	i have transferred this tech- nique in a certain ideational context to the fictitious figure of a musician , the tragic hero of ny novel
0	popinet had gone to bed to dream of burglars
0	and hardly had the back-building been demolished when a new , neat , and airy structure rose in its place , which fronted on bakers ' alley and was intended for shops and warehouses
0	you are already twenty , and you have still a good many tricks of the trade to get used to , quite hard enough to stimulate you
0	he seemed to see hofrat behrens walking down the garden path , with bent knees and arms hanging stiffly in front of him , adapting his long and somehow solitary-looking stride to the time of distant march-music
0	for his part , he thought well of the idea , he thought there would be boundless happiness in the experience
0	what sort of voluntarism is this you are giving vent to ?
0	have you seen the kroger carriage ?
0	well , and you found it amusing , this manner of existence ?
0	dr faustus such a meaning was always to be deduced from enigmatic sayings , and keen-eared piety always heard it in them
0	forgive my pom- pous way of talking
0	we pay for the swift break-through with a wrong , an acknowledged one , which we declare ourselves ready to make good
0	how tre-mendously strong the stork must be , to carry all that !
0	then he folded his hands upon the winebespotted sheet , and laid his head on the left shoulder , the one toward his guest , with the effect that his face was lightly turned away
0	not at all , answered joachim , shrugging again
0	\tv ould you like to retain the capitalist system , deutschlin , asked arzt - because it keeps alive the memory of the insecurity of human life ?
0	a high-shouldered functionary , a brisk intermediate some-thing between a waiter and a major-domo , had in charge the outward ordering of the solemnity
0	where love of wisdom lifts itself to contemplation of the highest essence , the source of being , the study of god and the things of god , there , one might say , is the peak of scientific dignity , the highest and noblest sphere of knowledrre , the apex of all thinking ; to the inspired intellect its most exalted goal is here set
0	quite simply ; since the relation to infinity of any size you chose to postulate was as zero
0	everyone can see we are talking about her and that you have said something to make me get red
0	behrens jerked his head in the direction of the salon , and hans castorp followed him thither
0	he took up a bottle of white wine that had a little silver stag on the stopper ; and with one of his fastidious , elegant motions , he held it on its side and examined the label
0	let me assure you that mankind is about to find its way back to this point of view
0	it was the same thing , he said , with the change-over of music from monody to part-music , to harmony , which people liked to think of as cultural progress , when actually it had been just an acquisition of barbarism
0	i have known people like teary trieschke , and i was married to bendix gr� , and i know the dissipated creatures there are here in this town
0	that might perhaps alarm me , the more because there was about the 'widened gaze a fixity - or shall i say it was a stare ?
0	it was the existence of the actually impossible-to-exist , of a half-sweet , half-painful balancing , or scarcely balancing , in this restricted and feverish process of decay and renewal , upon the point of existence
0	it was too late for coffee , in any case
0	she loved her palms , they gave so much elegance to the room
0	it is the same with all families
0	and the pastor , in his emotion , could only say : ah , thou dear child of god , thou little blessed one !
0	they addressed themselves to the glass with the extreme of courtesy
0	gr� , she said more quietly , why do you smile and talk about our ameans ' ?
0	it takes two to make a divorce , my child
0	well , and your sentence ?
0	a lament of such gigantic dimensions is , i say , of necessity an expressive work , a work of expression , and therewith it is a work of liberation ; just as the earlier music , to which it links itself across the centuries , sought to be a liberation of ex : eression
0	in case of a sec-ond marriage of my dearly loved older daughter antonie , in view of the fact that eighty thousand marks have already been applied to her first marriage , the sum of seventeen thou-sand thaler current must not be exceeded
0	naphta and settembrini , for instance , had copies sent them , which hans castorp saw in their hands , and remarked , to his surprise , that they too perused them with bitter concentration
0	she went out into the verandah , looking , in her while pique frock , perfectly fresh , and in the gayest of tempers
0	hans castorp was not up here to be company for joachim , he was a patient himself
0	we look at it , our humanistic-æsthetic eye pictures it among scenes far other than these : we see these youths watering horses on a sunny arm of the sea ; roving with the beloved one along the strand , the lover ’ s lips to the ear of the yielding bride ; in happiest rivalry bending the bow
0	a beer and cheese -- but herr dieckmann could not understand him , and began with great fluency : everything we have , herr consul : crabs , shrimps , all sorts of sausages , all sorts of cheese , smoked eel , smoked salmon , smoked sturgeon -- fine , dieckmann ; give us what you have
0	christian did not deny it ; he merely gazed aimlessly about
0	what are you saying ?
0	settembrini , asked for suggestions , proposed that they give the hofrat a newly projected encyclopædic work called the sociology of suffering ; but he found only one person to agree with him , a book-dealer who sat at hermine kleefeld ’ s table
0	psycho-analytic treatment , by the most modern methods was called attention to by means of spaced type
0	that was certainly a very important nerve you happened to hit on , herr hofrat , he said
0	or they would make general remarks on the subject of the undignified vanity of dyeing one 's hair
0	herr grunlich 's face was all mottled with red ; but he had dressed carefully in a respectable-looking black coat and pea-green trousers like those in which he had made his first visits in meng street
0	for that , litera- ture alone avails , humanistic science , the ideal of the free and beautiful human being
0	no , tom , it will not come out all right
0	wenzel , and i can not think of these years without you , either

0	did holger feel at home , and content , in his present state ?

0	he had always a few favourites -- two or three -- whom he called by their given names , and these lived in paradise
0	a humanistic one , of course
0	his voice was weak , but he spoke with conviction , at length and beautifully , upon the self-perfecting of the human spirit through social betterment
0	it was raining now , and the snow in the streets had turned to a slush that spattered as they walked
0	well , he had pulled himself together , and had revirwed the whole situation ; had reassured , reinforced , made head
0	he read about the struggles of zeus before he arrived at the headship of the gods ; and every now and then he listened into the other room , where they were going at length into the future of poor aunt clothilde
0	you kept urging me
0	but to judge from the way you have just characterized herr von maiboom and his prospects , i should say there can be nu security in his case
0	inflammation of the lungs then ?
0	hans castorp felt rather hurt to have krokowski circle round and leave him out—even though a tête-à-tête with the gentleman was something he was far from hankering after
0	i hardly think , she told herr pfiihl , that he is suited for solo work ; and on the whole i am glad , for it has its bad side apart from the dependence of the soloist upon his ac-companist , which can be very serious too ; -- if i did not have you , for instance ! -- there is always the danger of yielding to more or less complete virtuosity
0	there was little outward sign of the excitement that reigned everywhere : the streets were quiet , and people
0	truly the time flew
0	we betook our- selves to the nike room
0	hans castorp regarded the picture on his knee
0	the pupil who was then reciting interrupted himself ; even herr modersohn got up and listened
0	when he had done , he leaned back against his down quilt , with the magic table cleared before him , and looked into the growing dusk , to-day ’ s dusk , yet scarcely distinguishable from the dusk of yesterday or last week
0	yes , friederike chimed in
0	anyhow he denied being embarrassed by the comparison
0	but in the end she hit upon another plan and communicated it to her table-mates , to their great delight : she had the management refund her the ten francs and insert it in frau iltis ’ s weekly bill
0	it is in the highest degree repugnant to me to tell you a lie
0	the latter was very beautiful , of simple and elegant form , in the severe taste of the early nineteenth century
0	joachim agreed , and they acquired two camel ’ s-hair rugs like his own , in a fine and well-stocked shop in the english quarter
0	yes , that 's it , she said gratefully
0	for a long lime now , there had been dessert only on sundays
0	tom was lounging in an easy-chair beside her smoking his cigarette , while clara and clothilde sat opposite each other at the window
0	it went fast , and he was next in turn
0	besides it all , there was the field in which later was to lie his own particular interest : the confusion of the yards , the mammoth bodies of great ships , asiatic and african liners , lying in dry-dock , keel and propeller bare , supported by props as thick as tree-trunks , lying there in monstrous helplessness , swarmed over by troops of men like dwarfs , scouring , whitewashing , hammering ; there were the roofed-over ways , wrapped in wreaths of smoke-like mist , holding the towering frames of rising ships , among which moved the engineers , blueprint and loading scale in hand , directing the work-people
0	herr settembrini saw that all chance of conversation , of a human interchange of ideas , would be out of the question , and flung up his hand with a gesture of resigned despair
0	but to come now , like this -- my dear child , i beg your pardon , but it was -- foolish
0	for whom , indeed , should he have taken pains ?
0	on this piece of land the senator thought to build his house ; and he surveyed it with a speculative eye v/hen he passed the spot on his way to the harbour
0	you should see her teeth when she laughs
0	but now that the monstrous national perversion which then held the continent , and more than the continent , in its grip , has celebrated its orgies down to the bitter end ; now that its prime movers have had themselves poisoned by their physi- cians , drenched with petrol and set on fire , that nothing of them might remain - now , i say , it might be possible to thinl { of the publication of my labour of love
0	he repealed it stupidly
0	rather rude and familiar , seems to me
0	but the reply did not come at once
0	oh la la , vraiment—precisely thus i have always imagined un homme de génie !
0	tell me , why were you so quiet thursday afternoon at dinner , if i may ask ?
0	it turned out that these growths were entirely unorganic in their origin ; they existed by virtue of chemicals from the apothe- cary 's shop , the blessed messengers
0	i too turned disapprovingly towards the speaker , though privately i was grateful for what he said
0	the most important matter is still out-standing , my dear wenzel
0	but i find one ought to be grateful up here for a bit of music
0	it would have been culpable inhumanity to deny that an impure soul could produce by a mere look , whether deliberate or not , physically harmful effects in others , for instance in little children , whose tender substance was especially suscepti- ble to the poison of such an eye
0	he must have a lot of money , so we can furnish elegantly
0	some of the bystanders , who understood the matter better , began to laugh rudely and heartily ; and although few even heard carl 's answer , the laughter spread until the whole crowd of republicans stood shaking good-naturedly
0	at least so thought hans castorp , as with the others he waited in the greatest suspense to hear in what form love driven below the surface would reappear
0	only once—and then only for a moment—had he ever seen grandfather as he was here represented , on the occasion of a procession to the rathaus
0	and then , thermometer in mouth , with sack and pack , he went to lie down , while hans castorp began at once to wash and change for dinner—which was rather less than an hour away
0	in his mind was a picture which he longed to reproduce : it was a picture of hanno ' a great-grandfather , whom he himself had known as a boy : a clear-sighted man , jovial , simple , sturdy , humorous -- why could not little johann grow up like that ?
0	this motive , and no momentary fad—no , nor yet any native love of bodily exertion—was what impelled him to learn the use of skis
0	it had frozen at night ; now it froze in the day-time as well , and all day long ; and it snowed , with brief intervals , through the fourth , the fifth , and the seventh days
0	then he shook hands with consul kroger and sat down at the table with herr marcus opposite him
0	that is a magnificent commission , just in your line , i should think
0	what you mean to say is that i should leave for home ?
0	joachim , at this , searched his face in some alarm
0	his little deep eves were wide open and surrounded by red rims down to the cheek-bones , as his father 's used to be in anger
0	hans castorp saw here the opportunity to carry out his plan with the pot of flowers and the good wishes for speedy recovery
0	he makes funny motions with his head , like a bird , and talks all the time , so i call him the magpie , but gr� has forbidden b u d d e m b r o o k s me to say that , because magpies steal , and heir kesselmeyer is an honourable man
0	she wore rouge too , but was not immoral , being far too witless ; she merely rambled through the streets with her nose in the air , accompanied by pug dogs with satin saddle-cloths
0	when christian was at the club , the frau consul and ida jungmann sat at four o'clock dinner alone at the round table , in which there was now not a single extra leaf
0	obviously the elelnent of sin , of sensua ] ity , of evil lust altogether , is conjured away out of marriage - for lust is certainly
0	but twenty or thirty were scarcely the eighth part of the riches that lay asking to be enjoyed
0	joachim deserted—deserted to the colours—funny , but it can be done
0	herr weinschenk had not the faintest resemblance to herr permaneder ; and he was dif-ferentiated frnm bendix gr� by his position as an oldestablished official with a fixed salary -- which , of course , did not preclude a further career
0	after the fish followed an excellent meat dish , with garnishings , then a separate vegetable course , then roast fowl , a pudding , not inferior to yesterday evening ’ s , and lastly cheese and fruit
0	not content with that , she must go back into the th century , to the oldest buddrnbrook of whom there was knowledge , to the one who was councillor in grahau , and the roslork tailor who had been very well off ' and had so many rhildren , living and dead
0	i will confess to you that ever since zurich she has been very much in my mind , quite seri- ously , so that it is hard to bear the thought of the meeting as a mere episode , after which she will go away and i may never see
0	on his eighth birthday , april th , , hanno played before the assembled family a fantasy of his own romposition
0	lord , herr consul , i say we wants a republic ; that 's wat i be savin '
0	that 's the first thing
0	yes , you are ruining me with your indolence , your ex-travagance , and love of luxury
0	i must have another try
0	dr krokowski had issued a strict prohibition against any further experimentation on the part of the laity upon fräulein brand ’ s mysterious gifts
0	f or a while after helmut left , as it were while he was within hearing , we spoke of indifferent things
0	the snow came silently down
0	accordingly , at this hour they assembled before the portal of the berghof—hans castorp , ferge and wehsal
0	he sighed , as if he did not wish to say more , and was silent
0	pietism , by virtue of its overemotional na- ture , would indeed make a sharp division between piety and sci- ence , and assert that no movement , no change in the scientific picture , can have any influence on faith
0	i do hope you are enjoying the soup , heir pastor , she said several times
0	instead her awakened femininity turned straightway to another man , towards whom thus far she had consciously felt only tranquil sisterly feel- ings - and now others had been released in her
0	true , by the destruction of our cities from the air , germany has long since be- come a theatre of war ; but it still remains for it to become so in the most actual sense , a sense that we can not and may not con- ceive
0	now you are taking the affair personally again , like a young lady , fraulein tony , i am only speaking of the prin-ciple
0	as they went out he said to hans castorp : don ’ t you believe them , engineer , never believe them when they grumble
0	he had almost more pain than he could bear , and he spent many sleepless , feverish niphts
0	the pedagogue , for in- stance , knew that in elementary instruction even today the tend- ency was to depart from the primary learning of letters and sounds and to adopt the method of word-learning ; to lin ] { writ- ing with concrete looking at things
0	then you are coming back !
0	there might be a postcard there for one of us
0	get along now , into the caboose with you—march !
0	thomas stalked along with the calm-ness of despair
0	the night was the harder half of the day , for hans castorp woke often , and lay not seldom hours awake ; either because his slightly abnormal temperature kept him stimulated , or because his horizontal manner of life , detracted from the power , or the desire , to sleep
0	hans castorp gave vent to several heart-felt curses—of which his lips were too stiff to pronounce the labials
0	or when she becomes aware with whom she lives in tender wedded love , and says to him : my sweet son , thou art my only child , thou art my spouse and lord , thou art mine and my brother 's son , my sweet child , and thou my god , why hast thou let me be born !
0	did the paralysis of the sweat-secretions depend upon contraction of the skin ?
0	as the serum was prepared from hans castorp ’ s own blood , the inoculation with it could introduce into his system no deterrent not already present there
0	when i was driving from the station this afternoon , i passed nielsen the porter , and he took off his hat and made me a deep bow , and i bowed back to him -- not arrogantly , not a bit -- i waved my hand , just the way father used to
0	she is spirit herself
0	these munich trams , painted in the bavarian light-blue , are heavily built and either for that reason or some characteristic of the subsoil make considerable noise
0	at least , you must know there are twelve of them , three for each season , the ascending and the declining year , the circle of constellations through which the sun passes
0	did the way they put him off with his gaffky number drive him to the verge of despair ?
0	impossible that madame chauchat should know nothing of the threads that were weaving between her and a certain table
0	but you know what will happen : if we ask him , he will send the child a heavy gold service and refuse to be thanked for it !
0	these names wore for him the nimbus of conservative author- ity , and here they were being assigned to the realm of modernistic disintegration
0	she scolded him , but she was proud to have him express so freely in her presence the views and opinions which she knew he concealed from his parents
0	it tasted and smelled of chloroform
0	a little business , my dear lady , with the brewery at walkmill
0	it was some time after this that they took up karen karstedt ; and both hans castorp and joachim felt peculiarly drawn to her
0	if there were a son , gr� would keep him -- another time she said : i have thought a great deal about the four years of my marriage , father
0	but does not some one rely any longer on his estimable herr pa -- no hints , either
0	mynheer sat with his jaw dropped and his hands palm upward on the carriage rug spread across his and madame ’ s knees
0	it was a rather short oval , this face , with somewhat pointed chin , a not very regular nose , slightly flat and a little tilted , and a tranquil mouth , neither voluptuous nor severe
0	he stopped , he blinked his lashes free of water drops , knocked off the snow that like a coat of mail was sheathing his body in front—and it struck him that progress , under the circumstances , was more than anyone could expect
0	it doesn ’ t mean much , as behrens always says ; he told me at the last regular examination it would take another half year , pretty certainly
0	even at a distance , he began making obsequious gestures with his broad-brimmed grey hat , and as he drew near he took one last very long step , and arrived describing a half-circle with the upper part of his body , by this means bowing to them all at once
0	that was the sunday , and the monday
0	ami there may well up in him something like a feeling of shame for a neglected duty ; a sense of renewed energy , courage , and hope ; he may recognize a bond existing still between him and that stirring , colourful , callous existence which he thought he had left so far behind him
0	settembrini smiled , fanning himself with the magazine , which he still held in his hand
0	i only need to make a few payments and advances here and there to get on my feet again and restore confidence
0	i ’ m perfectly worn out with laughing , he said , and breathed through his mouth
0	the 'way the music strives upward out of the difficulties , the artful confusion , the mingled distresses of its first part to the tender light of the final cry and there is touchingly resolved - all that i straightway found admirable and did not hide my delighted approbation
0	but he was not merely a man of honour either , people nlis- took him when they thought so , a shallow amoroso and man of pleasure : that was loathsome
0	he turned away and made as much noise as possible while he concluded his toilet
0	but the italian courteously bade them both not to disturb themselves , and made them sit down again , while he maintained his easy pose before them
0	tiut it was aberration to assert that god permitted evil on account of the good ; for nothing was to be considered good except it corre- sponded to the idea good in itself , and not by accident
0	he would not confess it -- he was himself aghast at the fact , and would pettishly deny it when the subject was mentioned
0	as social events my productions rank next after the premieres of diaghilev 's ballet russe - if they do rank after them
0	it made gooseflesh and shivers run over her
0	there , engineer , you have the hostility the intellect feels against nature , its proud mistrust , its high-hearted insistence upon the right to criticize her and her evil , reason-denying power
0	for to be that , one had at least to recognize the difference between morality and blessedness , which our honoured illuminant and monist most certainly did not !
0	i know you are a maiden cherished and sheltered by the most loving care
0	a black-clad gentleman sat at a tiny table and served the soup out of a silver tureen
0	how well , for instance , we talked , going home after n onnenmacher 's class , about that im-
0	but a company of fifteen people , like this one , usually breaks up on rising from table into groups and makes fresh contacts
0	oh , is that what you want to know , morten ?
0	on the day after mother 's death , you propose to display your lack of filial feeling by -- only because the subject came up
0	even to alter the direction of his gaze he was obliged to conquer a great disinclination ; and , added to all this , the hateful burning in his face had reached the same height as yesterday , his cheeks felt puffy with heat , he breathed with difficulty ; his heart pounded dully , like a hammer muffled in cloth
0	's a good bit of truth in that , herr se noter
0	a week later he said to him : well , shall we work together , young man ?
0	with misgiving we examined the card , which gave us all the informa- tion we needed ; it read : saul fitelberg
0	and conversely , a full and interesting content can put wings to the hour and the day ; yet it will lend to the general passage of time a weightiness , a breadth and solidity which cause the eventful years to flow far more slowly than those poor , bare , empty ones over which the wind passes and they are gone
0	that sort of thing may happen again -- to speak frankly , i am afraid it will
0	\ ; ve had to win , and ours was the hard trade of triumph
0	very interesting , said hans castorp
0	at tea all the various beverages were served which it is possible to serve at that meal
0	he had been sitting there , hardly speaking , wrapped in his cloak , his hands in his lap and his cigarette in the corner of his mouth
0	i could avoid it , of course , i could keep with the others all the time and not let him get near me
0	he is a citizen of munich , but his family comes from nuremberg
0	no one in the institution seemed to know that he was an object of charity
0	may hell have pity on me !
0	opening leaving bare the rather short , sturdy neck and the upper part of the breast , where hung a simple gold ornament
0	i promise to have proper regard for the circumstances , and the—personalities
0	for the wounds of the body not only emphasized its sunken state , they also corresponded in the most edifying manner to the envenomed corruption of the soul , and thereby gave rise to emotions of true spiritual satisfaction : whereas blooming health was a misleading phenomenon , insulting to the conscience of man and requiring to be counteracted by an attitude of debasement and humility before physical infirmity , which was infinitely beneficial to the soul
0	t ake him , monster !
0	thus december passed , and at the beginning of the year ' the wedding was celebrated
0	was all he said , nodding slowly at the girl and then turning back to gaze again
0	armgard herself sent me an invitation ( very fine , with a gilt edge ) , and also a letter in which she expresses herself as enchanted with her bridegroom
0	he went on to criticize the proprietors of all the other sanatoria in the place , praising their acquisitive talents with mordant sarcasm
0	but we were speaking of you
0	but ca not we rely any longer on -- ?
0	who had introduced them was not afterwards easy to decide ; certainly it had not been elly brand , yet they had begun since her arrival
0	with powdered cheeks , in his scotch-thread drawers and red morocco slippers , he walked out on the balcony , drying his hands
0	he , vanted to make this much clear , he went on
0	for by his art the person of the beloved is elevated , froin art the emotions ever draw fresh food , when the artist 's own individual- ity is associated with the joys his art purveys
0	sometimes they played chess on hans castorp ’ s magic table ; joachim had brought a set of chess-men from below
0	not everybody gave her this opportunity , it is true
0	consul buddenbrook refused at first to ask him
0	she cried , with disproportionate joy , for she had really understood him
0	yet—he probably can ’ t help himself—he forces her to look westward for expansion , stirs up slumbering rivalries between st petersburg and vienna—
0	that would bring happiness , beyond a doubt
0	finally , in order to leave nothing unanswered , herr ludovico might be assured that he , the speaker , did his duty by the small civilian task which herr settembrini had been so kind as to mention , with all due reservatio mentalis ; though there was indeed a certain irony in his conforming to the standards of a classic and rhetorical educational system , whose survival the most optimistic observer could not predicate for more than a few decades
0	will you gainsay that you studied the best of the arts and sciences also only as specialist and amateur ?
0	i think he knew more or less what his partner was doing , and what the slate of affairs was at the warehouse
0	joachim said , and laughed curtly
0	he strove to call back that personal god
0	his air of preoccupation was simply enormous as he uttered a stealthy look out and hastily withdrew
0	therese weichbrodt was a well-read , almost a liter-ary woman
0	in the brief and trifling interval the cousins had taken a turn as far as the bench on the mountain-side , beside the little watercourse
0	the bridge of the nose was thin and finely hooked , the unbearded part of the cheeks under the cheekbones shadowed and even rather gaunt
0	there are a past grand master , a knight of the east , a grand high-priest—the thirtyfirst degree is called noble prince of the royal mysteries
0	as he covered his cheeks with scented lather and drew over them the blade of his silver-plated safety , he recalled his confused dreams and shook his head indulgently over so much nonsense , with the superior feeling a man has when shaving himself in the clear light of reason
0	what i perhaps most profoundly admire is the mastery with which the problem of sound-combination is solved
0	and in stronger and hardier hours he had blushed for his own weakness , for his own distress and sleepless nights , for his revulsion and disgust at the hateful and shameless harsh-ness of life !
0	it was a delegation of granary labourers , who camp straddling in like bears , the corners of their mouths drawn down with befitting solemnity and their caps in their hands
0	before the honeymoon was over she had had a blow so unforeseen , so unexpected , so incompre-hensible , that it took away all her joy in life
0	another time , his life had been saved from danger by water , when he had gone to bergen , as a young man
0	hope was no more
0	but you misunderstand me , the convulsion of nature to which i refer is not modern
0	lactantius , who was chosen by constantine the great as tutor to his son , put the position very clearly when he asked in so many words what heavenly bliss he could attain by knowing the sources of the nile , or the twaddle of the physicists anent the heavenly bodies
0	on the contrary , he belonged to those llen , vho prefer ill marriage to have all the economic power in their hands and to have their wives dependent on them
0	but when he saw tony 's frightened face he got down again and went on in a wheedling tone : good , good , say no more , antonie
0	she was well aware of her responsibilities toward the family and the firm , and she was proud of them
0	i would like to know whether epochs that possessed culture knew the word at an , or used it
0	on the right it was bounded by the curve of the mecklenburg coast ; but before her it stretched on and on till its blue and green streaks mingled with the misty horizon
0	the first elemen-tary difficulties were hardly got over when he began to theorize , in a simple way , with graphic illustrations , and to give his pupil the foundations of the theory of harmony
0	but one single pace forward , and the wind sliced at him like a scythe , and drove him back to the shelter of the wall
0	the night has fallen , our loved one may return any moment , and a meeting between you just now would perhaps not be quite well-advised
0	in my view we should de- mand something more
0	and going to bed with a match !
0	the winter drifts had wasted away , they were gone , save for vestiges here and there ; and the green slopes , the open paths , tempted the spirit to rove
0	luckily there was a vacant seat in the corner , near the door
0	adrian answered : oh , good !
0	so it is hard to measure the actual situation
0	the stiffened and perfumed mustaches , the meticulously shaven checks and chin , and the careful hair-dressing which sedulously hid a beginning thinness
0	there will always be men who are justified in this interest in themselves , this detailed observation of their own emotions ; poets who can express with clarity and beauty their privileged inner life , and thereby enrich the emotional world of other people
0	they are good enough to frame
0	then he kissed the little creature on the brow and said softly : god bless you !
0	it was then that two friends and professional colleagues visited him one afternoon and found an alarming state of things
0	there were hermine kleefeld , and herr albin—who carried about a great flowered box of chocolates , and offered them to all the guests , he himself eating none , but with a benevolent , paternal air smoking gold-tipped cigarettes ; there were the thick-lipped youth who belonged to the half-lung club , the thin and ivory-coloured fräulein levi , an ash-blond young man who answered to the name of rasmussen and carried his hands breast-high , with the wrists relaxed , like a pair of flippers ; frau salomon from amsterdam , a woman of full bodily habit , in a red frock , who had attached herself to the group of young folk ; the tall , thin-haired young man who could play out of the midsummer night ’ s dream sat on the step behind her , his arms about his bony knees , and gazed steadfastly down on the tanned back of her neck
0	yes , yes , laughed adrian , nodding , and they went into the house , into the pipe-tobacco air , and up to the upper storey , along the , vhite , damp-smelling walls , where the goodwife showed him his bedroom with the gay clothes-press and the high-piled white bed
0	now let us join the others
0	as it drew toward its end , the newly wedded pair disappeared , to begin their wedding journey , which was to include visits to several large cities
0	it begins with now let us all thank cod , goes over into the adaptation of offen-bach 's la belle helene , and winds up with a pot-pourri of folk-songs -- quite an extensive programme !
0	hardly wait for the music to begin again
0	after this affair , naturally , the friend-ship was about at an end
0	i smoked them with my coffee , he said , and thought no more of ’ it
0	the party held together for another hour , partly because they were all too leadenfooted and befuddled to rise , partly because this method of spending the hours of the night appealed to them by its novelty ; partly by the weight of peeperkorn ’ s personality , and the blasting example of peter and his brethren , to which they all shamed to yield
0	have you ever had a desire to commit murder ?
0	i shall fall dead at the news -- you will see !
0	he did not recall in all his experience so acceptable an easy-chair
0	dr krokowski did it by adopting a mingled terminology , partly poetic and partly erudite ; ruthlessly scientific , yet with a vibrating , singsong delivery , which impressed young hans castorp as being unsuitable , but may have been the reason why the ladies looked flushed and the gentlemen flicked their ears to make them hear better
0	young dr langhala was bending over him , changing a bloody bandage for a fresh one , which he dipped into a basin at the bedside
0	ida jungmann had gone to look after the linen for the guest-room
0	i did not begin too diplomatically , for i naively admitted in con- fidence that clarissa had preferred death to a life of dishonour
0	he is an angel , now , corrected sesemi
0	clara was a pious , ignorant woman , mother
0	that is not what irritates me
0	the result of the enormous authority that lay in his hands was that he grew more and more arbitrary and moody -- he was even capable of making a joke and then visiting with his wrath anybody who dared to laugh
0	when they had seen hin driving through his moun- tains , at night , alone , wrapped in furs , in a golden sledge with
0	once in the brentano cycle , he said , in ' lieb madel
0	when you were there on a visit , i concealed everything , for i am a tactful woman and do not burden others with my complainings , nor wear my heart on my sleeve on a week-day
0	and you , herr buddenbrook , are reading -- ?
0	and if not , so much the worse
0	settembrini compressed his lips , and hans castorp hastened to say that , as for his own attitude , it was of course entirely non-partisan ; he only meant that he had enjoyed hearing what naphta had to say about the deepest desire of youth
0	well , that doesn ’ t happen between one day and the next ; we ’ re not magicians
0	what made you think of it ?
0	call me sesemi , child , she said on the first day to tony buddenbrook , kissing her briefly , with a sound as of a small explosion , on the forehead
0	it comes near being told at the place where for the first time there is mention of the porter ; then it is dropped again
0	what has become false , worn-out cliche , the canon decides
0	they were not alone
0	i do not say it is possible -- i only say i wish it were
0	the truth was that the breakfast beer , as a rule only mildly obfuscating to the young man ’ s sense , had this time completely stupefied and befuddled him
0	well , what affair was that of mine ?
0	he quizzed frau stöhr with spirit , and made a few remarks about the carpenter ’ s son and rabbi of humanity , whose birthday they fancied they were celebrating to-day
0	mark , whoso for other pray himself he saves that waye
0	and always there was this curious equation of worthiness with sensual passion , this fixed and strangely drunken idea that inward worthiness could only fulfil itself , realize itself , in fleshly desire , which ob- viously was something of like value with worth ; that it was at once the highest and the most indispensable happiness to keep them together
0	yes , to make it all even more as it had been , mrs macdonald breathed her last , with the picture of her little son in her hand , and her room , next his cousin ’ s , reverted to joachim , after it had been thoroughly freed of bacteria by means of hco
0	at last the senator broke it by saying : i must say , christian , your ideas come rather late
0	our time itself tends , secretly - or rather anything but secretly ; in- deed , quite consciously , with a strangely complacent conscious
0	decent of you , to take an interest in my lungers , considering you are relatively sound yourself
0	the consul smiled again
0	cerda and thomas , however , were to take a trip to northern italy , as far as florence , and be gone about two months
0	he was about thirty-five years old , broad-shouldered and fleshy , much shorter than either of the youths before him , so that he had to tip back his head to look them in the face
0	he travelled direct from england , with-out coming home
0	we have got rather brown , he said , putting his arm arouml hanno as he stood before him
0	from behind him in the room hans castorp responded : that would be rather early—surely it can ’ t be settling down to winter already—but it has a terribly final look
0	they ought not to fetch the priest before one is quite weak
0	engineer , settembrini said sharply , almost angrily , pull yourself together and stop talking this demoralized rubbish
0	they stood together on the platform by the miniature train , in one of whose grey-upholstered compartments joachim kept a place with his overcoat , travelling-rug and roses
0	you seem not to have thought it might be possible to do something , to get help
0	drawing a paper from his pocket and laying his long finger with the signet ring to the side of his pointed nose , he read aloud , with a mock-heroic intonation : when the marechal saxe and the proud pompadour were driving out gaily in gilt coach and four , frelon spied the pair : 'oh , see them , he cried : 'the sword of our king -- and his sheath , side by side
0	and he spoke of priestly demagoguery , which began to vent its thirst for power in exaggerated solicitude for the under dog , when the top dog would none of it
0	it was now a question of probabilities : whether the symptoms of infection were to be referred to the insignificant amount of tubercle bacillus , or to the streptococci , which , also , were only present in small quantity
0	she said to me lately : 'there is nothing of the burgher about christian , thomas -- he is even less of a burgher than you are , yourself !
0	the act of fructification , the sexual merging of two cell-bodies , stood at the beginning of the upbuilding of every multiple-celled individual , as it did at the beginning of every row of generations of single elementary forms , and led back to itself
0	h am , well , yes , i agree with you
0	that was commendable of you
0	it beats not solely on physical grounds , as finger-nails grow on a corpse ; but humanly , on grounds of my joyful spirits
0	no , hans castorp said , when he was once more in his seat between the seamstress and the englishwoman , and had docilely unfolded his serviette , though still heavy with the earlier meal ; no , god help me , milk i never could abide , and least of all now !
0	while he had been at a safe distance she had hugely enjoyed the solemn conferences with her father and mother and the suddenly enhanced im- buddenbrddk portance of her own person and destiny
0	for i need hardly say that adrian was no very zealops participant and his membership was more a matter of form than of punctual per- formance of activities
0	two or three times she stammered : you are mistaken -- you are mistaken
0	yes , i like munich extremely
0	he suffered at limes also from spells of dizziness
0	it is all juggling and sophistry -- begging your pardon , he grumbled
0	is it not like a purifying bath for the mind ?
0	and took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee… then saith he unto them : … tarry ye here and watch with me
0	he looked quite yellow , and died without saying another word ?
0	he was affability itself
0	death was a joy , so great , so deep that it could be dreamed of only in momenta of revelation like the present
0	i never heard that before !
0	the leuchenfield , which took its name from the lighthouse that stood on it , somewhere off to the right , stretched its extent of short sparse grass under the pale sky , to a point where the grass passed into a growth of tall , coarse water- plants ; and then came the sand , with its rows of little wooden huts and tall wicker beach-chairs looking out to the sea
0	do not shriek like that -- control yourself , for god 's sake !
0	it is still alrnost nothing , what lies underneath , by comparison with all there is on top ; we give time , plenteous time , abundant time by the eye , the end whereof we do not need to consider , not for a long time yet , nor need to trouble yet awhile even of the point of time where you could begin to take heed to the ending , where it might come to arespice finez
0	the hofrat , bestriding a stool in front of the screen , lighted the light
0	they were on safer ground when they could sustain the conversation in the realms of the intellectual , and hold the attention of their audience by one of their elegant and impassioned debates , academic , yet conducted as though the matter discussed were the most burning question of the time , or of all time
0	saint elizabeth had been flogged by her confessor , conrad von marburg , until the blood came , and by such means her soul was rapt to the third choir of angels
0	now and then , indeed , if they happened to be alone , a jesting and teasing mood seemed to overcome him ; once he attempted to fall on his knees and approach his whiskers to her face , while he asked in a voice apparently trembling with joy , have i indeed captured you ?
0	we were driven by sheer force of logic to this conclusion ; dr krokowski implored his hearers , having arrived at it , to hold it fast
0	they waited for the glass to move
0	of course , a female !
0	and even with better visibility , the host of difficulties must have combined to hinder his progress : the snow in his face , his adversary the storm , which hampered his breathing , made him fight both to take a breath and to exhale it , and constantly forced him to turn his head away to gasp
0	you finally land at the objective di- rection , the name : allegro appassionato
0	he saw him stand , of an evening , in the card-room , among the other guests , quite lost in gazing at the lovely , contaminate creature on the sofa in the small salon , in talk with the whimsical , fuzzy-haired tamara , dr blumenkohl , and the hollow-chested , stooping young men who were her table-mates
0	mahlzeit , children , said he , languidly
0	wehsal had seen frau chauchat ’ s smile , and expressed himself on the subject to his companion , showing his bad teeth as he talked
0	she might be ugly , lame , crippled , disfigured by
0	often i called the thought to my aid when the problem of adri- an 's field of study plagued me
0	you know quite well your parents can only desire your good , and they can not counsel you to reject forthwith the position offered you
0	sleep is one of the—what did you call them , young man ? —one of the classic gifts of life—the first , the very first , the highest , ladies and gentlemen
0	it is even as tlugh our mjldly slumbering thuringian , vere woke up to a sevcn-hundred -- thou- £and-man ilpudence and smattered abhominably , ja , v stuck out - horrible , dreadful , but , god i ( eep us , certes meaning no harm , and mixed with self-mockery which they can graunt unto them- selves on the ground of their world-pulse
0	it is really rather frightening
0	i am astonished that such a stupid goose as i am have to tell you this -- yes , i am a stupid goose , and i should not be surprised if permaneder never loved me at all , for i am an ugly old woman , very likely , and babette is certainly prettier than i am !
0	so that at the decisive moment i wasn ’ t where all the others were , but behind the scenes , as you call it ; as i go along the corridor , they come toward me , in their lace robes , with the cross in front , a gold cross with lanterns—it made me think of the schellenbaum they march with , in front of the recruits
0	but hanno regained some little strength , consciousness returned ; and though the crisis which he had survived greatly hindered his progress in walking and talking , there was no longer any immediate danger to be feared
0	tell me , what do you think about greatness ?
0	one might have asked : and the good man too ?
0	nobody could say he broke his word
0	one might with truth say that he who was worthy of the one was fully worthy of the other
0	a respectful greeting from table to table—only that , for the time , no more
0	if i understand what he means by metabolism , it is nothing but physiology , and to talk about its being sanctified—irreverent , i call it
0	nowadays he too turned mottled when he changed colour , being too copper-tinted to grow really pale
0	if this foible added a quaint touch to his appearance , yet the effect was only of a slight negligence or licence due to age , which length of days either consciously and cheerfully permits itself , or else brings in its train without the victim ’ s being aware
0	i can not think of it today without wondering how i bore it so long
0	herr gr� threw him a quick look and seemed to grow slill more limp
0	for it turned out that they had mistaken a precipitate of sulphate of lime for protoplasm
0	he hastened to behrens , and found him in the lab , a cigar in one hand , and in the other a test-tube of dull-coloured fluid
0	as for the background of my actual narrative , up to the point whither i have brought it , i have characterized it at the beginning of this chapter in the phrase into the hands of strangers
0	you are beside yourself , your sufferings make you imagine preposterous things

0	was it her idea to attach herself to all these maternal figures and call theln sisters ?
0	during the years of approach- ing defeat and ever more gnawing stringency , he was , thank god , on the schweigestill farm as tolerably cared for as one could wish , without knowledge or appreciation of the state of things , almost unaffected by the slowly corroding changes under which our blockaded and invested country suffered , evell while militarily still on the offensive
0	that too was a work of immaturity
0	he sang the praises of the middle ages for forbidding the taking of interest
0	his face , with its light eyebrows , seemed serious and attentive as he worked ; but his thoughts travelled far away in the dark on their lonely , painful path
0	that 's what has happened !
0	i told you that in this difficult situation you could be a great help to me

0	the libretto from shakespeare 's comedy love 's labour 's lost , leverkiihn 's exuberant youthful composition , , vas my work ; i also had something to do with the preparation of the texts for the grotesque opera suite gesta rzanorum and the oratorio the revelation of st john tbe divine
0	well , was it beautiful ?
0	his hand hurried over the paper , never pausing except to dip his quill in the ink
0	a piece of music called a five-minute waltz lasts five minutes , and this is its sole relation to the time element
0	yes , if you will pardon me , i will take down this picture , there ’ s positively no light here where it hangs , permit me to carry it over to the sofa , we shall see if it won ’ t look entirely— what i meant to say was : what is the main concern of the study of medicine ?
0	it was absorbing to watch these ghostly pranks ; one needed to keep alert to follow the transmutations , the veiling and unveiling
0	what a lot of rooms !
0	truly , she bloomed anew in these weeks ; and their invigorating activity , the manifold plans , the search for suitable quarters , and the feverish preoccupation with furnishings brought back with such force the memories of her first betrothal that she could not but feel young again -- young and boundlessly hopeful
0	and what have i to expect from your sense of justice ?
0	every trace of strain was gone from the features , they had composed themselves , growing cold , into a silent purity of form
0	true , the circumstances had been extraordinary
0	and then 'antonie
0	he stumbled backward ; but at that moment sister julie appeared from behind a tree , like a little black demon , and , falling upon tony , tore off her hat and scratched her cheeks unmercifully
0	she shook her bird-like old head vig-orously , and her brown eyes were clouded with her distress
0	frau permaneder had hardly , with her sleepy senses , taken them in before she interpreted them as well , in such a way that she felt the blood leave her cheeks and rush to her heart , which contracted and then went on beating with heavy , oppressed pulsations
0	he would , so he would tell them , bring his music more into the fore- ground , and accordingly he was going to the city where the musi- cal mentor of his school-days was working
0	they wouldn ? t be so fortunate
0	dr faustus in his favour , and today too , when i go over it all again i feel mildly towards him , to a considerable extent touched by his tragic end
0	one might answer , life : a special power of resistance of the living protoplasm ; but this would be not to recognize the mystical character of such an explanation
0	she is a wonderful creature ; there are few like her in the world
0	such people incline to mistrust and bitterness
0	i want the linen and dishes
0	he carried his coat over his arm and his hat in his hand
0	she was wearing a thin dark silk this evening , cut round in the neck , with filmy sleeves finished by a buttoned cuff at the wrists
0	they all took part settembrini , naphta , hans castorp , ferge and wehsal—one and all slightly feverish , at once nervously stimulated and physically lethargic from walking and talking in the severe frost , all subject to fits of shivering , and—whether principals in the argument , like settembrini and naphta , or for the most part receptive , like the others , contributing only short ejaculations from time to time—all , without exception , so utterly absorbed that they stopped several times by the way , in a disorderly , gesticulating knot , blocking the path of the passersby , who had to describe a circle to get round them
0	it was not an optical toy which the guests discovered one evening in the salon , and greeted with applause , some of them flinging their hands above their heads , others stooping over and clapping in their laps
0	suddenly -- ihe carriage was rolling through castle street -- a wretched thing happened
0	it was a capital painting , by an artist of some note , in an old-masterish style that suited the subject and was reminiscent of much spanish , dutch , late middle ages work
0	he spoke again soon , this time on beethoven and the fugue
0	it did not cost anything , either , remarked herr gratjens drily -- he certainly ought to have known -- and studied the wall-painting through the hollow of his hand
0	was to see how the victim did not see that he had been be- witched
0	once on the other side , he could see what lay beyond
0	as they crossed the entry , he added , what do you say , for in-stance , to h c f burmeester and company in hamburg ?
0	i do not want the money
0	i do not blame permaneder for that , of course ; i do not mean that
0	but on the other hand , thank goodness , i have certain material rights on my side -- the consul walked up and down with his hands behind his back , his shoulders twitching nervously
0	ottilie was taken with high fever , her curve went well up
0	steps away , among the disarray of chairs , stands inez , who sees him and waits for him to stop clapping , turn round and speak to her
0	his voice sounded sinister
0	we are confident you will do your part
0	the ribs—thank heaven , he had them all ! —rose under the taut skin as he took deep inhalations , and the stomach fell away
0	will the deyil prohibit lust ?
0	place by the window
0	he lay quietly , giving himself up to the operation of the soda he had taken
0	mais c ’ est vrai , you are a little bourgeois
0	as hans castorp looked rather mortified , he added in his most charming manner : we all know you for a wag , engineer : but your sly quips at the expense of the true , the good , and the beautiful will never make me doubt your fundamental love of them
0	again you wo not answer me !
0	but the sum was fixed at eighty thousand
0	but as in the spiritual life everything is interrelated , one thing growing out of another , and since one may not reach out one ’ s little finger to the devil , lest he take the whole hand , and therewith the whole man ; since , on the other side , a sound principle can produce only sound results , no matter which end one begins at—so disease , far from being something too refined , too worthy of reverence , to be associated with dullness , is , in itself , a degradation of mankind , a degradation painful and offensive to conceive
0	energy and phlegm are not much use under
0	all monism is tedious
0	good time , divellishly german time !
0	your calling , as i have often said to you , has a certain charm about it
0	he said certain things—you know the ones i mean—about modern communism , and the religious zeal of the proletariat , and not withholding its hand from bloodshed—i wont discuss them further , but surely your grandfather , with his citizen ’ s pike , was a perfect ewe lamb by comparison—please forgive my language
0	buddenbr ddks but the man who gazed with furious ardour at thomas buddenbrook 's bride , the first time he saw her on the street , was cosch the broker
0	these sebaceous glands have little erector-muscles that act upon them , and when they do so , then you are like the lad when the princess poured the pail of minnows over him
0	the word is made for praise and honlage ; to the word it is given to astonish , to admire , and to bless ; it may characterize a phenomenon through the emotion it arouses ; but it can not con- jure up or reproduce
0	i am unfortunately without talent in that line , but i did what i could to encourage the mostly recalcitrant rudiger to visit pfeiffering
0	one would have to be as old as grandfather for that ; in these days , save for him and his old fiete , nobody , far and wide , wore such collars and neckcloths
0	' n ' then this buddenbrook -- he be so devilish fine wi ' his cuffs ' n ' his silk tie ' n ' his stickin'-out moustaches ; hast seen him walk ?
0	she would be forced to live in adultery : a just punishment for her philistinism , for what the wretch called her cowardly re- treat into bourgeois society
0	look , the sky is blue nearly all over
0	the french system of deportation had worked very badly
0	they had looked dreamy all the evening ; but now they stared into the candle-flame with a cold sharp gaze
0	but alongside the religious cast his reading took another direc- tion , which in certain times would have been characterized as wanting to speculate the elements
0	the prejudice that haunted him was grown to an itch , a ceaseless persecution-mania , which led him to smell out the vileness hidden or disguised in his neighbourhood and hold it up to scorn
0	but why do you ask ?
0	everywhere one saw people absorbedly bent over cameras supported in the pit or their stomachs , focusing and snapping the shutter ; and floods of snapshots were handed round at table
0	i caught your words and turned round
0	dr gieseke regretted being obliged to explain to her that neither the affair on the stairs nor the insult she had undoubtedly received , the pre-cise nature of which she hesitated to divulge , was sufficient ground for a divorce
0	then he slackened his pace , and finally almost stopped , as it seemed to him he must have got a good distance ahead of joachim
0	yes , she was unchanged
0	in my opinion the wretch , aside from satisfying his lust , had aimed at her death
0	but that was in his dreams—the waking hans castorp was no such matter , but a much less untrammelled person ; not disinclined , either , on the whole , to try out the influence upon himself of this novel human type , with its critical animus and acumen , despite the fact that he found the italian both carping and garrulous
0	something pressing , the tailor said curtly , stitching
0	after all , how else should i do while i ’ m up here ?
0	what is lacking is distance , con- trat , mere differentiation between the inaterial and the hand that shapes it
0	just a moment , thomas
0	after dinner , during the social half-hour , hans castorp came out of the music-room to look for his cousin , and saw him by the tiled stove , near marusja ’ s rocking-chair , which joachim held tipped back with his left arm , so that she looked up in his face from a half-lying posture , with her round brown eyes , and he bent over her , talking softly and disjointedly
0	in , when the french were in the country , he called us together and promised us a constitution
0	hans castorp sprang up and ran to the thermometer on the wall , as if to catch it in flagrante
0	and so -- it is madness to keep the house as dead capital
0	where did it come from ?
0	outside , the foundation storey was un- whitewashed and unadorned ; only above it did the ornamental woodwork begin
0	there stood the mighty tree , between the dark red window-curtains , towering nearly to the ceiling , decorated with silver tinsel and large white lilies , with a shining angel at the top and the manger at the foot
0	js ( _ t ) \ jf ' ; ' j will '
0	three rapid , noiseless steps forward -- and he was in his own room
0	it would be a pity
0	i never have a little fun with-out having to pay for it
0	i ( involuntarily ) : y ou mean in the brenning pit of fier ?
0	what an absurd want of style !
0	a pair of stairs led up to the first storey , where the consul opened a white door and admitted his guests to the billiard-room
0	the hortensia had been like homage at a ball , the brief chat with the two fine young cavaliers a tiny affaire de cœur ; she , the mother , had seen it
0	the latter felt less proud than one would expect
0	how the cock really swells his comb , or any of the other well-known instances come about , is still a mystery , particularly where it is a question of emotional influences in play
0	ah , that is you , herr settembrini !
0	hans castorp asked him succinctly , with the air of a connoisseur , circumstances betraying him to this tone
0	that the long-forgotten pribislav hippe should appear to him in the guise of frau chauchat and look at him with those kirghiz eyes—this was to be immured , not with opportunity , but with the inevitable , the unescapable , to such an extent as to fill him with conflicting emotions
0	there is no question of an extension
0	she went to god , and the firm of buddenbrooks received a large sum of money , a round hundred thousand thaler , which strengthened the working capital of the business in a highly desirable way
0	it was to be
0	i mean the grape , wine , the gift of the gods to man , as we are told of old time
0	i know there are two or three people here in the town who give lessons -- women , i think
0	he had only taken it over from the terroristic little naphta
0	and he brnke the dished when she was not
0	the housewife 's brothers , of whom i spoke , , vere two , one older and one younger than herself : ercolano manardi , lawyer , mostly called l ' avvocato for short , yet with some satisfaction too , he being the pride of the otherwise unlettered and rustic fanily , a man of sixty with bristling grey ustaches and a hoarse , com- plaining voice , which began with an effort like a donkey 's bray ; and sor alfonso , the younger , perhaps in the middle of his forties , intimately addressed by his family as alfo , a farmer
0	could not have gone off better , declared rudolf
0	i despise paradoxes , i hate them
0	he circles directly overhead , he hovers , not a single beat of his wing—at a tremendous height in the blue , and with his keen , far-sighted eyes under the prominent bony structure of his brows he is peering earthwards
0	no , no , he said , we ’ ll stop at the covers
0	i see , i see , i see , he said again , giving the s the same sharp sound as before
0	so the question is , are we dealing with a harmless infection or with something more serious ?
0	after this he took his instrument again and sang : he who the world will joyous rove
0	on the badly out-of-tune square piano in the frjends ' living- room he played to us once during our stay - unfortunately only once - from the completed sections , mostly already scored for a speciaiiy chosen orchestra , of the pleasant well-conceited comedy love 's labour 's lost , as the piece was caned in
0	he was some thirty years old ; his hair was thin , his teeth poor , and he had a self-depreciating manner of speech
0	how about the stitches in the right hilum , where it always sounded so sharp ?
0	fires on the mountain-top , and ring around-a-rosy about the leaping flames !
0	he said nothing , gave his feelings no vent -- to whom should lie speak , then ?
0	he found it not unlike life at the seashore
0	inez did not nurse her children ler- self , the family doctor having advised against it
0	the garden was full of young buds and bathed in tender sun-shine ; a pair of birds called and answered each other pertly
0	the consul could not look at him enough as they sat and drove
0	i can ’ t comprehend how in the world i—
0	it was a prophecy whose slighting note would have been harder to bear had he not known that prophecies are sometimes made in order that they may not come to pass—as a spell , indeed , against their fulfilment
0	but once in a way he would stop rather longer , standing there broad-shouldered and sturdy , ever with his manly smile , chatting with the comrade of this and that : the weather , the various departures and new arrivals , the mood the patient was in , whether good or bad ; sometimes about his personal affairs , origin and prospects—before he uttered the formula : good day to you and passed on
0	then the wife in justifiable wrath had left him , and for the rest of his life he had seen himself confined to the unaccommodating idol
0	several people were standing by rudolf , among them dr kranich , holding his hand
0	he is likely to demand equal shares with my sister and me after your death , which would mean a loss of hundreds of thousands to the firm
0	i ’ d feel a perfect coward
0	finally they sent her to davos , but that seemed to have been the finishing touch , for she died there almost at once , just as she had wished and wanted it , and if she had been right in her idea that everything had been evened up by the readiness for death , then she , vas quits and had got what she was after
0	when they met , adrian trembled for a long time , resting his head on the breast of the woman he called mutter and du
0	when this happened , the school yard became a desert , the day lacked all charm , hope alone lingered
0	but on the other hand , he felt a lively pleasure at having actually carried out his undertaking
0	that power is evil we know
0	joachim was quite cool , this being for him no new experience , hans castorp rather feverishly expectant , as no one , up to the present , had ever had a view into his organic interior
0	but i think , tom , he ought to stop swearing , went on the frau consul with mild disapproval
0	so that , however strange it may seem , this chapter , ' w
0	her most powerful realization for the senses she finds in orchestral music , where through the ear she seems to affect all the senses with her opiate wand and to mingle the pleasures of the realm of sound with those of colour and scent
0	hans castorp asked : a—what ?
0	of this uprooted child of patrician stock , striving towards in- tellectual and artistic goals
0	his head shook with the effort he made ; but he finally managed to bring out a well i and the spell was broken
0	they will still lay it to my charge - as though things would have turned
0	he let himself down sidewise on one of the high-backed chairs around the dining-talle , and held his hat and stick between his thin knees
0	but on the whole he was sound and fit , an adequate tennis player and rower ; though actually handling the oars was less to his taste than sitting of a summer evening on the terrace of the uhlenhorst ferry-house , with a good drink before him and the sound of music in his ears , while he watched the lighted boats , and the swans mirrored in the bright water
0	no , of course , it was out of the question
0	have you never heard of german becoming , of german wandering , of the endless migratings of the german soul ?
0	i should be so glad to learn something
0	as i say , i am for selling at the right time
0	what a love of a woman !
0	hans castorp retained only pale memories of his parental home
0	what am i laughing at ?
0	it was clavdia ’ s x-ray portrait , showing not her face , but the delicate bony structure of the upper half of her body , and the organs of the thoracic cavity , surrounded by the pale , ghostlike envelope of flesh
0	it must have been a happy few days for both of you
0	it was the worst hole they had ever found themselves in , devil take it !
0	by the ocean of time
0	nowadays we have it down finer than that ; but even so it ’ s a good plan to get the mortis causa fixed up beforehand
0	adrian nor i really liked and whom he had presupably invited along with the departed spengler ; helmut lnstitoris , no , v a sort of widower ; the clearly articulating dr kranich ; frau binder- majorescu , the knoterichs , the hollow-cheeked jester and acad- emy portrait-painter nottebohm and his wife , brought by in- stitoris
0	i was pleased to say , said the italian , swallowing , i am pleased to say , that i am resolved to prevent you from continuing to molest a defenceless youth with your equivocations
0	a work that deals with the tempter , with apostasy , with damnation , what else could it be but a religious work ?
0	the hofrat had advised a stay of three months
0	even more unsightly symptoms , therefore , must not be tai { en too seriously
0	thus ended the campaign of the flat-land to recover its lost hans castorp
0	i knew all the time that i was making it myself—the park with the trees , the delicious moisture in the air , and all the rest , both dreadful and dear
0	i had considerable dealings with him some while back : count strelitz , a very smart-appearing man , with a square eye-glass ( i could never make out why he did not cut himself ) , patent-leather top-hoots , and a riding-whip with a gold handle
0	he tried to fit his speech with gestures , then perceived that they were awkward , and gave it up
0	you will kindly address me with the accepted form employed in the educated countries of the west , the third person pluralis , if i may make bold to suggest it
0	often , in an hour of depression , thomas buddenbrouk asked himself what he was , or what there was about him to make him think even a little better of himself than he did of his honest , limited , provincial fellow-burghers
0	hans castorp had flushed ; joachim , in act to button his braces , paused as he stood , and listened
0	in fact , he showed disquiet and embarrassment whenever the conversation turned to the dead
0	two weeks had passed ; and hanno said to himself , and to every one who would listen to him , that there was still as much time left as the whole of the michaelmas holidays amounted to
0	the little eyes were almost in the right place , so was the pointed ear , and the tiny legs under the rounded little belly ; the curving line of the back ended in a small neat ringlet of tail
0	probably she took over-doses , which did not increase her animation but reduced her to a state in which she could not appear in public
0	the tones coming from the choir had resembled delicate instrumental music and evoked an impression of heavenly mildness and piety in the hearer
0	you will make yourself ill are things so very bad ?
0	but you mus not give way , tom
0	but it isn ’ t a humanistic gesture , speaking latin in honour of death ; and the latin isn ’ t what you learn at school , either—the spirit of it is quite different , one might almost say hostile
0	the little company in meng street , not committed , as we have seen , to large entertainments , had the more leisure for intimacy with each other
0	settembrini was silent a few paces
0	what he wants and gives is triumph over it , is shining , sparkling , vainglori- ous unreflectiveness !
0	what are you thinking of ?
0	it would have been un- thinkable
0	his excellent chair , with the sectional mattress and the neck-roll , he pulled close to the snow-cushioned balustrade ; at his hand was the white table with the lighted readinglamp , a stack of books , and a glass of creamy milk , the evening milk which was brought to each of the guests ’ rooms at nine o ’ clock
0	as the others entered , the house-boy , in shirt-sleeves and good-natured grin , was just bringing in a fresh supply of bottles
0	awaiting the final collapse , beyond which the mind refuses its office , i have withdrawn within my freising hermitage and shun the sight of our horribly punished munich : the fallen statues , the gaping eyeholes in the fa
0	right , then , of course , as i always am , behrens answered himself
0	above the whole , in the tall , gothic hand of him who had left it to his descendants , was the quotation : my son , attend with zeal , to thy busi-ness by day ; but do none that hinders thee from thy sleep at night
0	then the judglllent upon this very biron : you shall this twelvemonth term from day to day visit the speechless sick , and still converse with groaning wretches ; and his cry : it can not be : mirth can not move a soul in agony !
0	hans castorp slapped his thigh and threw himself back against the bench , looking up at the sky
0	but now he said : sapristi , engineer !
0	if not for the symptoms of infection , they were not worth noticing
0	pure and godly manner of life , strictly regulated , hard-working and dietetically sound , full of sacrifice and self- discipline
0	in short , it came close to being blasphemous
0	herr settembrini seemed to bring together in a single breath categories which in the young man ’ s mind had heretofore been as the poles asunder—for example , technology and morals !
0	they all do it , without exception , and all of them are only too much at home up here
0	the family thurs-day afternoon was put off on some pretext
0	it happens to be just pre- cisely my favoured language
0	why must he be for ever opposing these scruples against the hard , practical affairs of life ?
0	that makes a bond between people as far apart as paul and virgil 's leneas
0	and , finally , there were the little daughter of hermann and the little son of moritz , two white-frocked children , already as good as betrothed to each other , for the huneus-hagenstrbm money must be kept together , of course
0	the mygrim , the point of attack for the knife-pains of the little sea- maid - after all , you have them from him
0	it was too dark in the carriage to see his expression
0	it was the difference of the life-curve between good , yes , excellent average , which was destined to return from that roving , seeking student life to its bourgeois courses , and the other , invisi- bly singled out , who would never forsake the hard route of the mind , would tread it , who knew whither , and whose gaze , whose attitude , never quite resolved in the fraternal , whose inhibitions in his personal relations made me and probably others aware that he himself divined this difference
0	i ’ ll be here too , to help make things comfortable , and befitting the officer and gentleman he is
0	but ihis single bond was very close , even from his earliest school rlays
0	tony and morten seated themselves in one of the little rooms facing the sea ; it smelled of wood , like the cabins at the bathhouse
0	the truth was that the town had been the whole day in a state of unrest
0	i am the one to be grateful , for permission to sit here a little ; i get a great deal more out of it than you—i assure you my motives are not altruistic
0	but see , i do know it
0	hans castorp , seated in his capacity of patient , looked up at him with an expression that betrayed mental activity
0	ellen brand rested her finger lightly on the glass and directed her pure , childlike gaze away into the rosy light from the table-lamp
0	the former , indeed , all the while protested that he was just a plain man , and this high-flown stuff utterly beyond him , his experience with the pleura-shock having been the sole event in his life to raise it above the most humdrum sphere
0	contagious diseases , plague , black death , were probably not of this planet ; as , almost certainly indeed , life itself has not its origin on our globe , but came hither from outside
0	but the demands made by himself and by others upon his talents and his rapacities were constantly increased
0	she put her hand on the portfolio that -lay before her on the table
0	the green cap-strings still fell down upon the old lady 's childish shoulders ; but she had grown so tiny , with her seventy-five years of life , that she could scarcely raise her elbow high enough to gestic-ulate above the surface of the table
0	upon manzoni ’ s inni sacri !
0	oh , no , no , said the consul , pulling himself together , and making a weak gesture of dissent
0	was noted down the awful screari given to the mocking , bleating bassoon , the wail of the bird ; or perhaps that song and answer , like an antiphony , which on first hearing so gripped my heart - the harsh choral fugue to the words of jeremiah :
0	if necessary , of course , there were other expedients—for instance , artificial nourishment
0	then there was an odd , tiny little woman with a large head , who put up a huge tattered umbrella at every sign of a storm
0	you threw your honour overboard without getting any return
0	a few bool { s lay on the table : a little volume of kleist , with the bool { -mark at the essay on marionettes ; the indispensable volume of shakespeare sonnets and another book with some of the plays - twelfth night i think , mucb ado about nothing , and i believe ywo gen- tlemen of verona
0	as for schwerdtfeger , well knowing how many curious eyes he would meet , he scarcely during the whole evening looked down into the parterre
0	was it your earthly part which lay there alone on your balcony , while your spirit revelled below , with captain miklosich and his kisses ?
0	the truth is , the seasons here are not so distinct from each other ; they run in together , so to speak , and don ’ t keep to the calendar
0	somewhere else , in some far-off clime , clavdia was letting doors slam behind her , somewhere else she was expressing herself by that act , as intimately bound up with her very being and its state of disease as time is bound up with the motion of bodies in space
0	it is the demand of which i speak
0	, atisfactions , stimulating his urge to improve
0	yes , thanks , with the greatest pleasure , answered the buddenbrdoks banker , and there was a pause while he presumably helped himself
0	then passed several days , occupied in hans castorp ’ s mind with the question how this blood of his , this part of himself , would behave out of his control and under the eye of science
0	you are so quiet , tom
0	behrens answered , she ’ d never think of it
0	all the residue is elaboration , sticking at it
0	the next moment little johann sat upright in bed , stammering incomprehensibly , and staring wilh wide-open , strange golden-brown eyes into a world which he , and he alone , could see
0	the bench on which they sat leaned against the steep wall of the mountain-side , and near them a spring in an open wooden trough ran gurgling and plashing to the valley
0	it would be a pretty bit of property , if the grass were cut and the trees trimmed into formal shapes
0	these few lines will tell you that the vision has never ceased to hover before his spiritual eye ; that never has he during these interminably anxious months ceased to think of the precious afternoon in your parental salon , when you let fall a blushing promise which filled me with bliss unspeakable !
0	hans castorp being taken by another fit of laughing , his cousin laughed too , with hearty enjoyment , and told other funny things to add fuel to their merriment
0	i have always objected to the perpetual occupation of young heads with greek and latin
0	a week later there sat in senator buddenbrook 's private office , in the leather chair beside the writing-desk , a little smooth-shaven old man with snow-white hair falling over his brow and temples
0	he had a habit of slowly and cautiously stroking the red-brown moustache that grew over his mouth with the extended middle and index fingers of his left hand ; or he would rub his hands together and let his round brown eyes wander so aimlessly about that he gave the impression of complete confusion and absent-mindedness , though he was always must watchfully bent on the matter in hand
0	i vvill characterize it , however little the desig- nation i have in mind will seem applicable to a jest
0	the family of my late mother
0	a wild grape-vine , springing from bare roots at the door , flung an arm along the ground-floor wall towards the display window of a tiny shop
0	he fairly pushed himself away from it
0	that is what we recognized betimes and why from early on we had an eye on you - we saw that your case was quite definitely worth the trouble , that it was a case of the most fa- vourable situation , whereof with only a little of our fire lighted under it , only a little heating , elation , intoxication , something brilliant could be brought out did not bismarck say something about the germans needing half a bottle of champagne to arrive at their normal height ?
0	more than that can no man
0	she complained of relaxation
0	my daughter 's munich friend , she began , lives so far away that we shall have no opportunity to repay her hospitality
0	be reason-able , for heaven 's sake
0	hans castorp suitably explained and excused his seeming intrusion , speaking in a low , moved voice , with delicate reverence
0	repeated the frau consul , inquiringly
0	and i have to stagnate up here—yes , just stagnate like a filthy puddle ; it isn ’ t too crass a comparison
0	the church , in which they survived , has set itself to oppose astronomical knovvledge in the humanistic spirit ; bedevilled and forbidden it to the honour of the hulnan being ; out of humanity has insisted on ignorance
0	't is whether which dub d ' th ' three be ahead o ' the others , eh ?
0	we shall see if i am not quite a different chap when i come back
0	it simplified the return
0	hans castorp suggested that he be released from his post of first control , but dr krokowski refused
0	speak openly , tony , have you learned to love your hus-band in these years of marriage ?
0	certainly we must deem him lost and undone , and the object of our just concern
0	after that you just keep on saying amadame ' : 'ah , madame , madame , que pensez-vous , madame ; on me dit , madame , que vous ctes fana- tique de musique ?
0	well , anyhow , hans castorp considered , so much was granted : that in the antithesis between body and soul it was undoubtedly the body which embodied—the body embodied , that wasn ’ t so bad , was it ? —the evil principle ; in so far as the body was naturally nature—pretty good , too , that ! —and nature , being diametrically opposed to the spirit and reason , was by that fact intrinsically evil—mystically evil , one might say , if it didn ’ t sound like showing off !
0	and so this , said he , after he had greeted the young girl and exclaimed over her likeness to her mother , is the new member of the family ?
0	surely , i answered him , you wo not defend such a ridiculous and dogmatic arrangement , such childish rationalism as this in- vention of masters and servants
0	for these good gifts he praised germany ; praised her for her past , but awarded his own country the palm , because she had been the first to unfurl the banner of freedom , culture , and enlightenment , at a time when all other lands were wrapped in the darkness of superstition and slavery
0	with him it had grovvn to be something like a state of mind , in which past and future merged together ; the cool gaze he directed upon the hypertrophy of the post-romantic monster orchestra , the need he felt for its reduction and return to the an- cillary role that it had played at the time of the preharmonic , the polyphonic vocal music ; his tendency in this direction and thus to oratorio , a species in which the creator of the revellltion of st john and the lajlentcltion of dr faustus would later achieve his highest and boldest flights - all this came out very early in
0	and , as ever , hans castorp was filled by emotion at the sound , an emotion which this time circumstances magnified and as it were condensed into a longing ; he thought : barren and sinful or no , it would be a marvellous thing , a darling adventure !
0	all the good fellows , among them dr gieseke and peter dbhlmann , took leave of him at the station , and brought him flowers and cigars , and laughed to split their sides -- recalling , no doubt , all the stories christian had told them
0	but as consciousness of self it also strengthens life , and in this sense - i mean also to this extent - i call it good
0	we sit here visiting , but i really came to-night on a serious and im-portant errand
0	he was habitually observant and critical of this feature , and accustomed when he made a new acquaintance to direct his attention first upon it
0	the senator walked at her side , his hands behind his back , his head bowed
0	that cast a somewhat singular light on the art of verse-writing , naphta retorted , but was not otherwise worth answering
0	thomas buddenbrook 's prestige was of a different kind
0	good-morning , he said cheerily , with the idea of lending the scene a note of the natural , which should help to dissipate its evil bearing—but was out of luck , for nobody answered
0	of course , i leave , and so on
0	if you said that illness is sometimes a consequence of depravity , that would at least be sensible
0	for this hellish laughter at the end of the first part has its pend- ant in the truly extraordinary chorus of children which , accom- panied by a chamber orchestra , opens the second part : a piece of cosmic music of the spheres , icily clear , glassily transparent , of brittle dissonances indeed , but withal of an - i would like to say - inaccessibly unearthly and alien beauty of sound , filling the heart with longing without hope
0	we shudder as we realize that a connection subsists between it and the nether world , and that the reassuring epitheta which i sought to apply : sane , noble , harmonious , hu- mane , do not for that reason quite fit , even when - i force my- self , however painfully , to make this distinction - even when they are applied to a pure and genuine , god-given , or shall i say god- inflicted genius , and not to an acquired kind , the sinful and mor- bid corruption of natural gifts , the issue of a horrible bargain
0	it is the angel of the in- dividual , the genius of his life , in whose all-knowing guidance it gladly confides
0	pity you aren ’ t a member , you could get me in as a guest , as—as associate half-lunger—you ought to ask behrens to put you out of commission , then perhaps you could learn to whistle too ; it must be something one could learn—well , that ’ s the funniest thing ever i heard in my life !
0	laugh , dream , and feel amazement , when the world yet makes upon us not one single demand ; when the impatience of those whom we should like so much to love does not yet torment us for evidence of our ability to succeed in the impending strug-gle
0	it is your turn
0	but he had taken it up and thought it over
0	its colour toned beautifully with the paper above the wainscoting , and its large-flowered stuff , of a beautiful soft texture , was embroidered all over with sprays of tiny glass beads of the same colour , while row after row of red velvet ribbons ran from neck to hem
0	a touch of indigestion
0	they began to get used to the noise that rose and fell outside , to feel quieter ; to make themselves more comfortable , to sit down on the lower benches and chairs
0	at first there had been posts , staves set up as guides through the snow— but he had soon cut free from their tutelage , which recalled the coastguard with his horn , and seemed inconsistent with the attitude he had taken up toward the wild
0	ah , ha , ah , ha !
0	it was not particularly ladylike , this hand that was putting the braids to rights ; not so refined and well kept as the hands of ladies in hans castorp ’ s own social sphere
0	talking about post-mortems already
0	hans castorp ’ s charitable impulse was stronger than his cousin ’ s distaste ; which the latter , moreover , could only manifest by silence and averted eyes , since he could not stand for it except by betraying a lack of christian feeling
0	it enters my head that perhaps i ca not swallow , and then all of a sudden i ca not
0	he did not see the servant who opened the door
0	that was a polite exaggeration , settembrini answered
0	but i do not believe we should actually become bank-rupt if he put down his pen a quarter of an hour sooner
0	one of these appeared to be a nervous distaste for the expression of feeling
0	here were tall , stout , lusty rascals who would soon go to sea or else begin a mer-cantile career , and who had no further interest in their school life ; and small , ambitious lads , far ahead of their age , who were brilliant in subjects that could be got by heart
0	but -- or so said herr longuet , the livery man in john street , as he himself drove the covered char-a-banc up to the door of the house in meng street : the sun will be out before an hour is over -- which was most encouraging
0	oh , you are only here for a short time ? -- this from another lady
0	tony and her mother did hear from him , in the course of conversation , what dishonourable means gr� had used to get hold of the eighty thousand marks ; but the consul was careful to give the matter no pub-licity
0	but he had long since resigned himself to his fortunes ; and in his later years , especially after his nephew turned over to him the consulate of the netherlands , he ate his lozenges out of his tin box and harboured the friendliest feelings
0	reckoning at twenty pfennig the kilo , this would come to fifty-seven marks and sixty pfennig
0	up to that moment he had not been fully aware of the changes the last weeks had made in joachim—the young have not much eye for such things
0	is it conceivable for a psalmist to make god ask : wouldo i then eat the flesh of bulls and drink the blood of goats ? '
0	i am about to do something that would , in a novel , break all the canons : i mean to introduce into the narrative an invisible charac
0	his superiors were alarmed by a hæmorrhage ; he hovered for weeks between life and death , when they hurried him , barely convalescent , back whence he had come
0	what i mean is , it wo not turn out all right
0	he never heard the work , one of the two chief monuments of his proud and austere life ; but after all he used to say about hearing i do not feel entitled to lament the fact
0	and go his stiff-kneed way
0	do you hear , tilda ?
0	the view was cut off by the grey side-wall of the neighbouring villa
0	it will be so easy !
0	weeks passed like this : four , five , six weeks
0	we are going to the city
0	i am staggered—i admit it
0	the family dining-room and the much larger kitchen , in vhich friends from the village were entertained , lay in the upper storey
0	that this nervous complaint set in precisely on festal occasions , under the influence of emo- tion and excitement , is understandable
0	a bowl of fresh and dried fruits stood in the centre of the table
0	but that 's been over with for a long while now
0	he was all the time saying how clever and resourceful he was , and all the time hiding his villainy
0	the good soul read about cinderella , about the prince who could not shiver and shake , about rumpelstiltskin , about ra-punzel and the frog prince -- in her deep , patient voice , her eyes half-shut , for she knew the stories by heart , she had read them so often
0	he bent over the grave and spoke to the dead , calling her by her full name , and blessed her with the sign of the cross
0	when good dr grabow begged him to relax a little , iip answered , oh , my dear doctor , i have not reached that point yet !
0	it could subsist , in his mind , along with a degree of distaste for any social approach
0	the third exception , related to the second , was a journey to basel , which he made in company with his teacher kretschmar to attend the performances of sacred music of the baroque period , which the basel chamber choir gave in st mar- tin 's church
0	it was a frightened cry , and it repeated itself in an even more anguished tone the next minute ; and then three , four , five times more , one after an-other
0	is the record here ?
0	but herr naphta preferred to discredit art sooner than admit that it might have a humanizing effect upon a sunken wretch
0	he appeared in the first storey , where he was received by the three ladies , mother , daughter , and grand-daughter , talked for ten minutes , and promised to return an-other day for coffee and more leisurely conversation
0	and now began for tony buddenbrook a stretch of beautiful summer weeks , briefer , lovelier , than any she had ever spent in travemunde
0	then the process was repeated on the left side ; then the hofrat commanded : turn !
0	thus they came to an affectionate settlement ; the consul jingled his keys like a man satisfied as he got up
0	i ’ m glad i ’ m here still , for this , said hans castorp to his cousin
0	with a hospitable motion of his small right hand he would have ushered them to the satin chairs
0	it is quite different
0	but when one looked across the intervening space , at the towering marble statuary of the high alps in full snow , one felt a quite different emotion , and that was awe of their majestic sublimity
0	it was a large volume , poorly printed on cheap paper and poorly sewed ; the second part , only , of a famous philosophical system
0	with his never heavy luggage , to which belonged a brief-case with his scores and the rubber tub which in italy too had fur- nished his bath , he travelled to his goal from the starnberger sta- tion on one of the local trains , which stopped not only in walds- hut but ten minutes later in pfeiffering
0	it had always been , as far back as he could remember , the question
0	he ate twice a day in the best hotel and was a member of the club
0	un de nos pensionnaires , qui est un peu devenu mon ami , m settembrini— il vient de te lancer quelques paroles
0	y ou know what i find ?
0	i ought to practise my sonatas and etudes and then stop
0	the firm round chin was the old man 's , and the straight , well-chiselled nose
0	fine people come late , said consul buddenbrook , and kissed his mother-in-law 's hand
0	the muscles of his mouth and cheeks , other-wise obedient to his will , relaxed and became flabby
0	to-day it was frau chauchat who issued from the portal , in company with her concave fellow-countryman , herr buligin , who was to accompany her for part of the way
0	yes , russia must give herself time to recover from her little mishap in the east
0	the question , the great question , could now not be put off any longer
0	during the next few minutes one scarcely saw one ’ s neighbours ; then their eyes slowly accustomed themselves to the darkness and made the best use of the light they had—which was slightly reinforced by the small dancing flames from the chimney-piece
0	under his tutelage , they tasted the classic gifts of life : coffee and cream with fresh bread , moist cheese and fragrant alpine butter , heavenly-tasting with hot roasted chestnuts
0	when you have made your rounds , you are wiser than anybody : you have had the heads of nearly all the great houses under your hand , and know the mood of each one
0	the gay old lady continued to talk in her semifluid tongue at the care-worn dr blumenkohl , diagonally opposite ; her lean niece actually at last ate something else than yogurt ; namely , the thick cream of barley soup , which was handed round in soup-plates by the waitresses
0	it ’ s old , of course ?
0	after joachim ’ s cavalier treatment of madame chauchat—in which hans castorp seemed to savour something almost like faint hostility on his cousin ’ s part toward their fair fellow-patient , a hostility at which he could not help smiling , despite the commotion in his mind—clavdia tried a turn up and down the room
0	and that is not all ; it is , pedagogically speaking , only the beginning
0	they are very fine people , in mind and heart
0	the way things stand : this zany has taken away your beatrice from you , yet you—it is unheard of
0	but one only keeps a thing so long as it is rising or at least keeping steady
0	this was a practical , rational modern town
0	the letter b comes next , kai , so there 's not much help for it
0	everybody knew that the bond between the lawyer and frau salomon from amsterdam , after subsisting for several months , had been broken by common consent , and that frau salomon had followed the leanings of her time of life and taken up with callow youth
0	there will be a heavy rain , but no wind
0	you will develop your convictions another time , naphta cut him off icily
0	this was the one
0	i can not wait any longer
0	will you contemn them , in favour of some suggestion—hocus-pocus and emotional charlatanry ?
0	again they are billeted in the town for a time , are mustered out and go home -- to ijie great relief of the cheering citizens
0	she once related in a letter the story of how she met in the street a mason 's ap-prentire , carrying a mug of beer in one hand and holding a large white radish by its tail in the other ; who , waving his beer , said jovially : neighbour , can ye tell us the time ?
0	i have been working now for several days on these pages ; but though i try to keep my sentences balanced and find fitting expression for my thoughts , the reader must not imagine that i do not feel my- self in a state of permanent excitement , 'which even expresses it- self in a shakiness in my handwriting , usually so firm
0	i have already mentioned the garden of the cloister above the town , to which our friends climbed every morning with their portfolios to work apart
0	she was still about when i first came up here , and she could be wildly hilarious , regularly giggly , like a little kid
0	human reason needs only to will more strongly than fate , and she is fate !
0	marie ( in other words mile godeau ) addressed her as ma tante or tante isabeau ; she apparently lived with her niece as companion and housekeeper
0	tables were laid in both dining- and living-room , and there were a hired cook and waiters and kistenmaker wines
0	but enough on this theme
0	the corridor door opened , and there stood before them in the twilight , in a pleated pique house-frock , white as snow , a slender figure
0	it was you italians that invented banking and exchange , which may god forgive you !
0	but the weakness was burdensome too and went far to spoil the meal hours for him , which he had otherwise continued to find diverting and full of interesting episode
0	in your splendid walls live well ,
0	they bring you your midday broth , as they brought it yesterday and will bring it to-morrow ; and it comes over you—but whence or how you do not know , it makes you quite giddy to see the broth coming in—that you are losing a sense of the demarcation of time , that its units are running together , disappearing ; and what is being revealed to you as the true content of time is merely a dimensionless present in which they eternally bring you the broth
0	it would never occur to anyone to call you that
0	listen , my dear child , said the consul , stroking her hair
0	it was in the light of what he had said , he went on , that the work he was speaking of in particular , sonata ope i i i , was to be regarded
0	he wished , he said , not to offend either side
0	my cousin and i have had the privilege of frequent conversations with him on this and kindred subjects—what it amounted to , of course , was that we listened while he explained and developed his views—so i can vouch for the fact , and my cousin here will confirm me , that herr settembrini spoke more than once , with great enthusiasm , of the revolutionary principle , and about rebellion and reform—which is no very peaceful principle , i should think—and of the mighty efforts still to be made before it triumphs everywhere , and the great universal worldrepublic can come into being
0	but no one will suppose that the city he had chosen to live in really took him to her bosom or ever made him her own
0	they are not worth printing , the reader may easily find th
0	the word , even the most contradictious word , preserves contact—it is silence which isolates
0	life and experi- ence can give to single syllables an accent utterly divorcing them from their common meaning and lending them an aura of horror , which nobody understands who has not learned them in that awful context
0	and even so they are dead , said jonathan , and tears came in his eyes , while adrian , as of course i saw , was shaken vvith sup- pressed laughter
0	i know that during the writing of the we of the apocalypse he vore the jewel on his left hand
0	it is rather something psychical ; it means that the perception of time tends , through periods of unbroken uniformity , to fall away ; the perception of time , so closely bound up with the consciousness of life that the one may not be weakened without the other suffering a sensible impairment
0	and who can lead a theological existence without me ?
0	the snow mounted apace , it became a nuisance
0	you think so too , do not you ?
0	but they say that down there ; even the most cultured people do , and it does not hurt anything -- it slips out once in a while and nobody minds
0	and your perceptions are perfectly correct , naphta responded
0	but herr settembrini was only a representative—of things and forces worth hearing about , it was true , but not the only forces there were
0	hans castorp stumbled once or twice on the level street and grinned ruefully as he shook his head
0	every morning joachim appeared arrayed in white flannel trousers , to greet his cousin , and hans castorp felt a pang of regret , in which both heart and youthful muscles joined , at the loss of all this splendid weather
0	it was worthy of all respect -- herr k�en called it respeck
0	well , it is the tenth of september
0	eva ewers slept with her
0	now the frau consul rose
0	that was an instance of a technical mischance , the conse- quence of an error
0	but of course matter that is capable of taking those ascending stages by dint of outward pressure must have a little something in itself to start with
0	she looked at him
0	grown up bet\\'cen two lan- guages , she wrote ladylike and original studies of society in a charmingly incorrect idiom peculiar to herself alone
0	oh , yes ; that is south-german , said the consul , breathing the smoke slowly out into the room
0	in very truth , dead spirit is more repulsive to the living than dead matter , than granite for example , which makes no claim to be alive
0	ushered in by the technician , frau chauchat was entering the laboratory
0	madame antoinette , in a white lace cap and an apron over her striped frock , was busy with flannel and linen at the table
0	they would consider it an insult , and i should be punished for insubordination -- all for having discovered for them a much higher significance in their calling than they themselves were aware of !
0	tony sat in silence , and he did not un-dertake to engage her ; only gazing at her now and then , with his head a little tilted , his face looking dejected and encouraged by turns
0	no call for panic , he varied his theme
0	grandfather said thou to him and addressed him in dialect—not with any humorous intent , for he had no bent that way , but in all seriousness , and because it was his custom so to do in his dealings with the common people—the warehouse hands , postmen , coachmen , and servants
0	you call that recently ?
0	we have to banish the bright daylight and its pretty pictures out of our minds
0	but when there came a sudden mild spell , he would find that the soup he had brought with him in chunks had melted and run away
0	the four guests from the berghof had met settembrini there , and by chance naphta also
0	they were folio-wed by the piercing cry of the new member of the family , who had just waked up
0	which does not prevent his hair and nails from growing , or , all in all—but no , we shall not repeat those free-and-easy expressions used once by joachim , to which hans castorp , newly arrived from the flat-land , had taken exception
0	he has the reputation of having got so-and-so many dishonest bankrupts off scot-free
0	according to him , it was absurd to prate about human dignity , since true dignity indwelt not in the flesh but in the spirit
0	is the food decent up here ?
0	no , i would not , my dear arzt , answered deutschlin , vith some leat
0	since he went to bed , the cold and cloudy weather had given place to a succession of wonderful midsummer days
0	for he loved it all , the seats , the musicians , the drop-curtain -- even the smell of gas
0	when i am bored i sometimes poke about down here
0	we should give it out only in the form of praise—of complete and utter—enough , ladies and gentlemen
0	no more than a hands-breadth or so of space had been between his face and hers , whose outline and features , peculiar though they were , had been familiar to him as long as he could remember , and spoke to his very soul as nothing else could in all the world
0	he had seen it coming long before , he had felt it beforehand , before any one else had such an idea in his head
0	a whole year long the pride of the spirit asserted itself against the injury it had received , and it was always a sort of con- solation to me to feel that his surrender to the naked instinct that had laid its spiteful finger on him had not lacked all and every human nobility or psychological veiling
0	she merely pouted , sticking out her al-ready prominent upper lip still further over the lower one
0	it is almost as fine as gr� 's , and much finer than permaneder 's !
0	i levelled this reproach against no one—no one
0	in fact , from his grandson ’ s narrative , the two hearers got a picture of a dark and tempest-tossed figure , a ringleader , political agitator , and conspirator ; despite all their pains , they did not quite succeed in hiding a feeling of mistrust , even repulsion
0	in the dusk of that slow-brightening dawn , moved by such mingled and fluctuating hopes and feelings , he mounted the narrow path along the slope , from the village end of the bob-run ; arrived at the deeply drifted woods , crossed the little wooden bridge over the course , and followed a way among the tree-trunks trodden by feet in the snow rather than cleared by any shovel
0	in overcoat and galoshes he went with his cousin down to the village , to buy himself blankets for the out-of-doors cure , since it was plain his plaid would not suffice
0	yes , tony said ; adding with tact , unfortunately
0	little sister u rsel was too small to take part in these exercises , and moreover , of us four probably one was superfluous in the lcind of vocal music to which hanne elevated our lusty shoutings
0	yes , he waxed choleric , turned upon one of the company who tried to defend the collation
0	not sauces in general , special sauces for fish—that is the monstrous part of it
0	it is just as if one could look right into him when he coughs , and see what it looks like : all slime and mucous—
0	you are speaking of a unity which we seek to bring about , but which to-day , alas , does not exist
0	everything is relation , and the relation forms the circle
0	it had come to be the case that precisely this intoxication was the most bearable condition he knew
0	his social bearing was no less satisfactory to them
0	you will ask if it was t so wit !
0	it doesn ’ t do at all , i tell you
0	but they did not , nor had hans castorp been sincere in his conviction that they would
0	he knew that such and such a person had been operated on for rib resection ; had it on the best authority that from the autumn onward no one with a temperature of more than ° would be admitted into the establishment
0	hans castorp , of course , could only speak of those at which he was present ; but he felt tolerably sure he did not miss any ; that his presence , the presence of the bone of pedagogic contention , was necessary , to give rise to a disputation of any magnitude
0	we ’ ve only one word for that—personality
0	the hot drink hurt the bark tooth which herr brerht had just been working at
0	poke , the slightly inclined head and the rapt look of a man in a vision
0	it is sad enough that when i followed the dictates of my heart and married against your wishes , and further wounded your insensate pride by taking over a shop , you should have repulsed me so cruelly and remorselessly ; but the way in which you now treat me cries out to heaven , and you are utterly mistaken if you imagine that i intend to accept your silence without a struggle
0	the second opinion which thomas called in was gerda ' a
0	so i scarcely deceive yself 'vhen i assume that knowledge of inez institoris 's side-slip was fairly widespread in her \unich circle , although i have never , except with adrian
0	who ’ s got so much time to spend—
0	i am quite ready to accept the responsibility
0	what had been the net result of the vainglorious french revolution—what but the capitalistic bourgeois state ?
0	come on , come along with me , i ’ ll brew us a turkish coffee in my den
0	the singer took a high note , exquisitely ; then held it , while the passionate harmony swelled , unfolded , glowed from moment to moment with new radiance
0	s seems heavenly refreshment but is at once and in the most hellish meaning of the word intolerable
0	my dear child , nothing at all is decided yet
0	yrt even all that is merely superficial
0	settembrini said frigidly that he lacked the brains necessary to the understanding of this death-and-murder mysticism—and he really didn ’ t miss them
0	the ladies liked to dally with him , and he listened to their talk , for example to that concerning lawyer einhuf , the young lady in the combinations , and fränzchen oberdank
0	herr kesselmeyer followed their course with the greatest interest
0	without going into detail , it was evident that she could never find happiness in this marriage
0	but i confess that i am not proof against such a heroic female voice as the orlanda 's was at that time
0	can one tell—that is to say , narrate—time , time itself , as such , for its own sake ?
0	the housewife looked on as her guest began to eat
0	also i have heard that he let his brother in buchel pay the school fees , but took nothing himself for board and lodging
0	in what sense do you—
0	therefore , if it is too much to say that one can tell a tale of time , it is none the less true that a desire to tell a tale about time is not such an absurd idea as it just now seemed
0	the liquidation of austria
0	forgive me , dear lady , if i speak frankly what i feel
0	he paused in front of her , fairly wringing his hands
0	but the wood emits new swarms , who fling themselves down , who spring up , who , shrieking or silent , blunder forward over the fallen
0	then she is an enemy of philosophy !
0	they were a failure in the first place because our population had on principle no use for lectures ; and secondly because his themes were not popular but rather capricious and out of the ordinary ; and in the third place because his stutter made listening to them a nerve-
0	his arm lay stretched along the cloth and he tapped the table with fist lightly clenched
0	she was disappointed and grieved that her brother had passed over his son and heir and had not wished to keep the firm alive for him to step into
0	instinctively i have rejected it from my picture of the cosmos and never felt the slightest inclination rashly to open the door to the powers of darkness : arrogantly to challenge , or if they of themselves ventured from their side , even to hold out my little finger to them
0	still , there seems every reason , on our part and on his , not to go into it very much , and we will only add that thereafter wehsal carried his friend ’ s overcoat with even more self-abnegation than before
0	he said , and let buddenbrook slip through
0	and vhen he took leave for the evening , he showed his readiness to be sorry and do better : he came and said good-bye and made little jokes in dialect , at which one rather winced , for perhaps one was suffering from fatigue
0	for , it appeared , this followed of itself ; no other course seemed possible
0	the senator , in markintosh and goloshes , went walking with gosch ; chris-tian drank swedish punch with the barmaid in the pastry-shop
0	the end of it all is that the little soldier , white as a sheet , shirt open at the throat , stabs his mistress with his knife in front of the circus—which , after all , she brought upon herself
0	ijhill- justus scowled forbiddingly when the conversation , with the advent of the second course , turned upon the absent members of the family , and he saw the foolish mother wipe her eyes
0	the thing is this , answered frau permaneder , with some hesitation , as the brother and sister began to pace the gravel path of the fore part of the garden
0	her face still streamed with tears , but she was soothed and comforted and entirely herself as she rose to her feet and began straightway to occupy her mind with the announcements of the death -- an enormous number of elegant cards , which must be ordered at once
0	please give me the key to the secretary
0	it was very quiet , even solemn , up here at this hour of the afternoon
0	i imagine he is feeling pretty down in the mouth
0	i say all this to remind the reader of the historical conditions under which i am setting down leverkiihn 's biography , and to
0	and you are taking the course just on his account , arm-gard ; you gaze at him all the time with your blue eyes , as if -- are you in love with him ?
0	this specialist let it be known that all his spiriting had to be done behind the scenes , and a proper and dress-parade appearance presented to the surviving relatives
0	never in his life had thomas buddenbrook so im- pressed his brother as at this hour
0	she was fond of receiving visits in her brown silk salon , and she made no exception now ; particularly as she had a very profound impression of the importance of the present occasion , without comprehending in the least what it was about
0	most of the chorals , which had come over from europe , seemed to him much too forced , complicated , and artificial to serve for his floci {
0	mynheer peeperkorn assisted at the little ceremony , standing behind her while it took place , and then seating himself at clavdia ’ s side
0	i mean the word genius : i spol { e of the musical genius of my de- parted friend
0	all his life , he had made the impression on others of a practical man of action
0	herr griinlirh had finished breakfast , and the fragrance of the two cigars mingled with the warm air from the stove
0	the coming sunday , as he remarked to himself and to his cousin , would see the performance of another of the fortnightly concerts , and the monday another lecture by dr krokowski ; then , on tuesday or wednesday , he would be off , and joachim would be left up here alone—poor joachim , for whom rhadamanthus would prescribe god knew how many more months !
0	it is a small detail , yet worthy of mention , that he was growing to have a contempt for certain ways of expressing himself
0	is your summer over now ?
0	pray do not , on that account , refuse to entertain it , settembrini said with a smile
0	thus it had gone on : certainly this was no bagnio , no siberian penal settlement ; frau salomon had remained , and displayed her beauteous underwear
0	what abortions were brought forth !
0	under no conceivable circumstances
0	they sat down , twelve together , hans castorp between his kingly host and clavdia chauchat
0	she stood there , a victor in the good fight which all her life she had waged against the assaults of reason : hump-barked , tiny , quivering with the strength of her convictions , a little prophetess , admonishing and inspired
0	when , or if , he can leave this place , remains in doubt
0	perhaps it happens to you that you come into your room when it is getting dark and see a man sitting on the sofa , nodding at you , when there is no man there ?
0	thank god , wide stretches still lie be- tween our home soil and destruction rushing on from the east
0	he made as if he were itching all over with curiosity
0	he kept repeating that he could see right into the gentleman rider ’ s vitals ; when they reached the restaurant his travel-weary eyes had an excited glitter
0	of this time , and honour and dignity do not help the state one jot , if it does not of itself have a grasp of the economic situation and know how to direct it
0	how could one possibly talk to a man who had proposed for one 's hand ?
0	hanno himself was in a pale cold sweat , with staring eyes , incapable of protesting or running away ; in short , in much the same condition as a condemned criminal
0	then he wrote that he was in bed , on sick-leave , a catarrh , a matter of a few days
0	she was a stout lady , with thick white curls over her ears , dressed in a plain gown of striped black and grey stuff which betrayed the native quiet simplicity of her character
0	and after all it was worth listening to , all that naphta had to say
0	there was an almost dangerous surging to and fro inside the tram , which had come to a stop
0	we came to acquire health , to get healthier and healthier until we are entirely well , and are free to quit , and go down below where we belong !
0	rudiger 's judgnlent of the war was conditioned by his admiration for the english , as , vas jeanette scheurl 's by her french blood
0	it is the end of everything , the hellish despair , the judgment day
0	they bent over the little one in a circle , convulsed vvith rapture ; squatted down beside him and called on jesus , \ary , and joseph at sight of the beautiful little lad
0	hans castorp laughed—a thing herr settembrini never did
0	women are for ever smiling , at anything , just for the sake of smiling ; there is no sense in attending to it
0	he took occasion to animadvert upon it one day in autumn as they were walking on the main street
0	it seems as though you needed to come back here to be as you were on the day of your promotion
0	that birthday suit there is painted with science , it is organically correct , you can examine it under the microscope
0	she was standing near by , among a group of her table-mates , waiting until the press about the lodge should be lightened
0	in the beginning of february , , after eight years ' ab-sence , christian buddenbrook returned to the home of his fathers
0	you needn ’ t tell me : so far as peeperkorn is concerned , i ’ m certain we ’ re companions in misery—quaint creature , he continued aloud , and shrugged
0	do not like , replied , to have you make over the natural to evil
0	the populous valley , extended and rather winding , now began to show lights everywhere , not only in the middle , but here and there on the slopes at either hand , particularly on the projecting right side , upon which buildings mounted in terrace formation
0	you have never been married , so of course you know nothing about life , really ; but you are a truthful woman , and you have some sense -- and you are forty-two years old !
0	and joachim pulled him over to number twenty-eight , where the scene was reminiscent of that long-ago evening when hans castorp arrived
0	it is hard , isn ’ t it ? —you just tell me if you don ’ t think it is pretty hard on me
0	she had a boundless appetite for gossip
0	all this world , including the cousins and their protegée , were betaking themselves to the rink , which lay in the depth of the valley not far from the kurhaus ; in summer it was a meadow , used for football
0	and slowly , slowly , with mournful long-drawn pomp , thomas buddrnbrook 's funeral train wound away , while the flags at half-mast on all the houses flapped before the wind
0	the picture had changed considerably since the war
0	you should be just , even if you are angry , to her and to -- why should not it be my child ?
0	she did it gallantly
0	so that after your death your inheritance would pass to them ?
0	in short , all that ceased , long ago , to be folk and blood and religious reality ; it is nothing any more but weak water-gruel
0	ay , said he simply , he has it behind him now , and lifted the stethoscope from joachim ’ s breast
0	born in dresden , but in origin low-german , of medium height and neat build , and with a shock of flaxen hair , he had the polish , the pleasing versatility of the saxon , and was in equal measure good-natured and desirous to please
0	if all these sensations caused him no high degree of suffering , that was only because his head felt as though he had inhaled a few whiffs of chloroform
0	it was this : certain fires of considerable extent had taken place in different localities , which would have cost his company large sums of money
0	some of the form remained in the chemistry hall , others went up to the classroom ; nobody needed to go down and freeze in the courtyard , because herr modersohn was in charge up in the corridors , and he never dared send any one down
0	he followed this street , which led down to the trave parallel to meng street , for a few steps , and paused before a small house , a modest flower-shop , with a narrow door and dingy show-window , where a few pots of onions stood on a pane of green glass
0	no , it is the right thing to do , this time quite particularly , he declared
0	the bob-run , which led down from the north-western slope of the schatzalp into the valley , was zealously worked on , it would be possible to open it in the next few days , unless a thaw put out all calculations
0	he seems to sleep , said he , humanely ; though such was far from being the case
0	and on high days and holy-days , after the cake and wine , he made one of the long line of pupils who , in grey and green uniform with a stripe on the trousers , high collar and kepi , went walking in the country
0	but the truth was , neither of the cousins was sure the other believed it ; if they did not meet each other ’ s eyes , it was because of the doubt both pairs of eyes sought to hide , and because the eyes had met before
0	and , as madame gr� , should she drink morning chocolate ?
0	here is your latest photo , take it and hold it up to the light
0	it leaned there , set off against the cold lifelessness of the inanimate world , in its own vaporous sphere , relaxed , the head crowned with something cool , horny , and pigmented , which was an outgrowth of its skin ; the hands clasped at the back of the neck
0	but he would lift his head , with the curling light-brown hair , inflate one delicate nostril , and it was as if he cau-tiously sniffed the air about him , expecting to perceive that odour , that strange and yet familiar odour which , at his grand-mother 's bier , not all the scent of the flowers had been able to disguise
0	we passed some of the villages that we had left smoking in our rear , and the hill where the tragic woman had stood
0	is distinctly a malicious slander and fits me not a whit
0	what word did not shake , as only too often the hand that wrote it , with the vibrations not alone of the catastrophe towards which my story strives but simulta- neously of that cataclysm in whose sign the world - at least the bourgeois , the human world - stands today ?
0	in the cantata he is clearly drawn in the charac- ter of a tempter ; and the tempting of jesus by satan is unmis- takably suggested ; as unmistakably also is the apage !
0	even so , he seemed to cling to the soothing ne- cessity of an early leave-taking and fixed departure by the eleven- o ' c ] ock train
0	like to that other , what thrilling opportunities it offered , what prospects lay concealed within it of coming into social relations with frau chauchat !
0	she stuck her glasses on her nose , unfastened the two great leather hasps of the book , opened it to the place where there was a book-mark , took a sip of eau , sucree , and began to read , from the yellowed page with the large print , the christmas chapter
0	but he was enraptured not so much because she looked so charming , as because her charm added strength to the sweet intoxication in his brain , the intoxication that willed to be , that cared only to be justified and nourished
0	a man knows by a certain numbness of the features that he has gone pale ; the drops of perspiration which may come out on his brow are deathly cold as well
0	he waited , erect and composed , on the edge of the sofa , buttoned up tight in his ulster
0	there was the unhappy wehsal , consumed by his louring passion for frau chauchat ; who grovelled before peeperkorn and hans castorp , the one on grounds of the past , the other for the sake of the compelling present
0	don ’ t pay too much attention to my prattle
0	they argued over it in adrian 's presence and each put on the other the merit of the attention they paid him
0	they envied those actively engaged the chance , the justification for screaming ; a gnawing desire to do likewise possessed mind and body , and he who could not summon strength to flee apart , was soon willy-nilly in the midst of the mêlée
0	no , people do not do that now , there are other man-of-honour rules , you are not to say no , especially if the woman is pretty , though in rather a fatal and suffering way
0	medical books and lllagazines lay about , for instance an illustrated history of morals , in the room where adrian for the first and the second time awaited his treatment
0	do you find it so disgusting to have to sit next to me ?
0	that same morning the master 's two maids had made off , for the night be- fore , at about one o'clock , there had been a furious quarrel , rous-
0	she had known it for that from the first , and only hoped that ziemssen by his pigheadedness had not made it putrid
0	johann buddenbrook gave him a quick glance and let the glass down hastily
0	she gazed at him with her brown , close-set , blue-shadowed eyes ; as he stood before her , she took his head in both her hands and kissed him on the brow
0	herr brechl 's nervous exertions communicated themselves to thomas buddenbrook 's whole body , he was even lifted up a little on his chair , and he heard a soft , squeaking noise coming from the dentist 's tjiroat
0	his head was hot ; for he had treated his friend franz not only to many beers , but to champagne wine as well
0	there were cases of choking , some of them having been in the act of chewing and swallowing when the excitement began
0	once you are up here , why not ?
0	i repeat , he said , with one lancelike finger reared up , i repeat , that therein lies our duty , our sacred duty to feel
0	item , some doctores assert and swear by peter and paul there must be brain specialists among the little ones , amateurs in the cerebral sphere , in short a virus nerveux
0	after he had prayed with joachim , the patient assumed an official tone and air , and uttered his wishes in the form of short commands
0	both cousins were surprised by the luxury of the two-windowed study
0	it will do me good—i feel our visit just now has done me good already
0	it is at an end , i tell you -- you draw your pay , and stay away from the office
0	it ’ s a fantastic little gadget , and ingenious
0	the city , the state , the social community regulated according to the principle of division of labour , not only might be compared to organic life , it actually reproduced its conditions
0	under herr settembrini ’ s critical eye—he played the connoisseur , though innocent of sports—hans castorp acquired a pair of oaken skis , finished a light-brown , with tapering , pointed ends and the best quality of straps
0	but johann buddenbrook was already dead
0	what are you talking about ?
0	my suspicions were not definite , she stammered
0	she gave him a halflength red pencil in a silver holder , and warned him in an agreeable , husky voice to be sure to return it to her after the hour
0	she was a tall blonde , with large features whitened by cosmetics , a full lower lip and under- developed chin ; she was preparing for a dramatic career and stud- ied with an elderly actor who played father parts at the hof- theater
0	it was a significant fact that the whole town , the bourse , the docks , the club , and the street called them by theii first names -- peter and chris
0	of the traditional world of the russian and french ballets , represented by a tchaikovsky , a ravel , a stra- vinsky , he had no notion ; ideas about the classical ballet such as those which the last-named russian master later enunciated , vere remote from his mind : ballet as a triumph of plall and measure over unstable feeling , of order over chance , as a pattern of con- scious , apolline activity , a paradigm for art
0	frau permaneder repeated over and over again , in her despair : and mother lying there in the next room !
0	the viddle ages , \\tere geocentric and anthropocentric
0	we shall be able to test the truth of his prophecy , for we are destined to spend yet much earthly time at this pleasure resort
0	he filled the whole house with the rolling periods buddenbrook of his exquisitely modulated , sonorous voice
0	what you wish to express is—
0	thus things lool { ed to me , as seen from dr institoris 's side
0	but that could not be
0	you are silent , herr settembrini said , moved
0	it saddened tony to hear him call the nobility idiots and wretches and to see the contemptuous if awkward gesture that accompanied the words
0	dr faustus as , i say it again , an envoy and message-bearer ; all this lulled the reason in dreams beyond the claims of logic and tinged with the hues of our christian theology
0	it was a significant decision , one pregnant with fate
0	goes at him like that , and simply tells him not to behave that way !
0	i can prolong my days , but only up here
0	yes , you are without pity , without love , without humility -- dh , he cried , and stretched botr arms in front of him , palms outward , as though pushing eveiything away from him , oh , how sick i am of all this tact and propriety , this poise and refinement -- sick to death of it !
0	the symptoms of infection have not for a long time corresponded to the local condition , which is undoubtedly very much improved
0	moreover , he would have no right nor reason to interfere—no more than upon that carnival night on which hans castorp had found himself in a position quite as mad and bad as this one , when he gave the ailing clavdia chauchat back son crayon—his , pribislav hippe ’ s , pencil
0	they lead a loose and idle life , and imagine themselves entitled to pity , and justified of their bitterness , irony , and cynicism
0	and though there was no idea of bustling her away from under the parental roof , she plunged at once , with the greatest zest , into the business of finding and renting a new home
0	he was fortunate in this friendship , and it did him credit ; for dr gieseke , though as much of a rake as christian , knew how to keep his dignity
0	that happens not once but ten times before i get to sleep
0	he sang at first softly , in a humming tone , then louder , finally at the top of his voice
0	i have a couple of rooms at the city of hamburg -- a couple of rooms , thought the frau consul -- which was just what herr gr� meant her to think
0	there were letters , on torn and yellow paper , written by anxious mothers to their sons abroad -- which the sons had docketed : received and contents duly noted
0	the hofrat ’ s large , goggling blue eyes watered as he told this story
0	he would curve forefinger and thumb to a circle ; extend the palm , that was so broad , with nails so pointed , to hush , to caution , to enjoin attention—and then , having by such means led up to some stupendous utterance , produce an anticlimax by saying something his audience could not quite grasp
0	is that so gernlan ?
0	but hans castorp gave the mountains only a fleeting glance
0	poor clothilde bore up under the departure of her rela-tive , as one must bear up under the afflictions of this life
0	but no matter what his feelings , he must have winter clothing , money , footwear , linen—in brief , everything he might have brought with him had he known he was coming , not for three short summer weeks , but for an indefinite stay which was certain to last for a piece into the winter—or rather , considering the notions about time current up here , was quite likely to last all the winter
0	dh faustus i , ) year 's separation
0	last year the horrible man escaped with his life - by now surely only , an insanely flaring and flickering existence - from the plot of desperate patriots trying to salvage
0	they reached the high road that led along the terraced slope a storey higher than the valley floor
0	the betrothal of her adored brother rejoiced her heart
0	this occupied the entire pause till the bell rang , and dr marotzke came in
0	he had hurried directly to his cousin ’ s room without going first to his own , in order to greet his old-time companion , while his mother was putting herself to rights in the chamber assigned her
0	his demonstra- tion became very diverting , and likewise flattering , since it as- sumed in us a certain apprentice and brush-washer intimacy with music
0	i learned that adrian was looking for a theme for an opera and , years before he seriously approached the task , had had love 's labour 's lost in mind
0	his whiskers were freshly curled , and at this early hour his rosy face was rosier than ever
0	let her have patience , and wait , and bethink herself a hundred times
0	at the beginning it seemed endless ; you could not believe that it would end ; it was almost indelicate to suggest such a thing !
0	you can do what you like : you can harness up all your work-horses -- but you can never drag me back to munich again
0	but here everything was empty and still , and his road up the broad linoleum-covered stairs lay free
0	they boasted in conversation of having met knut in the garden , the wood , or the english quarter
0	hans castorp , as fräulein engelhart said this , gave a hasty glance at joachim bending sedulously over his plate a face gone all mottled
0	he heard hermine kleefeld say to two of her familiars , the student rasmussen and the thick-lipped young man , whose name was gänser
0	he had no time
0	he replied , quite calmly , that he found mynheer peeperkorn a blurred personality ; a personality , that is , undoubtedly , though blurred
0	there were pictures of saints on the walls of the flat-arched window embrasures , and leaded win- dowpanes that had squares of painted glass let into thenl
0	not only for the sake of comfort , to be better bedded down ; but most of all because he hopes to get from it good and fine things for his '\tvorking energy and enthu- siasm , for the human content of his future work
0	there was a pause , in which he gave a little cough
0	i know you ca not stand me -- you used to hate me ; but -- why , tony !
0	the bud den-brook ladies from broad street made the remark : well , let 's hope it will last , this time
0	you perceive that the objects toward which the league directs its efforts are ambitious and broad in their scope
0	he did know the names -- at least some of them
0	he confesses : sometimes i cursed the hour i met thee , and tried all vainly to forget thee—only next moment to rue his blasphemy , and pray on his knees to see her once more
0	and certes i schal be mum , will hold my tunge , were it sheerly out of shame , to spare folkes feelings , for social considerations forsooth !
0	but one admission i will make ; inez , as , ve know , committed a few years later a capital crime , which aroused general horror and put an end to her bourgeois existence
0	dizzyingly it escapes your measurement
0	he acquired some black-bordered note-paper , and wrote to his uncle-cousins : he , the doubly , now , so to say , triply orphaned , expressed himself as being the more distressed over the sad news , for that circumstances forbade him interrupting his present sojourn even to pay his great-uncle the last respects
0	you might refer to your interest in the medical side
0	the hofrat ladled coffee and sugar into the long-handled pot , added water , and let the brew boil up over the flame of the lamp
0	the art of wrapping himself up , as practised in the sanatorium ; they all did it , and each new-comer had to learn
0	, he would often throw in a remark and give an in- teresting turn
0	this was the recent habit , for instance vhen he , vas thinldng , of mov- ing his eyeballs rapidly to and fro rather far , from one side to the other , rolling them , as we say
0	was it one of those mel- odic illuminations to which he was , i might almost say , exposed and with which powers whereof i refuse to know aught kept their pact with him ?
0	the jest had for its point a jeer at the senator 's carefully preserved and faultless exterior -- and it was received as a masterpiece of wit by his fellow-citizens
0	think of the spelling !
0	in so few years -- oh , that 's simple , answered herr kesselmeyer , good-temperedly
0	gaffer , why are you circling and spying up there ?
0	how old i am ?
0	why should not the child have her own little ideas about such things , at her age ?
0	he was an idler pure and simple , whose special characteristic was a sort of rough good humour
0	i am perfectly well-informed about your ability to pay
0	get along with you , i cried , you understood nothing of the sort and you understand very well what i meant about the ger- man break-through to the , vorld
0	yes , you are cured
0	and i have the rule ’ at my fingers ’ ends , and observe it faithfully
0	he rubbed his hand over his eye and forehead , drawing a long , deep breath , mechanically lighted another rigarrlle , though he knew they were bad for him , and continued to gaze through the smoke-haze into the darkness
0	no ; what you are saying interests me
0	with the help of a sort of metal shoehorn from her pocket , she looked at the patient ’ s tonsils , hans castorp standing by with the lamp
0	the material must have been extraordinarily stiff , for the edges stood out in a circle around the legs of his short , broad boots
0	you have a business friend from somewhere , and you invite him to dinner
0	and i can assure you that his prejudices , in so far as they exist , are in no case of a petty or bourgeois character
0	but he himself felt sure that the increase in his bodily heat had to do with the mental activity and excitation which kept him in his chair on the balcony until deep into the glittering , frosty night
0	fdr people without overshoes are suffering , and stamping their feet to warm them
0	but now joachim had made another discovery , he had fathomed the duplicity of his cousin—without , be it said , any faintest intention of so doing , without having bent his military honour to the office of spy
0	the wings were trustless
0	the dining-room girl whose duty it was to serve the bedridden brought it to him in dainty cook-pots under nickel-plated dish-covers
0	it was schubert ’ s linden-tree , it was none other than the old , old favourite , am brunnen vor dem tore
0	this was a wax-doll -- to dress it up and lay it out like that seemed rather horrible
0	however , there was no time now to brood over the question
0	you would see , as plainly as i do , the blunt pinions—it is a golden eagle
0	he was glad to relapse into the deserter ’ s bed , with his regular good-night cigarette—with which he nearly caused a conflagration , by twice falling asleep with it alight between his lips
0	she sobbed into her batiste handkerchief , trimmed with lace and with the monogram a g she still wept just like a child ; quite unaffectedly and with-out embarrassment
0	i only suggested that a great deal of virtuosity , foreign or not , was after all a component of wagner 's internationally so well-tolerated art - and then charitably distracted his mind by speaking of an article on problems of proportion in gothic archi- tecture , which he had recently , vritten for the periodical art and artists
0	one read of it in the novels
0	how have you got a right to treat me like that ?
0	the recipient read it with a certain surprise , and on account of its literary quality it could not possibly be passed over in silence
0	at first blush proper and pious enough , indisputably
0	little johann was to go to take his farewell of his grand-mother 's mortal remains
0	truth and justice are the immediate jewels of personal morality
0	riddle of the sphinx
0	in vain they sent him tongue and spiced eel from home—he could not digest it
0	but do you hope to have people hear all that ?
0	he even raised himself a little , bent over , and looked his vis-a-vis in the face , with his mouth open
0	i am not afraid of that
0	he 's taken it into his head he must be compensated for his share in the house no , no , jean
0	it was half past three by his watch when he was roused by voices behind the left-hand glass partition
0	the table-d'hote was very gay , for this was a good season at the baths , and the great dining-room was filled with acquaintances of the buddenbrooks , hamburg families , and even some russians and english people
0	the worst of it was that hans castorp would clearly not have been surprised if she had
0	then he stopped on until half past six , to show that he would rather be here , that he was so entertained where he was that the others would have to wait
0	there are two paths to life : one is the regular one , direct , honest
0	since then it has been increased , first another three , then another six , and so on , and still i am not cured
0	what is one to say to such an assault upon the human understanding ?
0	then got-thold exchanged a few courteous words with his sister-in-law , stroked the children 's heads , and went away
0	in whom will you recognize theological existence if not in me ?
0	one day , in hans castorp ’ s room , he lifted from its easel on the chest of drawers a black glass plate , one of the small personal articles with which the owner adorned his cleanly quarters
0	well , castorp , i won ’ t grudge you human society any longer
0	there were modifications of this organic plurality united to form the higher ego : cases where the multitude of subordinate entities were only grouped in a loose and doubtful way to form a higher living unit
0	he got up , and the con-sultation was at an end
0	his muscles relaxed , his head sank weakly on his shoulder , his eyes closed , and a pathetic , almost an anguished smile of speechless rapture hovered about his mouth ; while his tremolo , among the rippling and rustling runs from the violin , to which he now added runs in the bass , glided over into b major , swelled up suddenly into forte , and after one brief , resounding burst , broke off
0	she made a joke of it , in the telling ; yet even so , a strong undercurrent of irritation betrayed itself
0	an philoctetes and the epithet leschylus has for the arrow : hissing winged snake ; i recalled too the connection between the arrow of phrebus and the ray of the sun
0	he still wore his pilot coat and check trousers
0	his researches , which dealt with psycho-analysis and the dream-life of humanity , had always had a subterranean , not to say catacombish character ; but now , by a transition so gradual that one scarcely marked it , they had passed over to the frankly supernatural , and his fortnightly lectures in the dining-room—the prime attraction of the house , the pride of the prospectus , delivered in a drawling , foreign voice , in frock-coat and sandals from behind a little covered table , to the rapt and motionless berghof audience—these lectures no longer treated of the disguised activities of love and the retransformation of the illness into the conscious emotion
0	you would think old behrens must admit to having made a mistake in the treatment ?
0	and it went so well -- it always went so well !
0	of the mind , the general artistic and intellectual movelnent of the tinc - we should not forget that
0	how could i wait longer ?
0	yet it seemed to him , as he thought about it , that what one characterized as absurd might also be thought of as intellectually honourable ; from which it would follow that the absurd hostility to nature evinced by gothic art , when all was said and done , was as fine in its way as the gestures of plotinus or voltaire , since it testified to the selfsame emancipation , the same indomitable pride , which refused to abdicate in favour of blind natural forces— naphta burst out laughing
0	you are right , she had answered , and arranged the laces through which her bosom shimmered like marble
0	it was a simple affair , a motif entirely of his own invention , which he had slightly developed
0	it stood at the side of a flat open space laid out with lawns and sandy paths and country flower-beds ; beyond it , the forest rose gradually like an amphitheatre
0	what good can he do you ?
0	a crib , herr doctor ?
0	to keep direction , relatively speaking , into his own valley would be a question far more of luck than management ; for while he could see his hand before his face , he could not see the ends of his skis
0	adventures of the flesh and in the spirit , while enhancing thy simplicity , granted thee to know in the spirit what in the flesh thou scarcely couldst have done
0	it was agreed at length to leave the decision to the elder rotbein , soon to arrive
0	at the other end of the table frau reiff energetically presided between adrian and schwerdtfeger , next to whom sat , respectively , a young , or still young professional woman , mlle godeau , a french swiss , and her aunt , a thoroughly good-natured ,
0	he spoke of the ease with which the property could be divided , emphasized his responsibility toward his sister , and remained by the sum of thirty thousand thaler
0	tom , she said , do control yourself
0	what sphere of human en- deavour , even the most unalloyed , the nst dignified and benevo- lent , would be entirely inaccessible to the influence of the powers of the underworld , yes , one must add , quite independent of the need of fruitful contact with them ?
0	and soon i came myself and on fine sundays strolled at his side round the pond and up the rohmbtihel
0	immediately thereafter he expressed his opinion that everything was in perfect order , and sent the overwrought company off to the evening cure , with the exception of elly brand , with whom he said he wished to have a little chat
0	positively , he made the statement that christ had been the first to proclaim the principle of equality and union , that the printing-press had propagated the doctrine , and that finally the french revolution had elevated it into a law !
0	we had got back to the leverktihn house , and he opened his door
0	she , poor , weak woman , secretly sells the house-hold silver to send money to the disinherited son
0	and besides , excuse me ; 'constellation ' is your every other word
0	the air in the class-room had grown very hot and heavy again ; but here it was saturated with an odour of sulphuretted hydrogen from a just-completed experiment , and smellcd abominable
0	there were only two more performances of l\drian 's opera , and it was not , for the time , to penetrate beyond the hansa city on the trave
0	indeed , the whole consecrated programme instituted by the deceased consul had to be carried out to the smallest detail ; and the poor lady fluttered about , driven by her sense of responsibility for the fitting accomplishment of the evening 's performance , which must be pervaded with a deep and fervent joy
0	position and organization of the material would have to be read } t when the actual work should begin , and all one asks is : which is the actual \-vork ?
0	his ention could escape no- body , certainly not the child
0	the experienced joachim had already moved over toward the entrance door and taken position at a stand ; at his back was the lofty structure of the apparatus , with a bulb half full of water , and distillation tubes ; in front of him , breast-high , hung a framed screen on pulleys
0	the party was thinning out ; many of the guests had presumably taken up the horizontal
0	where does it come from ?
0	but in truth , the fathers of the early church were never weary of warning the faithful against the lies of the old philosophers and poets , in particular of cautioning them not to be corrupted by the voluptuous eloquence of virgil ; and to-day , at a time when again an age is declining to its fall , and we see the approaching dawn of another proletarian morn , the time is ripe to feel with them
0	hans castorp replied that the hofrat had taken the words out of his mouth , and offered him what he was on the point of asking
0	a charming woman like her , in the bloom of youth—why should she , every time she gives a man her hand to kiss , tell him straightway that she is bound in wedlock ?
0	my instrument came from the paro- chialstrasse , a present from my parents at my confirmation
0	then came scenes from all parts of the world : the president of the french republic , in top-hat and cordon , sitting in a landau and replying to a speech of welcome ; the viceroy of india , at the wedding of a rajah ; the german crown prince in the courtyard of a potsdam garrison
0	but in general we would emphasize the fact that people in hans castorp ’ s state regularly feel a craving for self-revelation , an impulse to confess themselves , a blind preoccupation with self , and a thirst to possess the world of their own emotions , which is the more offensive to the sober onlooker , the less sense , reasonableness , or hope there lies in the whole affair
0	and the flutes give the flourishes to it !
0	who believes in the devil , already belongs to him
0	on every hand were loud complaints , that they had been cheated out of their summer ; though they had really cheated themselves , abetted by conditions both natural and artificial , and by a consumption of time-units reckless alike within and without
0	she gave him her hands , received his kiss , and it was not four-and-twenty hours before the glad news had gone the rounds of our circle that rudi was caught , that konzertmeister schwerdtfeger and marie godeau were an engaged pair
0	altogether , according to the master of buchel , a certain ill fame , a fantastic ambiguity , attached to this whole ex- traordinary field
0	it would seem only too advisable to inquire how the reader 's patience is holding out
0	hans castorp made a face ; but his eyes remained fixed on madame chauchat ’ s back , as he vaguely recalled what dr krokowski had been saying , about counteracting influences of a bourgeois kind , which set themselves up against the power of love—the arm , in its gentle upward curve , was better than the hand ; it was scarcely clothed , for the material of the sleeve was thinner than that of the blouse , being the lightest gauze , which had the effect of lending the arm a sort of shadowed radiance , making it prettier than it might otherwise have been
0	he felt common , clumsybooted
0	deuce take it—was he never to have a moment ’ s peace ?
0	he nodded , read the remaining sentences , closed the book , and looked about him
0	all you have just now said came from the very depths of your personality ; even the present stage you have arrived at found there poetic expression , and showed itself to be still the experimental—
0	bcissel had never enjoyed any education worth mentioning ; but in his awakened state he had mastered by himself t
0	as they passed the boulders where morten schwarz-kopf sat , tony nodded to him from a distance , and somebody asked , who is that you are bowing to , tony ?
0	the mistakes of these favourites would be passed over with neat , careful corrections , so that their work retained a respectable appearance , no matter how bad it was ; whereas he would attack the other copy-books with heavy , ruthless pen , and fairly flood them with red ink , so that their appearance was shocking indeed
0	he was in the real sense of the word a man of disinclination , avoidance , reserve , aloofness
0	he fairly bellowed , and with the words appeared to fling off the last vestige of restraint and go stark mad , shaking his fist at emerentia , literally showing her his foaming teeth
0	and now he is bankrupt
0	they had tried all that already
0	woods , meadows , mountains , trees , lakes , beauty of scenery ?
0	in matter it was an exposition of the philosophy of sensual passion , developed in a spirit of debonair and man-of-the-worldly paganism
0	tbe brass does not start from the beginning as it did the first time , but as though its melody had already been tere for a while ; and it continues , solemnly , to that climax from which it wisely refrained the first time , in order that the surging feeling , the ah-h-effect , might be the greater : novv it gloriously bestrides its theme , mounting unchecked , with weighty support from the passing notes on the tuba , and then , looking back , as it were , with dignified satisfaction on the finished achievement , sings itself dec- orously to the end
0	but there must be something about the man too , if she can ’ t bear to be with him
0	then messengers haste in all directions and arrive at the place of that fisherman , who be- thinks himself
0	the needle touched the plate
0	how nice to find you still here , for once , papa , she said as she held her egg in her napkin and opened it with her spoon
0	dashing from one thing to another , or linking them together , he heaped them up - first because he had endless things in his
0	she kissed the little maiden over tony 's head and told her : go up with ida now -- we shall soon have dinner
0	then he wrote amen
0	the grand-daughter of the proud lebrecht kr� glowed with reverence for armgard 's noble birth
0	it is without doubt a matter worth discussing
0	even though i tell you i can surely discharge you in half a year , but not before ?
0	c'est 'boche ' dans un degre fascinant
0	i suggest to the consul that this would be a most advantageous time to display the strength of the firm of buddenbrook
0	what did the comrades talk about ?
0	she sat on the sofa reading a book with a yellow paper cover , and looked up as he crossed the room
0	gate , at the edge of the cemetery grove
0	joachim suddenly choked violently , and could scarcely get his breath
0	and thus m stanislaw von zutawski was constrained to apply without delay to the undersigned and to authorize them to institute honourable proceedings against the said m kasimir japoll
0	for it is plain that from that moment rebellion becomes a crime—
0	the fear of invasion grows : , ve await the attack , from all sides , with preponderance of material and millions of soldiers , on our european fortress - or shall say our prison , our madhouse ?
0	she tossed bark her head , stretched out her arms before her , or flung them above her head as she talked ; and her voice showed by turns anger and dismay , passionate opposition and deep feeling
0	this juliet mollendorpf , or hagenstrbm -- or semm-linger -- whatever she is , the- creature ! -- imagine , mamma !
0	i have never found any other teeth to compare with them , not in valparaiso , or london , or anywhere else in the world
0	yes , that is what you are , hans castorp asserted , and struck the table with the flat of his hand
0	but you have always known how to reconcile it with regular work and a serious life
0	i-ie decreed that there should be masters and servants in every scale
0	but one doesn ’ t like to seem forth-putting
0	it may be the sentimenta ] disingenuousness to which the vice leads , or is always immanenr in it , that causes my unconquerable distaste
0	there was a plucked fowl , with its long writhen neck hanging down from a table among a setting of vegetables
0	at this hour , she said , the café life was not yet in full swing , the dancing became much livelier as the evening advanced , and numerous patients from the sanatoria , as well as dissipated folk from the hotels and the kurhaus , many more than were here as yet , came later to join the fun
0	since joachim ’ s departure hans castorp sat no more at frau stöhr ’ s table , the one with dr blumenkohl ’ s empty place , at which the gay marusja had been wont to smother her irresponsible mirth in her orange-scented pocket-handkerchief
0	hans castorp heard of a new sport that had come from scandinavia , ski-jöring : it consisted in races in which the participants were drawn by horses while standing in their skis
0	he came on children 's day , and was received civilly by the relatives of his betrothed
0	and then , there is something else , gerda dear
0	who would ' a ' thought it ?
0	cerda looked rather dis-dainfully from one to the other , and tony wrung her hands , imploring -- tom , christian !
0	i don ’ t enjoy seeing him smoke , either ; it distresses me , because i know it is not good for him and gives him melancholia
0	the invasion of our beautiful sicily by no means proved that it was possible for the foe to gain a footing on the italian mainland
0	the schweigestills , adrian , his family , kunigunde , and i ate an almost silent meal in the nike-saal together , one of the , vorncll rising very often to iool , to the patient
0	the son of poor madame josephine had had the worst of it in life , compared with the younger and stronger brother and sister born of madame antoinette
0	but the seasons up here followed the calendar with halting steps , and only within the last few days had spring fairly arrived : a spring still without hint of summer ’ s denser air , rarefied , ethereal , and balmy , with the sun sending silvery gleams from a blue heaven , and the meadows blithe with parti-coloured flowers
0	the woman , the gipsy girl , can not , will not understand
0	what 's the good word ?
0	of course , they were ill ; but they were also pretty crude
0	the veins in my temples are all swollen and they beat so that it hurts ; but still , there may be too little blood in my head
0	by all means , young man , he said , taking off the horn spectacles by the nosepiece
0	thus one passed from the supposed smallest unit to a still smaller one ; one was driven to separate the elementary into its elements
0	to the graveyard then , on the slope of the dorfberg , the three wended their way— we tell it to complete the tale of their excursions
0	then the consul turned back to the front of the book , to some pages written in bluish ink , in a hand full of flourishes , on paper that was like parchment , but tattered and spotted with age
0	i want a home , and somebody who will be sympa-thetic when i am ill and we suit each other very well
0	there are situations where—quarrels that—in short , i am at this man ’ s service
0	noborly was pleased to have him called up after the gentle perlemann
0	it might be true and it might not ; but was he , thomas buddenbrook , called upon to express such ideas -- was he called upon even to think them ?
0	she was silent , and looked neither id the right nor to the left
0	with pribislav ’ s very eyes she had looked at him , and at the spots of blood on his coat ; her look had been rather bold and ruthless too , as a woman ’ s would be who let doors bang behind her
0	what did she reply ?
0	this paroxysm of anger was out of proportion to the cir-cumstances , no , it was not the hundred and twenty-seven thousand marks that had brought him to this unprecedented state of rage
0	the guests went up to them at once on entering , courteously ready to praise
0	the g minor concerto of bach , herr pfuhl
0	this made hans castorp go from tears to laughing ; and thus he was tossed back and forth among varying emotions , until the dawn came through his half-open balcony door and wakened him
0	herr settembrini spoke with droll and plastic effect
0	it was the overture to die meistersinger
0	that is good too
0	try to be calm
0	christian was now more than ever master of his own lime
0	it was a very pretty scene when the consul led hi ?
0	all that is at an end , tom -- you know all ?
0	this reduced the offender to silence , for certainly peeperkorn , as host and dispenser of the good cheer , might find fault with its quality if he chose
0	then i will lend it to you
0	i can not express the mournful pity which almost overcame me
0	the business is young , but in fine condition -- assets must be somewhere about a hundred and twenty thousand thaler , and that is obviously only the situation at the moment , for he makes a good slice every year
0	james asked him , shivering in his inch-thick ulster
0	he flung the covers over him , one after the other : first from the left side , all their length up to his shoulders , then from the feet up , then from the right side , so that he formed , when finished , a neat compact parcel , out of which stuck only his head , shoulders , and arms
0	hans castorp gazed thoughtfully at it
0	at the same time polyphony predominates in the extreme , and every part is quite independent at every moment
0	the shouts that greeted him when , i amust almost say on rare occasions : he appeared at a session in the smoke- filled private room in mtitze 's tavern , did contain a little fun at the expense of his supposed misanthropy ; but they expressed genuine pleasure as well
0	ing in the scenarios freely and more or less the dialogue , after which it was i who in my spare time quickly gave them their final form in mixed prose and rhymed lines
0	i needed only to imagine that instead of speaking myself to my helene , instead of using my own tongue , i had sent some attractive friend of mine to tell her my love , to see the whole equivocal absurdity of what he had done
0	the mystery of life was literally bottomless
0	well , tom , said the consul expansively , and took the cigar out of his mouth , we are arranging that rye sale i fold you about , with van henkdom and company
0	how the phrase suited the man !
0	it ended , apparently , in the triumph of chastity
0	on a party like this he is inimitable , it is true -- we shall have crabs to eat , herr permaneder , he said in a livelier tone ; crabs and baltic shrimps !
0	well , i have made up my mind to concern myself a bit in future with the severe cases and the moribund
0	i know i gave him cause to worry and complain over my ex-travagance and silliness and my new dressing-gowns
0	ida jungmann rould not be brought to repeat the visit
0	even in maisons de santé they have their balls for the fools and idiots , i ’ ve read ; why not up here as well ?
0	let me make just a few explanations
0	incited by frau stöhr , who joined them at the exit , they paid a visit to the café at the kurhaus , karen clapping her hands in delighted gratitude
0	this last letter was exhaustive , it covered the case ; not according to the time-conceptions of down below , but according to those obtaining up here ; it asserted hans castorp ’ s freedom
0	but with all this , rudi appeared depresseq by certain circum- stances of his private life ; in short by his liaison with inez insti- toris , about which he relieved himself in private to adrian
0	your tale is told
0	such was individualism , in its two aspects—all things unto all men
0	all this hans castorp did , and all this we report of him , indifferent to the danger that someone may thereby be reminded of ferdinand wehsal , who once was wont to carry hans castorp ’ s overcoat
0	but that never occurred to him
0	when she and the consul were alone , in the room lighted by burned-down candles , with the furniture disarranged and the air thick with heavy odours of rich food , wine , cigars , coffee , perfume , and the scent of the flowers from the ladies ' toilettes and the table decorations , he pressed her hand and said : very good , gerda
0	the german element they avoided entirely - schild- knapp invariably took to flight so soon as a sound of his mother tongue struck on his ear
0	is not everything wonderful ? —my child , he went on , with a perfectly serious face , almost sternly , you surpass all my expectations
0	there was really no danger that the solemnity of the feast would be rudely broken in upon by youthful high spirits
0	the frau consul , health permitting , would attend tom 's wedding in amsterdam
0	and the most dreadful thing is that i ca not help seeing through you with such dis-gusting clearness !
0	the church of st mary ' a was entirely shrouded in rain and darkness
0	won ’ t give us even a measly half-a-year !
0	the ceiling light came on
0	that country too lay remote from the humanistic mean , though on the side of austerity rather than of softness
0	there was a neat little office , with a typist busy at her machine and three clerks bending over desks
0	the dutchman ’ s manner toward hans castorp ’ s friends was rather mocking than ironic
0	why have we given the platonic philosophy the preference over every other , if not because it has to do with knowledge of god , and not knowledge of nature ?
0	he was , permissibly at this hour , smoking a cigarette
0	he would walk up and down with the same unquiet and brooding eyes
0	the fact might rest upon sympathy and physical likeness , for the grandson resembled the grandfather , in so far , that is , as a rosy youth with the down on his chin might resemble a bleached , rheumatic septuagenarian , yet it probably spoke even more for that which was indeed the truth , that the grandfather had been the real personality , the picturesque figure of the family
0	in the beginning , to be sure , hanno threw up after each spoonful
0	again i break off , in the realization that i came to speal { of gen- ius , and the fact that it is in any case d ( £monically influenced , only to air my doubt whether i possess the necessary affinity for my task
0	do you remelnber a certain lecture given for the society for the common weal from which it fol- lowed that in music one certainly need not hear everything ?
0	he sat there lost in troubled and bitter thoughts of his fate and his future , when a member of the teaching staff of the morning star , the pensionnat of the society of jesus , out for a walk , sat down near him , put down his hat on the bench , crossed one leg over the other under his cassock , and after reading his breviary awhile began a conversation which waxed very lively , and proved in the end a decisive factor in leo ’ s destiny
0	yes , in fact , this was the idea he had in mind and hoped to be able to carry out -- provided the broker did not try to drive too hard a bargain with him , ha , ha !
0	imagine lying anywhere else for hours at a time , flat on your back , doing nothing , not even thinking -- yes
0	to be older than those in \erseburg
0	it was no matter , she said
0	but it is probably something else , responded deutschlin
0	how should we come to be doing that ?
0	but they found her out by exchanging her regular thermometer for a silent sister
0	do freemasons believe in god ?
0	no , she is a russian , was the answer
0	madame kethelsen , her simple sister , had grown rapidly deaf and had understood almost nothing of tony 's affair
0	tony , what an idea !
0	you are not usually lacking in dig-nity
0	even more telling , schleppfuss thought , for the psychological situation , was the restriction imposed upon a youth of that same period : it had come upon him by no fault of his own , through fe- male witchcraft , and tragic indeed had been the means of his re- lease
0	i do not so interpret it ; but rather think that if some blemish existed it lay in the realm of the spirit and taught her to understand every sort of need for consideration and scru- pulous tact
0	that vvill keep you safe
0	well , you sha not do it , then , shouted the senator , and sprang up
0	the consul had scarcely reached home again when he was attacked by a fresh misfortune , which had for the moment shaken his firm to its foundations and by which it had lost eighty thousand marks at one blow
0	under the circumstances the best thing , in the dutchman ’ s opinion , was to begin where one had left off ; and that innocent effervescent wine had the same effect as soda-water
0	i must confess i know nothing
0	she said it was right , she knew it must be so ; but in her heart she mourned over her sister-in-law 's departure
0	the hofrat had not much time for private interviews
0	kurz hai not gettin ' it this time , nuther , be he ?
0	this choice of a place to live , reproducing the earliest one , this bury- ing oneself in one 's earliest , outlived childhood , or at least in the outer circumstances of tle same - it might indicate attachment , but in any case it is psychologically disturbing
0	but if herr settembrini meant to suggest that the pleura-shock was a good example of what he was talking about—that torture by tickling , with its stench of sulphur and its three-coloured fainting fit—well , really he was very much obliged to herr settembrini , he really must thank him very kindly indeed ; but there had been nothing of the sort about the pleura-shock—not it !
0	and thus began tony buddenbrook 's third marriage
0	the young pair had made calls in only a few houses ; for the director , a serious and preoccupied man , with no social experience , intended to devote what leisure he had to intimate domesticity
0	i ca not realize it !
0	more annoying for me personally was the presence of dr chaim breisacher , the lover of paradox , already known to the reader
0	he had practised fur a long time on the piano , and now was idling about in the living-room
0	how odd it was , that she still did not know his first name !
0	it was in no eerie or ghostly sense that the scene affected the sympathetic one as mystic or mysterious , as conducing to solemnity ; it was rather natural , organic—by virtue of the intimate association we have already referred to
0	he drew upon his repertory of comic songs , and half sang , half recited , with incomparable pantomime and highly suggestive gesture : i sauntered out one day , in an idle sort o ' way , and rhanced id see a maid , ahead o ' me
0	ther 's evolution iverywheer , in berlin , in paris -- but , smolt , what do you want ?
0	he sat bent over , tracing figures on the ground with the ferrule of his cityish silvermounted walking-stick
0	he repeated the word , and held up one hand before his face with the fingers crooked , in the same gesture as when he used to tell about maria and the depravity of london
0	it was a trait of her family : the uncle that died had had white hair at thirty
0	hans castorp took an interest in this glimpse into the business side of the enterprise
0	but perhaps she had failed in the service of the cure , perhaps hers was one of those cases in which the air proved in the first instance to be good not against but for the disease
0	i have been here the whole afternoon -- yes , herr consul , brought out carl smolt , chewing violently
0	if only mamma had not spoken of getting excited !
0	that was in the end of may of the year
0	obviously he , vas primarily concerned with the typical progress of the case and a clear clinical picture in all its stages
0	he knew more than that
0	they could not dissimulate , and they would accept no responsibility for omitting to say that little johann was fright-fully slow about learning to walk and talk
0	just try to imagine my sensations , and how frightened i was !
0	you have acted like a distracted person , in a perfectly unreasonable way
0	she was a raw-boned jewess , of about the same age as nacke- cley , with thick , unmanageable woolly hair and brown eyes where timeless grief stood written for the daughter of zion despoiled and her people as a forsaken hearth
0	humanist—yes , certainly , i am a humanist
0	it happened on the way to the opera
0	how long were the gentlemen thinking of stopping ?
0	s daughter , a connection which was hard enough to !
0	he knew that the thought which tony hugged to her breast in secret was being spoken in the street
0	thought han no in despair
0	how much did it lose by the bremen failure ?
0	jeanette scheurl whispered magnifique !
0	if weakness it were , it was the only one the sharp eye of the child ever noted in his grandfather ’ s exterior
0	too bad about the feasts of roses !
0	the same tremendous meals were served here as at the others ; rhadamanthus himself occasionally folded his huge hands before the doctor ’ s place at the head ; and the nations who ate there were respectable members of the human race , even though they boasted no latin , and were not exaggeratedly dainty at their feeding
0	from here you could look into the pretty little garden , which was well laid out , though just now brown and sodden with the autumn rains , its beds protected with straw mats against the cold
0	the chord is no harmonic narcotic but polyphony in itself , and the notes that form it are parts
0	he had grown skilled in the handling of his rugs and the art of making a proper bundle , a sort of mummy , of himself , when lying on his balcony on cold days
0	strictly speaking it was not three days , but as many minutes , which brought about the change
0	or take an hour spent in the rest-cure , at the dinnertable , or on the daily walk—and these ways of employing the time-unit practically exhausted its possibilities—what was an hour ?
0	in other words , if he can paint a little below the surface , and stands in another relation to nature than just the lyrical , so to say
0	director weinschenk was , like erica , devoid of every social connection : the two were thus , in a manner , marked out for each other -- it was plainly the hand of god himself
0	individually they had probably all questioned themselves , in these last few days ; they knew whither their thoughts tended
0	he pressed your hands
0	their guide , the manager of the estate , himself told them , with compassionate head-shakings , as a fact worth mention , that the villagers only had meat one day in the year , at christmas , and had not even tallow candles , but literally went to bed with the chickens
0	i could keep down the soup the mother brought me
0	hans castorp was not on sick-diet
0	i brar in myself the seed , the tendency , the possibility of all capacity and all achievement
0	thanks for your telegram -- of course , it shocked us a good deal -- she stopped
0	when behrens says half a year , you can make up your mind it will be more
0	what did he mean by introducing such a subject—what kind of upbringing had he had ?
0	but at last a lucky turn gave him a clearer view ; he hastily arrested his hand and brought his intelligence to bear
0	he turned on his heel and moved away , as if his words had settled the matter
0	the room belonged to the beer-hall and danceestablishment of a widow named suerkringel ; but on certain days it was at the service of the gentlemen burgesses
0	the man was an resthete unnerved by erotic excesses and in a religious sense a progressivist blockhead , typical of the back-formation of the cult of the effectively present national god , the general concept of the metaphysical power of the folk , into the preaching of an abstract and generally human god in heaven ; in other words , from the religion of the people to the religion of the world
0	the friendly and helpful attitude of french constitutionalism toward the new , practical ideals and interests of our time is some-thing we should be deeply thankful for practical ideals -- well , yees -- the elder buddenbrook gave his jaws a moment 's rest and played with his gold snuff-box
0	but then he would suddenly have the thought that the whole thing was a senseless folly , and confess to himself that his present house had plenty of room for himself , his wife , their child , and their servants
0	to put such words in god 's mouth is already simply unheard of , a slap of impertinent enlightenment in the face of the pentateuch , which expressly describes the sacrifice as 'the bread ' - that is , as the ac- tual nourishment of jahve
0	but catarrhs are not caused by cold ; they come from an infection , which one takes from being in a receptive state
0	the unnatural condition , vas not removed , the attacks recurred intermittently , and the afflicted one declared he could stand them if it were not for the permanent and constant pain in the head , above the eyes , and that indescribable , paralysis-like feeling all over from the top of the head to the tips of the toes , which seemed to affect the organs of speech as well
0	he had a hand-organ , propped by a sort of wooden leg against the pavement , and as he played a sprightly air , he flung his humanistic eyes up to the people in the houses
0	it consoles me to be able to tell myself that the reader can not lay to my charge the extraordinary size of the last chapter , which considerably exceeds the disquieting number of pages in the one on kretschmar 's lectures
0	the heart of hans castorp rejoiced in the blessed fact that two vacant and securely tranquil hours lay before him , dedicated by the rules of the house to the principal cure of the day ; he felt it—though himself but a guest up here—to be a most suitable arrangement
0	then he got red , tossed his half-dozen spoons back into the chest , and exclaimed , 'who told you i was going to do any-thing with these things but look at them ?
0	the darkness of her colouring , the black hair , the black eyes with their quiet , friendly gaze , might have made me take her for an italian were it not for a certain sturdiness in the facial structure
0	settembrini had ceased to have residence at the berghof , he had taken up his abode with lukaçek , the ladies ’ tailor—and that indeed some weeks back
0	everybody flew downstairs and through the breakfast-room into the bedroom
0	she tapped softly with the sole of the foot that rested on the floor
0	sports activities were unconditionally forbidden at the berghof as in all other establishments of the kind
0	he may laugh at my pedantry , but i consider it right to let him know that since i be- gan writing almost a year has passed ; and that whilst i have been composing the last chapters , april has arrived
0	why are you making such a face ?
0	in their place were the only guests not members of the family
0	adrian 's ca- pacity for mocking imitation , which vias rooted deep in the mel- ancholy of his being , became creative here in the parody of the
0	a rather sharp and spasmodic sort of illumination , be would add
0	pastor tiburtius had modestly chosen a bed-chamber in the back building next the billiard-room
0	i do not think you can comprehend such meanness
0	we aren ’ t more than three steps from the conception that tuberculosis is a disease of the blood
0	it was he who with due respect dubbed it inaccessible—and afforded herr settembrini the chance of saying that this particular rock was considerably frequented
0	that is as good as all there is to it
0	with clothing dishevelled , his features so distorted as to strike terror to the beholders ; the eyes dazed , absent , listening , all at once ; he had stared at them , they got the impression that he had come out of a life-and-death struggle with all the opposing hosts of counterpoint
0	they clawed at each other ’ s faces , clutched throats or noses , grappled , hewed loose from each other and rolled together on the floor , spat , kicked , worried , and foamed at the mouth
0	superfluous to account for herr peeperkorn
0	he rots away , liver , kidneys , stomach , heart , bowels ; some day his voice will be a croak , or he will be deaf , after a few years he will ingloriously shuffle off this coyle , with a cynical quip on his lips - what then ?
0	it is just the chagrin that upsets him , poor man
0	what belongs to you is well invested , and brings you in something safe
0	but will it do any good ?
0	herr settembrini looked at him , as so often he had looked in the course of the years , with melancholy black eyes
0	why should we beat about the bush ?
0	you overslept , did not you ?
0	i am standing here with my eyes shut , and have quite a pleasant sleepy feeling
0	consul peter , like justus kr� , belonged to the group of young men whom the town called fast
0	i mean the ones at our table
0	dh , i see -- the pavor repeated frau permaneder
0	thomas buddenbrook finally declared that he must take time to think , and that in any case he must consult his sister , before he accepted the twenty-eight thousand thaler -- which was unlikely
0	hans castorp changed colour
0	he summoned them , with raised forefinger—and that pointed finger was like a waving standard or the flash of an unsheathed sword , as his words were like the rallying-cry of the leader , which brings to a stand the threatened rout
0	yes , that is the middle ages , the way the books say ; and i can more or less recognize in this thing the conception i have been getting of them lately
0	there was a feeling of indiscretion , even of guilt , bound up with it , not quite alla ) ted by the feeling that science must be allowed to press just as far forwards as it is given the in- telligence of scientists to go
0	hans castorp was rather put off to see the dutchman wearing not a white night-shirt , but a long-sleeved woollen vest , buttoned at the wrists and collar-less , cut round in the neck , and clinging to the old man ’ s powerful torso , his broad shoulders and breast
0	sounds as though she had been dead a very long time
0	hans castorp returned to his invisible , melodious pair of lovers
0	he had got his musical educa- tion in his country of origin ; but he was early drawn back to the old world whence his grandparents had once migrated , and where his own roots lay and those of his art
0	or rather , said he , i ’ ll fetch my revolver ; that will be more interesting
0	the elder kr� was telling the most delightful stories ; and his son justus , who sat with dr grabow down at the bottom of the table , near the children , was chaffing mamsell jungmann
0	she only turned her head as her daughter entered , and her face wore an almost defensive expression
0	they were sensible and beautiful , by no means small , but slender and small-boned , the wrists encircled by the cuffs of a white silk blouse
0	bevi , bevil said the padrona
0	you must admit that from the other side it has something suitable about it - on that side where you got it from , and indeed forewarned , from the side of your pretty song with the letter symboi- oh , really ingeniously done , and almost as though by inspiration : when once thou gavest to me at night the cooling draught , with poison didst undo me
0	one evening the social hour happened to be livelier than usual—which it might be at any time without especial cause
0	most particularly in the late work , where audacity and despair mingle in so unique a , vay , the jvebeklag of dr faustus , written in pfeiffering , where the inclination shows even more strongly to use those intervals also in a sirlultaneous-harmonic combination
0	he did not betray that he felt the blow
0	oh , a souvenir , the nephew answered
0	for all interest in disease and death is only another expression of interest in life , as is proven by the humanistic faculty of medicine , that addresses life and its ails always so politely in latin , and is only a division of the great and pressing concern which , in all sympathy , i now name by its name : the human being , the delicate child of life , man , his state and standing in the universe
0	you have got it good here , said herr permaneder , as he let himself down in his chair and looked at the variety of cold meats on the table
0	naphta cited arndt , who cursed industrialism and glorified the nobility ; and görres , the author of christian mysticism
0	she gave an order to mamsell severin , and the spinster went out through the hall , past thr rhoir-boys and the poor and down the corridor to christian 's room , where she knocked on the door
0	it was the same with the skating in the wintertime , and with the bathing in summer at the wooden bathing establishment of hcrr asmussen , down on the river
0	herr gr� sat silent , stiff , irresolute ; his mouth opened and closed without a word coming out
0	al- ways , we were told , the opponents and rivals of the bold inno- vator asserted that beethoven could not write a fugue
0	he changed his shirt every day , sometimes twice a day , and perfumed his handkerchief and his moustache , which he wori !
0	to me it was a moral certainty that the contrast between the eyes of the two parents , the blending of hers into his , was what formed his taste in this respect or rather made it waver
0	the excellent man set out his views , with eloquence if some embarrassment : spoke of the difference between line and dash , told the tale of the forest green and the scuttle of coals , and made use in every other sentence of the phrase in consequence
0	on his one hand he might have a precipitous , pine-clad declivity , falling away into the mists ; on the other sheer rock might rise , with masses of snow , in monstrous , cyclopean forms , all domed and vaulted , swelling or cavernous
0	he could see the narrow head of old hans lorenz , as it bent musing over the pale gold rim of the christening basin , that symbol of the passing and the abiding , of continuity through change
0	dr zimbalist 's eyes were cast down like those of a man taking heed to his steps on the stairs
0	there is , after all , something peculiar about the process of habituating oneself in a new place , the often laborious fitting in and getting used , which one undertakes for its own sake , and of set purpose to break it all off as soon as it is complete , or not long thereafter , and to return to one ’ s former state
0	the tired , worried eyes gazed at objects without seeing them ; they became red and watery
0	that 's all , he said , and put his cigar into the ash-receiver
0	then he commanded that the register be brought , and slowly marked down for laziness all those pupils -whose performances of the morning had been deficient -- or entirely lacking -- six or seven marks at one fell swoop
0	it was just this that made one sad
0	you want to badger me into abetting your damned hypocrisy , so that you can sleep in comfort , while other people have to wake and watch and grin and bear it
0	eh , ingegnere , un po ’ di ragione , sa !
0	as was to be expected , frau permaneder protested against the sale of the house which her brother had built
0	but at the same time they were an end in themselves too
0	dh , so you are leaving me in the lurch , edgar , said dr mantelsack with tender reproach
0	christian 's reply to this was one that made gerda budden-brook turn and gaze at him with an enigmatic expression in her eyes
0	she jumped out of bed and opened the blinds
0	naphta , continuing , derived the reverence which the christian middle ages paid to physical suffering from the fact that it acquiesced on religious grounds in the sight of the anguish of the flesh
0	very good , said hans castorp
0	they take each other ’ s hands and dance in a ring—the whole square is full of dancing people
0	permit me , said he
0	dn the third di fourth day after his arrival the hop dealer let it be known that he had concluded his business with the local brewery
0	i should be mad to believe it
0	he was most friendly with the boy as they drove out together to the cemetery , in the first carriage behind the hearse
0	we shall see : what does caesar say ?
0	no , papa , he said , and his tone bespoke finality , i must advise you not to give in
0	why could not he be reasonable ?
0	he : w ouldst like to besides , and art well content that thou canst hear
0	on one of these visits she asked if she might go up and see the senator a minute
0	we put it in this way on purpose , in order to suggest another element , an illusory , even , to speak plainly , a morbid element , which is quite definitely a factor in the situation
0	the pale shimmer of this tender , though not emaciated , bosom , losing itself in the bluish shadows of the drapery , was very like life
0	but sometimes one starts out with having an opinion and feeling righteous indignation and all that , and then something comes up that has nothing to do with judgments and criticism , and then it is all up with your severity , and you feel disgusted with the republic and the bello stile—
0	oh , very well , let it strike , and get along with your prussian woman !
0	and i am so stupid , i do not know what is rhadamanthus
0	- declared it of his own ac- cord to his parents at buchel , who received the news even better pleased ; and had already told me earlier , confessing at the same time that he did not envisage his choice as preparation for taking a parish and assuming a cure of souls , but as an academic career
0	and i ( retschmar 's re- ply : that document i have not by me
0	i have been here listening to the wind ; the weather is something fearful
0	is it my fault that phthisis and concupiscence go together—slight harshness here ?
0	only what surprises me is that the glands are erected for such different reasons
0	thus kretschmar , on beethoven and the fugue ; and cer- tainly it gave us matter for talk on the way home - ground too for being silent together and for vague and silent reflection upon
0	one day , some three quarters of an hour before dinner , hanno had gone down alone to the first storey
0	a sigh passed through the assemblage , and lawyer paravant weightily nodded approbation as krokowski proceeded to develop his theme
0	every-body downstairs , into the fresh air , as quick as possible !
0	it seemed ashen in the twilight , the pale , weary eyes stared out beneath the great folds of brow , the large chapped lips stood half open , like the mouth of a tragic mask
0	precisely because they do , because they try to as hard as they can , they are worthy of all respect
0	we are going to the schwarzkopfs '
0	he got as far as fishers ' lane and began to descend the left-hand sidewalk
0	and they observed the season at the berghof , as they did consistently all the recurrent feasts of the year , by way of breaking up and articulating the long stretches of time
0	the hofrat said : spooky , what ?
0	i am obliged to inform you , he went on in a sing-song tone , his sharp eyes jumping from one point in the room to another and then to the window , that some time ago i pro-posed for the hand of mademoiselle buddenbrook
0	the harmonium was an over-powering dream -- which just now he had no time to indulge
0	it is precisely youth , i mean more highly developed youth , that is more likely to shrink or be scornful , to display hostility
0	that was genuine salami , the real thing ; herr settembrini ate it with tears in his eyes
0	she ventured , turning her light eyes a little away , that he might not see the bewilderment they expressed
0	thee , my friend with silver hair ,
0	here signora manardi reigned , called nella by her family - i believe her name
0	it was even my impression that he believed he could use the sufferer 's reduced and as he probably thought more or less helpless state to exert his quite imperturbable ingrati- atingness , enforced by all his personal charm , to conquer a cool- ness , dryness , and ironic withdrawal which annoyed him , on grounds more or less serious , or hurt him , or wounded his vanity , or possibly some genuine feeling on his part - god knows what it was
0	he tapped all over , as he had with joachim , and several times went back and tapped
0	her again , and put to her in person the question which he here wrote down with his whole heart and soul : did she not under- stand that a man , out of veneration for another man , could sacri- fice his own feelings and act regardless of them , making himself a selfless advocate of the other 's desire ?
0	christian no longer knew what he was saying ; he leaned over the table , knocking on it all the while with his knuckle , glaring up , red-eyed , his moustaches bristling , at his brother , who , on his side , stood looking down at him , pale , and with half-closed lids
0	not for nothing had the angel said to tobias : over them who are given to lewd- ness the demon wins power
0	\y lutheranism agrees , for it sees in theology and music neighbouring spheres and close of kin ; and besides , music has alvvays seemed to tie personally a magic marriage benveen theology and the so diverting mathe- matic
0	and turned under these circumstances to god , imploring him to take under his special care and protection his beloved sister
0	hans castorp started as the door opened in his rear
0	it was the second summer the friends had spent there
0	scant confidence in god 's prompting , scant re- spect for it is expressed in that ameilleur ' - itself not so very en- thusiastic either
0	silly business , hans castorp said , with the ready understanding of the old inhabitant
0	the great soul of which we are a part may dream through us , in our manner of dreaming , its own secret dreams , of its youth , its hope , its joy and peace—and its blood-sacrifice
0	he leaned against the wall of the school , drawing his jacket closer about him , yawning and shivering : , i am so scared , kai , that it hurts me all over my body
0	she has her whims , of course , has maria ; but the inspection must be very thorough , for she doesn ’ t vary much , and draws perfectly even
0	people posi- tively did not want to know why ope i i i has only two move- ments
0	that is what i am thinking
0	he had to lool { very high , intellectually , where he was to feel himself called as musician , and so the german poem to which he gave himself productively is also of the highest rank if without the intellectual distinctiol of the !
0	the consul was in his easy-chair beside her , and the child perched on her grandfather 's knee in the window
0	but oh , how easy to understand !
0	i-iowever , it was here that adrian llade the acquaintance of jeanette scheurl , a woman of peculiar charm and sincerity , a good ten years older than he , daughter of a deceased bavarian government official
0	they thought of going to the riviera , to nice and so on
0	my position is so serious -- yes , i admit , it is serious
0	heavens , what is there to say ?
0	now and then mother schweigestill would put her head round the door to look for her daughter , whom she might have needed in the house ; but she nodded approvingly at the pair and withdrew
0	the skin of his face was abraded in spots , and the nose was bruised
0	genghis khan , he said
0	and many of my colleagues are as yet unacquainted with the situation which confronts us , namely , that a man can even have tubercular bacilli in his blood without being any the worse for it
0	i will go to dr gieseke
0	but now , when the snows were melting , and she was prescribed , at her examination , another six months , on account of whistling sounds in the upper left lung , and unmistakable discords under the left shoulder-blade , her patience suddenly came to an end , and she left for her wet and windy amsterdam , uttering invectives against dorf and platz , the far-famed climate , the doctors , and the international sanatorium berghof
0	she was a designer , so adrian had been told by frau reiff ; an artist who sketched and
0	the melodic components pre- sented themselves in different layers , but no jangle or conf ? sion ensued , for the imitation of the first phrase by the second singer fitted itself very pleasantly point for point to the continua
0	and the lady thus courteously and exotically entreated came and sat down , clasping elly ’ s fragile wrists , one in each hand
0	do you know what you have done ?
0	but hans castorp had been for some time now inclined to reject harmless and disinterested explanations as being in the nature of twaddle ; nor could he regard in any other light this oil-painting , considered as a bond of interest between a widower with a robust vocabulary and a narrow-eyed , soft-stepping young female
0	the atom was a cosmic system , laden with energy ; in which heavenly bodies rioted rotating about a centre like a sun ; through whose ethereal space comets drove with the speed of light years , kept in their eccentric orbits by the power of the central body
0	the sky-line was high , the distance seemed to mount to hans castorp ’ s view , looking down as he did from his elevation onto the spreading gulf beneath
0	not that he was narrow-minded
0	after tony had expressed many times her conviction that she should soon be back again on a visit , and that they too would not delay long to come to hamburg to see her , she climbed in good spirits into the coach and let herself be care-fully wrapped up by the consul in the warm fur rug
0	indefinite , exaggerated rumours of the unfavourable liq-uidation got about , and were fed by the news that gerda buddenbrook meant to sell the great house
0	there is no occasion for that , first of all because i can by no means pretend to have ex- cluded myself from the general emotion
0	a man came into my life ; by his heartfelt holding out he overcame death - you might really put it like that
0	the last bit of blue had disappeared ; the dark grey sky lowered heavy and swollen over them
0	this had gone on for more than an hour when the leader found it to the interest of all concerned to grant a brief intermission
0	at the same time , i say to myself : your acquaintance with madame is older than ours
0	he sat down , he obliged her to sit as well , and , bowing over her hand , which , limp with indecision , she resigned to him , he went on in a trembling voice : fraulein antonie , since first i saw you , that afternoon , -- do you re-member that afternoon , when i saw you , a vision of loveliness , in your own family circle ? -- since then , your name has been indelibly written on my heart
0	you must know that children are tender stuff , they are re- ceptive for poisonous influences - now it was i , in very truth , who cried out and indignantly repudiated his words
0	as the atmosphere in which we live is obviously very favourable to such miasmic growths , i may hope , or rather , i must fear , that you understand my meaning
0	it was a harmonium -- a pretty little thing of polished brown wood , with metal handles at the sides , gay bellows worked with a treadle , and a neat revolving stool
0	instead , i felt at once ashamed and anxious
0	he told hans castorp about two little henry clays he had once taken to his heart , in an evening company , which had come within an ace of putting him under the sod
0	then i said i would visit the patient
0	that would be a rejuvenation of the worn-out by the con- stellation
0	and hans castorp was reminded , as he saw her , of something else : the look on karen karstedt ’ s face , a smile just like that , when she stood with joachim and himself and regarded the unmade grave in the dorf graveyard
0	i should be surprised , i should be greatly surprised , if there were not wendish , slavic , sarmatic elements in play there
0	such a very gratifying sight that is not , and no deduction can be made from the word painful when i use it here to characterize the impressions i got as a purely passive ob- server from the gatherings of certain councils of intellectual workers then springing up in munich hotels
0	the englishwoman with the rose tea was miss robinson
0	and if this be so , then it is clear that time , while the medium of the narrative , can also become its subject
0	unfortunately , gone mad , uttered kai , count molln , with great clarity and precision
0	next , it appeared that gerda arnoldsen did not take piano like the rest of them , but the violin , and that papa -- her mother was dead -- had promised her a real stradivarius
0	but only for a moment
0	at the right , in front , was a time-regulating device , with a dial and figures like a watch ; at the left , the lever , which set the mechanism going or stopped it ; and behind , also on the left , the hollow , curving , club-shaped , nickel-plated arm , with its flexible joints , carrying the flat round sound-box at the end , with a fitment into which the needle was screwed
0	frau schweigestill , worn with lack of sleep , her eyes swollen with weeping , met me at the door and urged me to go at once to adrian
0	but every human being needs to express what he feels , said wehsal complainingly , to relieve himself , my dear castorp , when he is in the state i am in !
0	they must have taken a long time to dry—but were sometimes effective by way of helping out the other shortcomings
0	were they , he asked , up here for the winter sports , or were they patients ?
0	these were forms of tissue—and very luxuriant forms too—produced by foreign cell-bodies in an organism which had proved receptive to them , and in some way or other—one must probably say perversely—had offered them peculiarly favourable conditions
0	every one was silent
0	if you please , he said
0	in these last days his eyes had grown so shy , so uncertain in their glance
0	but he scorned the effort
0	what sort of men prefer the monotony of the sea ?
0	there would be a frock-coated official representing the management , perhaps even the physicians themselves ; then out came the gracious recipient of the attentions paid by this little world to a departing guest ; generally with a beaming face , and a bearing which the excitement of the moment rendered far more animated than usual
0	and so you go round visiting the fever cases ?
0	yet that lifelong inlpress never resulted in any conflict vith my humanistic attitude in general , my love of the liberal arts as one used to call them
0	but it is a good thing , notwithstanding
0	why should not you speak first ?
0	this important matter must be settled
0	next morning he heard for the asking the name of the mysterious new arrival ; heard likewise that the two travellers occupied neighbouring suites on the first floor
0	one might put—here he paused a second , and the crisping at the corner of his mouth grew crisper—more than one interpretation upon your laughter
0	herr settembrini advanced as far as the neighbourhood of one of the windows , hans castorp followed
0	there were milk , tea , coffee , chocolate , even bouillon ; and on every hand the guests , newly arisen from some two hours ’ repose after their heavy luncheon , were busily spreading huge slices of raisin cake with butter
0	these aging spinsters felt that all too little shadow set off the sunshine through which thomas 's outward life ran its brilliant course
0	she looks so very fit
0	the old inhabitants passed it by without thought ; and—though in general they seized on every pretext for jollification , and took occasion to celebrate their own private anniversaries in addition to these that accented the recurrent rhythm of the year ; making merry with popping of corks in the restaurant , over birthdays , general examinations , imminent departures whether wild or sanctioned , and the like—they accorded to the anniversary of arrival no other attention than that of a profound silence
0	with the turkey ramp roast potatoes and two kinds of compote , and each dish held enough to satisfy the appetite of a family all by ilself
0	the engagement proved a failure ; and her teacher , a man of experience named seiler , must be absolved from all responsibility for it
0	the room was further enlivened by several electric chandeliers in bright brass , consisting of three rings placed horizontally one over the other and held together by delicate woven work , the lowest ring set with globes of milky glass like little moons
0	? een , and such a time is also an eternity - then you shalbe fetched
0	his old father , in fact , still lived in silesia ; but the family seemed not to come into consideration , hugo being , evidently , a self-made man
0	as though israel 's whole and unique task had not consisted therein , that it should build god a dwelling , a tent , and provide all means for his constant presence
0	he was in contact by letter , it appeared , with persons who were at the head of the portuguese lodge , and there , without much doubt , things were ripening to a decisive event
0	the master had wrought late into the night , on the credo , the credo with the fugue , without a thought of the meal that stood waiting on the hearth ; while the maids , yielding to nature , had at last fallen asleep
0	if not , he might be assured she had it on the best authority
0	it is a telling fact that , as i mentioned earlier , the first performance of adrian leverklihn 's apocalyptic oratorio took place in gern- : any - or re precisely its first complete per- formance
0	they all drew a long breath and broke the circle
0	the colourless hands , whose sensitive shape i had always loved , lay crossed on his breast , like a saint 's on a medixval tomb
0	not with any idea of wounding or annoying his father !
0	that makes six hundred and eighty
0	vvas there , i asked myself , something in the wonlan 's outward appearance that might explain the fundamental condition of her relations with adrian , the in- visibility , the avoidance , the rule that they should never set eyes on each other ?
0	see here thy flow ’ ret treasured well—how exquisitely josé sang that !
0	'not aloud , but probably to himself -- he has not sair much about the other poem -- it is called 'the nursery clock ' -- he has only wept
0	and he broke a lance in defence of the blamelessness of sensual gratification—hearing which , hans castorp could not but think of the humanistic cuddy under the roof , with its standing desk , rush-bottomed chairs , and water-bottle
0	to-day it was a hurried , lively ah ha !
0	briskly he responded , sprang up and flung on some clothing , ran his fingers through his hair , and went down ; not slow , not fast , and more in uncertainty as to the how than the what , in the meaning of these summons
0	how pretty it was , though , with its curved mouthpiece , shining in the decoration of its keys and levers !
0	he , naphta , stated this , in order to counter the arrogance of materialistic science , which gave out for absolute knowledge its astronomical quackery , its windbaggery about the universe
0	when one thinks how women are made ( you smile , to hear a person of my youth and inexperience making general observations on this subject ) —how dependent a woman ’ s feeling for a man is upon his feeling for her—it is not surprising
0	he even remarked this tendency and took thought to comment upon it
0	he showed them to hans castorp in the lab : a red , coagulate blood , in which tiny grey points were discernible
0	those who stood about him , drawn first by the reports of the man ’ s wealth , soon hung absorbed upon his personality
0	what hovered before his mind 's eye were simply gauze petticoats , toe-pointing , trip- ping , and arms bent gracefully over heads , under the eyes of a court society asserting the ideal , reprobating the hateful prob- lematical , these sitting in their loges , while a well-trained bour- geoisie filled the parterre
0	you should not think that , he said , and smiled a peculiarly fine and painful smile
0	her left hand fingered the sofa pillows nervously , and her light eyes wandered restlessly to the window
0	he was a well-known art connoisseur
0	in school , when it was settled that someone was not to move up to the next form , he just stopped where he was ; nobody asked him any more questions , he did not have to do any more work
0	giddy and oppressed , he considered as in a dream how very odd he had felt since he came up here
0	hans castorp helped himself to his ; it was unusually large and thick , and had a gilt sphinx on it
0	but these volumes lay now neglected in favour of other textbooks belonging to quite a different field , an interest in which had seized upon the young man : anatomy , physiology , biology , works in german , french and english , sent up to the berghof by the book-dealer in the village , obviously because hans castorp had ordered them , as was indeed the case
0	joachim had begun , without more ado , to lay bare the upper half of his body
0	only one totally ignorant of the tender passion will suppose that such scruples can detract from the object of love
0	adrian , in his scrupulous delicacy , had asked him to rep- resent him and he felt he could not refuse
0	how yes and no ?
0	i find that in a chordal combination of notes one should never see anything but the result of the movement of voices and do honour to the part as implied in the single chord-note - but not honour the chord as such , rather despise it as subjective and arbitrary , so long as it can not prove itself to be the result of part-writing
0	in the duel with the outrageous little naphta he had borne himself like a man
0	one must just be satisfied with symbolism , my good man , when one is speaking of hell , for there everything ends- not only the word that describes , but everything altogether
0	young man , said he to hans castorp , holding him by the power of his pale eye and his developed gesture : young man—the simple—the holy
0	obviously he did not feel comfortable so long as any of his audience knew what they were to think
0	the morning is come unto thee , thou that dwellest in the land
0	he could see only a part of the interior , some four or five chairs
0	the sun shone , the day was beautiful and bright
0	introduces himself to me as a guide and proved it by his brass badge and his lw ' o or three scrapes of french and english , diabolical pronunciation ; peautiful puilding , antiquide extrement indcressant
0	this is what i wanted to bring out , this is the word of warning i have been trying to utter
0	and above all the macabre proposal , answered with giggles : alourons enscluble , voulez-volls ?
0	hans castorp too finished with his cure for the time and went into his room to put himself to rights a little
0	she is simply priceless , mother
0	when he had tapped to his satisfaction , he began to listen , setting his stethoscope on joachim ’ s chest and back , and putting his ear to the ear-piece
0	the half-parted lips moved a little too , as if forming words
0	and the cornered father could only admonish him to pray for a tranquil spirit—ut in aliquem gradum quietis in anima perveniat
0	well -- in fact -- why should i wait for them and let slip a good chance when it offers ?
0	how learned you ’ ve got , said hans castorp
0	he was a master in the irresistible , a virtuoso of the italian da capo school ; he must have come forward to the footlights and flung up his arm , as he held the last tone before the closing tonic , so that the audience involuntarily burst out in shouts of applause before he ceased
0	now they str : uck into the path at the edge of the village , which brought them back home
0	almost he inclined to call them what peeperkorn in his royal cups had called him , hans castorp—chatterboxes
0	so that the retirement of the frau senator had a practical justifi- cation and even became a genuine interest , for it enabled her to provide her daughters and also former friends of the house , like the knoterichs , with supplies from pfeiffering : eggs , butter , : flour , sausages , and so on
0	the frau consul , frau permanrder , christian , clothilde , herr and frau consul kroger , herr and frau director wrin-sl'henk , the broad street buddenbrooks , and therese weich-brodt were all bidden to dinner at four o'clruk , with the senator and his wife , in honour of hanno 's birthday ; and now they sat in the salon and looked at the child , perched on the music-stool in his sailor suit , and at the elegant , foreign appearance his mother made as she played a wonderful cantilena on the g string , and then , with profound vir-tuosity , developed a stream of purling , foaming cadences
0	it even came to this : that the thought of lawyer einhuf could not enter his mind without calling up there , by an association of ideas , the thought of fränzchen oberdank , the little creature with the sleek blond head , whose mamma , a worthy dame from the provinces , had brought her up to the berghof a few weeks before
0	every family has its own skeleton , he went on in a lower voice , with a glance at jock 's broad back
0	when the shattered wood steams ( a povverful passage ) ; the so new and enlightened concord of the high register of the organ with the strings at the end , when the deity comes , no longer in storm , but in hushed murmurings and beneath it arches the bow of peace ; yet despite all these i have never understood the work in its real spiritual sense , its inward necessity , its purpose , informed by fear , of seeking grace in praise
0	here his grandfather johann had set down the genealogy of the main branch of the buddenbrooks
0	of course , if i did not have my house in fishers ' lane -- but i have , and what should i do with it ?
0	that was rather tall talk , retorted naphta ; and mentioned mount everest , which to date had icily refused to surrender to man ’ s importunity , and seemed likely to continue to do so
0	the four and a half months which i gave as the period of production are reckoned up to the beginning of the relapse
0	but it remained an open question whether the old school , as an institution , with its smaller endowment of modern comfort and its larger share of gay good nature , courage , charm , and good feeling , had not been more blest and blessing than the new
0	enough of your theological spinsterhood !
0	dh , if i could only make a match worthy of our name , and set myself up again -- do you think it is entirely out of the question ?
0	that was hard to bear ; yet , since it undoubtedly happened on his account , it preserved the relation between them , if only on its negative side
0	it was holger in person , the spirit holger , who understood such matters as the pinch of salt and that , but knew better than to mix into lessons at school
0	what it demolishes is the pretence in the bourgeois work of art ; music , although she makes no picture , is also subject to it
0	i did not know then that what was involved was a tendency , an idea , in a way a sort of rehearsal for something to come later ; a pattern , i mean , of sending to the beloved - for that is what i must call her - and leaving it to someone else to speak to her
0	may they live long and prosper !
0	he might count , however , on a general understanding of it , and as for the inevitable malice that went with it , he took that for granted
0	per bacco , this was a joy to listen to !
0	at your service , repeated heir schwarzkopf , taken aback
0	well , geida , i am off for london
0	give it to me , please , he said shortly
0	gone for good , o ’ er the border and awa ’
0	no trace of confusion showed in his blue eyes , which could burrow with such penetrating naivete into the eyes of anyone 'who vvas making clever , learned , or cultured remarks
0	joachim could hear , hours on end , the noise made by the paperknife going through the uncut leaves
0	i should be boasting if i say yes , lying if i say no
0	what do you mean ?
0	i have been at small evening companies at the van henkdoms and the mo el ens , and on the third day after my arrival i had to put on my dress clothes to go to a dinner at the house of my former chief , van der kellen , which he had arranged out of season in my honour
0	the little engine puffed and pulled off , the train glided after
0	you may as well resign yourself , hanno , be-cause if it is his inscrutable will --
0	she is ill , and she is limited ; her case is hopeless , and the matter is simple
0	it was life-bound , and thus entirely utilitarian ; it was pathetically unheroic
0	we have reproached hans castorp with being willful ; but certainly , whatever the goal toward which his wishes led , it was not that of social intercourse with madame chauchat
0	so you are interested in organic chemistry too ?
0	his slightly faded nationality is scarcely sufficient ground for introducing him at this late day into our story
0	the orchestra stood open-mouthed
0	there was one more person in the room than before
0	armed with the recommendation of a brother of the cloth who had eaten at least once in meng street of mock-turtle soup and ham with onion sauce , he waited upon the frau consul and was invited to be her guest for a few days
0	an ethiopian prince had been received at the same time with naphta ; he had woolly hair , and was distinctly moorish in appearance , though most distinguished
0	and at that there swept over him anew , from head to foot , the feeling of reckless sweetness he had felt for the first time when he tried to imagine himself free of the burden of a good name , and tasted the boundless joys of shame
0	have you a double ?
0	yes , says behrens , and shrugs his shoulders , it seems to be indicated that she certainly can not stand the climate up here
0	joachim had not much to bring up against the plan
0	but hagenstrom , he 's got the money
0	it smells like that , too
0	it is very radical , but it relaxes the prohibition which after all already hung over consonance
0	do it not only for yourself , but at the same time for me and my guilty soul
0	they only begged him for the mercy of a gentle death
0	i am interested in the development of our railways -- it is a tradition with us from on
0	the height of the piled-up snow was estimated at two feet ; its consistency was said to be ideal for skiing
0	you ’ ll learn all about it , he said , and added : one ’ s ideas get changed
0	he never wore an overcoat
0	yet all these figures were , in a way , public institutions , uncommonly characteristic of the psychological picture of my native town , adrian 's setting till he went to the university , for nine years of his young life
0	yes , it had to come , and it came
0	our good jungmann has your room ready
0	never mind the propositions
0	you are quite frozen , poor boy , she said
0	the frau consul heard the news , and there was a long and particular conversation among her , herr permaneder , antonie , and thomas , in the landscape-room that very evening , and every-thing was arranged
0	when he was fifteen , he had had a front seat at the christening ceremony of the new double-screw steamer hansa
0	this thing was sent to me !
0	i will make one exception to this uniform ironic contempt which he presented to what the school offered him and the claims it made upon him
0	but not without talent , not at all without talent for a heightened degree of oxidization
0	the young folk looked at the view , standing in the snow before the stone gateway to the cemetery ; then they entered through the ironwork grille , which was on the latch
0	it was a matter of abstractions , an intellectual disagreement
0	for the moment , while she peered into his throat , nothing ; but even after she was done , he was at a loss
0	why , if he and a few other people had not kept at the senate continually , we should most likely still be behind the danish and the thurn-and-taxis postal service !
0	that was the song of a dweller in a great city
0	sometimes he sealed himself on the little terrace , in the pavilion now entirely overgrown with green , and stared across the garden at the red brick rear wall of the house
0	and he looked at the guests as well ; the groups began to break up for him , and individuals to stand out
0	it , vas simply as though we had parted the day before
0	they returned almost in silence
0	i shouldn ’ t have thought i could remember him so clearly
0	her breasts , which were not high and voluptuous like marusja ’ s , but small and maidenly , were pressed together from both sides
0	no doubt he , vas very welcome there , and just as certainly the arrangements to release him went forward slowly in munich , where there was reluctance to let him go
0	dh , so you like being there ?
0	they went out on the high-road to the next village , or along the beach to the ocean temple on its height , whence a wide view was to be had over land and sea ; or to the woods be-hind the kurhouse , where was a great bell used to call the guests to the table-d'hote
0	i enjoy drinking the beer -- i drink a good deal , the more so as the water is not very good
0	i hate , love , and fear it ; for - may i be pardoned for this all too personal excuse ?
0	well , when you say amateur ( hans castorp could not recall saying anything of the sort ) , the word is perhaps not ill chosen ; it has a slight suggestion of superficiality—yes , very well , i am an amateur of music—which is not to say that i set great store by it ; not as i love and reverence the word , the bearer of the spirit , the tool and gleaming ploughshare of progress—music ?
0	drink seven swallows of water , and then lie down and count a thousand
0	flowers half faded , wilted but not dry , lay scattered on the floor of the loggia and on the balustrade ; others , between sheets of blottingpaper , were giving out their moisture under pressure from heavy stones
0	of course he will have it anyhow , but never mind , i will make the most of it while i can—he enlarged upon his objection : but you are a humanist , are you not ?
0	the audience , however , took no offence , all being in much the same irresponsible condition
0	never before had hans castorp been so impressed with its oddity as when he saw it to-day under this absurd head-gear : the flat , snub-nosed , purple-flushed physiognomy , the watery , goggling blue eyes beneath tow-coloured brows , and the blond , close-trimmed moustache mounted crookedly above the full , bow-shaped lips
0	fine lads , eh , frau consul ?
0	he inquired after tony 's acre and cow , asked how much she wanted for a sack of wheat , and tried to drive a bargain with her
0	he had stammered something unintelligi- ble , and then burst out complaining and scolding at the fine kind of housekeeping he had , and how everybody had run away and left him to starve
0	some days later , however—that is , between the beginning and middle of the month— there came another change : a latter summer set in , with amazing splendour
0	she repeated his word , not without difficulty
0	frau stöhr tells me the concierge sells tin horns in his lodge , did you know that ?
0	the two physicians , the directress , madame chauchat , and the malay were within , the last-named dressed not as usual , but in a sort of national costume , with a striped garment like a shirt , very long wide sleeves , a gaily coloured skirt , and a curious , cone-shaped hat made of yellow cloth on his head
0	the guilty satisfaction of seeing the open book in front of him gave him a pricking sensation in his skin ; but at the same time he had such a feeling , of disgust that he intentionally deceived as badly as possible , simply to make the deceit seem less vulgar to himself
0	he was fitted out with the pneumothorax and wore smoking at the midday meal but not in the evening , saying this was their custom in the navy
0	need i tell you how ?
0	young behrens sometimes visited his father in the holidays ; he had done so once during joachim ’ s time up here
0	people un-earthed wise old saws on the subject of human nature and applied them to senator buddenbrook 's wife
0	he had just come from the operating-room , so he said , and was on his way to private practice in the village
0	the kr�s lived in the grand style ; there was a difference be-tween their brilliant establishment and the solid , somewhat heavy comfort of the paternal home , which was obvious at a glance , and which impressed very much the young dem-oiselle buddenbrook
0	nor do we except the person and situation of the husband—if we may regard in that light our young friend , who had indeed formed such a wish—sitting there , with the knees of the little mother between his own , holding in his her hands , which were as wet as once little leila ’ s , so that he had constantly to be renewing his hold , not to let them slip
0	or rather , the thing is , i do not dare really will it
0	but now , she went on , in a louder key , slowly nodding her head from one side to the other , now that you are here , i am glad you are
0	it must be the most melancholy thing in life
0	a deaf man , he cried , quite ignorant of sound , could not but de- light in these gracious visions
0	he took a morbid and extravagant pleasure in thus trifling with fräulein engelhart , and she on her side reciprocated ; first out of a natural instinct to be the go-between in a love-affair , secondly because to oblige hans castorp she had actually contrived to fall victim to frau chauchat ’ s charms ; and finally because she felt a pathetic joy in having him tease her and make her blush
0	the consul could not see her face -- but it had the expres-sion it often wore those summer evenings at travemiinde , as dhe leaned at the window of her little room
0	their bearing , less angular than usual , expressed a mild satisfaction with the impartial justice of death
0	then he asked the pianist , a weary-eyed youth who had certainly dreamed of something higher than his present occupation , if he could accompany dvo- rak 's hurnoresqlle , and on the mediocre fiddle played the popular piece , with its many grace notes , charming glides , and pretty double stopping ; so pertly and brilliantly that he won loud ap- plause from everybody in the place , ourselves and the neighbour- ing tables : , the amazed musicians , and the two waiters as , veil
0	a young man with thin moustaches sat next beyond
0	they have been brought forward , these comrades , for a final thrust in a fight that has already lasted all day long , whose objective is the retaking of the hill position and the burning villages beyond , lost two days since to the enemy
0	for marusja was almost always there in the evening—laughter-loving marusja , with the little ruby on her charming hand , the handkerchief with the orange scent , and the swelling bosom , tainted within—hans castorp comprehended that it was her presence which drove joachim away , precisely because it so strongly , so fearfully drew him toward her
0	he bowed low , laying his hand upon his breast
0	repeated herr settembrini , and looked at him
0	kai asked with deep interest
0	if he is that , then i would gladly make his acquaintance—did i not tell you your cousin would die if he went down to be a soldier ?
0	the masters have not known him since he was a baby , the way i have -- they do not know how to take him , when they are teaching him
0	oh , heavens , you poor thing !
0	but today i seem to hear them when i hear you
0	pastor kolling of st mary 's per-formed the service , and laid special stress upon moderation
0	he was now thirty-three years old , but he looked much older
0	a lovely boy , with full hair drawn sideways across his brow and falling on his temples , sat directly beneath him , apart from his companions , with arms folded on his breast—not sadly , not ill-naturedly , quite tranquilly on one side
0	they were not the worst
0	now look how you can improve on it !
0	hans castorp sat awhile without answering , looking in front of him
0	silent and stiffly erect , with his eyes half-closed , lebrecht kroger sat with the rug over his knees , the consul at his right hand , while the carriage rolled through the streets
0	there is the administration of jus- tice and the preservation of order
0	she folded her arms and looked around her like one sure of ap-plause
0	the more i think of it , the surer i am that the bed of repose—by which i mean my deck-chair , of course—has given me more food for thought in these ten months than the mill down in the flat-land in all the years before
0	he said no more , clutched a roll , and began , standing , with his hat on and his bag under his arm , to swallow his cocoa
0	it will soon be filled up again , i am not worried about that— but anton is off , on the wings of the wind , in the twinkling of an eye , rapt away before he knew where he was
0	whereat tony , red with anger , gave him a push and darted an embarrassed glance at young schwarzkopf
0	industry and beauty chaste
0	i-ie repeated the passage and declared that some day he would cer- tainly compose it , also the incomparable talk in the fifth act about the folly of the wise , the helpless , blinded , humiliating misuse of wit to adorn the fool 's cap of passion
0	he rested his elbow on the sofa-cushion , and his chin in his hand , and looked at the things for a while from a distance
0	his case was long-standing , he had wandered for years from one establishment to another
0	aussi longtemps pour toi
0	he did not sit down
0	they accused herr albin of perpetrating this rather contemptible jest , but he denied it on his honour ; and even without his word they all felt fairly certain no one of their circle was guilty
0	it is like a word , a key word , stamped on every- thing in the song , which it would like to determine entirely
0	child , you will believe me when i tell you that i feel everything you can say , as much as you do yourself
0	but it is well worth seeing
0	fame and virtue were shadows to him , nature an evil power—and so she is , stupid and evil both , i agree with him there—he even despaired , horrible to say , he even despaired of science and progress !
0	even more nefarious , in their eyes , was the exploitation of time ; the montrousness of receiving a premium for the passage of time—interest , in other words—and misusing to one ’ s own advantage and another ’ s disadvantage a universal and god-given dispensation
0	when we students greeted him on the street he would take it off with a very sweep- ing bow and say : your llumble servant !
0	but , deuce take it , the free natural beauty belongs to me -- have not i the right to put it in order if i like ?
0	the crashing applause , loud enough any- how , rose still higher as ferdinand edschmidt motioned to the orchestra to stand up , and put out , his hand gratefully to his kon- zertmeister
0	he was wrong , they said , at least for the most part
0	but i was almost never with them , since we usually went to buchel only after morning church and i can but say that i never heard from adrian a word to indicate that his
0	in beethoven there are already movements of a rhyth- mic freedom foreshadowing things to come - a freedom which in leverktihn is complete but for his bar-lines , which , as an ironi- cally conservative conventional feature , he still retained
0	her mouth wore a pinched smile , her nose was rather beaked ; the expression of her blue eyes , blurred by the drooping lids , was weakly , dull , suspicious ; it was a loolc of knowledge and suffering , if not without some effort at roguish- ness
0	surely a religious sense , which i protest is in no way lacking in me , is something other than positive and formally professed reli- gion
0	why should i marry him ?
0	he gave signs of life , but was frightfully injured
0	but no one , certainly not myself , could have laughed at certain other phenomena , nat- ural , yet incredible and uncanny , displayed by father lever- ktihn
0	and loving words i ’ ve carven
0	hanno , still looking down , made an obvious effort to give a prompt , alert , and correct answer to the question
0	how the child can play !
0	well , you should be pleased : you have some good things in the adagio
0	he was possessed by a sort of spasmodic activity : would sit down next a pupil , exhaling a strong spirituous odour , tap him on the forehead with his seal ring , shoot out certain isolated words and phrases like perspective !
0	yes , we will even go further , and relate his carelessness of his person to the carelessness of the rest of the world regarding him
0	yes , i am pretty wretched too , said christian , irritated at thomas 's speaking only of himself
0	for this sufferer possessed neither the power nor the good will to rise above his illness ; but rather saw all the world in its sign and image
0	he said the hrart and lungs were operating soundly , but the occasional difficulty in breathing was due to muscular sluggishness , and ordered first the use of a fan and secondly that of a green powder which one burned , inhaling the smoke
0	one could only think : god save me from the humiliation of belonging to a man like that !
0	this is not a funeral , it 's a christening , get along with your mother earth !
0	all these clandestine dainties his family had sent to give him strength
0	an estimable christian gentleman was the consul 's opinion
0	flesh and blood too and not wrapped up in asbestos against the atf traction of the lovely and precious
0	wait a minute -- here , go out and give yourself a treat , in honour of the day !
0	but since it was absolutely impossible to think anything about it , little elly had thought nothing at all
0	then she takes it to the virtuous lady , who receives her respectfully , since everybody supposes she is a saint
0	but i have retained the impression , based principally , i suppose , upon things my fa- ther said , that the little long-bearded , cap-wearing talmudist far surpassed his colleague of another faith in learning and religious penetration
0	the progress of acclimatization was over , there were no more visions
0	just as the soil there increases in value , and space becomes more and more precious , so , in the same measure , does time
0	a pretty , or at least a charming woman
0	rhadamanthus always talked about his doggedness
0	time is a gift of god , given to man that he might use it—use it , engineer , to serve the advancement of humanity
0	i am grateful to providence that i came off without any loss whatever
0	but the place doesn ’ t look its best to-night
0	now , castorp , watch out you don ’ t disappoint me and give the lie to my knowledge of human nature !
0	the illumination leaves your mental powers to the last unimpaired , ) ; res , heightens them to an ecstatie of delirium - what shall it then go short of save the dear soul and the price- less life of feeling ?
0	with only two of his table-mates had he personal relations : anton karlowitsch ferge from st petersburg , that good-natured sufferer , was one , on his left
0	it showed a nice little income , herr permaneder 's share of which , with the help of tony 's seventeen thousand , would suffice for a comfortable if modest life
0	so it was settled , joachim was to go
0	until everybody jumped out of bed
0	he hasn ’ t any money , has he ?
0	will ye hold your tongue still ?
0	that shows how little he let one approach him ; what fixed bounds he set to intimacy
0	by the beginning of april he was a lieutenant
0	for it was precisely this mingling of trials with blessings which showed that cod never lifted his hand from the family , but ever guided its destinies according to his wise design , which we mi^ht not seek id question
0	they went about on their tip-toes and spoke in whispers
0	you may make yourself quite easy , they sit at the bad ’ russian table , a long way off us—there is a good ’ russian table , too , you see , where the nicer russians sit—and there is not much chance of you coming into contact with them , even if you wanted to
0	from what i hear , there will be more masquerading ; certain people have left the room , we are justified in anticipating almost anything
0	but he would never , by himself , have taken the first steps ; he was too timid for that
0	for the size of the room , the furniture was rather scant
0	yet , on the other hand , the luxury of an ocean-going vessel connoted ( ! )
0	but my dear wehsal , it seems to me there are certain rights a man simply does not assert
0	you are a man of experience , both professionally and per-sonally
0	his fellow-guests were right to make light of them
0	we were indeed brought into cursory contact with chamber mu- sic , for every weel { or so there was a performance in adrian 's uncle 's house , but only occasionally in my presence and by no means always in his
0	but , good lord , she must have had strength , to defend herself like that
0	he himself felt the change and knew it could not have escaped the eyes of others : the contrast between his active , elastic movements ani the dull pallor of his face
0	yet why not material—it was sentient to the point of desire and disgust , the shamelessness of matter become sensible of itself , the incontinent form of being
0	but one only needed to look further on in the book to find others which attained the same end by being strikingly , far-rcachingly visible
0	his mouth turned down at the corners , in one of which he held a wooden pipe
0	but every now and then i tell him a dream i ’ ve had , so he can have something to analyse
0	a tall young girl in a green sweater , with untidy hair and foolish , half-open eyes , brushed past hans castorp , nearly touching him with her arm
0	may i be permitted to ask after the state of your health , engineer ?
0	he could not hide his pleasure in the degree of intimacy thus achieved , and from now on referred always to frau chauchat as clavdia
0	hosts of flakes flew into his face , melted there , and he anguished with the cold of them
0	herr gosch spoke the last word with his teeth particularly close to-gether , and went on : oh , the thing has its fine side , that 's certain
0	in the first place he had gone back to william blake and set to music a very strange poem of this favourite au- thor of his
0	of course preference is not the right word ; i only mean that at least in this work , the apocalypse , he makes exceptionally frequent use of it , and certainly these images of terror offer a most tempting and at the same time most legitimate occasion for the employ- ment of that savage device
0	to try to make a clean-cut distinction between the passionate and the soulful—that would , no doubt , be analytical
0	hanks , deutschlin , laughed adrian
0	the fell intent of this sentence , so full of pitfalls , was that you should write ei where you ought to write ie , and contrariwise
0	he was hampered by his illnesses , and often absent-minded , for his thoughts would linger among his harmonic combinations , or upon the still unravelled marvel of some piece 'which he had heard his mother and herr pfiihl playing ; and all this did not help him on in the sciences
0	'the waggoner gks up at thrrc from his bed of straw ' -- why , of course he- docs !
0	no , he was not the man to give any quickening impulse to the business in the face of his partner 's present lassitude
0	it 's not far from here to rostock -- and from there it is no distance at all
0	it is much easier for us to follow the feelings of a man for a woman - even though he be entirely indifferent to her himself - than to put himself in the place of a woman in love with another man
0	you know how i despise that lot
0	the place he had elected as his home - home in that sense i have spoken of , assinlilative and not altogether acceptable- was a relatively fortunate choice
0	but in practice , of course , there is hardly such a thing as pure and unadulterated waiting
0	our good dr kiirbis 'vas greatly surprised by the violence of its recurrence ; but he told us that children convalescing from measles or whooping-cough were susceptible to it
0	but , on the other hand , he partook of the wine with gusto , not to say abandon ; and repeatedly , though with careful avoidance of emotional language , expressed his joy at having somebody here with whom one could have a little rational conversation
0	they entered an antechamber with clothes-racks , where behrens hung his bowler on a hook , and thence passed into a short corridor , which was separated by a glass door from that of the main building
0	when her eyes -- the light blue eyes of herr griinlich -- rested upon him , you could see how her full bosom rose and fell without a sound , and how she was beset with anxious , bewildered thoughts about usance and book-keeping , witnesses , prosecuting attorneys , defence , and judges
0	the reading which held him so late suggested such an explanation to his mind
0	joachim must know , and as he made no motion to defer to sex , even though hans castorp looked at him imploringly , the latter followed his cousin past frau chauchat , who merely glanced up from her stooping posture as they went through the door into the laboratory
0	the consul was leaning forward in his easy-chair , rather fidgety

0	she never stirred from the house , but superintended with tireless zeal the homage that pressed about the earthly husk of her departed brother
0	reduced to order and put into words , they would have been something like the following
0	at the upper end , next the place of the medical presiding officer , the hump-backed mexican sat , perched on many cushions ; the amateur photographer , whose facial expression was that of a deaf person , because he possessed no language with which to communicate his thoughts
0	then i wrote to him : amon tres cher fits : you are marrying our shop -- very well , that 's an end of it
0	but he had also felt great curiosity at these fateful gifts of ellen brand ; combined , it is true , with the knowledge that their field was with difficulty accessible to the spirit , and the doubt as to whether it was not barren , or even sinful , so far as he was concerned—all which did not prevent his feeling from being what in fact it actually was , curiosity
0	frau gr� rang , and tinka , the housemaid , came from the entry to take the child from her high chair and carry her upstairs into the play-room

0	and thanks very much
0	he sent it to lubeck , where the stutterer still was , and the latter ac- tually produced it there , in a german version , a year later , after war had broken out - i was not present - with the result that during the performance two thirds of the audience left the the- atre
0	kb'ppen , made fun of their friend betsy
0	nor did the bearing of his entourage speak for it , they having been ready to fight on his behalf ; nor the fanatical love of the peasants , eager to die for their kini
0	and one would know so much better the second time !
0	i have seen so much evil in the world
0	hans castorp recognized her , staring-eyed , and distinctly felt the blood leave his cheeks
0	this holger was the departed and etherealized spirit of a young man , the familiar , something like the guardian angel , of little elly
0	through it went and landed on a roll df green rep the rascally mob !
0	a tendency , which indeed i had noticed in him some time back , to walk with his head and torso slightly bent to one side was now more marked
0	yes , my dear friend , said he ( omit the hitches which de- tracted from his impressiveness ) , if it is healthiness you are after
0	the projecting roof gave the illusion of shelter , and the hut itself , on the side turned toward the mountains , afforded , he found , some little protection against the storm
0	we need more room
0	that was at the beginning of november—all souls ’ —and there was no novelty about it
0	he shivered a little in his light clothes as he stood there a few paces from his own house , and turned to look up at its grey gabled fa�e
0	you fetch them from here to go and practise , you go off on them—
0	forgive me , gerda -- you are his mother -- dh , he was an angel
0	since the occasion arose , i bought one from her
0	is there an intelligence present ?
0	it was touching to see hans castorp labour to master his drowsiness and be polite
0	leo , or leib , as he had been called in his childhood , had been allowed to watch in the court-yard while the father carried out his task , aided by his helper , a powerful youth of the athletic jewish type , beside whom the slender elie with his round blond beard seemed still more fragile and delicate
0	they were busy in there
0	he made as though to follow , but then left them on the stairs , turned back to the salon , closed all the doors , and stopped there half the night , busy as a bee
0	but suddenly , in the noise of the wheels , she heard morten 's voice with miracu-lous clearness
0	on the one hand i was shocked and upset about the maibooms , but on the other i was pleased for you
0	fortune and success lie with ourselves
0	his language was so violent that she began listening wilh a jump , staring up to see if he were looking at her
0	may not my readers ask , vhence comes the detail in my narrative , so precisely known to me , even though i could not have been al- ways present , not always at the side of the departed hero of this biography ?
0	it had been absolutely necessary for the sake of the country to turn him over to psychiatrists and keepers and set up a mentally sound regency
0	the senator shook his head as he stood , playing with his pince-nez on the table-cloth
0	mynheer peeperkorn arrived at the dorf station by the same evening train as frau chauchat
0	the cousins learnt of the death from fritz rotbein ’ s nurse , alfreda schildknecht , called sister berta , who met them in the corridor and discreetly communicated the sad event
0	they exchanged glances and head-shakes and rather intimidated smiles as they stood regarding this spectacle , this long catastrophe of foam and fury , whose preposterous roaring deafened them , frightened them , bewildered their senses of sight and hearing , so that they even imagined they heard above , below , and on all sides , cries of warning , trumpet-calls , hoarse human voices
0	so she had stayed at home
0	and she isn ’ t the cleanest in this world , with her feather hat
0	how , then , could one who posed as the friend of man shut his eyes to these fundamental truths concerning man ’ s humanity ?
0	can you deny that he puts us all in his pocket ?
0	and he will hear not of my going to the conservatoire , either the big one of the hase , where he teaches ; it were , he says , no atmosphere for me , i must rather do as father haydn did , who had no preceptor at all , but got him- self the gradus ad p , , ; rrnassum of fux and some music of the time , in especial the hamburg bach , and therewith sturdily practised his trade
0	not to one man , but to two : for the house is to be pulled down , and a hedge run through diagonally , and benthien will build himself a dog-kennel on the right side , and sorenson one on the left

0	music was playing , the kurhaus band , stationed in the gallery of the wooden pavilion , above the four-cornered racecourse
0	frau consul buddenbrook had invited her brother to meng street , in order that he might talk over the provisions made by the deceased with thomas and with heir marcus the confidential clerk
0	he demolished illusions , he was ruthlessly enlightened , he relentlessly destroyed all faith in the dignity of silver hairs and the innocence of the sucking babe
0	but he would say it in a different tone , more en passant , more modestly , in short
0	and yet the line between temptation and sin was hard tp draw , for , vas not temptation already the raging of sin in the blood , and in the very state of fleshly desire did there not lie much concession to evil ?
0	the rendezvous will have to be made
0	he repeated , i have none
0	for such a significance , he declared , he joyfully ascribed to them
0	and here some strange things had been written on the rough paper
0	he said that he and the family there present no longer importuned cod for the life of this dear and beloved suf-ferer , for they saw plainly that it was god 's will to take him lo himself
0	he went over , in his disgust , to the order of the day , and looked to see whose turn it really was
0	i must join my regiment
0	but samiel- that 's a folish form
0	burgo- master dr langhals , a heavily built man of elegant appear- ance , with a shaven chin nestling in a white neck-cloth , short grey mutton-chops , and a languid diplomatic air , was received with general marks of respect
0	thus , as i have lain in my loge , it has been revealed to me , and i am enchanted to be able to tell you all about it
0	he had fought out the attack on his lungs , fought long and stoutly , despite his air of being at home in the life of the day only by dint of his powers of adaptability
0	i was quite put off , for the moment
0	the other pictures were chiefly mountain landscapes , mountains in snow and mountains in summer green , mist-wreathed mountains , mountains whose dry , sharp outline was cut out against a deep-blue sky—these apparently under the influence of segantini
0	i am taken up with the housekeeping
0	eva ewers managed it -- but eva is not a buddenbrook , and she has a husband that amounts to something
0	this correctness of demeanour obviously had to do with the fact that grandfather was now no longer anything but body
0	a light object lay in his lap ; he discovered it to be the souvenir which had once so surprised his uncle when he lifted it from his nephew ’ s table : the glass diapositive of clavdia chauchat ’ s x-ray portrait
0	slowly , slowly , with secret tears , little johann learned to live without the sea ; to lead an existence that was frightened and bored by turns ; to keep out of the way of the hagenstrbms ; to console himself with kai and he it pfiihl and his music
0	and the mylendonk slipped you the thermometer ?
0	do not i have to -- ?
0	no , my mot was not in the nature of paradox , i assure you
0	ee were fair , charmingly pampered , lisping little beings , concerned about their frocks and sashes , obviously under pressure from the mother 's perfection-compulsion
0	but they spoke of one last episode -- the visit of the little ragged count who had almost forced his way to hanno 's bedside
0	what do i hear - you do not conduct ?
0	though one could be sure that he said the same thing in the other place and tried to create the illusion that he liked them best - just as though everybody set great store by that
0	she accepted with no false pride the fruits of his charity or his unquenched love , whichever it was , seeing herself quite humbly as a dishonoured and sinful creature ; and so bore all the plagues of job with astounding patience and resilience , with the elementary powers of resistance of her sex , which triumphed over all the misery of her tawny body , and even made of the gauze dressings which she had to wear about her head a becoming personal adornment
0	perhaps the consul wished to make his burst of hilarity appear plausible ; perhaps he had some other connexion in mind ; at all events , he abruptly took over the conversation and began talking like a club-man
0	aloud he said : thank you , professor naphta
0	what a pity christian was not here !
0	joachim , then , inveighed against the gaffky scale , openly giving notice that he questioned its authority—or perhaps not quite openly , he did not say so to the authorities , but expressed his views to his cousin , and even in the dining-room
0	then he took his pen again and wrote after his last amen : yea , o god , i will eternally praise thee !
0	from her , from her alone it came , she said remorsefully , again and again
0	revolution had arrived under the windows of the sitting
0	also he would oblige the assembly with a solo , a toccata of bach , a movement of beethoven or schumann , at the instance of the leader , baworinski , a tall dark lean person , vvith drooping lids and mouth puckered as though to whistle
0	clouds came up , behind piz michel and tinzenhorn , and drove north-eastwards
0	i admit the man has his faults ; his manner of speech becomes disagreeable in the long run , there is something forced about it , especially when one remembers he had the great sorrow of losing his wife up here
0	it was evidence of old-established intimacy , a life in cimon which could not be in the least affected by a year 's sep- aration
0	adrian showed no sign of gratifying the general expectation , mine included , by going to the piano
0	we were all so happy here to-day , father ; we had a glorious celebration , and we felt proud and glad of what we have accomplished , and of having raised the family and firm to a position of honour and respect but this bitter feud with my own brother , with your eldest son , is like a hidden crack in the building we have erected
0	herr magnus was livelier and chattier , though only in a vein intolerable to the italian ’ s literary sense
0	the professional skaters , in close-fitting costumes of black tricot with furred and braided jackets , cut figures , hovered and balanced , leaped and spun
0	probably it was al- so connected with the scruples he felt on the score of the destiny , the historic situation of art itself , of the autonomous work
0	clara and clothilda went always on sunday evenings to the house of a friend , where they knitted stockings for little negro children
0	it was funny , and touching , but to restore good relations he might repeat some more or less apt phrase you had used , or a quotation you had once made from a book , to show that he had not forgotten , that he was at home among the higher things
0	this drug caused immediate death when introduced into the circulation—as for instance by means of an arrow—but nobody could explain how it operated
0	every wednesday after-noon there appeared on the threshold his bulky , square , high-shouldered figure , in a coffee-coloured coat , whereof the skirts hung down over his knees
0	he was like the scholar in the peculiarly happy state of never being asked any more ; of never having a task , of being left to sit , since the fact of his being left behind is established , and no one troubles about him further—an orgiastic kind of freedom , but we ask ourselves whether , indeed , freedom ever is or can be of any other kind
0	he regarded her with the air of a satisfied possessor
0	she always stood up for her sister and said up with you !
0	what was it then , carmen asked ; and he : dost thou not hear ?
0	what a queer creature !
0	i parted from adrian with soothing hopes on my lips , and the way he left me was better than the way he had received me the day before
0	it kept within bounds , but it persisted
0	hans castorp revolved these queries and their like in his brain
0	these gentlemen brought us the conception of the vocal polyphonic art , humanly at first , oh yes , and seemed to us therefore the greatest masters of this style
0	there is something secret and suspicious-looking about him , there in that hole , with all that silk—
0	we shall put tony into fraulein weichbrodt 's boarding-school , said the consul
0	she went out , after receiving the frau consul 's kiss on her stiff lips
0	hanno was quite dazed
0	it is just time for early service , but to-day we will praise god with full hearts in his own free out-of-doors ; shall we not , herr permaneder ?
0	herr von throta played the piano , violin , viola , cello , and flute , and played them all unusually well
0	but a day without tobacco would be flat , stale , and unprofitable , as far as i am concerned
0	the smoking-room was furnished in dark colours and wainscoted
0	how do you expect to give your lads the devil down below , in the lit-up state you are in ?
0	behrens told me directly that she would be out before you came , and you might have the room
0	not an instrument at all in the sense of the others , since all spe- cialization is foreign to it
0	a moment , thomas -- it 's very pressing ; there 's no time to waste
0	grass and moss grew between the paving-stones , the steps were in a state of advanced decay , and they could only look into the billiard-room without entering , -- the floor was so bad -- so the family of cats that lived there rent-free was not disturbed
0	gerda leaned her head on her hand and watched them , with an expression in her eyes impossible to read
0	or , on the other hand , that he had after all not left , but lent an ear to the hofrat ’ s gospel of the melting snows—was that fact any way connected with the circumstance that the full-bosomed marusja was not gone for good but only on a journey , and would be back again in five of the smallest time-units known to house berghof ?
0	she had begun early to grow grey , but her hair had never become quite white , having remained a mixture of black and grey ; her erect bony figure was as sturdy , and her brown eyes as bright , clear , and unwearied as twenty years ago

0	he laid his hand on the door-knob -- but now the music struck up again with a stormy outburst of sound , and he shrank back
0	have you heard of leopardi , engineer , or you , lieutenant ?
0	ah , only a little while , and that struggle will be upon us -- and they will do their best to bend us to their will and cut us to their pattern , to exercise us , to lengthen us , to shorten us , to corrupt us great things happened while little hanno played
0	that is too bad !
0	the drawing-lesson was the next period , and hans castorp found himself without a pencil
0	but his head and face , despite their careful grooming , looked rather seedy
0	from this sowing , as the result of a physical process called osmotic pressure , there sprang the pathetic crop for which their
0	not a word of his health
0	later , in the salon , he played several concert pieces , and �erda also performed
0	you must not attach importance to that , she finally said
0	the large garden , all the way down to the trave , the house set far back with the drive , and the chestnut avenue
0	certainly a greek venus or athlete is more humanistic , it is probably at bottom the most humanistic of all the arts , when one comes to think about it !
0	the primary symbol of alchemic transmutation , naphta said , was par excellence the sepulchre
0	lead back my mind to what you said previously about vice : that it consists in an affront to the simple , what you call the holy , or , as i might say , the classic , gifts which life offers us ; the larger gifts , by contrast with the later and cultivated ’ ones , the refinements , which you indulge in , as one of us put it , whereas one consecrates oneself ’ to the great gifts and pays them homage
0	one can only add that had there been no pieter peeperkorn , party feeling would have run higher on both sides ; as when leo naphta defended the arch-revolutionary nature of the church , against settembrini ’ s dogmatic assertion that that great historic power was to be looked upon merely as the protectress of the sinister forces of reaction ; whereas all the forces that made for life and future , and looked undismayed on change and resolution , he claimed for the principles of enlightenment ; science and progress , which had their rise in an epoch of quite opposed tendencies , the famous century that witnessed the rebirth of classical culture
0	he had used the second person singular
0	in any case , it was at the schlaginhaufens ' , and through this very breisacher , that i first came in touch with the new world of anti-humanity , of which my easy-going soul till then had known nothing at all
0	he felt beforehand , quite clearly , that such experiencess whatever the course of them , could never be anything but in bad taste , unintelligible and humanly valueless
0	the pain grew and grew , to limitless , incredible heights ; it grew to an insane , shrieking , inhuman torture , tearing his entire brain
0	in the moment when that hope can no longer be decently sustained , in that moment i shall turn my back on this establishment , and take private lodgings somewhere in the valley
0	herr settembrini , of course , could not refrain from protesting against this hideous conception of policy ; against the gesture of a shrewd and sinister complaisance , made by the spirit—or what called itself so—against the imaginary guilt of its opposite , which it pretended to deal with in a politic sense , but which in reality stood in no need of the pernicious indulgence it proffered ; against the accursed dualism of a conception which bedevilled the universe—that is to say , life—as well as life ’ s dark opposite , the spirit—for if life was evil , the spirit , as pure negation , must be so too
0	hans castorp well remembered the mottled pallor of joachim ’ s skin when , for the first and only time , he had innocently alluded to marusja ’ s physical charms in the light tone he might have assumed at home
0	in hans castorp ’ s case its nature was evident in the extent to which he not only ceased to exercise his judgment , but even began to experiment for his own part and upon his own mortal vesture
0	the hofrat came , summoned by sister berta
0	a fresh rumour from the town hall , running zig-zag through the crowd , has reached her ears
0	that is to say—i suppose i am expressing myself very ridiculously , but—you can see how the things of the mind and the love of beauty come together , and that they always really have been one and the same—in other words , science and art ; and that the calling of being an artist surely belongs with the others , as a sort of fifth faculty , because it too is a humanistic calling , a variety of humanistic interest , in so far as its most important theme or concern is with man—you will agree with me on that point
0	in short , he has made a mistake in his calculations about me and the character of my firm
0	such at the moment is the background of my biographical ac- tivity
0	then he went into the balcony with the glass cigar in his mouth , like an old hand
0	once more she saw his anguished face , his im-ploring eyes directed upon her ; again she saw , and was moved to see , that this pleading , this anguish , were real and un-feigned
0	dh , no , morten said , hastily
0	such scenes in the family are frightful , but we must speak out once for all
0	it ’ s annoying— who is that dark woman down in the garden ?
0	into it adrian spun himself round like a cocoon , to stimu- late himself for a work which should gather up all their elements into one single focus , assemble them in one pregnant , portentous synthesis and in relentless transmission hold up to humanity the
0	still , his drunkenness was not debasing , there was no loss of dignity ; rather it combined with the nobility of his nature to produce an immense and awe-inspiring effect
0	he weeps so easy , poor little lad , and it is so hard for him to stop
0	but it is painful for me to have gotthold think that his step-mother looks out after her own children and delib-erately makes bad blood between him and his father !
0	they were , to a man , well-meaning and sweet-humoured ; and they were one in the belief that knowledge and good cheer are not mutually exclusive
0	in other words , between death and us there is no rapport ; it is something with which we have nothing to do—and only incidentally the world and nature
0	we will see who dies first
0	come along , it is time we both went to bed
0	the slender , elderly legs were cased in black silk stockings ; the shoes had silver buckles
0	everything depended upon who was drunk—a drunken personality was far from being the same as a drunken tinker
0	he had no more time to concern himself with his cousin ’ s fate or further sojourn
0	i myself have seen some beautiful cases of acclimatization
0	they rubbed their eyes , stared vacantly before them , blinking in the brilliant light and wishing themselves back in the darkness , looking at sights which had had their day and then , as it were , had been transplanted into fresh time , and bedizened up with music
0	she sat up quickly and put her feet to the floor
0	will you take a glass of red wine with me ?
0	and the ladies , even though aware of the mechanicocosmetical origin of this conquering-hero air , were foolish enough to be carried away by it
0	one day the english reached bremen , the americans were at the gates of upper franconia ; nuremberg , city of the national celebra- tions so uplifting to unenlightened hearts , nuremberg surren- dered
0	people have on good black clothes , and they take off their hats and look at the coffin , and behave serious and reverent , and nobody dares to make a bad joke , the way they do in ordinary life
0	dear friend , why do i have to laugh ?
0	what do you expect to do ?
0	at first the rooms held the warmth of the summery period just past : they stood at fifty degrees , which passed for comfortable

0	even a k ferge , to whom all elevated thoughts were foreign , who disclaimed from its inception any power to measure the seriousness of the dispute—even he was convinced that this was a quarrel à outrance , and that there was nothing to do but let it take its course
0	a while ago i was feeling rather queer -- not exactly ill and yet not quite well
0	but what troubles me is that your experiment should lead you in just this direction
0	and now irnagine ( here is the clear picture i promised to give ) how these gentlemen , scientists themselves , scholars and teachers - vogler , unruhe , holzschuher , lnstitoris , and brei- sacher as well- revelled in a situation which for me had about it so much that was terrifying , and which they regarded as either already in full swing or inevitably on the way
0	but was that all ?
0	they returned to their own storey , hans castorp greatly pleased and edified by the visit
0	it was just a little arrangement among them-selves -- not very honourable , indeed , but then , not very un-common either
0	then the wind he faced took his breath on the spot , so that he was forced to go through the awkward process of turning round again to get it back , and collect his resolution to advance in the teeth of his ruthless foe
0	only that the dialectic process - by which , at the stage of development that this work occupies , is consummated by the change from the strictest constraint to the free language of feeling , the birth of freedom from bondage - the dialectic process appears as end- lessly more complicated in its logic , endlessly more miraculous and amazing than at the time of the madrigalists
0	but at length the master sighed and said : oh , buddenbrook !
0	well , hanno , so you want a little taste of music , do you ?
0	come round—not coming round—that ’ s the regular expression they use , of people drowned or frozen to death—i suppose i used it because i arn not quite so clear in the head as i might be
0	it was a decent conviction , if you were to ask me
0	at that moment he did not know how old he was , despite strenuous , even desperate efforts to bethink himself
0	oh , it was absurd to get up now !
0	hans castorp ’ s thoughts , or rather his prophetic half-thoughts soared high , as he sat there in night and silence before his truncated sarcophagus of music
0	to all this herr kesselmeyer simply shook his hand in the air , as if to say : this wo not get us anywhere , my dear friend

0	uncle justus brought his feeble wife , with whom he lived an un- happy existence
0	and from this circumstance arose all the proceedings , acts , and formalities , which were the theme of a widely circulated composition
0	the buddenbrooks must have dragged the old man in by the hair !
0	he : off you go again !
0	as for the cigarettes , adrian never gave up smoking except when forced to on the days when the migraine , with its violent attacks like seasickness fell on him , and he kept his bed in a darkened room , as happened two or three times in the month
0	so passed october and november
0	but of course youth is capable of anything
0	the worst case at their table was dr blumenkohl , leo blumenkohl , from odessa , the young man with the moustaches and the absorbed and care-worn air
0	there ’ s no law against it—anybody can paint that likes
0	st augustine , at least , had gone so far as to say that the function of tie bad , vas to make the good stand out more strongly ; that it pleased the more and , vas the more lovely , the more it was compared with the bad
0	furthermore , since newspaper might easily come to have four times the value of wrapping-paper and pasteboard , it would become an economic factor of considerable importance , and the basis of fruitful governmental and communal assessments , and thus lighten for newspaper readers the burden of taxation
0	he put up a sign which read : here lives count molln
0	his head was bowed and his legs far apart , his manner vastly respectful
0	but these inhabitants , these streets and granaries , which were normally a matter of complete indifference to him , became positively hateful when they were made the subject of an examination
0	the greek sculptors did not trouble themselves about the head and face , their interest was more with the body , i suppose that was their humanism—and the plasticity of the female form—so that is fat , is it ?
0	then it was over , and the whole holiday lay in the past—or , equally , it lay in the distant future , a year away : twelve months would bring it round again , seven more than the time hans castorp had spent up here
0	much roasting and baking went on in the kitchen
0	now and then some-body sighed and said that the wife would be waiting with the coffee -- and then herr benthien would venture to mention the trap-do or
0	that lasts , adrian said , a long time , maybe as long as the house
0	impudently , deceptively , they imitated the vegetable kingdom : most prettily of all , fern fronds , grasses , the calyxes and corollas of flowers
0	and now give me the enclosures from clara and the pastor
0	he coughed , for the sound of his own voice in the emptiness made him feel unpleasant
0	we must lead the human race up out of the primitive stages of fear and patient stupidity , and set its feet on the path of conscious activity
0	chairs and ice-pails were upset
0	you cut a disgraceful figure , let me tell you , sir
0	i will paint it a little , he said ; and began at once to apply a strong-smelling liquid in generous quantities
0	winter was here again ; and the buddenbrooks began to consider sadly what sort of christmas feast they should have this year
0	she sincerely regretted being obliged to take the view that dr leverktihn 's messenger and representative was also necessarily affected by this change in the situation
0	they crossed the flags at the back , leaving the kitchen on the right , went through a glass door and up two steps into the lovely , scented flower-garden
0	then he turned and , passing through the room , went straight up to clavdia chauchat , who , as he was well aware , was standing near the door of the little salon , watching with a smile the throng round the punchtable
0	she had considerable left from her earlier equipment , but new purchases were necessary to complete it
0	kai worked at his new literary project during this period , and hanno occupied himself wuh conducting , in fancy , an overture with full orchestra
0	they met the guests of the cure , strolling about , young people for the most part : gallants in sporting , without their hats ; white-skirted ladies , also hatless
0	he will insist on absolute cleanliness , and by means of frequent shifting and changes of linen will keep the patient free from bed-sores -- if possible ; in some cases it is not possible
0	but any ass might have cocci , and tubercular bacilli too
0	the explicit order to destroy this letter i did not obey - and who on that ground will condemn a friendship which can claim for itself the description deeply intent used therein of delacroix 's friendship for chopin ?
0	the food is already swallowed , but the muscles -- right here -- they simply refuse
0	they all bowed and exchanged greetings , and naphta took his place beside ferge in the first landau , which now contained four persons , while herr settembrini added himself to the other two in the second carriage
0	how are you forcing him , when it is he who conies to you ?
0	from where they sat at the table they could look between the grey gables of intervening houses at the stars and the slowly moving clouds
0	i was not meant for change and excitement
0	a pair of birds chattered , and the faint rustling of the leaves mingled with the sound of the sea spread out below them
0	i want to forget it
0	and you ought not to steal my thunder like that , either
0	hippe already wore long trousers , and a blue jacket belted in at the back and closed to the throat , the collar of which was usually whitened by a few scales of dandruff
0	he held it to his lips , a reed pipe or little clarinet , and coaxed from it soothing head-tones , one after the other , just as they came , and yet in a pleasing sequence
0	the truth is simply that i fix my eye in advance with fear and dread , yes , with hor- ror on certain things which i shall sooner or later have to tell ; they stand before me and weigh me down , and i try to distribute their weight by referring to them beforehand , of course not com- prehensibly to anybody but myself
0	upon my word , the old man said , i still feel angry with myself that i have never put it into some kind of order
0	since then history has taught me to regard vvith otier eyes our conquerors of that day , who will shortly conquer us again in alli- ance with the revolution of the east
0	yes , let ’ s , he assented , and gazed beyond her , with his blue eyes , his grandfather ’ s musing eyes , in his pale young face , at the antics of the masked patients in salon and writing-room
0	we looked the other way
0	must i say now , or repeat , that with all this correctness things were by no means correct , that they rested on self-
0	as they passed the boulders where morten schwarz-kopf sat , tony nodded to him from a distance , and somebody asked , who is that you are bowing to , tony ?
0	first gr� and the bankruptcy , and then permaneder going out of business -- and then the baby !
0	one jay edelmann bobbed up unexpectedly in pfeiffering , in fact even before the apocalypse was finished ( it was in the weeks of interruption through the
0	dr krokowski ’ s yellow teeth kept gleaming in his beard with every hearty , confidence-inviting smile ; he repeated his wel— come to each arrival , with special fervour in hans castorp ’ s case—who , for his part , said nothing at all , and whose manner was hesitating
0	i ’ ll keep them all and return to them later , perhaps after breakfast
0	she is a married woman , i think you told me ?
0	he lay in the centre of the large , light room , the furniture of which had been removed , amid the white silk linings of his coffin , dressed in white silk , shrouded in white silk , in a thick and stupefying mingling of odours from the tube-roses , violets , roses , and other flowers with which he was surrounded
0	the elders of the family fell in behind , and the younger brought up the rear ; the servants and poor joined in from the hall ; and so they marched , singing with one accord dh , evergreen -- uncle christian sang oh , everblue , and made the children laugh by lifting up his legs like a jumping- ] ack -- through the wide-open , lofty folding doors , and straight into paradise
0	no , of course i knew
0	in particular he recalled the agreeable sensation of being totally lost and abandoned , with which , in the fourth quarter , he gave up the running—he could have laughed at the whole thing
0	please tell me plainly : will my brother be alive to-morrow ?
0	he came to the verses that were to have been prepared for to-day , and called up petersen
0	you will have nothing , or very , very little ; you will be thrown upon your own resources
0	the boundary line between usance and actual dishonesty is extremely hard to draw
0	only let them be calm , they should see
0	it became unbelievably warm
0	but with the real chord , consisting of several notes , it is after all something different
0	long ago it had been herr settembrini who brought sudden illumination into the room , sat down beside the horizontal hans and sought to influence and instruct him upon matters of life and death
0	and he extinguished the last candle
0	the little glass was so full that the bread overflowed and bedewed the plate
0	he had composed a melody which was just the same read forward or backward , and based upon it a fugue which was to be played crab-fashion
0	only a light case , at most
0	but it seems it is not to happen
0	but did you see , joachim went on , and the joy of having fought and won his battle mounted in him and almost took away his breath , did you see how he gave in and showed no more fight , directly he saw i was in earnest ?
0	the courage to recognize and express—that is the quality that makes literature—that is humanism
0	it becomes static , mo- notonous - twice d , three times d , one after the other - the chords do it - dim-dada !
0	one single memory of the sound they made as they plashed against the breakwater could make him oppose an invincible front to all the pains and penalties of-his life
0	he quit his situation in london and started off
0	by little and little his morality and his curiosity approached and overlapped , or had probably always done so ; the pure curiosity of inquiring youth on its travels , which had already brought him pretty close to the forbidden field , what time he tasted the mystery of personality , and for which he had even claimed the justification that it too was almost military in character , in that it did not weakly avoid the forbidden , when it presented itself
0	it is a regular dilemma for the human feelings—i find it more deplorable than i can say
0	but i am bringing with me the arnoldsens ' promise that father , daughter , and married sister will visit us in august , and then you will be obliged to confess that she is the very wife for me
0	they let him stare , and paid no heed
0	any departed person they chose ?
0	he was talking and laughing , anxious to try his skill ; asked on all sides for a pencil , and at length received a stump of a thing , hardly to be held between thumb and forefinger
0	they had talked at length and repeatedly with him , on the subject of his resolve ; also about how he could carry on the service of the cure even after he left the berghof ; about his taking with him and continuing the great encyclopædic task he had set himself , that survey of the masterpieces of belles-lettres , from the point of view of human suffering and its elimination ; finally , about herr settembrini ’ s future lodging , in the house of a petty chandler , as the italian called him
0	the old treadle- box stands here pretty forlorn ; but for all its simpleness it has the meat of the matter in it
0	she bent over as she mounted the stairs , and held up her frock with one beringed hand , while with the other she pressed her tiny handkerchief to her lips and , all stooped as she was , stared up over it into nothing , with great blue , distracted eyes
0	hanno would laugh too , softly but with heart-felt glee ; for those two up there were both of the opinion -- which neither of them expressed -- that the sermon was silly twaddle , and that the real service consisted in that which the pastor and his congregation regarded merely as a devotional accessory : namely , the music
0	but it always seelned as though one were looking at a fairy princeling
0	and last night too , i ’ m sure
0	it , vas at- tended by hosts of people from the region round about
0	i know they gave you a jolt yesterday -- a very , very stimulating jolt eh ?
0	it was so with the elder inan
0	who is playing with us ?
0	you have really heard it already
0	the first letter she wrote , fron brussels , was accompanied by a gift sent to hinl in homage : a ring the like
0	she read the newspaper articles aloud many times in her throaty voice : those same newspapers which at the time of the jubilee had paid tribute to her brother 's merits , now mourned the irreparable loss of his personality
0	he is dreaming , said frau permaneder , moved
0	god himself has implanted in men ’ s breasts the instinct which bids them separate into states
0	you can rely on me
0	hans castorp reflected that if one party did not fire , the other would surely not be able to bring himself to do it either ; and his heart perceptibly lightened
0	fr�ein meyer-de-la-grange lifted her pretty brows and asked : 'the son of consul buddenbrook ?
0	hans castorp thought him well over , with his gift of the gab , his florid harangue on the combination of dullness and disease , and how he , hans castorp , had been taken to task for calling it a dilemma for the human intelligence
0	well , about the skin
0	and good day to you , on his rounds
0	the sparrows on the housetops know that it was involved , heavily involved
0	and she burst into weeping
0	actually he could pray for a war , a revolution , any external con- vulsion just to shock him out of his torpor
0	sirs , is he going to expatiate now upon the purpose and uses of the lewd day-bed ’ ?
0	they have turned to the right -- they are going down broad street !
0	he asked , half- dazed : what did you think ?
0	it did not prevent him from believing stoutly in revelation , nor indeed from being on a very familiar footing '\-vith the devil , if also , of course , the reverse of a cordial one
0	he spoke of the mere appearance of musical notation , and assured us that a l { nowledge- able person could get from one look at the notation a decisive im- pression of the spirit and value of a composition
0	and , by a natural association , hans castorp decided that in the interest of these mental activities of his , and his responsible position as a civilian member of society , he must really—and joachim must too—pay that little man the honour of a visit
0	i see his mother kiss him and , perhaps in the same way as she had done that time with kretschmar in the living-room , lean his head on her shoulder
0	and yet hans castorp did progress
0	ah , no ; you have already played your best card
0	what do you mean ?
0	i am not in love with him , and i would not marry a teacher , anyhow
0	once he had played the role of domingo in an amateur performance of schiller 's don carlos -- this was the culmination of his career
0	even in the matter of the operation he took a business view , for , so long as he lived , that would be his angle of approach
0	all those who saw the encounter trembled hours after
0	you allege that i
0	they broke off at last
0	where greatness and death come together , he declared , there arises an ob jectivity tending to the conventional , which in its majesty leaves the most domineering subjectivity far behind , because therein the merely personal- which had after all been the surmounting of a tradition already brought to its peak - once more outgrew itself , in that it entered into the mythical , the collectively great and supernatural
0	yes , indeed , herr consul , if your wife is satisfied
0	it comes from the bay-window in the right-hand corner , between the verandah door and the bad russian table , at a goodish distance from frau chauchat ’ s place , and almost equally far from hans castorp ’ s
0	the present slope was too steep to ascend directly , so he slanted a little , and went on thus awhile without much heed whither
0	he talked of zu- rich , and of the meeting at the schlaginhaufens ' , of the day in the mountains
0	the bulwark of luxury , her protection against life , threatened to fail the fright- ened woman ; it was already doubtful vvhether they could keep the expensive home on the english garden
0	not to ny entire satisfaction , i may add
0	even before leo ’ s baptism he had , at the father ’ s instigation , found temporary lodgment in the stella matutina , where he was given food for both body and mind ; and had migrated hither with the greatest equanimity , and the callousness of the born aristocrat , leaving his brothers and sisters to the care of the poor guardians and a destiny suited to their lesser gifts
0	now this word genius , although extreme in de- gree , certainly in kind has a noble , harmonious , and humane ring
0	the democratic idea was on the march
0	it would be a great deal truer to say that it rather takes it out of me
0	et c'est tres dommage !
0	now and then a twig would flare up on the christmas-tree ; there would be work to put it out , and shrill , immoderate panic among the ladies
0	it ran now in the direction of davos-platz , some third of the height , and kept a continuous view , between high , sparse , wind-blown pines , of the settlement below , gleaming whitely in the bright air
0	and of young hans ’ s moral state
0	he did not belong to her circle of wealthy merchant families , nor sit at their , tables , nor pay visits to them
0	have you followed me ?
0	he ate scarce a mouthful ; and when the dwarf waitress came to say that his trunks had been strapped , he started up from his chair to take leave of his table-mates
0	nothing for it but that the good joachim must go along
0	takes me to a house in a little back lane behind the main street - brass railing to the steps up to the door - polished as bright as the fellow 's badge , and a lantern over the door , red as
0	moi , tu le remarques bien , je ne parle guère le français
0	the beer , the noodles , the artist who wanted to paint her , and the court coaches had made the greatest impressions
0	if during our year of separation he had not become \ different person , at least he was now more definitely that whictjl he was , and this was enough to ilnpress me , especially since i had probably a little forgotten what he had been
0	we do not know that you may not be made responsible by the most high judge if a man whose feelings you have coldly and obstinately scorned should tres-pass against his own life
0	only the fingers showed beneath the too long , too wide sleeves of his nightgown : one of his hands lay on his breast , the other on the coverlet , with the bent fingers jerking slightly now and then
0	it is at your service
0	i had no hat to take off—
0	and the hofrat skipped away , wiping his eyes behind his glasses with a table-napkin—but whether it was tears or sweat he wiped could not be told
0	but the misery in the side had , if anything , grown worse , and added to tlms was a whole list of other infirmities of which christian kept the closest watch , and which he described in all com-panies , with his nose wrinkled up
0	later on , tony being again urged by the housewife to take something , he said , you can rely on the honey , fraulein buddenbrook ; it is a pure nature product -- one knows what one is eating
0	one must not ask for five legs on a sheep , as we say in business
0	they rould not do other-wise -- i would smash in their window ! '
0	'this lady , i said -- one will say anything at a time like that -- 'the lady of the house , she is not a german
0	the idea of the society is rooted in and inseparably bound up with the absolute
0	there were indeed not many signs that pointed to the true state of the calendar ; and even those there were did not strike the eye
0	for my own , vas simple , i did not need to spend much thought on it , only to ensure by faithful work the postulates for its prescribed solution
0	this man ’ s eyes , so hans castorp one day observed , travelled the same road as his own : they hung upon madame chauchat ’ s lissom person with timid , doglike devotion
0	it must have been used the evening before , and it was strange that papa had not put it back in its leather portfolio and laid it in its special drawer
0	or even a little later to-night , eh , meta ?
0	and she had had ° when she got up that morning— what was she likely to have by afternoon ?
0	he said : yes , i always have them
0	at seven o ’ clock he died ; alfreda schildknecht was in the corridor , the mother and cousin were alone with him
0	madame chauchat too wore a warm belted mantle of some woolly stuff with a pattern of large checks , and a small fur about her shoulders
0	now , tony said , you are going to begin again on the nobility
0	he wore a full , short reddish-blond beard , and he had his mother 's nose , which came down quite flat on the upper lip
0	are you willing to absolve yourself of it ?
0	but after the old masters had had their due , gerda no longer needed to urge him to respond to a more complex demand upon his virtuosity ; with an expression of shame-faced pleasure , he would glide into the weaving harmonies of the leit-motiv
0	the creator of fausti w ebe-klage can , in the previously organized material , unhampered , untroubled by the already given structure , yield himself to subjectivity ; and so this , his technically most rigid work , a work of extreme calculation , is at the same time purely expressive
0	he beckoned to a dining-room girl—it was the dwarf—and though busily engaged , she at once obeyed his weighty summons , and stood , milk jug and coffee-pot in hand , by his chair
0	but , after all , tony felt that his peace and quiet had not suffered any long in-terruption
0	he could say , without stretching the truth , that such a connexion now existed , or was easily induced : he was aware that he felt an emotion to correspond with the action of his heart
0	hanno buddenbrook closed his bible and stretched himself , yawning
0	but why is it just this one that profits by the cunning ?
0	this time it was a duel
0	but , as never before , he began to cling to money and , in his private life , to save in small and petty ways
0	and literally no soul had taken notice of it save settembrini , who strolled over at the end of the meal to exchange a lively greeting
0	counterpoint , my dear lady , counter-point !
0	the people are half moorish
0	i must add that he troubled himself as little about the circumstances of his second bad shot as about the extraordinary atmosphere of his first one
0	there was no doubt that in the future , after we had begun to practise a large-scale elimina- tion of the unfit , the diseased and weak-minded , we would justify the policy by similar hygienic arguments for the purification of society and the race
0	rivolution it has to be
0	but the light of day did not encroach upon its living outline ; rather it looked more substantial and opaque for its background of bright air , only its outer edges were rosily illuminated
0	you know , herr settembrini answered him very deliberately , my opinion of these productions
0	- a certain four-squareness , rhythmical heaviness , immobility , grossierete , which are old-german - en effet , entre nous , one finds them in bach too
0	such a circle of arbiters elegantiarum and society cheer-leaders is usu- ally an assortment of demi-fous excentriques , expended souls and elderly crapules - un impresario , c'est un espece d'infirmier , voila !
0	w f , brahms , and bruckner lived for years in the same town - vienna , that is - but avoided each other the whole time and none of them , so far as i kno\\ ' , ever met the others
0	it certainly gave me a queer feeling in my inside , to hear him
0	they looked up guiltily , expecting the betrayed one to enter
0	we make bold to laugh at the idea
0	you had a right to be called , she said
0	impossible to stop away and await the event in bed , in the first place because—but he did not finish his firstly , but hastened on to secondly , which was that one could not leave the thing to itself
0	yes , someone answered , they had been there once and left the room just as the cousins entered
0	above , behind a glass partition , was a narrow corridor which led to the dining-room
0	and he may have been right in so considering
0	may i venture in make a suggestion ?
0	naphta asserted that sensual gratification was never blameless—nature , he said , always had a bad conscience in respect of the spiritual
0	at his head , in a half-circle of silver cande-labra , stood the pedestal draped in mourning , supporting the marble copy of thorwaldsen 's christ
0	it was as though he were pinched and plagued with hot pincers , without being in immediate danger of his life
0	after the puncture nepomuk fell into a sleep of exhaustion
0	the diminished seventh is right and full of expression at the beginning of ope i i i it corresponds to beethoven 's whole technical niveau , does not it ?
0	i fled from this exaggerated sense of the comic into theology , in the hope that it would give relief to the tickling - only to find there too a perfect legion of ludicrous absurdities
0	you mean , he interrupted , that the early and repeated contact with death developed in you a tendency which made you sensitive to the harshness and crudity , let us say the cynicism , of our everyday , worldly existence
0	individualism was romantic-mediæval , in its conviction of the infinite , the cosmic , importance of the single human being , whence was deduced the doctrine of the immortality of the soul , the geocentric doctrine , and astrology
0	but he will be going to his own place by middle-day
0	the dwarf waitress served them nimbly , and james ordered a bottle of burgundy , which was presented lying in a basket
0	und the world ; one ought to study physics , astronomy ; one ought to acquire a little land and cultivate the soil in the sweat of one 's brow
0	acquaintances he made scarcely any in these early days , nor for a long time afterwards
0	the muscles of the riders ’ backs played beneath the sun-bronzed skin , and their voices were enchanting beyond words as they shouted to each other or to their steeds
0	some of the young girls rose , and peter d�ann insisted on accompanying them up the beach
0	you may well be astonished ; but as for smiling , give me leave to tell you it is out of place
0	and after the senator and his wife , and frau permaneder and erica , had received for long hours the condolences of the entire town , elisabeth buddenbrook , born kroger , was con-signed to earth
0	thus he clung to mother schweigestill , to clementine , to waltpurgis
0	he got up the idea that , so far at least as his own sanatorium was concerned , the summer cure was not only not less to be recommended than the winter one , it was , on the contrary , of great value , really quite indispensable
0	every morning early he appears in broad street , takes the boots frnm before the door , and cleans them below in the court
0	his great adam ’ s apple and his good-natured moustaches worked up and down as he repudiated any lack of respect for the sufferings he had undergone
0	then his uncle sat without mov- ing , his chin resting lightly on the hair of the sleeping child , until one of the women came and fetched him away
0	sometimes the symphonic accompaniment would fade far off and be forgot
0	the tablets and crosses were modest affairs , that must have cost but little
0	they did not , however , think him proud of his achievements ; the trouble was , he was not proud enough , just therein lay his arrogance
0	but the disease makes him ailing within and fevered without ; disease makes men more physical , it leaves them nothing but body—his own thought startled him , and he looked quickly at joachim with a questioning glance , that travelled from the bared body up to the large , gentle black eyes
0	her redblond hair gleamed in the morning sun
0	i can not … once more , renounce her… in vain thou pleadest—and deathly obstinacy and anguished love blend together in a duet of extraordinary power and beauty , but absolutely no hope whatever
0	she had always known , of course , that she should one day marry , and be the wife of a business man , and embark upon a solid and advantageous married life , commensurate with the position of the family and the firm
0	hans castorp , bustling and solitary , sifted and classified it all , and tried a fraction of it upon the instrument
0	inez , that is , espoused the view - i have on occasion heard it from her lips - that pain is an indignity , that it is shameful to suffer
0	but when naphta did the same , he made unaffectedly merry over the sphere which the other represented , and gave hans castorp to understand that the things for which settembrini fought were all of them dead issues ; free-thought and bourgeois enlightenment were the pathetic delusions of yesterday , though prone to the self-deception which made them a laughing-stock : namely , that they were still full of revolutionary life
0	he made a wide , sweeping gesture , and cried : twenty-nine thousand thaler , eighty-seven thousand marks current , for your mother 's house !
0	then i certainly did offend him , hans castorp said fretfully , for it annoyed him to give offence
0	no , this dark tone-poem pernits up to the very end no consolation , appeasement , transfiguration
0	arms akimbo , he stood and said : well , well !
0	such beauty as they had was not of this earth , and made no appeal to the ordinary layman 's human feeling
0	i beg your pardon for speaking of it like this , but they seem very jolly over it themselves , your pneumatic friends
0	hans castorp had seen them in herr albin ’ s room , and against his own convictions , out of sheer compulsion from the prevailing temper , offered to borrow them
0	but one thing i will say : such weirdnesses are exclusively nature 's own affair , and particularly of nature arrogantly tempted by man
0	h , and un- civilized , the leadership was incapable , the air frightful , and the result less than nothing
0	it was apparent that one must not demand consistency of conduct
0	forgetfulness held sway , a blessed hush , the innocence of those places where time is not ; slackness with the best conscience in the world , the very apotheosis of rebuff to the western world and that world ’ s insensate ardour for the deed
0	and it is a fact that he marked no more the loosening and dissolving of the bond which united him to pribislav than he had previously marked its beginnings
0	they say already that the prince will be made regent in time
0	he heard dr krokowski ’ s baritone voice summon him , formally , cheerily , and repeat the request
0	but i think i may fairly claim to have had a personal share , more than once , in the fortunes of the bud-denbrnok family
0	albeit first our friendly hert and good will , trusting and playing that thou maist almost joyfully bear the rod and in tract of time be so holpen thereby , till at the last in braid and buttons thou goest forth as a reserve sergeant inajor
0	the truly musical , in modern , mechanical form , the german soul up to date
0	i think it pleased the childless man to receive a young kinsman in his far too spacious house
0	hans castorp and joachim—the first faster than the second—turned their heads from settembrini to naphta
0	to the frau consul he speaks rather unctuously , to thomas and gerda like a man of the world , and with frau permaneder he is downright jocose , making jokes and gesturing fluently
0	a way we have in the service
0	never , he said solemnly , as if transported , speaking to nobody in particular , have i seen more beautiful hair
0	but at the same time they came to a stop , and the ministrant with the censer knocks , and lifts the latch , and makes way for his superior to enter
0	like something you dreamed in a fever ?
0	it had not been so
0	between the opaque glass walls that divided him on the one side from joachim , on the other from the russian couple , he lay and idly dreamed , his heart pounding , breathing through his mouth
0	they , vho practised this critique were men of education , culture , science
0	the parents , afflicted as they were , sustained the brief colloquy with courteous inquiries as to the state of the cousins ’ health , and other conversational devices
0	he had the feeling that he had been out of touch with yesterday since waking , and had only now picked up the threads again where he laid them down
0	but after all , joachim said , it is rather flabby-minded of you to be so dependent on it
0	i will try to tell you about it , in so far as i can , now that i am secure in the honour of your confidence , and in this altogether exceptional and extraordinary twilight hour
0	his audience rose , pushed back its chairs , and slowly began to move towards the same door , as though converging upon him from all sides , without volition , hesitatingly , yet with one accord , like the throng after the pied piper
0	the back of his chair was against the hall door
0	right-oh , i see , the rigor mortis , hans castorp said blithely
0	we must hold them firmly -- deep within us
0	after a while the chairman , herr dr langhals , spoke in a subdued tone : gentlemen , i think we could come to some agreement if we opened the meeting
0	ball gowns he had seen , stately and ceremonial , cut in conformity with a fashion that exposed far more of the person than this one did , without achieving a jot of its sensational effect
0	it must be more fun to lie in company than alone
0	there was his smile , of course not quite free from coquetry and consciousness of the charm he
0	he had reached the second stage of the melody , by the first starting again at the beginning , having surrendered to the second as the fundamental bass the descriptive ding-clang-dong - and so on
0	we were passing the university , and the conductor , in his felt boots , was standing in front of me to take my ten pfennige and give me my ticket , when the incredible thing happened - at first , like everything entirely unexpected , quite incomprehensible
0	well , summer is over , in so far as there has been a summer , that is—it has really been a sell , like life in general
0	he spoke in the pleasant , conversational tone which he liked to use in the pulpit ; his head a little on one side , a subtle , humorous smile on his pale face , gesturing easily with his free hand
0	seldom has one heard certain things of vivaldi , vieuxtemps and spohr , the c-minor sonata of grieg , even the kreutzer sonata , and compositions by cesar franck , more fault lessly played
0	a thousand pardons for not waiting , ' she said , as she stood up
0	the day , however , was cloudy , inclined to frost and snow , and was to clear only towards evening
0	adrian seemed not to notice
0	there had been a farewell between clavdia chauchat and himself , the surviving member of a severed brotherhood ; a farewell , uttered in the shadow of a tragic renunciation , and followed by her second departure from the berghof
0	he felt disgusted , yet for all that he went on fishing in these troubled waters , quieting his conscience with the assurance that he was only up here on a visit and would soon be leaving
0	the naive expression of her mouth betrayed that the whole of her dignity and importance were a part of a beautiful , childlike , innocent game which she was constantly playing with herself
0	having decided to regard the com- mon chord as the melodic centre of any given key , he called masters the notes belonging to this chord , and the rest or the scale servants
0	naphta suggested that since god , in punishment of our sins , had visited us with the shameful and horrible sentence of bodily corruption , after all it was not such a frightful insult to that same body that it should now and then get a flogging
0	today we see , of course , that it was the mistake of our civilization to have practised all too magnanimously this respect and forbearance
0	privately he received vords of praise or blame , exception , :vas taken , shortcolnings pointed out in french and gernlan ; he said nothing , either way , and anyhow he agreed with no onc
0	no arrangements had been made to fetch the guests ; and frau schvveigestill , whom helene and i sought out in the kitchen , explained to us in no small consternation that adrian had not said a word to prepare her for the invasion
0	a forthright question on the subject could at most have been in place and had any chance of results in the course of a students ' evening jollification , when tongues and brains were loosened and livened by drink
0	hans castorp took in this information with a sprightly , yet half-distraught air
0	i noticed he had gone , he is probably in the rest-cure by now
0	wehsal , who was present , announced that naphta had already expressed himself to the effect that he wanted no doctor
0	i , viii go back to ny room
0	his little deep round eyes began to stray moodily about ; he rubbed his left side with his hand , and seemed to be listening to uncanny sounds within himself
0	it is an idea of mine , an inspiration , the way something comes when you compose
0	i salute you , and your house
0	when you asked me what i thought of marie godeau , i had the answer ready that everybody must like her
0	yes , this was really the right way to put it
0	'you are a man of intellect , i see , said i
0	young schwarzkopf shook his head and laughed cynically
0	from hour to hour it worked changes in him , like to those wrought by time , yet in a way even more striking
0	i tell you , we have been silent more than four years - and now everything is taking the finest , most exquisite , most promising course , and the bell is now half cast
0	there is nothing in the book -- i have no crib -- i have not deceived you -- i have al-ways been honourable -- give me your book , repeated the master , stamping hia foot
0	people hurried past the window , their chins tucked into their turned-up collars ; no one gave a glance into the corner of the little flower-shop , at the two who stood there saying their last farewells
0	for the distinctive feature of his cosmos was that he made god and the devil two distinct persons or principles , with life as a bone of contention between them—which , by the by , was just the way the middle ages had envisaged them
0	but , herr hofrat , why are you so hard on me ?
0	questionable : a capita ] word , i have always ascribed a high philological value to it
0	i am per-fectly convinced that is your secret ideal
0	at four o'clock , when she had stopped watch- ing and almost stopped thinking about her daughter , there was a stir below in the house
0	yet he was so sure he was bringing joy to everybody that there was something contagious about it
0	bitterer , harder to understand , for him who knew and walked beside him than for the devoted one himself , whose knowledge , even though he knew and kept silent , was academic in its nature , was in a way less his own concern than his companion ’ s
0	he had become more and more subject to uncannv delusions and morbid hallucina- tions , until finally his wife had acted upon the advice of a physician and had him put into an institution
0	johann buddenbrook found and greeted his old friend g f koppen , and then kb'ppen 's rival , consul kistenmaker
0	the heart- rending moans and yelling screams began again : the typical hy- drocephalic shriek , against which only the physician , precisely because he kno\\ls it is typical , is tolerably armed
0	take out the roots
0	what suspense , what subterranean activity !
0	should you like to do that ?
0	i know i am silly ; but i have noticed about myself -- and about other peo-ple too -- that we are most likely to get angry and excited in our op-position to some idea when we ourselves are not quite certain of our own position , and are inwardly tempted to take the other side
0	to go on without any marked cresura would be correct , for the subject of the narrative is the same : the outer world , and the history of my departed friend 's con- nection or lack of connection with it
0	they let him be
0	as for krokowski , for all his brain , it was a question whether the technique of wound treatment would be his strong point
0	he sat with his back to the salon , already arrayed in a black coat and light trousers with a pattern of large checks , eating a grilled chop , in the english manner
0	there were even two or three women -- who had probably promised themselves the same millennium as the buddenbrooks ' cook
0	even so it had been a strange moment , and his heart had missed a beat , when one morning at nine o'clock the four-hundred- pound arllloured door had closed behind them and they swayed a , vay from t
0	he has already pronounced judgment—he says i look charming in it
0	where shall i be when i am dead ?
0	when the beach was too stony to go on , they began to climb , and continued upward through the wood until they reached the temple
0	—the beautiful old furniture , hans castorp went on , the pieta out of the fourteenth century , the venetian lustre , the little page in livery—and such a lot of chocolate layer cake , too—he must personally be pretty well off , i should think— herr naphta , settembrini answered , is , personally , as little of a capitalist as i am
0	they were served by a friendly maid in black frock and white apron
0	he paused , and his bony , emaciated face cleared up as be regarded the little theatre
0	the man was of slight proportions , with a grey , hollow-cheeked face
0	yes , you say that as a soldier ; and i must admit the military has an understanding of these matters
0	adrian no longer believed
0	it was pathetic ; and the flabby humanitarianism of it went hand in hand with the wolfish cruelty and baseness of the economic conflict within the bourgeois state
0	after all , he was only thirty-nine years old , and besides , but few of the guests present possessed enough musical knowledge for such an attitude on any rational grounds
0	but , before everything , he must find out his daughter 's real feelings
0	it was indeed a solemn moment when , after early breakfast , the consul led him down into the office and introduced him to herr marcus the confidential clerk , herr havermann the cashier , and the rest of the staff , with all of whom , naturally , he had long been on the best of terms
0	you probably mean : 'in my experience
0	she held her left hand doubled up in a fist near her cheek as she ate , and drew her upper lip back from her long , narrow , rodent-like teeth when she spoke , obviously trying to make an impression of culture and refinement
0	time always did—but more gradually , in the rule , not so strikingly
0	before they separated , hans castorp told them that behrens ’ s order was for joachim to remain in bed at least on the morrow , or until he had come to examine him
0	wild horses could not drag him up here
0	it seems that she gave him all the sweetness of her womanhood , to repay him for what he risked
0	leila , after ten minutes ’ talk , gave signs of fatigue , or rather of over-excitement ; the flush deepened in her cheek , and her forget-me-not eyes glittering disquietingly
0	the imaginative grasp , the brave idealism of his youth was gone
0	he watched frau chauchat going out , gliding along with her head thrust forward
0	not a member was frost-bitten , nothing snapped when he stamped , shook and struck himself , as he did vigorously , all the time seeking to establish the facts of his situation
0	he may die any day— and yet they ’ ve never found even the ghost of a bacillus in his sputum
0	that indignity of corruption , he said , of which naphta spoke , could by its means be redressed
0	the snow-fall was monstrous and immeasurable , it made one realize the extravagant , outlandish nature of the place
0	iwersen made a low , awkward bow ; his wife , continuing to push the little carriage back and forth , looked calmly and observantly at the frau senator with her narrow black eyes , as the lady approached them on her husband 's arm
0	and herr hofrat , how much longer do you think—
0	suppose he did do it , began frau permaneder afresh , and her voice gathered strength
0	what is it you want ?
0	whereat he , with a feverish presence of mind for which he thanked his stars , had responded : pas de quoi , madame
0	naphta , with unexpectedly spontaneous cordiality , expressed the hope that he might have the pleasure of meeting them again
0	he leaned against the wall , now and then contributing a word to the conversation , and for the rest looking out into space across the balustrade
0	he himself had five children , and his brother moritz had four sons and daughters
0	you have been devoting yourself entirely to brandy , eh ?
0	youthful courage , that is the spirit of dying and becoming , the knowledge of death and rebirth
0	the never-ending public in-
0	by this time he was in full swing , and narrated with such gusto , verve , and irresistible drollery that he would have held a large audience spell-bound

0	everything will go off very easily
0	on the steps he met the consul , and his eyebrows went up under the brim of his grey hat
0	the laggard greeted her table-mates with a nod , and took her place on the inner side of the table with her back to the room , next to dr krokowski , who was sitting at the top
0	she had taken up the paper as she spoke , and
0	the general rest-hall was populated by reclining patients , reading , writing , or conversing
0	the queen herself says : in my own france how different !
0	he had the greatest respect for work—though personally he found that he tired easily
0	no talk of getting away
0	next they tired of ordinary photography , the fashion veered to flashlights and colour photography after lumière
0	the daily routine was clearly articulated , carefully organized ; one fell quickly into step and , by yielding oneself to the general drift , was soon proficient
0	the lance-tipped fingers were aloft
0	of course we had always to check our merriment and remenlber that this , vas the narrator 's father we , vere dealing with
0	he that would eat the kernel must crack the nut , le wrote to me , copying kumpf , from the bavarian capital a few weeks later
0	we have a guest who is used to good living
0	he told himself that it was not his regular bed-time ; that during the day he had probably rested too much
0	he blinked rapidly for a bit and then got up
0	i well remember how she once said : hop up !
0	tom was very attentive in helping his sister out , while anton and line hastened up to unfasten the trunk
0	shockingly pale , he had the same red eyes as the rest of the household ; with his mouth firmly shut , he kept mechanically moving his tongue to -and fro inside his lower lip
0	hans castorp remained in ignorance of the hour or day of his cousin ’ s coming , and thus could not receive him at the station when , three days later , he and his mother simply arrived
0	two rows of jewelled buttons sparkled on his black velvet waistcoat
0	furthermore , the sole and only reason zutawski had declined to institute proceedings was that all the world , himself included , was aware that his wife jadwiga had provided him with a complete assortment of horns ; as to the truth of which fact japoll would have found nothing easier than to give evidence ; and that lastly the appearance of the kryloff before a court would have been little edifying for anybody concerned
0	but the experiment \\ras not en- tirely without fruit , for it had put me in touch with the leaders of the artistic life of paris , painters , musicians , writers
0	thomas 's contemp-tuous ill will , which christian bore with quiet indifference , expressed itself in all the trifling situations that dome up be-tween members of a family
0	oh , come along , joachim said
0	the same train brought them as had hans castorp , when years ago , years that had been neither long nor short , but timeless , very eventful yet the sum of nothing , he had first come to this place
0	in the mouth of rosaline and her friends biron falls quite out of his role ; he is no longer biron , but shakespeare in his unhappy affair , vith the dark lady ; and adrian , who had the sonnets , that profoundly extraordinary trio of poet , friend , and beloved , always by him in an english pocket edition , had been from the beginning at pains to assimilate the character of his biron to this particular and favourite dialogue and to give him a music which , in suitable proportion to the burlesquing style of the whole , makes him grave and intellectually considerable , a genuine sacrifice to a shameful passion
0	no doubt of it at all
0	he drew out and opened his book again , all the time apparently wrestling to recover his self-control and staring about the room
0	well , how are you , my dear boy ?
0	it is quite mad to be eating so much cucumber and potato salad with the beer -- my tummy rebels audibly
0	he gave me his hand first , he announced when he looked up and saw me
0	am i not a man ?
0	what fanatical customs , the civilian remarked ; extravagantly emotional he found them
0	yes , he is in the pensee-room looking at the album
0	the built-in structure , projecting between the two black-hung windows , divided the room into two unequal parts
0	and director wulicke said besides , i will spoil all your careers for you
0	then it was shut away ; but he heard it again when , a few minutes later , he was bidden to enter , and behrens presented him to the blonde lady lying there in bed and looking at him with curiosity out of her blue eyes
0	with her , vas her husband , to , vhom the , vire had been sent and he had fetchcd her from suderode : johannes schneide- wein , a tall , tine-looking , sitnple man , vith a blond beard , , viti nepoltiuk 's blue eyes , '\lith the honest and sober speech that ur- sula had early caught from him , whose rhythm we had } { nown in the timbre of echo , our sprite
0	it would disgust me to enter the lists in the sort of rivalry that is too current up here ; otherwise i might reply that my case is far more serious than yours—so much more , in fact , that it is only by artificial means , almost by deliberate self-deception , that i can keep alive the hope of leaving this place and having sight of the world below before i die
0	their voices rose unisono to the blissful sustained note leading into the octave , as they assured each other that now heaven was opening , and the light of its eternity streaming forth before their yearning eyes
0	it was , at that musical time of day and at the young adept 's age , almost inevitable that here and there the influence of gustav mahler should be perceptible
0	they danced in the dining- room and the hall , which had been strewn with talc for the occasion
0	the time in which i write , which must serve me to set down these recollections here in my silence and solitude , this time has a horribly swollen belly , it carries in its womb a national catastrophe compared with which the defeat of those earlier days seems a moderate misfortune , the sensible liquidation of an unsuccessful enterprise
0	thus riedesel esteemed and protected the ballet , and forsooth because it was graceful
0	or , as herr settembrini with literary feeling had put it , a wag
0	he stuffed his down quilt behind his back , and wrote upon the note-paper of the establishment , to the effect that his departure was being delayed beyond the appointed time
0	full sway , repeated peeperkorn
0	through sin no let has been , save when some goode be seen
0	let me explain in what sense this is to be taken
0	herr settembrini , lifting his face toward the sky , had turned himself somewhat side-wise to his opponent
0	she folded her hands in her lap , cast down her eyes , and put her nose in the air
0	in the household she was most intimate with her poor and pious cousin clothilde , whose father had lately died , and whose idea it was to es-tablish herself soon -- which meant to go into a pension some-where with the money and furniture which she had inherited
0	yes , they were all flourishing , thanks
0	i see that it was ill-judged of me to try to set down all the trifling minutire which were the harvest of my observant eye
0	and you want to imitate it , do you ?
0	thus for the space of a moment they stood , he in a posture of commanding rage , tony pale , weepy , and trembling , her damp handkerchief to her mouth
0	he risked nothing by this attitude , being confident that his accomplice would agree to anything he said , no matter how wide of the mark
0	might be higher and still not quite girls ' !
0	there were also , however , some objective grounds for his state , as the cousins had heard : international scandal of a kind only too familiar in the establishment
0	aside from the few oak-trees that had been set out down in the platz , where they had just managed to survive , and long before now had despondently shed their leaves , the whole region held no deciduous trees to give the landscape an autumnal cast ; only the hybrid alpine alder , which renews its soft needles as though they were leaves , showed a wintry baldness
0	you are tired out
0	the coach door was about to be slammed , when tony was overtaken by a sudden impulse
0	but the reader will now understand better certain expressions which i applied to him , that impish naivete or childish devilry in his nature
0	he was in an unsafe position himself and could not hold me , but he gave a yell , and they all took hold of him around the waist and pulled
0	it was the army regulations of the prussian frederick , the exercise-book of the spanish loyola all over again ; it was rigid , it was devout , to the very marrow
0	pairs strolled along the beach , close and confiding , at the maiden ’ s ear the lips of the youth
0	one does not tell a schoolmaster that he has expressed himself well
0	they complement each other , said the heads of the great houses to each other ; consul heneus said it to consul kisten-maker
0	then petersen collapsed , and his face grew grey
0	for a man to take an interest in a woman inwardly diseased had no more sense than—well , than the interest hans castorp had once taken in pribislav hippe
0	still one got the impression that this conservatism was a defence mechanism against certain tensions and dangers in her own nature ; though intellectually she ascribed some importance to these as well
0	miss robinson drank again her brew made of rose-hips , the grand-niece spooned up her yogurt
0	i must go down now
0	but they employed the torture as a judicial instrument
0	it was ages ago that he had first begun to practise here ; independently at first , and early winning a name for himself as an extraordinarily gifted auscultator and skilful surgeon
0	the disciplining of lovableness till it became love : that was what it amounted to ; but at the same time there was more abstnlse matter , about something wherein thought and sense mystically melted into one ; the idea that the contradiction between the frivolity of society and the melancholy untrustworthiness of life in general was resolved in his embrace , the suffering it caused most sweetly avenged
0	dr faustus cloistered life , but ass aye to understand that a secret terror , yarned me not to forsake it , to put the scriptures under the bench and scape into the art to which you introduced me , and about , vhich j f
0	perhaps , indeed , her whole disease consisted in that , and in nothing else—but though lost to view , she was none the less invisibly present to hans castorp ; she was the genius of the place , whom , in an evil hour , an hour unattuned to any simple little ditty of the flat-land , yet one of passing sweetness , he had known and possessed , whose shadowy presentment he now wore next his months-long-labouring heart
0	i only spoke against youth 's discussion of itself in so far as that disintegrates the immediacy of life
0	i must speak with you , without any delay ; i must speak with you
0	do you know your directress already , too ?
0	on this spot the affair should take place , on the third morning , as soon as there should be light enough to see
0	storm , stress , violence -- the tem-pest !
0	i am not sure they are quite honest , but thank god i do not have to look after every kreuzer
0	some choral pieces arc accompanied only by it
0	this hand-in-hand was not like him , it was a change which i saw with emotion , even with pleasure , but yet not quite without anxiety
0	not dangerously , so far as i know , but obstinate , keeps coming back
0	his blushes were superfluous -- nobody saw him
0	come , child ; come here and say how do you do
0	i wish you a pleasant and beneficial stay at the baths , and beg you to greet all the family most heartily for me
0	my dear friend , you have the floor
0	but up here -- here sits mother on one side and tom on the other , looking at him and lifting their eyebrows , and uncle justus gives a start and fairly snorts , the way the krogers do , and pfiffi buddenbrook gives her mother a look , or friederike or henriette , and i feel so morti-fied i want to run out of the room , and it does not seem as if i could marry him -- oh , childie -- it would be munich that you would live in with him
0	why was i more than surprised , namely moved and a little startled ?
0	with the swift-changing years , a spirit began to walk in house berghof : a spirit of immediate descent , or so hans castorp surmised , from that other demon whose baleful name we have spoken
0	he had left off his worsted gloves to-day , and his hands were long and white , marked with blue veins
0	these little worries are not anything
0	i did so at once , inviting those nearest me , mak- ing signs to those farther off , and even bringing myself to clap my hands for silence , that the announcement might be made that dr leverkiihn would now begin his lecture
0	you have read too much hoffmann
0	he heard his cousin get up from his chair and go indoors , probably to show the doctor his curve ; and the conversation seemed to be further prolonged inside the chamber , to judge from the length of time before the assistant appeared , this time from the inside , through his room
0	such events did not disturb him -- they had never disturbed him
0	it is all one—for the reproach of cruelty rests upon somewhat sentimental grounds
0	oh , he got christian 's consent , did tibertius !
0	it was not the sickly and mystagogic figure of beatrice which the poet had celebrated under the name of donna gentil e pietosa ; rather it had been his wife , who represented in the poem the principle of worldly knowledge and practical workaday life
0	meanwhile , however , his health suffered ; less , indeed , through the severity of the noviciate , which was not lacking in physical recreation , than from within
0	for writing well was almost the same as thinking well , and thinking well was the next thing to acting well
0	he also showed me a letter that the man had written to him in the midst of his exacting labours , vherein he expressed with intelligence a sort of anxious enthusi- asm for the object of his pains
0	the riders were men and women , in white woollens , with gay-coloured scarves of all nationalities wound about them
0	a strip of the outer germinal layer , the ectoderm , thickened , folded into a groove , closed itself into a nerve canal , became a spinal column , became the brain
0	an open book , a skull , and in its slender frame the double glass , holding a little sand , taken from eternity , to prolong here , as time , its troubling , solemn , mysterious essence…
0	in oils and in marbles , a humanistic taste would celebrate the glories of the senses—of the sinful body whose flesh it had saved from putrefaction
0	the ladies had not long followed the discussion
0	come have a look—run your experienced eye over him—you ’ ll agree there ’ s nothing for us to do
0	while the hofrat was introducing his new toy to the guests , the young man had remained in the background , not laughing or applauding , but following the performance with tense interest , rubbing an eyebrow round with two fingers , as he had on occasion a way of doing
0	did his eyes deceive him , or was the tapir-faced girl really occupied in sewing on a button for the monocled youth—and , forsooth , on the knee-band of his knickerbockers ?
0	there he stands in the corner , the mock- ing-bird , the make-bate , the malcontent , the sad , bad guest , and can not stand it to see us merry in god with feasting and song
0	the frau consul was convinced that her husband had acted cor-rectly and out of a sense of duty ; but when tony began to talk , she would put up her lovely white hand and say : assez , my child ; i do not like to hear about it
0	do you remember how we used to go back and forth to school together ?
0	it is all philistinism and morality , most certainly it is irreligious
0	i began this record by expressing doubt whether i was the right man for the task
0	for lunacy undoubtedly in many cases meant the kind of self-abandonment which was the refuge of a weak nature against extreme distress , a defence against such overwhelming blows of destiny as it felt itself , when in its right mind , unable to cope with
0	that is true : you have expressed it quite correctly
0	said dr mantelsack , and stared at him sharply through his glasses with his prominent sapphire-blue eyes
0	the stutterer stuck by his summons , his monitions and allurements
0	frau stuht , she who moved in the best circles , had seen the pair , and had remarked at the mbllendorpfs ' , whither she had gone to buy some cast-off clothing , that really mademoiselle buddenbrook was getting to the age where -- and frau senator m�n-dorpf had lightly repeated the story to the consul
0	i ’ ve often asked myself these questions , when i have been thinking quietly alone
0	the sufferer , whether man or woman , is privileged
0	it had been the feeling of life in youth itself that by dint of
0	but she is at the last stage
0	i wo not receive him , you may be sure of that
0	she appears unannounced on the scene , some three heads taller than i am , white-haired and exceeding wroth ; fetches herr anton a couple of boxes on the ear , takes him by the collar , and puts him on the train
0	but , after all , it was not so absolutely cer-tain , beyond a peradventure -- there were exceptions to every rule
0	the old man 's rosy face grew sterner as he opened the seal with one finger , unfolded the thin paper , and gave it a smart rap with the back of his hand as he turned about to catch the light from the candles
0	they were students from the conservatoires , painters , writers , young publishers , also beginning lawyers with an interest in the arts , a fcw actors , members of the leipzig kam- merspiele , under strong literary influence - and so on
0	all this bespoke and beknown , will i now to take leave to play you a little out of the construction which i heard from the lovely instrument of satan and which in part the knowing children sang to me
0	to the pedagogic temperament there is something revolting about that
0	she sobbed once or twice before she answered , hopelessly : oh , no , tom
0	i ca not tell you how pleased i am that they are installing gas for the street-lighting , and the miser-able old oil-lamps are disappearing -- i admit i had a little something to do with that change
0	thus what we call tedium is rather an abnormal shortening of the time consequent upon monotony
0	you do understand me - you could scarcely mistake
0	fränzchen ’ s case , on her arrival , and even after the examination , had been thought a light one
0	i howled like a rhained-up dog ; i felt dread-fully
0	we who were present at the explanation had indeed an uncommonly enriching evening , and this although the sonata un- der discussion was to that date entirely unknown to us
0	it is all perfectly new and astonishing to me—i am free to confess
0	hans castorp walked into his own room in confusion
0	i prefer to annihilate my consciousness at its very centre by introducing my charming little foreign body direct into this interesting organ—herr albin indicated with his index finger a spot on his close-cropped blond pate
0	the tea-kettle was humming
0	she knew that clavdia chauchat was having her portrait painted , and asked hans castorp if he knew it too
0	it is not quite the thing , is it ?
0	that ’ s nothing but a week-end ! —won ’ t pay you to take off your hat
0	three weeks up here was as good as nothing at all ; they had all told him so in the beginning
0	the health of the dear patient , as well as of the infant , is unexception-able
0	the discussion was intermitted only by a visit to the church ; it was in the main a controversy between rudi schwerdtfeger and me over the so- called madness , the incapacity for reigning , the dethronement and legal restraint of ludwig
0	it was like a dry cough , which had of late become almost a habit with her , and had probably to do with her digestive trouble
0	after the examination he confirmed the disposi- tions of his obsequious rural colleague : avoidance of light , head kept cool and bedded high , very gentle handling , alcohol rubs , concentrated nourishment ; it would probably become necessary to give it by a tube through the nose
0	who would have thought it of him ?
0	after the third time , however , the frau senator refrained from reply
0	but it is obvious that you are even more interested in him than in her
0	i , yell know this is at bottom what they mean 'who apply the , vord barbaric to adrian 's creation
0	the invasion of france , long recognized as a pos- sibility , has come , a technical and military feat of the first , or rather of an altogether unique order , prepared with the fullest de- liberation , in which we could the less prevent the enemy since we did not dare concentrate our defence at the single point of land- ing , being uncertain whether or not to regard it as one among many further attacks at points we could not guess
0	all about him was coldness - and how do i feel , using this word , which he himself , in an uncanny connection , once also set down ?
0	and he , as i said , responded with a , vorsening of his impediment amounting a few times almost to a calamity
0	and joachim , with a quick look at his cousin , answered , drawing his heels together as he sat : for half past three
0	after forty years in the service of the buddenbrook family , left it to return to her native west prussia to live out the evening of her life
0	i think i can understand a joke , but you see how your joke was understood
0	the lesson went on
0	they must wait and control themselves
0	oftener there vvas no occasion at all , it was the purest silliness , and i confess that i al- ways had certain difficulties in seconding him
0	she carried in one hand her little lacquered key-basket ; the other was in the pocket of her gown , whose soft folds played about her
0	yes , just now , as we came out
0	the whole affair , each time , took but a second ; one after another , the row of patients received their dosage , in thigh or arm , and turned away
0	take care , if it drips on your skin it will blister
0	the senator followed on the invitation
0	on using his handkerchief he discovered it to be red with blood , but had not enough energy to think about the fact , though he was rather given to worrying over himself and by nature inclined to hypochondria
0	hans castorp said—and he too addressed his companion with the licence of the season , and said thou to him : dear me , you ’ re full of poetry to-night
0	are not we well enough as we are ?
0	ah , it was worth dying for , the enchanted lied !
0	even so , the present enclosure seemed fairly full , both along the wall and in the less desirable inner plots ; one could hardly see or say just where another interment was to take place
0	it seemed he simply could not lay eyes on the hofrat ; either that evening , or in the course of the two following days
0	ich trage meine minne
0	he is the feeling of god
0	then grotthold had come , and josephine had died
0	they took her hand and murmured , with drooping eyes , precisely no more and no less than what on such occasions must be murmured ; while the gentlemen made ready to go down to the carriages
0	raise my spirits , as i reflected that after all only the youthful play- mate and nobody else in the world could be the recipient of such confidences
0	he took his skis and went up on the funicular to the schatzalp ; there , rapt six thousand feet above the sea , he revelled at will on the gleaming slopes of powdery snow—whence , in good weather , there was a view of majestic extent over all the surrounding territory
0	he said himself that he had the pedagogic itch
0	i ’ ll stick a little something in my pocket for second breakfast ; then i shall be independent
0	she had folded her arms again
0	you must see kretschmar soon , it occurred to him to say \
0	the red spots on breast and ab-domen are more numerous
0	she set a steaming cup of cocoa before him , and pushed the bread and butter , salt , and an egg-cup toward his place
0	her manner expressed sheer surprise and umbrage - and that both startled and secretly pleased him
0	peeperkorn made no objection to his neighbours ’ enjoyment , but did not smoke himself—he never had done so
0	good gracious , what a business !
0	his name , so the young people understood , was naphta
0	he had the same rather small round deep-set eyes and the same prominent aquiline nose ; the lines of his face below the cheek-bones showed that it would not always retain its present child-like fulness
0	is there anything more heartfelt , more glorious , he would cry , than such a pro- gression of mere triads ?
0	hans castorp reflected that if that were true , then what about the anonymous and communal—not to mention any other contradiction ?
0	he looked toward the open balcony door , and considered seeking counsel of joachim , but thought better of it and paused again by the table
0	but she had seen the child 's smile , the rhythm of his body , the beloved little head swaying enraptured from side to side -- and the sight had penetrated to the depths of her easily moved nature
0	on a june afternoon , not long after five o'clock , the family were sitting before the portal in the garden , where they had drunk coffee
0	no more did his body lie supine while his ego roved back to a far-off present
0	the fresh milk , and the farm sausages and hams -- one thrives like the cattle and the crops
0	it seemed to him that with his two simple inquiries he had refuted settembrini ’ s whole position , even the republic and the bello stile
0	edgar , said dr mantelsack , closing his note-book with his finger in it
0	even so , it did not come about without angry opposition , bitter reproaches and outcries against the piece as a mockery of art , an expression of nihilism , a crime against music , in short , to use the current and fashionable condemnation , as a specimen of cultural bolshevism
0	but doubtless—am i then to ascribe it to the—what was it you said ? —the pedagogic principles of signor settembrini that you—i beg you not to misunderstand me— not at all , mynheer peeperkorn
0	joachim was for instructing his cousin in the names of the mist-wreathed alpine heights which seemed to enclose the valley on the south , pointing them out in turn with his alpenstock
0	he had been coughing a bit down below , but otherwise quite lively
0	art would like to stop being pretence and play , it would like to become knowledge
0	he addressed his relative as young man , and asked if he was crazy
0	he will undoubtedly come up to ascertain your condition
0	but when he heard his neighbours to right and left conclude their evening cure and re-enter their rooms to exchange the horizontal without for the horizontal within , he gave utterance to the conviction that at least this evening the barbaric pair would keep the peace
0	only a short hour now remained before school would begin
0	it was the re-turn from an unspeakably painful wandering , the correction of a grave mistake , the loosening of chains , the opening of doors -- it put right again a lamentable mischance
0	let us see , now -- let us see -- what sort of offer was it they had made ?
0	and dr krokowski entered it all in his book , just like the tailor ’ s assistant
0	furthermore , joachim was always urging an early withdrawal
0	in the corridor joachim pointed to this and that door and gave the names of the occupants—there were german names , but also all sorts of foreign ones—with brief comments on them and the seriousness of their cases
0	it would have been better to keep still and get a mark
0	if one had to sit up here for ever and a day— !
0	would you like to dance ?
0	then it appeared that herr kistenmaker was not minded to allow any interference in what he considered his prerogative
0	so when echo addressed his uncle for the first time , his words , instead of sounding forward , seelned to be placating and making light of something , loyally reducing it to simple and friendly terms : well , you are glad i did come , yes ?
0	you can expect from me nothing that runs counter to the duties i have to-day assumed ; all other feelings must be silent
0	so much the better if that is true
0	let me do it , he said to them , gently putting them aside ; and they gave way , first because he wore an air of having known all about it for years , and second because they cared little to take their pleasures actively , instead of sitting to be served to as much and such enjoyment as they could comfortably and unbored receive
0	but it was perfectly plain that either he or her mother had let the pastor into the secret
0	in the details of his physical appearance -- the rhin , the nose , and especially the hands , which were wonderfully true to the buddenbrook type -- his likeness to his grandfather was more pronounced than ever
0	and the senator determined not to let any such opportunities pass without improving them
0	for the visitor ’ s first motion , while still on the threshold , had been to turn on the electric light , which filled the room in a trice with vibrating brilliance , and reverberated from the gleaming white ceiling and furniture
0	but the 'senator ' and this house are superficial after all
0	what does wouldead ' mean when the drop displays such a healthy appetite ?
0	i call it that , because in my opinion the unhappiness of the world rests on the disunity of the intellect , the stupidity , the lack of comprehension , which separates its spheres fron each other
0	so this was young joachim ’ s home-coming—for a little after-cure
0	he has consecrated his burgher ’ s pike on the altar of humanity , so that salami may be taxed at the brenner frontier
0	which in my view was an inven- tion of tante 's
0	you lie there on your chips and sawdust , and you bloat ; the gases swell you up , puff you all out , the way frogs do when bad little boys fill them up with air
0	they laughed , glad that he should be pleased to jest and talk poetry
0	the anthers shook out their yellow pollen on the thalamus from the tips of their filaments , the pitted pistil stood stiffly up from the ovaries ; when hans castorp cut through it longitudinally , he could see the narrow channel through which the pollen grains and utricles were floated by the nectar secretion into the ovarian cavity
0	thus ended the continuation of p : drian 's cure by dr zimbalist , after its earlier interruption
0	dr faustus present or dreamed of
0	be happy , you good child , she said , when tony appeared at herr gr� 's buddenbrodks side in the hall
0	joachim sat up straight
0	so novv i copy it down - and i fear that no distant explosions jarring my retreat will be needed to make my hand shake as i write and my letters to be ill-formed
0	halle was , if not a metropolis , at least a large city , with more than two hundred thousand inhabitants
0	moreover it is pure hypochondria
0	no , just as it was , it accurately mirrored his inner state , and that , whatever its simplicity , was full of troubled , involved , dubious , not quite ingenuous thoughts
0	you are not fond of children , antonie
0	it must keep together
0	the softness of his outward seeming , however , contrasted strongly with the actual strength and self-respect of his charac- ter
0	he made a droll picture of a grief-stricken widower on his daily pilgrimage to the graveside , to hold communion with the beloved departed ; and said that the man must have a superfluity of that most precious of human commodities , time ; and further , that the rush of business in a large modern burying-ground must surely dash his atavistic bliss
0	monic powers , to a world of fantastic uncanniness , an ocean of d
0	the pavements were wet and dirty , the grey gables dripped
0	there is something suspicious about music , gentlemen
0	so that , he thought , was directress von mylendonk
0	the consul had hard , nerve-racking days behind him
0	after his first visit , as the old lady with sly reproof betrayed to him , she had , vept a few tears on her tante 's breast
0	( out of print ) past masters and other papers translated by h t lowe-porter
0	then you have already made his acquaintance ?
0	he sat down , as if all were in the best of order
0	i can still see the figures of some of them ; for instance , that of thomas , the ostler , who used to fetch us from weissenfels and bring us back : a one-eyed , ex- traordinarily long and bony man , with a slight hump , on which he used to let little adrian ride ; it was , the meister often told me later , a most practical and comfortable seat
0	jonathan leverkiihn was a man of the best german type , such as one seldom sees now in our towns and cities , certainly not among those who today , often with blatant exaggeration , repre- sent our german manhood
0	you will , herr settembrini persisted , level this reproach in vain , if humanistic pride one day learns to feel as a debasement and disgrace the fact that the intellect is bound up with the body and with nature
0	he might as well have said against whom , but expressed himself impersonally to show how completely unconscious he was of herr settembrini ’ s meaning—a meaning which even joachim perfectly comprehended
0	you never asked me to wait , i did it on my own
0	i wouldn ’ t contradict you , herr settembrini , because you look at the question from a higher point of view , so to speak , as an author
0	yes , this wipes out a lot of things -- not least the affair with that person whose name i do not even like to speak
0	there is both rhyme and reason in what i say , i have made a dream poem of humanity
0	fashion , in his left hand , against his shoulder
0	at last he received from her hands the pressure that meant yes
0	or , to speak literally , by his mama—a very determined lady , i quite took to her
0	i invite you , sir , to take heed to your words
0	herr permaneder f orebore to commit himself on the subject of his departure
0	he had driven hither in his carriage
0	yes , the good , the patient , the upright joachim , so affected to discipline and the service , had been attacked by fits of rebellion , he even questioned the authority of the gaffky scale : the method employed in the laboratory—the lab , as one called it—to ascertain the degree of a patient ’ s infection
0	he tried to say very well , but his voice was inaudible in the clamour behind him
0	father , she said , i understand very well that this affair is a blot on our family history
0	producer at once and urgently claimed our sympathy
0	the date can not be fixed , but it must certainly have been in our early school-days that he ceased to bestow it on me and used only my last name instead , though it would have seemed to me impossibly harsh to do the same
0	whether settembrini had remarked yes , yes , or i see , i see , or both , or merely poveretto !
0	that was all he did ; the rest the drop did itself
0	her brother himself sits there , certainly a little pale
0	hans castorp betook himself to his balcony , his ears full of the hurly-burly and the clashing of arms , as the army of jerusalem and that of babylon , under the dos banderas , came on in battle array , and met each other midst tumult and shoutings
0	the consul said : no , let me do it , gosch
0	still , i may be allowed to indicate the tragic antino- mies of which life is full
0	it must come up , and he must answer ; but was her brother now in a mood to be governed by gentleness and filial piety ?
0	times are not what they were when your grandfather was a prussian army contractor
0	hans castorp felt utterly dumbfounded—involuntarily he slapped the table with his hand
0	he crossed the stream and the narrow-gauge road to the street , with its scattered buildings ; but left this again soon to strike into a meadow path , which went only a short way on the level and then slanted steeply up to the right
0	literally that , and making just such a face ; i have often heard them , and i see now it made an impression on me—which it would not have done , of course , unless it had struck me as strange
0	they shook their fingers at him , they winked maliciously , they put their heads on one side , crooked their forefingers beside their ears and waggled them in a pantomime suggestive of their delight at having found him out , who had played the innocent so long
0	it was so obnox-ious , so incredibly tactless , that i can find no words -- the stupidity called down a sharp snub on you at once
0	not eight hundred even
0	hans castorp was vaguely smiling ; the other ’ s eyes looked sad , beseeching
0	if so be it 's all o'er wi ' kurz then i am fer buddenbrook
0	his distorted lips curled back with the emphasis of the here !
0	gerda had finished her hair for the night and was brushing her big white teeth , using the ivory-backed hand-mirror to see them better
0	in the morning the bathing-master would give a mighty thump on the door and enter—a nervous individual named turnherr , who wore his sleeves rolled up , and had great standing veins upon his forearms , and a gurgling , impeded speech
0	what is it you reproach him with ?
0	it was not easy to understand her rage and terror ; hans castorp did not see at once what she meant , and inquired : well ?
0	passionate—that means to live for the sake of living
0	he felt all the world looking at him expectantly , questioning if he would know how to command prestige for the firm and the family and protect its name
0	he tested hanno 's heart action and measured his chest and his lamentable muscular development
0	i thought you wanted to go down later as a sound man , to be a soldier
0	those were his very words
0	you really mean that ?
0	a missionary comes , and stops the week with us
0	beethoven , then , so we heard , was reputed not to be able to write a fugue ; and now the question was how far this malicious criticism was true
0	on the sixth occasion , when he felt , he divined , an inner voice whispered him , that she was looking , he pretended to be absorbed in disgusted contemplation of a pimply dame who had stopped to talk with the great-aunt
0	madame kethelsen wept softly , but comprehended nothing
0	is not it amusing that music for a long
0	up to a certain period they had been his only trouble in life
0	no , i am no good
0	but they must be up !
0	he had not shed a tear -- which fact rather mortified him
0	he was not capable of consecutive thought
0	the cousins ordered orangeade for the refreshment of their charge and themselves , while frau stöhr took a brandy and sugar
0	but if i may take the occasion to give you the benefit of my poor opinion—sine pecunia , you understand , quite sine pecunia—i would suggest that you do just as your cousin does , while you are up here
0	this distension of the tissues , or turgor , pressed the lymph , after it had nicely swilled out the cells and exchanged matter with them , into the vasa lymphatica , the lymphatic vessels , and so back into the blood again , at the rate of a litre and a half a day
0	my name is , i repeat , grunlich , he said ; from hamburg , i may say by way of introduction that i am a close business friend of herr buddenbrook
0	you have expressed it to a t , herr settembrini
0	this was the lower second form of the real schule , some twenty-five strong , comrades of hanno and kai
0	i rejoiced that i was on the spot to protect adrian ; i should not have liked him to be delivered over alone to this representant
0	she had on a short bodice with high puffed sleeves , that left exposed a flawlessly modelled neck adorned with a spray of diamonds on a satin ribbon
0	i did not care for it when kammersanger kioeielund brayed out sieg- fried 's pretty dull and long-winded smith 's songs so that all the vases and glass-ware in the salon rattled and rang in sympathy
0	i regret to say it escaped my attention , joachim said grumpily
0	on their side , the jewish publishers ' wives and bankers ' ladies looked up to him with the profound admiration of their race for german master- blood and long legs and greatly enjoyed making him presents : the knitted stockings , belts , sweaters , and scarves which he wore were mostly gifts , and not always quite unprompted
0	the arch of the loggia framed a glorious panorama of snow-powdered forest , softly filled passes and ravines , white , sunlit valleys , and radiant blue heavens above all
0	hans castorp might have applied to him with his metaphysical puzzles , if only by way of challenge or in a carping spirit , without any serious expectation of an answer from the humanist , whose concerns and interests , of course , were all of this earth
0	actually , he only told him what the artistic sense of the pupil might have said itsejf , or what it had already told him
0	never mind , my child ; things will all be arranged here , just take what is necessary in a small trunk
0	i shall do nicely now
0	my eyes run over
0	more than once he remonstrated angrily , this constant harping on musical \dlues , my dear , strikes me as rather tasteless and opinionated
0	he lifted his head and tried to say something ; but bubbles of blood welled out between his lips , whose gentle fullness seemed all at once so touching to me ; his eyes rolled and his head fell back with a thud on the bench
0	i-ie begged her pardon for the treason , which he had committed against nobody but himself
0	true above all for the embittered self-castigation of the heart be- cause of its infatuation with the whitely wanton with a velvet brow , with two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes , and again quite particularly for the musical picture of these beloved ac- cursed eyes : a melisma darkly flashing out of the sound of coffi-
0	you don ’ t mean to say it is going to snow now ?
0	in pfeifferilg he had wished not to rec- ognize me
0	echo liked these things , of course , but when he had played vvith them he soon said : 'nuff , and much preferred to have his uncle show and explain some object of grown-up use - alw
0	it was somewhat past the half-hour when the door was opened by the technical assistant to admit the swedish giant and fortune ’ s minion
0	as you see , sir
0	they drove under a heaven thick with stars , and hans castorp , his head tipped back , with pointing forefinger expounded to his uncle-cousin the starry field , named planets by name and showed off this or that constellation
0	herr permaneder had to explain to frau antonie in her turn the reason of his appearance
0	because they were revolting
0	with unerring instinct he divined that this figure was cal- culated to add content to his unsatisfied existence , and he made himself the slave of one who had scarcely ever heard his name
0	mother , i am looking forward to trouble
0	his grandfather had enjoyed playing the flute , and he himself always listened with pleasure to melodies that possessed a graceful charm , a lively swing , or a lender melancholy
0	life was harsh : and business , with its ruthless unsentimenlalily
0	he did not stir , he lay on his back in the narrow yellow wooden bed , the linen of which was extremely thin and soft with age
0	oh , said hans castorp , i know how already
0	i can see , now i look back , that i was always struck by it
0	the corners of thomas 's mouth were drawn down in an expres-sion almost scornful
0	she had been a charming person , to judge from her likenesses , though too large-eyed and asthenic-looking
0	it may not be too late , since christian has decided to give up a professional career , for him to learn much that is valuable from his chief , mr richardson ; may he prosper and find blessing in the mercantile line !
0	he is no longer here ?
0	to-night , perhaps , before we go to bed
0	he preserved a depressed and brooding silence
0	ah , thought i , there lies our charming invalid , obeying the rules of the house , for the sake of an early return to the arms of her waiting husband
0	and there were still nlhrr days , dreamy , blue , wind- less , broodingly warm , when the blue flies buzzed in the sun above the leuchtenfield , and the sea lay silrni and like a mirror , without sir or breath
0	and if we touched upon the further question , whether our readers were clear how much time had passed since the upright joachim , deceased in the interval , had introduced into the conversation the above-quoted phrases about music and time—remarks indicating a certain alchemistical heightening of his nature , which , in its goodness and simplicity , was , of its own unaided power , incapable of any such ideas—we should not have been dismayed to hear that they were not clear
0	his wife thought this very elegant , but also very disgusting -- she had never brought herself to take it instead of her usual breakfast of bread and butter and an egg- tony was in her dressing-gown
0	i believe , on my soul , she looks like netta , old johann said , beaming with pride and pleasure
0	what a shocking pity , my friend !
0	herr albin asked , almost gruffly , and emphasized his energetic speech by shaking his head
0	their movements were quick , agile , and noiseless ; hardly had any one time to be sensible of the pain of the situation , before they had lifted the burden from the bier to their shoulders , and the flower-covered casket swayed away smoothly and with decorum through the pillared hall
0	certainly not for a joke , he repeated , and compressed his
0	he received me in his private office
0	and once in a while the rircu-lation is not what it should be
0	and even 'his sense of personal modesty seemed to be breaking down
0	thus passed tom 's and christian 's boyhood , with no great events to mark its course
0	i must say that gives me to think
0	and yet what all in our time have the police not allowed - again in agreement with the times , which might read- ily , by degrees , allow just such things to happen again now ?
0	outside was the reeking void , the world enwrapped in greywhite cotton-wool , packed to the window-panes in snow and mist
0	her mother , frau permaneder , saw further
0	he wrenched his eyes open , amazed at the depths of the trance in which he had been sunk
0	a peculiarity of this given name was that you were to pronounce it as though it were spelled pschibislav ; and the singularity of the appellation suited the lad ’ s appearance , which did indeed have something exotic about it
0	or , rather , it followed directly from the union , the unity that subsisted between humanity and literature , for the beautiful word begets the beautiful deed
0	the entrance was through a narrow whitewashed corridor opening into the restaurant on the right side , where it smelled of beer and cooking , and thence through a handleless , lockless green door so small and narrow that no one could have supposed such a large room lay behind it
0	thomas used to make cool sarcastic comments and act as if he thought christian was exaggerating or hoaxing -- which was certainly not the case
0	i ask , are they problems ?
0	and you will see , you will succeed with him
0	they were quite ready , and took temporary leave of frau permaneder , expressing the hope of seeing her again when they had finished
0	flushed with pleasure and industry , she ran impetuously down the steps ; gerda and thomas climbed out of the trunk-laden carriage wrapped in their furs ; and she drew them into the house in her embrace
0	we saw tears run down his cheeks and fall on the keyboard , wetting it , as he at- tacked the keys in a strongly dissonant chord
0	it is necessary , in any case , that you should make some new connections
0	y ou want to put me on my honour as a humanist , said i hu- man reason !
0	beneath each dried specimen in his herbarium he carefully inscribed in ornamental lettering the latin name which a humanistic science had gallantly bestowed on it ; added its distinguishing characteristics , and submitted the whole to the approval of the good joachim , who was all admiration
0	cross yourself , like this , forehead to shoulders , the way you learned as a child
0	but seriously speaking , it was chance after all ; for the reason that this whole complex of halle univer- sity life , just as in the earlier case of the i
0	moi , j ’ ai dansé aussi moi !
0	perhaps somebody dropped a little word to madame his mother ; anyhow , she got wind of his goings-on , in baccho et ceteris
0	she promised to bring kulmbacher beer , and did so
0	i know how much you contributed to make her visit in munich pleasant and entertaining
0	he had been taken to the opera as compensation lor a particularly painful visit to herr brncht ; sitting beside his mother , in the dress circle , he had followed breathless a per-formance of fidelia , and since that time he had heard nothing , seen nothing , thought of nothing but opera , and a passion for the theatre filled him and almost kept him sleep-less
0	he contemplated this fact with pleasure ; he enjoyed the reflection that his relation to the femur , or to organic nature generally was now threefold : it was lyrical , it was medical , it was technological ; and all of these , he felt , were one in being human , they were variations of one and the same pressing human concern , they were schools of humanistic thought
0	in one aspect death was a holy , a pensive , a spiritual state , possessed of a certain mournful beauty
0	he wears the stately ruff of the departed and we do him honour in solemn black
0	the & hame that gnaws at us secretly and eats away our self-respect -- that is far , far worse
0	he had gone to the keyboard not out of desire to master it , but out of private curiosity about music itself ; he was entirely lacldng in the gypsy blood of the concert artist , who produced l
0	an of the hundred and forty-four thousand redeemed , filling the heavens with their voices , here the four choral parts simply sing in the same rhythm , while the orchestra adds to and sets against them the richest , most varied and contrasting ones
0	dr faustus i duty of keeping house for her father in her mother 's absence and was likely to be too busy to take over the care of her little brother
0	i have often wanted to ask papa to give in
0	she is seriously ill , without the shadow of a doubt— she has every reason for pessimism
0	i refrain from asking what becomes of the principle of revolt when peace and prosperity have once been brought about
0	no , no , my friend
0	he awoke with the thought in his mind that he must certainly tell joachim of this discovery on the morrow
0	what pains she would have to take to spare me if she had to say no !
0	who says tbou to me ?
0	he talked about the pleasure of driving , the charm of sitting still and being moved along at the same time amid a changing scene ; showed a fatherly interest in hans castorp , even patted the forlorn wehsal ’ s cheek and bade him forget his own unsympathetic ego in admiration of the blithe exterior world , to which the italian pointed with a spacious gesture of his hand in its worn leather glove
0	he began to smoke—it was wonderful , as behrens had said
0	it is indeed a most thought- ful and beautiful gift
0	his business instincts conflicted with his good breeding—the more keenly the more he was aware of the self-confident poise of the institutional life
0	they looked at each other , and smiled ; then , as there remained nothing more to say , they turned , first their shoulders and then their backs , and went
0	then he shut his eyes , lifted his face to the ceiling , and drew , all the time uttering objurgations against the pencil , some horrible inanity upon the paper , in his haste spoiling even this , and running off the paper on to the tablecloth
0	and france , the land of cathedrals , whose head was the all-
0	a peculiarly painful combination that : necessity and futility
0	postage stamps were exchanged
0	so for the first time , with honest admiration , but no trace of shyness , kai entered hanno 's beautiful home
0	no , no , he said let me alone , i ’ m all right , thanks
0	they talked with the children or discussed the unseasonable cold and the new house
0	and jurisprudence—making laws , pronouncing judgment—its main concern is with human beings too
0	your heads are full of fantastic religious humbug -- practical idealism , the july monarchy , and what not : and we old folk are supposed to be wretched cynics
0	his heirs sold the janson matrices in holland to w olffgang dietrich erhardt , of leipzig
0	but -- do not throw yourself away , i tell you
0	i still remember the coffee and the pleasant talk we had last autumn , herr hofrat , he would say
0	the irksome physical conditions that had victim- ized him so long , the catarrh of the stomach , the throat trouble , the tormenting attacks of headache were all gone , his day was his own , and freedom to worl { in it
0	very remarkable to me , even on the second reading , , vas the fact that the style , the travesty or personal adaptation of icumpf 's old-german , prevailed only until the adventure was recounted and then , vas dropped regardless , so that the closing pages are entirely uncoloured by it and show a perfectly modern style
0	oh , morality , and that !
0	it went off with all the proper bourgeois flourishes : ceremonies civil and religious and a wedding dinner in the hotel vier jahreszeiten , after which the young pair left for dresden and the saxon switzerland
0	privately or publicly you all ask it ; only out of good nlanners and for appearance ' sake do you take notice of each other - if you do take notice of each other
0	the preceding easter , he had , by the skin of his teeth and by dint of two extra exam-inations in mathematics and geography , been passed into the fnurth form -- as had likewise his young friend count molln
0	he had supplemented the arrangements with a rented cottage piano always strewn with sheets of music , some written by himself
0	but you will recall , you will remember—gethsemane
0	it ended in herr permaneder 's withdrawing the capi-tal he had in the hop business , so that now herr noppe , in his turn , could strike the and company off his card
0	it was a wonder , she said , that the gentleman rider had lived over the holidays
0	for there was another man
0	with the back interest they come to sixty-eight thousand seven hundred and fifty-five marks and fifteen shillings , an-swered herr kesselmeyer pleasantly
0	no , thomas , the thing was that it filled the cup to overflowing -- and that did not take much , for it was full already , and had been for a long time -- a long time
0	hans castorp would be good enough to go by himself—let him pay his cousin ziemssen a visit
0	she did not live deeply , it is true , into the life or affairs of her new home ; but she breathed the munich air , the air of a great city , full of artists and citizens who habitually did nothing : an air with something about it a little demoralizing , which she sometimes found it hard to take good-humouredly
0	came the eve of departure
0	should it not pause on the sixty , or give some small sign that this was the end of one thing and the beginning of the next ?
0	as you know , marcus has become my partner , in proportion to the quota he has paid in
0	'shall you take your new baschlik ?
0	how procure the truth , out of the mass of circumstance and suspicion ?
0	he expressed himself rather strongly on the subject of this same press , he went on with another cynical laugh , which , for a moment , made a painful impression on tony
0	the pregnancy of seemed rather to increase than to lower her vitality
0	it is the end of all honesty in art
0	they were in the highest degree calculated to stimulate adrian 's penchant for parody , and the thought of dramatizing them musi- cally in condensed form for the puppet theatre occupied him from the day he made their acquaintance
0	yet it looked quite properly warlike , like an old-fashioned foot-soldier , perhaps
0	no , she wears no ring , i have noticed it myself
0	should you like to guess ?
0	he assented to frau ziemssen ’ s withdrawal , but was not minded to be bowed from the scene himself
0	how were things in the world ?
0	perhaps in a larger city he might be , but here everything depends on cliques and personal motives
0	you see , munich -- he pro-nounced the name of hia native city in such a way that one could only guess what he meant -- munich is no commercial town
0	enlightened fanaticism—oh , very good indeed !
0	ler , from central germany , with a flourishing blond moustache , vas a sceptical man of the world , with some means , no great , yorker , hypochondriac , well-read , always smil- ing and blinking rapidly as he talked
0	and the part of my rhyme and here my melancholy with which biron appears on the stage for the prose monologue ( v\lell , she hath one ' my sonnets already ) is one of those which shakespeare addressed to this black and whitely beauty
0	we live in a very pretty square in the town , with a fountain in the middle , like ours at home in the market place , and the house is quite near the town hall
0	no , there would be no exigence , no clumsy pressing of claims
0	tom , she said , her voice quavering , wringing her hands inside her muff , you must give it to us -- lay it out for us -- you will , wo not you ? -- the money for the bond , i mean
0	i stand again to-day at that moment , i return to it , i declare that the period of probation has come to an end
0	i was already tolerably well aware that what is called liberalism—individualism the humanistic conception of citizenship—was the product of the renaissance
0	there was no doubt as to which of the two would finally triumph : it would be the power of enlightenment , the power that made for rational advance and development
0	everyone looked forward eagerly to the activities of these sound people down below—to the sports and races , which it was forbidden to attend , but which numbers of the patients resolved to see , by cutting the rest-cure and slipping out of the berghof
0	your phrase was that the thou had full sway—very good , let ours likewise have full sway , let us give free rein to brotherly feeling
0	then he ran down the narrow corridor and sprang out upon the platform to greet his cousin properly
0	it sounded ridiculous enough , monstrous enough—
0	for instance , he had the old bell-pulls taken out and the house fitted throughout with electric bells
0	pieter peeperkorn lay under the red satin coverlet , in his tricot shirt , as hans castorp had so often seen him
0	he said this not only within himself , his lips formed the words
0	well , we had not got so far by then
0	dr faustus stance , and adrian , who had not spoken for a long time , gave it expression in a few words as we settled down
0	old dr grabow appeared in person , buddenbr ddks looked at the patient with his long , mild face , shook his head , pressed all their hands , and then stood as dr langhals stood
0	dazzled by the light and the unfamiliar look of the room , they marched onre around it , singing , filed past the manger where lay the little wax figure of the christ-child , and then moved to their places and stood silent
0	in other words , to a limited extent and with limited means , he carried on studies ill natural sci- ence , biology , even perhaps in chelnistry and physics , helped out occasionally by my father with material from our laboratory
0	if you will be so good as to follow me , herr gr� murmured
0	the criticism of ornament , convention , and the abstract generality are all the same one
0	he rowed with his little red hands in the air , the fuzz on his head waved up and down , his whole face , with its bristly white beard distorted and grotesque with uncontrolled hilarity -- had grown the colour of cinnamon
0	he scarcely felt the forceps close around his tooth ; but from the grinding sensation in his mouth , and the increasingly painful , really agonizing pressure on his whole head , he was made amply aware that the thing was under way
0	i was just wondering about it
0	breathing heavily , and not quite sure how he got upstairs , hans castorp lay once more in his capital chair upon his loggia ; after this meal there was rest-cure until tea-time—the most important and rigidly adhered-to rest period of the day
0	to become a laughing-stock be-fore her , too -- no , surely he was not called upon to do that
0	instead of complying , he drew his hands away from beneath elly ’ s face , and stood up
0	he looked disturbed and em-barrassed
0	firstly , said he , i will exhibit to you my thanl { fuiness for the courtesy and the friendship , both undeserved by me , ye have vouchsafed in that ye are cle hither into this place , afoot and by wagon , since out of the desolation of this retreat i have tritten to and called you , likewise had you written to and called by my leal famulus and specjal friend , which yet knoweth how to put me in remembrance of our school-days from youth up , since we did study together at halla ; but thereof , and of how high-mind- edness and abominacyon did in that study already begin , more hereafter in my sernni
0	his voice cracked as he spoke , because it was changing , which hanno 's had not yet begun to do
0	he drew out the crib , looked at it with an ex-pression of extreme disgust , as if it were a piece of decaying offal , thrust it into his pocket , and threw the volume of ovid contemptuously back on petersen 's desk
0	are you now resolved in your mind ?
0	yes , six times a day , like the rest of you
0	they are thronging before the town hall , with its ornamental glazed-brick facade , its pointed towers and turrets mounting toward a whitish grey sky , its covered steps supported on outstanding columns , its pointed arcades , through which there is a glimpse of the market place and the fountain
0	answer him if you can !
0	but it was all up with hanno
0	it is a compliment i am paying you , or rather to what you are from god
0	but with the words came so deep a sob that tears rolled out from under his lashes and down his cheeks and wakened him
0	permaneder has certainly behaved very badly , as i will give him to understand pretty clearly -- do not be afraid of that -- as to how he has behaved himself , thomas , she inter-rupted him , raising herself up to lay a hand upon her breast , as far as that goes , i have already given him to understand that -- and not only 'given him to understand , i can trll you !
0	i thank you for having taken trouble for me in these seven months , for having lent a hand to a young donkey in all the new experiences that came to him , and tried to influence him for his good—sine pecunia , of course—partly by means of anecdote and partly in abstractions
0	there was only a dull murmur from the front of the house
0	i ’ ll soon be twenty-four
0	she thought she was uttering the most terrible falsehood
0	do not fancy that you are inclined to profound thought ; the best you can do is to be receptive and to take to heart—i say this in your own interest , as well as in the interest of your country and of europe— what i am about to impress upon you : namely , that in the second place , masonic thought was never unpolitical , at any time—could not be
0	but if i am to be so afraid of julchen mollendorpf and pfiffi buddenbrook as to swallow down all sorts of insults and let myself be cursed out in a drunken dialect that is not even grammar -- to stop with a man in a town where i have to get used to that kind of language and the kind of scenes i saw that night at the top of the stairs -- where i have to forget my origin and my upbringing and everything that i am , and learn to disown it altogether in order to act as if i were satisfied and happy -- that is what / call undignified -- that is what / call scandalous , i tell you !
0	in short , no faint-heartedness !
0	je le crois bien
0	a bitter taste came in his mouth
0	now and then rain-drops spattered the pane
0	no , it was her melancholy nature , seeking unhappiness , which fixed upon him as its object ; upon him froin whom she had heard with dis- gust the words : there are so many unhappy ones !
0	it ’ s coming , just keep it up , let it come , that ’ s the way !
0	it was partly the comfortable cut and durable wool material of his clothing , the broad , solid elegance of his boots , his crotchety expression , and the way in which his red-blond moustache drooped over his mouth
0	i have been up here too long not to know how things go
0	it infallibly reflected the chances of recovery with which the patient had to reckon ; the number of months or years he must still remain could with ease be deduced from it , beginning with the six months that hofrat behrens called a week-end , and ending with the life sentence , which , taken literally , often enough meant very little indeed
0	it comes down to us from a past seething with superstition , in which the idea of humanity had degenerated and deteriorated into sheer caricature ; a past full of fears , in which well-being and harmony were regarded as suspect and emanating from the devil , whereas infirmity was equivalent to a free pass to heaven
0	we ought to read other papers : the konigsberg gazette , or the rhenish gazette ; then we would -- she interrupted herself
0	do you consider love the strongest emotion ?
0	them and simply promised him to carry out his wish , assuring him that i was very much pleased with the enterprise , for him and for all of us
0	it was vain , naphta responded , for herr settembrini to invoke the simplicity of those primitive times , the victorious element which preserved its creative vitality even while endowing that which it conquered with a demonic quality
0	she had spent the time since her father 's death in her room praying almost without ceasing
0	she scolded him , but she was proud to have him express so freely in her presence the views and opinions which she knew he concealed from his parents
0	i lived a long time , oh , a very long time in this house with clavdia—i beg pardon , with the present companion of your travels—before making her acquaintance
0	he had cost his father a huge sum in the course of years , and when consul krbger refused to give him more , the mother , a weak
0	it would be teleological reasoning , as the philosophers express it
0	naphta shrugged his shoulders
0	the window was covered with ice-crystals , and the blind was up in order that the light might come earlier
0	tom , father , grandfather , and all the rest !
0	the phenomenon so freshly called up to him the memory of his dead grandfather that , far from finding it offensive , he took a certain pleasure in availing himself of that remembered and dignified method of supporting the chin , by means of which his grandfather had been wont to control the shaking of his head , and to which the boy had responded with such inward sympathy
0	he stood before her , his weight on one leg , his hands in his trousers pockets
0	i should have been more inclined to a change of air , a sojourn at a cure , which the doctor also sug- gested , without , as we might have expected , being able to per- suade the patient
0	in this company , then , adrian was received on the estate as though he were the lord of the manor come home from abroad
0	poor , lean , grey , patient , hungry clothilde came , submitted to the usual teasing , and drank four cups of coffee , praising everything the while , in her usual friendly drawl
0	there spoke the voice of utter inexperience
0	here was a hidden point of contact
0	their alliance was based on mutual con-sideration , tact , and silence
0	but frau iltis , with a pointed snout , sat by the road-side with something in her hand , which must be her steriletto , but was obviously nothing else than a safety-razor
0	there is egoistic devotion , and there is devoted egoism
0	loss of appetite , sleeplessness , diz- zin ess , and the chills to which he had always been subject forced him several times to call in dr langhals
0	but its spirit - sit venia verbo !
0	reverence for the mystery in general , and personal reverence as well , combine to close my lips or make me chary of , vords when i come to speak of the trans- formation , always in the sign of the d
0	beyond a doubt he was born for conquest ; but i should be afraid of doing him wrong were i to see him from this side alone
0	on her lips rested the mocking , merciless smile with which a young girl measures and rejects a man
0	the reverberating gong , the tam- bourine beloved of the gypsies , the triangle with its open end , sounding brightly under the steel stick ; the cymbals of today , the hollow castanets clacking in the hand
0	i am willing to spend buddenbrook something on it
0	these saine objections , he went on , stoog
0	i think you are very ill-tempered
0	he fairly snorted , but recovered himself immediately , horrified ; coughed , and tried his best to disguise the senseless outbreak
0	all he knew was that she was great-aunt to the young lady who ate yogurt , and lived with her permanently in the sanatorium
0	and accordingly i myself must cease to speak , since in spirit i have turned my back on his deliberately chosen refuge , shared with the silesian , where i had sought him out
0	after a short pause , herr gr� got up
0	the whole seemed to be a direction to go slanting through hans castorp ’ s room , that was to say , through number thirty-four
0	to fill it out , herr permaneder gave a sort of groan , and fol-lowed it up by an exclamation in the broadest of dialect : something that shocked the frau consul because it sounded so like swearing , though it probably was not -- at least , she hoped not !
0	these few sun-days by the sea , during the summer , have not amounted to much , of course
0	and finally , for the third time , fellonia , the priestly chorus proclaims , after noting that radames has again remained absolutely silent
0	he does not need me
0	the thin air would be in a hurly-burly , so whirling full of snow one could not see a hand ’ s breadth before one ’ s face
0	and scowled as before
0	of course , his own grandfather hadn ’ t either
0	good lord , is it still only the first day ?
0	perfectly simple , when you see it like that ; you just have to get the idea
0	after that she had lung trouble and spent some months in a sanatorium in the harz mountains
0	oh , my family , you know , consists of three uncles , a great-uncle and his two sons , who are more like my cousins
0	the young girls—the blooming marusja and the lean consumer of yogurt—cast down their eyes modestly as the doctor spoke
0	is herr von maiboom -- ?
0	and slrunrk and hagenstrom have all the business in their hands anyhow , the broker said morosely , with his elbows sprawled out on the table and his wicked old grey head in his hands
0	timm sat down , proud and beaming , and dr mantelsack gave him a good mark in his book
0	but you can still recall all the scurrile nick- names from the schoole , from your first studies , when you had not put the good boke out of the door and under the bench
0	i assume , continued herr settembrini , in case your stay is prolonged , we shall make the acquaintance of your uncle—i mean your great-uncle—shall we not ?
0	he said , blowing out the smoke
0	it was the music of one who never escaped ; it was , into its most mysterious , inspired , bizarre convolution , in every hollow breath and echo it gave out , characteristic music , music of kaisersaschern
0	dr faustus and my emotion and even at the glory of nature 's magnificence as well
0	do not imagine that i think i could persuade you -- i know i do not know enough
0	he vas leaving next morning , and we said good-bye on the street , as we had hundreds of times before
0	naphta , having been in a manner challenged , straightway girded up his loins , and fell foul of the latin poet , whom settembrini was known to admire to the point of idolatry , even placing him higher than homer , while naphta had more than once expressed contempt for him and for the whole of latin poetry , and did not fail to seize this opportunity to do so again
0	it is true that repeatedly , for extended periods , i lived apart from adrian : during my year of military service , at the end of which i resumed my studies at the university of leipzig and became familiar with his life and circle there
0	by the beginning of june he was back
0	i have seen that already , on the way upstairs
0	the resolution , the redemption , the complete fulfilment -- a chorus of jubilation burst forth , and everything resolved itself in a harmony -- and the harmony , in bwei't ritardando , at once sank into another
0	his eyes rested on her unseeing , for he was in deep thought , and slowly moving his head from side to side
0	these singers male and female whom he heard , he could not see ; their corporeal part abode in america , in milan , vienna , st petersburg
0	pfenstosser orchestr to execute an angelic chorus
0	hard lines came out at the corners of his mouth
0	the crowd began to disperse , in the best of humours
0	c'est ia question , ma tr�ch� demoiselle !
0	pardon , said van riedesel
0	no , he laughed , for the old french i have to use my own eyes
0	but now matters moved more rapidly
0	he saw the pine grove behind and below him , on his right , turned again toward it , and with a quick descent reached the laden trees ; they stood in a wedge-shaped group , a vanguard thrust out from the mist-screened forests above
0	though it might exactly as well be you who should invite us , for you are just as well off as ( we are now
0	a christening -- a christening in broad street !
0	you lucky people , to have travelled so far in the world
0	we ’ re all poor creatures
0	these compositions , as well as the voluntaries he played on sundays at saint mary 's , were flawless , impeccable , full of the relentless , severe logicality of the strcnge satz
0	it visited h , o , and l , then seemed exhausted ; but pulled itself together again and sought out the g , and e , and the r just as they thought
0	he was quite a wit , and loved to play with verbal distinctions , as : you were to make a line , my child , and what have you made ?
0	he overlooked this or that pupil who had brought a book with him into the courtyard to prepare a little at the eleventh hour ; he overlooked the fact that one of his boarding-pupils handed money to the porter , herr schlemiel , and asked him to get some pastry ; he overlooked a small trial of strength between two third-form pupils , which re-sulted in a beating of one by the other , and around which a ring of connoisseurs was quickly formed ; and he overlooked certain sounds behind him which indicated that a pupil who had made himself unpopular by cheating , cowardice , or other weakness was being forcibly escorted to the pump
0	but a next course was unthink-able , after this mighty dish ; and despite the french toast and apple jelly which finished the meal , the reverend guest had to rise hungry from table , while tony tittered , and tom , with fine self-control , lifted one eyebrow
0	yes , of course , she was told ; and she followed frau permaneder up the main staircase , gazing silently at its magnificence
0	i see i have come to the right place ; nobody else here knows how to coin phrases like that—may i be permitted to inquire after the state of your health , frau stöhr ?
0	have this or that
0	they were in their element , whereas the personality was not
0	how can he do that ?
0	but at bottom it was not so much consul buddenbrook himself whose personality fired gosch 's soul to its innermost depths
0	her passionate resist-ance was shattered upon his urgent longing for peace and quiet
0	the children clapped their hands with delight
0	went frau stöhr too , holding her stumpy finger next her stumpy nose
0	look , he interrupted himself , here i am sitting in the sacred seat of number one -- adolf todten-haupt 's place !
0	good heavens , i have asked you that before !
0	they had read it together in the evenings and it ap- pealed to adrian 's sense of the ridiculous , his craving to laugh , yes , to laugh until he cried
0	i sha not be bothered with the kurhouse society , i can tell you that much
0	but i had gone to sleep in the afternoon rest and overslept myself , i hadn ’ t heard the gong and was a quarter of an hour late
0	i will drink , for i am thirsty
0	all the presents made by frau permaneder were decorated with huge satin bows
0	and you will follow his advice ?
0	she had stood on her hind legs , then run howling into the next room and taken refuge under a sofa
0	dear me , you act as if this were the first time in my life that i got a divorce !
0	oh , charming , naphta said
0	he was sure that everybody remembered the day with pleasure , except probably schildknapp , who had overdone himself and was now ill in bed
0	maiboom has to have thirty-five thousand marks cur-rent -- heavens and earth !
0	his chin was dropped , his mouth drawn down , his blue , musing eyes , with the tear ducts plain beneath them , directed toward the distant view
0	oh , the government will have to take it up !
0	frau stöhr sat next it—it made her shudder , so she moved over to joachim ziemssen ’ s other side , in the room of miss robinson , discharged cured , and opposite the schoolmistress , hans castorp ’ s neighbour , still faithful to her post
0	and rolls her eyes up , or else rolls them down
0	those august and inviolate rules !
0	she had grown to be a young lady of an austere and peculiar beauty , with a tall , slender figure , dark , smooth hair , and stern yet dreamy eyes
0	they caressed and comforted her , kissed her on the forehead and sent her to bed
0	to-morrow the little puss will be slinking back—i ’ ve had a dispatch
0	one involun- tarily smiled as one applauded ; schwerdtfeger himself laughed like a boy , wriggling his shoulder in his jacket and making his little grimace with the corner of his mouth
0	an interesting character , brusque to a degree , yet melancholy
0	the change to liquid nourishment was indicated , and behrens sent him to bed , in order to conserve his strength
0	and that is just it : today even , along with the instincts , propaganda is made for claims to all sorts of sanc- tions , and that one too , i mean , it takes them in and trims up the old idealism with the psychology of instinct , so that there arises the dazzling impression of a thicker density of reality
0	and behold , it waa^as though the darkness were rent from betore his eyee , aa if the whole wall of the night parted wide and disclosed an immeasurable , boundless prospect of light
0	and they twain shall be one flesh , he began again : is it not a curious blessing ?
0	they followed his gaze
0	thomas buddenbrook would sit there , and the torture was such that he sometimes softly groaned
0	no unorganic instrumental sound can be compared with it
0	he was a strange yet attractive figure among the citizens of the old city ; still , he belonged among them , for he carried on a small brokerage business in the most modest , respectable sort of way
0	the consul turned to those pages , written in a florid hand on rather coarse paper that was already yellowing with age
0	the book of job falls into three sections
0	for though joachim ’ s were but a companionship in suffering , yet he suffered , as it were , conformably with military etiquette ; even , though unconsciously , to the point of finding satisfaction in the service of the cure , of substituting it for the service down below and making of it an interim profession
0	naphta ’ s malicious wit lay in ambush , to spy out the weaknesses of the naturecompelling forces of progress , and convict its standard-bearers and pioneers of human relapses into the irrational
0	the student rasmussen had grown daily thinner and weaker , he was now bedridden , probably moribund
0	sometimes i have had to borrow money for tooth-powder !
0	right ; that is to say , right in so far as it was a question of the relation between the peoples and the priesthood ; for it was indeed at that time that the mounting consciousness of national honour began to harden itself against hieratical presumption—
0	herr doctor , she said , there is one thing you can do , and i beg you to do it
0	it seemed that in hans castorp ’ s case , the test of the eye confirmed that of the ear in a way to add lustre to science
0	another time tony stood with stina , the cook , in domestic discourse in the entry , when pastor mathias from kannstadt , who was stopping a few days in the house , came back from a walk and rang at the outer door
0	cruel , and thoughtless - anyhow cruelty always comes of thoughtlessness
0	he cried , springing to his feet
0	he wore his usual black alpaca shirt , setting off the pallor of his face ; his elbows rested on the table , in one hand a pen , the other fingering his beard ; while before him lay various papers , probably the documents in reference to the patients to be examined
0	but his re-finement led him to overlook all sorts of small infractions of the rules
0	that 's been my experience , though a short time ago i was too simple to realize it
0	i ’ m not a pimp
0	candidate modersohn was an undersized , insignificant looking man
0	do not call him , my child
0	your path , take care , twill lead you all astray
0	the car stopped , i got on in front and went inside
0	von zutawski and lodygowski , which had not hurt them at all , and which had been regarded in the light of a pleasantry by the bystanders
0	mature , that was the florentine citi- zen of tle renaissance , who before he went to church said to his wife : well , let us now make our bow to popular error !
0	he was aware that weather of this kind was not recognized as bad ; such a conception hardly existed up here , where the most inclement conceivable went unheeded and had no terrors for anyone
0	no need to mention the vermiform appendix , which was a mystery ; in rabbits it was regularly found full of a pulpy substance , of which there was nothing to say as to how it got in or renewed itself
0	their high state of suspense might , one would think , have made the time seem longer to them than it actually was , whereas it shrank to less than a third of its objective length
0	i must arrange everything before it is too late
0	indeed , adrian had repeatedly expressed to me the view that the old distinctions between chamber music and orchestral music are not tenable , and that since the emancipation of colour they merge into one another
0	the consul shot a glance at his wife and then regarded his empty cup , embarrassed
0	and at the thought my heart stands still
0	behrens motioned them into the cabinet , saying : then you must have been more interested in sculpture , originally , than in painting , i should think
0	you could not get used to it
0	as far as the money goes , i am perfectly informed on that subject
0	i already saw with emotion that the decision
0	what a pity he had so little taste for those old records !
0	oh , yes , very energetic , said hans castorp
0	he did not look like a man at the end of the thirties
0	he comes to a fisherman who , by the fineness of his limbs , rec- ognizes that he has no ordinary traveller before him , and the two agree that the utmost isolation is the only fitting thing
0	she smiled as she spoke , and looked at her hus-band with her head on one side
0	i knew it , but i had forgotten
0	herr permaneder accepted this invitation as blithely as he had the one to dinner
0	the round table in the great dining-room was grown very small
0	this consola- tion , true , the n ackedey lacked
0	in god ’ s name , then , let it vary ; that it does so makes it living , makes it human ; it would be a regrettable lack of depth to trouble over the fact
0	what happened was that the pressure at which it was pumped caused a milky extract of it to sweat through the walls of the bloodvessels , and so into the tissues , so that it filled every tiny interstice and cranny , and caused the elastic cell-tissue to distend
0	he sent it to her that she might , if possible , deny it
0	as for my catholic origin , it did of course nluld and influence my inner man
0	he is my son
0	do you know what he does ?
0	the country air did you good
0	he was in gottingen
0	his quiet evenings he spent at home with gerda alone , smoking , listening to her music , or reading with her some book of her selection
0	last spring a formal meeting of the league was called , at barcelona
0	i was out of it
0	i am ill , mamma , damned ill , whimpered christian , his little deep-set eyes darting back and forth , and his big nose looking bigger than ever
0	you have conducted yourself like a vandal , a barbarian
0	it rang for hanno , , and he had received a nod of approbation
0	or how utterly too-too !
0	for the magis- terulus had marked that i was minded to inarry me and was ex- ceeding wroth , sith in the wedded state he saw apostasy from him , and a trick for atonement
0	besides myself , who took care to be free for the occasion , from our circle of acquaintances there was present only our dear jeanette scheurl , , vho despite her narrow means made the journey to frankfurt and reported on the per- formance to her friend at pfeiffering , in her very individual mixed french and bavarian dialect
0	bernard of clairvaux , for instance , preached an order of progress towards perfection quite different from any signor ludovico ever dreamed of
0	and the berghof population agreed with him , to the extent that from the very first night they silently acquiesced in his self-appointed guardianship of the instrument
0	but no less painstakingly did the senator strive to influence his mind and give him lively impressions of the practical world in which he was to live
0	how i love the yearning , the urgent longing , which characterizes it ; the romantic note - since after all it is treated with the strictest of modern devices - thematic , in- deed , but with such considerable variation that actually there are no reprises
0	you know what profound sympathy i feel for him
0	his letter had told me something about his eager and accumulating exercises in counter- point
0	two weeks ago i had gaffky two , a mere nothing , my prospects were the best
0	for m ) t hand trembles in any case , on account of my subject ; it can not nuch matter to me that it trembles a little more due to terror from without
0	at home he declared that jurisprudence was the finest profession there was , and ho thought it would just have suited him
0	if they would only heat the building !
0	and he laid his hand on her head , as scarcely anyone could resist doing
0	i-ie railed about conditions of payment , , vhich he had neglected to observe , and then had been compelled to find another man , well knowing that he never could or would satisfy him - and more of the same
0	yes , yes , that is exactly it
0	he told about the christmas celebration at the club , which had been very jolly , it seemed
0	before aught else , he went on , must i pray ( he said play , corrected it , and then went back again to his mistake ) and beg you not to take it amiss or crosswise that our hound praestigiar , he is called suso but of a truth is named praestigiar , did demean himself so ill and make so hellish a yauling and bauling that you have for my sake undergone stress and strain
0	i sha ' not make this high-falutin scamp of a son any fonder of me by giving him what he asks for , it seems to me
0	far and wide the darkness of the sea was illunlinated by shooting and circling will-o'-the-wisps , caused by the light with which dlany of the creatures were equipped , so that in some cases the entire body vas phosphorescent , while others had a search- light , an electric lantern , with which presumably they not only lighted the darkness of their path , but also attracted their prey
0	but grobleben has not nearly done
0	are not you getting too far ahead ?
0	it takes all that is offered , and bites the hand that feeds it
0	but as he had one day put it to joachim : one begins by being angry and disgusted , and then all at once something quite different enters in , that has nothing to do with moral judgment , and it is all up with your severity ; you are simply not at home to pedagogic influences , however republican , however eloquent
0	the life christian led outside the house , mainly wilh his old schoolmate lawyer gieseke , was observed by the consul with disgust
0	horrible , awful ; never in my life have i imagined there could be such a sickening feeling , outside hell and its torments
0	they asked it teasingly , with that curiously superior and slighting air which grown people assume toward children , as if none of their affairs could possibly be worthy of serious consideration ; but hanno was proof against their questions
0	serenus , said she , it is inevitable , i knovi it , he '\-vill leave me
0	he had a face like a pug dog , and dull brown eyes
0	i thought about it a long time in bed last night , and i had a quite remarkable feeling -- you know how it feels -- � stop chattering , stop chattering , i beg you , interrupted the consul
0	we can not oppose you , for whatever we could say would be only sentiment , not real objections , it is very plain
0	placet experiri , he thought to himself , with a smile
0	his eyelids were usually half drooped , and he had a way of relaxing his lower jaw without opening his mouth , which gave him a flabby , resigned expression like that sometimes seen on the face of a sleeping person
0	ades , which both disguise the yawning void behind them and advertise it by the growing piles of rubble on the pavements
0	later there was supper , and he played a game of chess with his mother , at which neither side won
0	the proprietress of the cow-stalls , a heavy , bold-faced woman buddenbrodk in the forties , came by with a pail of milk and smiled at the gentlemen
0	and now he told us a story which in the most fantastic and suggestive way fitted into the frame of his present theme
0	in valparaiso , too , he had mostly associated with englishmen ; and his whole appearance had something english about it which somehow seemed rather appropriate
0	perhaps there are men who would answer like that , but they are poorspirited creatures—their women wear the breeches , if you will forgive the expression
0	it occurred at a week-end i was spending in pfeiffering , after the siinple meal served us in the big piano-room , when the primly clad young clementine had kindly brought us each our half-litre mug of beer , and we sat smoking zechbauer cigars , light and good
0	though one might have two views of the rôle he played when wrangling was the order of the day
0	but now they seem to have made up their minds to have that too ; and some of it they will get by moving into a house like this one
0	his bows were devoid of military stiffness , and you could not hear his heels click together as he made them
0	even the stairs widened only after the begin- ning of the mezzanine , which lay rather high above the stone entry , so that visitors and buyers - many of these came from abroad , from halle and even leipzig - had not too easy a climb to the goal of their hopes , the instrument warehouse
0	very good , anton , she said
0	i was simply too lazy to turn on the light
0	it became his daily task to console his cousin for the disappointment of missing the manœuvres , which were beginning in these august days
0	but of that which any ordinary person would call love , there was very little to be seen between the pair
0	when the choral was finished , herr pfiihl would slowly lift his fingers from the keyboard , so that only the bass and the fundamental would still be heard , in lingering solemnity ; and after a meaningful pause , the well-modulated voice of pastor pringsheim would rise up from under the sounding-board in the pulpit
0	adrian described the scene to me : the whole house , mother , daughter , gereon , maidservants and menservants , in sheer delight , laughing for pure pleasure , stood about the little man and cou ] d not gaze enough at so much loveliness
0	do you see it ?
0	when i say 'baked potatoes , she screams 'how ?
0	a chastened mood reigned for some time at the old house in meng street after madame gr� and her little daugh-ter returned thither to take up their abode
0	but the calling back of the dead , or the desirability of calling them back , was a ticklish matter , after all
0	by next day joachim lay in his silk dress-shirt , with flowers about him on the coverlet , looking , in the midst of all this white , more beautiful than immediately after death
0	i am not built on a grand scale , as you can see
0	funerals have something very edifying ; i always think one ought to go to a funeral instead of to church when one feels the need of being uplifted
0	it was three in the afternoon
0	but one thing they both felt : in the long second when their eyes met , all constraint , coldness , and misunderstanding melted away
0	yet his face burned
0	poor clothilde , lean and ashen , stood by the bed ; her face was apathetic , and she folded her hands in their -worsted gloves
0	it was an overflowing cornucopia of artistic enjoyment , ranging from grave to gay
0	asked krokowski , putting his head teasingly on one side
0	the coarse creature regaled the table with these repulsive details throughout the brief but hearty meal
0	there was good-natured applause , even from the bridge-tables , which had been set up and occupied by maskers , with bottles in coolers at their sides
0	and on a sudden felt so staunch as to allow myself a ciga- rette
0	why do you suddenly begin talking french ?
0	father , surely you can understand how painful my position is !
0	bookcases lined the walls , full of pamphlets and broadbacked medical works
0	would the gentleman like to see the young lady ?
0	the state of mind of the liltle elisabeth could not be fathomed
0	these circulars—you would like to know what they say ?
0	hans castorp wrenched himself out of a stealing paralysis , and flung himself once more into the breach
0	and he builds her a cloister , here she rules as abbess , but only for a short time
0	we leave marusja out of account
0	but there was no rest
0	hans castorp gave a sudden angry start
0	look , the child sits there listening -- would you then utterly corrupt his soul ?
0	the company had for the most part seated themselves on the chairs and the sofa
0	to delay longer would have been unfair to her , and the answering telegram announcing her arrival followed , vithout a day 's delay as i said , adrian had been told ; but it vas hard to know if he had grasped the news
0	job arm buddenbrook leaned back in his arm-chair quite white , with a fast-beating heart
0	naphta was acrimoniously debating the general tendency which led the humanist to exalt health and cry down and belittle illness
0	i really felt sorry for the baron
0	but he was uncommonly comfortable , he decided , with distinct satisfaction
0	herr settembrini had quite won him over with his plastic theory
0	those gentlemen who come as delegates from any body such as the senate , the board of trade , or the assembly of burgesses , appear in frock coats
0	no , kesselmeyer ; hear me out
0	and when you think we ’ d just finished with it and that the snow only just melted—at least , it seems that way , doesn ’ t it , as though spring were only just over—well , it gives one a turn , i will say
0	the whisperings had run dry , the first tension relaxed
0	my little daughter must not feel that people mean to urge or torment her
0	yet in its service , countered naphta , laboured the whole machinery by means of which the holy office freed the world of undesirable citizens
0	a sec- ond was necessary and inevitable after the way in which marie dismissed him the first time
0	well , my interlocutors did not go so far with their proposals as swift 's scholars
0	there was cordial applause
0	you have duties to your wife and sons -- my son , betsy
0	herr brecht told me lately that all my teeth are in a dreadful condition -- not to mention the ones that have been pulled already
0	i love her : but it crowns my happiness and pride to think that when she becomes mine , our firm will at the same time gain a very considerable in-crease of capital
0	his chin and upper lip were smooth-shaven ; he wore long , drooping side-whiskers , in the english fashion , and these adornments were conspicuously golden-yellow in colour
0	the poor prisoners stood with folded hands
0	she said softly and clearly , but that is the only thing i have refused you
0	but no one stopped the machine
0	subjectively , indeed , it , vas free , entirely so , within an objective restraint so native and incorporate that it was in no way felt as a fetter
0	shadow lay on half its height , but the upper half was bathed in palest rosy light
0	in kai- sersaschern i could have suffered it
0	both speakers treated their theme as of the utmost personal concern ; and both often turned , not to each other but to hans castorp , with argument and exposition , referring to their opponents with a jerk of the head or thumb
0	they arrived before we did , and the car did good service in pfeiffering , going to and fro several times between the little station and hof schweigestill and conveying the guests by groups , such of them , that is , as did not prefer to walk
0	yes , tom , said christian
0	his features were striking , their aristocratic character marred only by a soft , loose-lipped mouth such as i have often noticed among silesians
0	no , persisted hans castorp , with a violence out of proportion to the opposition he met , i insist that a dying man is above any chap that is going about and laughing and earning his living and eating his three meals a day
0	even in the last years of the consul 's life , his wife had more and more sympathized with his spiritual cravings ; and it now became plain that she was determined to honour the memory of her dead by adopting as her own all his pious conceptions
0	there was also frequent cor- respondence , an exchange , i believe every two weeks , between halle and kaisersaschern , about which adrian from time to time informed me and of which i even got to see some part
0	a drop of water always came in the corner of her mouth when she spoke
0	the offer was refused
0	the pupils sat drowsing in the warm room , some of them half asleep , soothed by the purring sound of the gas
0	my cod , ca not the senate just pardon him if it likes ?
0	responded the italian , and fanned himself with his handkerchief , though it was far from warm
0	is not he gettin ' o'erwrought !
0	everybody rushes to the landing , blocks up the doora to the salon , the dining-room , and the smoking-room , and peers down
0	do you think i might sell that instead ?
0	yet it is not allowed to form the end of the letter , rather some remarks about schumann , the romantic movement , chopin , are appended to it , obviously
0	but joachim seemed unaware of any offence in his own remark and went on , asking about matters and things in the berghof , not only without the least touch of condescension , but even rather moved by the home-coming
0	there followed a long prayer of thanksgiving , which the consul re-read with tear-wet eyes
0	long ago i said in these pages that in faustus too that letter symbol , the hetxra-esmeralda figure , first perceived by me , very often gov- erns melody and harmony : that is to say , everywhere \\there there is reference to the bond and the vow , the promise and the blood pact
0	that is just twaddle and the beginning of the end , that is the degenerate conception of the poets of the psalms ; with whom god is already entirely exiled into the sky , and who constantly sing of god in heaven , whereas the pentateuch does not even know it as the seat of the godhead
0	you mean you would mingle your mother 's inheritance with the -- savings of this lady ?
0	it was a pretty clumsy piece of work , i don ’ t flatter myself i hit her off very well , though we had , i suppose , twenty sittings
0	it would be forbidden to him to mix in such serious matters—and moreover , he would probably not have known the answers himself
0	then he carefully deposited it on the wash-hand-stand , and went with his overcoat and rugs into the balcony
0	hans castorp stirred his coffee-cup , though there was nothing in it
0	it looked down at him beneath drooping lids , out of eyes made to appear slanting by a racial variation in the lid-formation
0	i ’ ve dabbled a little in that sort of thing myself , hans castorp explained
0	the senatorial committee was surrounded , its members ' opinion eagerly sought
0	broad street , at midday , was full of life
0	and she said , 'yes , my children , come !
0	madame chauchat almost invariably came late to meals
0	they were the sanest , the homeliest in the world
0	she asked , and gestured with her chin toward the little brd on the left wall , its head close to the door that led into the parents sleeping chamber
0	ate rise out of himselfe , yet never transcend but re- main the same , though raised to his proper stature by the half-
0	he had composed these verses himself , with no little skill , and took much pride in declaiming them , with great attention to rhyme and rhythm
0	will it have sleeves ?
0	the fragrance from the neat beds and borders hung in the evening air , and the fountain , sur-rounded by tall pale purple iris , sent its stream gently plashing heavenward , where the first stars began to gleam
0	about the human skin in general , that you know so well how to paint
0	you must know it , being as much smitten as you are !
0	don ’ t think too much of it
0	they stipulated that , in order to answer yes or no , the glass need not run to the letters , but might give one or two knocks instead
0	yet for sheer pleasure in the idea , for the joy of singing , he forced his voice and sang on , with frequent gasps for breath , until he could no more , and sank , quite out of wind , half blind , with coloured sparks before his eyes and racing pulses , beneath a sturdy pine
0	but then he shut the piano and cried out : oh , fie , fie !
0	then he would be silent -- silent a long time -- while his small deep-set eyes travelled round the room in thought
0	moreover the doctor to whom he went was so small in person that a practice for grown people would obviously not have been suitable and he could only have become a physician for children
0	well , so long—enjoy yourselves !
0	now her husband wrote that her health left much to be desired
0	that is the town air , and the parties
0	what we call mourning for our dead is perhaps not so much grief at not being able to call them back as it is grief at not being able to want to do so
0	it was pieter peeperkorn who first spoke
0	my human powers of intuition told me : it had happened when dr helmut ap- proached her , as man to woman , and began to woo her
0	it took place just as other such which hans castorp had witnessed during his stay up here
0	frau senator m�ndorpf , in paroxysms of laughter , was crying out over and over again : stop , herr d�ann , stop !
0	a hero , he was a hero , cried she , and demanded that the erotica be played at his grave
0	but i hardly think that will make much difference to him -- a great lot of money would not be to his taste -- but -- what was i saying , ida ?
0	how he did love his tiny , warm little study !
0	as if the opposite of life— and we all knew what that was—was likely to be more refined than life itself !
0	it was early upon a magnificent october morning , sunny and fresh
0	for in these cases the two opposing groups of instincts—the compulsive force of love , and the sum of the impulses urging in the other direction , among which he would particularly mention shame and disgust—both exhibited an extraordinary and abnormal height and intensity when measured by the ordinary bourgeois standards ; and the conflict between them which took place in the abysses of the soul prevented the erring instinct from attaining to that safe , sheltered , and civilized state which alone could resolve its difficulties in the prescribed harmonies of the love-life as experienced by the average human being
0	and yet a shudder went through me when di- vined - divined very clearly - that he had made his choice out of { arrogance
0	they jolted along over the great boards and down the shallow steps to the cart-yard with a heavy rumbling noise
0	he is from ham-burg -- an agreeable man , and well recommended , the son of a clergyman
0	again brahms 's first as piece de resistance - again the 'tenth sym- phony ' ?
0	in short , it , vas about inez radde , or rather institoris , and his relations with her , which he could not help
0	he experienced them , as it were ; he did not know them beforehand
0	the cousins resumed their visits to settembrini and naphta and their walks with those two devoted opponents
0	what a con-trast between that relaxed and suffering facr and the elegant , almost military style , of his hair and beard !
0	the man of god , a sturdy cleric of tru
0	when the mas- ter , between twelve and one , demanded something to eat , he found the maids asleep , the food burnt and dried up
0	the fish would nrrlainly be fresh , for the most of them were still alive
0	i can not help feeling astonished at you , tom
0	yes , tom ; such is my firm determination
0	thomas buddenbrook , though still a little pale , was strikingly elegant
0	he was speaking of count strelitz and the landed aristocracy , and he had expressed the view that the producer had a social advantage over the middleman
0	not out of impotence , not out of incapacity to give form
0	russian government official , in some distant province , daghestan , you know , out beyond the caucasus , he was ordered there
0	but i will tell you something : take any general principle or conception of life
0	the thermometer showed a few degrees above freezing , but the snow lay a foot deep , and a completely wintry landscape spread itself before hans castorp ’ s astonished eyes
0	he felt as often after a colloquy with settembrini and naphta , only to a far greater degree : dazed and tipsy , giddy , a-tremble with excitement
0	no failure on the prac- tical side can decrease this pleasure , especially when a good part of it consists in the disappointment
0	you will feel the cold less on account of the dryness of the air and the absence of wind
0	he was slightly thick-set as to figure , but neither fat nor lean
0	there were only two candles left when the elder turned again to his son , whom he could hardly see at the far end of the room
0	our ears are wrapped about by the great mild , ample wind , that comes sweeping untrammelled blandly through space , and gently blunts our senses
0	the spirit of the inventor of the master and servant notes and of musical hymn-recitation moves ghostlike in it
0	hanno buddenbrook was called up and could not do a line
0	i have no time
0	his marriage seemed not to have improved his health
0	so much is clear
0	how can anybody tell who she looks like yet ?
0	the tall white door , with the relief of the singing cupids above it , was scarcely closed for a moment ; there wag a constant vinw from within of the great staircase , upon which the light streamed down from the sky-light far above , and of the stairs themselves , full of guests cither entering or taking their leave
0	hans castorp stopped until far into the night in his balcony above the ensorcelled
0	why , in three weeks
0	gathered in a little group behind mynheer peeperkorn , frau chauchat surrounded by the five gentlemen , they stood and looked into the surging waters
0	if we sit on the benches we can be seen from outside
0	and yet there was something here - that elfin mockery seemed to express a consciousness of it - which put it out of one 's power to believe in time and time 's common work , or its action upon this pure and precious being
0	all the bud-denbrooks wrote a fine , flowing hand ; but these tall straight letters were full of heavy strokes , and many of the words were hastily underlined
0	long , long have i sought after this word , in the place where hippe appeared to me , in my loggia , everywhere
0	do his authorities stand for it ?
0	with all the pleasure in life
0	for then the others were undone , then they were cast in the shade , then they drew in their horns , and peeperkorn came out , grasped the sceptre , arranged , decided , settled
0	no one was here to blow a warning to the rash one—unless , indeed , herr settembrini , with his farewell shout at hans castorp ’ s disappearing back , had been that man
0	tony , he said suddenly , getting up and slapping his hand on the arm of his chair , you are not going to make a scandal !
0	they apologetically conveyed it back to its station , and rebuked the chinaman
0	certainly they could have put it all more simply , but then it would not have been their scientific-theological jargon
0	he ’ ll soon be at his last gasp
0	but unhappily it did turn out to be possible , while in naples last weel { a comnunistic revolt broke out in support of the allies which made that city appear no longer a place worthy of german troops
0	we must keep our tempers
0	his rosy face could not become actually pale ; but it was spotted red and white like a scarlet-fever patient 's
0	as for his natural part , it felt only too much inclined to yield to the confusion which laid hold upon him with his growing fatigue
0	the truly compelling turn in the melody occurs three times , in its modulated second half , the third time in the repetition of the last half-strophe ay , onward , ever onward
0	he seemed unaware that he did this , nor did the other give sign of remarking it
0	way it is with seasickness and sick headache aha , he sonetimes has it pretty bad ?
0	every now and then a tall , smiling white figure seemed to step momentarily out of the tapestry and then back again
0	the same commaunde myselfe would keepe , and me insure my seemely slepe
0	he took the grain distillation between thumb and middle finger , and held it toward the light
0	i have always stuck to that
0	he knew it as veil as i did
0	nor am i for little naphta either , or his religion , that is only a guazzabuglio of god and the devil , good and evil , to the end that the individual soul shall plump into it head first , for the sake of mystic immersion in the universal
0	i vvould send you to her
0	it was six minutes after the half-hour
0	it seems to me i ’ ve been up here a long time—ages
0	the gentleman we met this morning on our walk—at that bench up there—near the—yes , i knew you at once
0	in these years tony buddenbrook visited two mecklenburg estates
0	and then , despite all the caution , cunning , and self-control used to hide such devious vva ) ts from society 's eyes , the will to do so is never , on either side , quite clear or consistent
0	it has even happened that some passage of pure , free beauty stand- ing out from the tense intellectuality of his work has later brought to my mind those days and the experiences we shared
0	herr brecht prepared something at his chest of drawers and got out his instruments
0	dinner was at four o'clock , and hanno , his mother , and fraulein clementine sat down to it
0	his illness was serious , he had a burdensome cough , and made a sound as though he sneezed with his lung , a short , high-pitched , uncanny sound
0	but it had not been realized that it was the office of the neutral party to give the dread sign—at least , it had not been mentioned
0	a little parted beard on his chin wagged up and down as he talked , and above his open lips with the sharp teeth behind them was the little moustache with stiff twisted points
0	and as in the pre-liberal period the possibility of production depends largely on the chance of a mrecenas ?
0	there was a very great failure in the supply of sunshine , an element so important in the cures achieved up here that without it they were distinctly retarded
0	madame chauchat had put on a thin dust-cloak belted in at the back , but wore no hat
0	alj this was pretty awful , and i take it adrian must have thought so too , though his pride prevented him from exposing his teacher
0	for the sake of the inner continuity it would be better , so he said to himself , to bring with him into the new situ- ation a remnant of the old occupation , and only to fix the inward eye on something new when the outward new should have be- come routine
0	we have two friends who are at the house a good deal , both of whom live out here : doctor klaasen , of whom i must tell you more later , and kesselmeyer , the banker , gr� 's intimate friend
0	he bade his housekeeper give them each a cup of coffee , and then dismissed them
0	i bought a pink and put it in my button-hole -- i still have it -- i am taking it with me to amsterdam -- what a heat : how hot and dusty it was on the meadow !
0	it received the enthusiastic approval of a minority and of course some spite- ful and stupid opposition too
0	maybe he shows up on the parade-ground , for aught i know ; but he ’ s no good a ’ being ill will you believe it , he ’ s always wanting to clear out !
0	of this room , therefore , some quarter of the length had been cut off , and turned into a cabinet
0	if it believed itself to be so , it was in error as to its own essential characteristics
0	they knew that the harshness of this moment , when the coffin was laid hold upon by strange hands and borne away from the survivors , must be ameliorated by tact and swiftness
0	schild- knapp distinguished himself by knowing the names of this or that ridge or wall
0	it even produces a certain in- clination to silence , to the extinction of speech ; but schwerdt- feger 's dresden upbringing did not tolerate any pauses
0	in the middle of the night the great bell downstairs rang ; and as christian had come home very late and was not feeling up to much , tom set out alone in the spring rain
0	as for frau stöhr , she danced with her broom , pressing it to her heart and caressing the bristles as though they were a man ’ s hair
0	i must confess further that really i could feel no proper liking to any of the table-round , nor extend to anyone of them a feel- ing of genuine confidence
0	the witch makes her little bitch fast for two days , and then gives it bread spread with mustard to eat , which causes the little animal to shed copious tears
0	apparently his irritation over it was one of the reasons why he would not give his father the satisfaction of wiping out the stain in the person of his son , for he had frustrated the elder 's hope of seeing the younger a member of government
0	the nimble lame man attended to tickets and luggage
0	some day even the story itself will come to an end
0	the thing concerns all of us , and the disgrace will fall on us too ; for weinschenk belongs to the family and eats at our table
0	i hope you do not snppose that i think small of the idea which it pleases you to chew over , in your straw
0	exchange upon the subject of mozart 's polyphony and his rela- tion to bach
0	it was long ago , we were walking round the cow pond , and it was a musical conversation
0	she raised her eyebrows and looked severely through her pince-nez -- which she nnw used for sewing , but never managed to put on straight -- at her knitting-needles
0	why else indeed should he be here ?
0	there is no thematic conception there as god gave it
0	the old dutchmen made her do the rummest sort of tricks , to the glory of god ; and it went harder and harder on her from all one hears , with no sense appeal , excogitated by pure calculation
0	bitter , bitter was the weird of our young man , who had borne out the long waiting only to be gulled at the end
0	thus also on hans castorp ’ s anniversary
0	he had folded his hands across his chest , upon his scanty beard , and laid his head on one side
0	he was pale , and the blue veins stood out on his narrow temples , from which the hair went back in two bays
0	work was for him , in the nature of things , the most estimable attribute of life ; when you came down to it , there was nothing else that was estimable
0	for gerda was taking nothing with her -- she was going away as she had come
0	the preoccupation with music was no doubt due to his mother 's influence ; and it was not surprising that during his early years this influence had been preponderant
0	but he felt the fact need not prevent his offering his respectful sympathy
0	the good , the true , and the just , is that which advantages the state : its safety , its honour , its power form the sole criterion of morality
0	he had caught it , probably , in the rest-cure , and , again probably , in the evening rest-cure—which for almost a week now he had been taking in the balcony , despite the long spell of cold , wet weather

0	in the family , justus krbger was the first to mention the approaching event , on the thursday afternoon ; and frau permaneder saw to it that the venerable leather portfolio was solemnly brought out after dessert was cleared away , and the whole family , by way of foretaste , perused the dates and events in the life of the first johann buddenbrook , hanno 's great-great-grand-father : when he had varioloid and when genuine smallpox , when he fell out of the third-storey window on to the floor of the drying-house , and when he had fever and delirium -- she read all that aloud with pious fervour
0	then she returned to her papa and her cousin , her mental resources being exhausted

0	i shall marry a country gentleman

0	behrens is right , you are certainly a civilian
0	but who then was the orthodox , who the freethinker ?
0	the youth with the voluptuous lips , sitting at frau salomon ’ s feet , turned his head upwards to talk with her , while behind them the thin-haired pianist directed his unchanging gaze down the back of her neck
0	did herr naphta realize what it was he denied and disavowed in the presence of youth , when he flung god and the devil together and in the name of this mad two-inoneness refused to admit the existence of an ethical principle ?
0	insanity , i explained , was an ambiguous conception , used quite arbitrarily by the average man , on the basis of criteria very much open to question
0	in the meantime tony , with the help of the up-holsterer jacobs in fish street , was to make ready the charming little house in broad street , the property of a bachelor whd had moved to hamburg
0	and the eyes said thou , for that is the language of the eyes , even when the tongue uses a more formal address
0	if the guests of the berghof had more generally applied themselves to the same study , the necessity for certain recent rulings would most likely have been obviated
0	on two occasions he refined yet further
0	almost all jews are , very musical , but also she had , though with- out any extensive reading , much purer and more fastidious rela- tions with the german language than the national average , yes , than most of the learned
0	he had his mouth open ; hans castorp knew the words great-great-great were about to issue from it , the sombre syllables which always reminded him of places where one walked with bent head and reverent gait
0	field of honour , you know—slipped away from us , and now he ’ s dead on the field
0	for , he added , it has nothing to do with life
0	the ladies of the sanatorium gave it to me when i was ill with my inflammation of the lungs—
0	all this made of his life , his every word , his every motion , a constant irritating pretence
0	they spoke the words the lord with the fluent authority of early christians , as if they had heard out of the master 's own mouth the words , yet a little while and ye shall see me
0	it goes without saying that i have no idea of turning over adri- an 's manuscript to the printer
0	jonathan leverktihn 's fine old-german head was always a joy to my eyes ; but they rested with no less delight on his wife 's fig- ure , so altogether pleasant it was , so individual and well propor- tioned
0	he turned calmly to herr gr�
0	i : slanderer , i have no connection with you
0	he could no longer work on the sociological pathology ; the league waited in vain for that lexicon of all the masterpieces of letters having human suffering for their central theme
0	johann buddenbrook had himself taken no steps against his untrustworthy son-in-law
0	to get behind it even a little , to look beneath the scanty outward facts to the bottom of this relation , seemed a difficult , but certainly a stimulating task
0	if he met any of his elder pupiki in the streets , late at night or at two or three o'clock in the morning , he would puff up the way he did in the classroom , fetch out a good morning , and let the matter rest there , on both sides
0	but how can we possibly measure anything about which we actually know nothing , not even a single one of its properties ?
0	his clipped white beard was in sharp contrast with his red face

0	the condemned one protested , quite properly , against the sacrifice of the precious life ; but in his tender , despairing no , no , troppo sei bella was the intoxication of final union with her whom he had thought never to see again
0	amusing or dull , whichever you like , responded hans castorp
0	so much the better !
0	joachim indeed , when he stood or sat by his cousin for ten or fifteen minutes—and that happened ten times in the course of the day—would relate whatever there was of interest or variation in the daily life of the community ; and hans castorp ’ s questions , whenever he put any , had been of a general nature
0	then the low sleds would come singly , with long intervals between , around the curves of the white course , that shone metallic between frozen barriers of snow
0	he still retained some of the half-humorous respect he had felt when he first heard about the wonderful novice and lawgiver of music
0	she grasped the hands of her grandson johann and her granddaughter elisabeth , and pro-ceeded through the room
0	a few minutes ago you were at pains to make comprehensible to us a christian individualism based on the dualism of god and the world , and to prove its pre-eminence over all politically determined morality
0	he answered , with an emphasis not quite without theatrical effect : yes , engineer , i take it upon myself
0	even today i thinl { of schwerdtfeger and ask myself whether he actually understood w solitary adrian was , thus how needy and exposed to temptation ; whether he wanted to try his charms - to put it crudely , to get round him
0	but even at the vestibule door he turned again and shook hands violently
0	royal princes are feted , entry follows entry
0	will you have the goodness ?
0	he rose in his place and was about to utter some forlorn and absurd excuse to the effect that he had forgotten to study the lines , when he became aware that the boy ahead of him was offering him his open book
0	there was nothing surprising about that—it was of a piece with its fastidiousness in the matter of corporal punishment
0	there was not a sound but the rustling of the consul 's papers and the falling rain outside
0	down here the fundamental conception is lacking
0	a meeting was called
0	they would bring the conversation round to the subject of coiffures : the frau consul was capable of saying , in the blandest way , that she always wore her hair very simply , whereas it was plain to any one gifted by god with intelligence , and certainly to the misses buddenbrook , that the immutable red-blonde hair under the old lady 's cap could no longer by any stretch be called her hair
0	was it only for this he came ?
0	so they walked and kept silence between them upon all such unseemly natural concerns
0	mother schweigestill 's description of him was amusingly justified by his easy manner and refreshing lightness of touch
0	here he lay , at whom once christiari had flung the reproach that he was too heartless to iveep at h brother 's death
0	when will you be back ?
0	their spirits , particularly the sallow frau magnus ’ s , were proof against any ray of cheer ; forlornity exhaled from her like damp from a cellar ; even more than frau stöhr she represented that unedifying union of dullness and disease , which had offended hans castorp ’ s soul—under correction from herr settembrini
0	the cousins were sitting on a bench at the end of the garden , in front of a semicircle of young firs
0	but the senator sat apparently at ease
0	he would not have listened to it from one of you
0	and seeming to have forgotten rudolf

0	we come out of the dark and go into the dark again , and in between lie the experiences of our life
0	there was another factor which added to clarissa 's emotional confusion
0	the mythological fantasy made me think of the sting or shot-wound of the chrys
0	eat your breakfast , my child , said the frau consul
0	for the moment we need only recall the swift flight of time—even of a quite considerable period of time—which we spend in bed when we are ill all the days are nothing but the same day repeating itself—or rather , since it is always the same day , it is incorrect to speak of repetition ; a continuous present , an identity , an everlastingness—such words as these would better convey the idea
0	you must show what you are made of , herr dieckmann , added the consul
0	a dinner is so soothing
0	you know , there is now and then one among them who does not treat the merchant classes with any great respect , though perfectly aware that he ca not do without them
0	in kitchen and cellar every-thing was tip-top , and he himself was considered a most courteous and tactful host , whose toasts were wittier than the common run
0	the father of all human beings , who had sent a part of himsplf npnn earlh to suffer and bleed for our sins , and who , on ihe final day , would come to judge the quick and the dead ; at whose feet the justified , in the course of the eternity then beginning , would br recompensed for the sorrows they had borne in mis vale of tears , yes , he strove'to subscribe to the whole confused unconvincing story , which required no intelligence , only obedient credulity ; and which , when the last anguish came , would sustain one in a firm and child-like faith -- � but would it , really ?
0	surely he knew the answer to his question ; as surely it could not be put in words
0	hans castorp would think of him when , before very long , it came to an upset in that country
0	both sisters had confidence in ne ; that is , they seemed to consider ine capable of just evaluations of others , a capacity , of course , which , if it is to inspire full confidence , must stand outside any situation and view it with unclouded eye
0	hans castorp asked , inclining his head in answer
0	the principal warks af thomas mann
0	thus for the third time in so short a space and in such young years did death play upon the spirit and senses—but chiefly on the senses—of the lad
0	he half lay , half sat , on the chaise-longue , tying and untying his sailor 's knot , and his eyes , raving aimlessly about , caught sight of an open portfolio on his mother 's nut-wood writing-table
0	if hans castorp wanted to do himself a good turn before he entered his post at tunder and wilms ’ s , what more natural than that he should go up to davos and keep his poor cousin company for a while—it would be agreeable on both sides
0	then the mistress of the house and her guest sat alone in the family living- roon
0	no little reading was done , in the rest-halls and private loggias of the international sanatorium berghof ; largely , however , by the new-comers and short-timers , for the patients of many months ’ or years ’ standing had long learned to kill time without mental effort or means of distraction , by dint of a certain inner virtuosity they came to possess
0	we must proceed to extraction , fraulein , he would say , growing pale
0	and a man-servant would be so useful for errands and so on
0	the senator gave away the bride , supported by christian 's friend senator cieseke , and two school friends of erica 's acted as bridesmaids
0	whoever is in that state can not wish not to be , it would be like wishing not to live , because it has bound itself up with life
0	quite exactly , no metaphors
0	i shall be forgiven for an argument more or less into the blue ; but to call soullessness the yearning for a soul- the yearning of the little sea-maid - that is what i would characterize as barbarism , as inhumanity !
0	it was tante isabeau whom ru- dolf met when he entered the little vestibule of the pension
0	the consul took her hand , bowed to his son-in-law , and moved with her toward the hall door
0	we say wilfully because his eyes were open , he was aware that reason and good sense were against it
0	he knew now tbaf the man in the worsted coat was right , and that thev would , in very truth , begin again where they had left off , and go on to this and that
0	his tiny hands play among the gilt trimmings of his nurse 's waist ; his head , in a lace cap trimmed with pale blue ribbons , lies sidewise on the pillow , turned heedlessly away from the preacher ; he stares out into the room , at all his relatives , with an old , knowing look
0	standing and walking , he rather stuck out his abdomen , which hardly made an athletic impression ; but his bearing at table was beyond cavil
0	young man , kiss this lovely woman good-night , upon her brow , said he to hans castorp
0	dh , do not be embarrassed
0	but they have both in themselves , i retorted ; otherwise they could not have exhibited both of them
0	above her head , over the door , was a transparency , garlanded with evergreen , that said glory to god in the highest
0	no , my dear mother , i am not asking a written answer to this letter , for i am leaving to-morrow
0	but as little as those at home did we understand what that meant
0	but now little johann was no longer small
0	oh , we should never be transplanted , we northern folk !
0	it is not very large , but it is a glacier right enough , the skaletta
0	he had mutton-chop whiskers that looked as though they had been dressed with gold paint
0	she held her stunted figure stiffly erect , tapped vigilantly on the table , cried nally or babby , and subdued mile
0	they are young -- so much the better
0	it was not found among the papers leverkiihn left
0	he accepted the invitation almost before she gave it , with such alacrity that it was plain he had expected it
0	nowadays , when hans castorp relieved his mind , he did not hem and haw , become involved and stick in the middle
0	i dn not understand your tone
0	if they had been put him , he would have tapped his forehead with the tips of his fingers , and most certainly not have known—a phenomenon as disquieting as his incapacity to answer herr settembrini , that long-ago first evening , when the latter had asked him his age
0	that diseases , plagues , epidemics have to do with the position of the stars was to those times an intuitive certainty
0	no , i still have much on my heart about it and about certain of its characteristics , which - of course with undeviating admiration - disturbed and depressed me , or , better put , absorbed my attention even while they disturbed my mind
0	hans castorp started ; looked at joachim , joachim at him
0	lord , herr consul , ye knaw what that is
0	his parents took the little coffin with them , back to their home
0	and joachim ’ s diaphragm rose quivering , as high as it could ; the upper pans of the lungs could be seen to clear up , but the hofrat was not satisfied
0	a key- basket stood beside her
0	i am not de-ceiving you , he repeated , in the greatness of his need
0	naturellement , you think i have in mind your ferocious discipline , and que vous enchalnez votre art dans un systeme de regles inexorables et neo-classiques , forcing it to move in these iron bands - if not with grace , yet with boldness and esprit
0	kesselmeyer , you have sat at my table -- oh , be quiet with your table !
0	that nobility is comprehended in the mind , in the reason , and therefore you will level against me in vain the reproach of christian obscurantism— hans castorp demurred
0	her passion was betting ; she staked against the gentlemen every conceivable object upon every conceivable subject : the weather , the dishes at dinner , the result of the monthly examination , the prescribed length of stay of this or that person , the champions in the skating , sleighing , bob-racing , and skiing competitions , the duration of this or that amour among the guests of the cure , and a hundred other , often quite indifferent or trifling subjects
0	she remained alone with her husband
0	so you have thrown yourself into a career of benevolence ?
0	jealousy -- tnp word meant action : mistaken , crazy , wrong action , perhaps , but at least action , energetic , fearless , and conclusive
0	she is greeting her table—you really ought to look , it is so refreshing to see her !
0	nikolaus , a widower - his rife died young - had up to adrian 's coming lived alone in the house with an old-established house- keeper , frau butze , a maid , and a young italian from brescia , named luca cimabue ( he did actually bear the family name of the thirteenth-century painter of madonnas ) , who was his assist- ant and pupil at the trade of violin-making ; for uncle leverkiihn also made violins
0	for he was by nature and temperament passive , could sit without occupation hours on end , and loved , as we know , to see time spacious before him , and not to have the sense of its passing banished , wiped out or eaten up by prosaic activity
0	he has short , curly blond hair and a smooth- shaven , bony face , with a somewhat theatrical range of ex- pression , from fanatical zeal to an exalted serenity
0	but he knows that that hour , four weeks ago , was a desperate one for mother and child ; and he bends tenderly over gerda , who reclines in an easy-chair in front of him , next his mother , her feet , in patent-leather shoes , crossed before her on a velvet cushion
0	but he disturbed none of the traditional customs of the house
0	they drew obscene pictures on pieces of paper , passed them about , and laughed at them greedily
0	no longer of the youngest , already far on in the fifties , he applied himself to worl { out a musical theory of his own , suited to his special requirements
0	it was hard , clavdia , even for a man phlegmatic in his passions
0	i find that in the last -- degree -- funny !
0	a god invented it , and with its invention civilization began
0	and the senator retorted with scorn , and with threats which he regretted a moment later
0	as if we did not owe to the monks the culture of the soil of all europe !
0	it was not joachim ’ s fault that their glances failed to meet , hers swerved aside
0	but make haste , or we shall get nothing hot to eat
0	that was the expression of dr gieseke -- andreas gieseke , the son of the fire com-missioner and christian 's old schoolmate
0	may i not see my ward ?
0	i have made great mistakes , you know
0	oh , there are a host more such titles in the upper reaches of the knights templars
0	it does one good , among such impressive performances , to con- tribute something oneself to the artistic entertainment , and i was gratified when excellence von riedesel , seconded at once by our long-legged elegant hostess , urged me in his south-german pro- nunciation , and voice made more strident by his officer 's training , to repeat the andante and minuet of milandre ( ) which i had once before played on my seven strings
0	a confused nation , he persisted , and bewildering for the others
0	but now he himself was the object of her visit
0	her person formed the chief subject of conversation on the bourse , at the club , at the theatre , and in society
0	homme gate , endurci comme moi , c'est toujours une experience touchante de rencontrer un grand homm ' c
0	it must be decided to-day -- but what shall i say , ida , when he aska me ?
0	he tried desperately to escape ; knocked into a column with his shoulder—and found himself , with the sound of that dreadful whispered brawling still in his ears , still wrapped in the cold horror of it , lying by his hut , in the snow , leaning against one arm , with his head upon it , his legs in their skis stretched out before him
0	it is , by god 's will , a daughter ; i can find no words to express my joyful emotion
0	i had my suspicions—i can tell you now—from the first day i had the undeserved honour of making your acquaintance ; i made a pretty shrewd guess that you were one of us and that you would find it out , like many another who has come up here on a lark and gone about with his nose in the air , only to discover , one fine day , that it would be as well for him—and not only as well , mark that—to make a more extended stay , quite without reference to the beauties of the scenery
0	i must dwell a little on this i point , and the sweeping gesture ac- companying it , this putting at the disposal of
0	but from this your school deduces in the first instance the right of the people to revolt from the monarchy
0	he did not buddenbrook look like the semmlingers , having a yellow face and pointed teeth with wide spaces between
0	he ’ s even austere ; he makes one feel rather uncomfortable , as if you were—well , shall i say as if you were being taken to task ?
0	once , at a certain critical juncture now far in the past , he had made its action serve him for an allegory
0	thomas buddenbrodk took a solitary early breakfast in bis pretty dining-room
0	he was unusually pale , of a translucent , yes , phosphorescent pallor , that was further accentuated by the dark ardour of his eyes , the blackness of his brows , and his rather long , full whisker , which ended in two points and already showed some white threads
0	thomas buddenbrook would sit at his desk and watch until he saw his wife 's friend enter the house
0	as they went along the corridor , hans castorp saw , beside two of the white-enamelled , numbered doors , certain curious , swollen-looking , balloonshaped vessels with short necks
0	for a long , dreadful minute she lay among the pillows as if stunned , as if paralysed
0	he made the duty calls which his position demanded ; but the buddenbrook house was the only one at which he visited -- too much , people thought , and the senator himself thought so too
0	and hans castorp took in a deep , experimental breath of the strange air
0	now , for a change , he was going downhill , with the wind in his face , when , at some distance before him , and seeming to hang in the driving wind and mist , he saw the faint outline of a human habitation
0	like that , he said , and gave his place to hans castorp , who assumed the same position
0	he remained the rest of the day in this condition , this heavy lethargy and intoxication , overpowered by the heady draught he had drunk , incapable of thought
0	how often had naphta not stood for instinct , what time settembrini called nature a blind force , mere factum et fatum , before which reason and human pride must never abdicate !
0	with tony and gerda here we ca not really talk -- but i have already told you i have responsibilities -- the last child , little gisela -- i know nothing about any little gisela -- and i do not care to
0	we have been waiting nearly half an hour already
0	he stood before her and found no words
0	hans castorp saw clavdia ’ s traveling-companion as he lay under the red satin coverlet , in his collarless woollen shirt , half ancient ouvrier , half royal bust
0	very good , said the master , when he had finished
0	you know i should not make a good bachelor
0	christian appeared not to notice the growing dislike of the head of the firm
0	we need not pity him , for was it not all his own doing ?
0	in the salon she looked thirstily at a long-legged , sunken-chested gallant , who described himself on his visiting-card as aviateur diplomé et enseigne de la marine allemande
0	i shall do well to leave the word entirely to him , since whatever adrian or i interpolated or replied played scarcely any role
0	he shows good taste , does not he , this canting money-grabber ?
0	if you bring me that much back , that the thought of shar- ing my life with me is not utterly repugnant to her , not exactly monstrous - then my turn will come and i will speak 'with her and her aunt myself
0	cer- tainly specimens of the race have also crossed my path - i need only think of the private scholar breisacher in munich , on whose dismayingly unsympathetic character i propose in the proper place to cast some light
0	adrian spoke of the itch one felt to expose the unexposed , to look at the unlooked-at , the not-to-be and not-expecting-to-be looked-at
0	what i meant to ask you , he began , the case in my room had died just before i got here ; have there been many deaths , since you came ?
0	in uninter- rupted application he provided with musical settings all the poems in the mount of incense , some of them with two or three , and set to music all the hymns he had himself ever written , as well as a great many by his pupils
0	but the broad mantle of civic respectability concealed this side of their life
0	little johann said he would
0	la conférence de m krokowski vient de commencer
0	monkey , little , merry fellow , thou art nature 's punuhinellu there were endless verses -- kassbaum read them , quite simply , out of his book
0	you mean he is pedantic
0	i do not know whether any of you have that feeling
0	it was the same with satan himself
0	on the contrary , i am pitiful of that i make mine own , and ye may see in that an homage , a declaration of love for music , a special position towards her , that in her case i should feel quite too deeply pitiful
0	my cousin and i were talking about it lately
0	then he sipped his sweet wine gingerly and listened to uncle christian , who had begun to talk
0	and so once more the patient } s familiar sur- roundings received him
0	how incapable he was of not keeping it !
0	the noble foam bedewed the cloth
0	the suits he made for the young masters buddenbrook were at the combined cost of seventy marks ; but at the boys ' request he had consented to put them down in the bill at eighty marks and to hand them the difference
0	'they have got at the silver , wunderlich !
0	if you knew the girl and the spirit of our bond , then you would know that there is no need to fear for my peace of mind , but that on the contrary everything is directed towards the foundation of love and tranquillity , a fixed and undisturbed hap- piness
0	what shall i take , papa ?
0	that first utterance which the society of a catholic theologian had tempted from him was—however comparative and analytical in form—in substance a declaration of affection for the roman church , as a power at once spiritual and aristocratic ( in other words anti-material ) , at once superior and inimical to worldly things ( in other words , revolutionary )
0	settembrini spoke of his grandfather , a milanese lawyer , but even more a patriot ; with something of the political agitator , and orator and journalist to boot
0	but he paid no heed
0	adrian might be cer- tain that elsbeth leverkiihn bore this loss with the same quiet resignation , the same understanding acceptance of the human lot , as lvlother schvveigestill showed
0	i have referred to his feeling of independence
0	schildknapp , with a reflective head-shake , even thought that one ought to set- tle down and live here ; but frau sch\\leigestill had her doubts whether it would not be too lonely for a writer , too far fronl life and culture
0	the place above in the left lobe is no longer worth talking about
0	shaving had grown burdensome to him , for some eight or ten days it had not been done , and he had now a strong growth of beard , setting off with a black frame his waxen face and gentle eyes
0	we were lewd enough , i do assure you ; but too high-brow too , as they say in english
0	the younger children were mentioned , and the consul spoke of them with easy satisfaction , shrugging his shoulders
0	she swept him with an astonished and deeply offended glance
0	he had left his uniform at home , of course
0	at the most he would have allowed it to suggest itself afar off , in some subtly disguised , almost ilnperceptible way
0	madame antoinette buddenbrook , born duchamps , tittered in precisely the same way as her husband
0	now , as then , it mortified hans castorp
0	a catarrhal condition due to alcoholism—and from what i can see he is threatened with tropical fever , malignant , intermittent , you know ; protracted , obstinate
0	later , perhaps , a certain sinister but strong desire of his , since gratified , had sharpened it the more and confirmed it in its general tendency to question and to carp
0	asked the pilot-captain , as tony and morten both rose from table and were about to take their leave
0	but , if you will permit me to say so , i can hardly subscribe to your deductions ; i must deny them ; my position is one of absolute dissent
0	never had i felt more strongly the advantage that music , which says nothing and everything , has over the unequivocal word ; yes , the saving irresponsibility of all art , compared with the bareness and baldness of unmediated revelation
0	the great man ’ s face was yellow , the eyes pale beneath the forehead ’ s heavy folds , a bitter expression sat on the wounded lips
0	so behrens brought him up with a round turn : do me the favour not to behave like that , he said to him ; and the patient became quite calm and died as quietly as you please
0	the experienced frau permaneder made several energetic attempts to get into touch with him , in order , as she importantly explained , to get evidence upon which to sue him for divorce on the ground of wilful desertion
0	hans castorp raised his arms , to signify that there was so much written , on both sides , it was hard to know the rights of it
0	in a civil court , to pronounce upon matters of life and death , communicate the will of god to man , and decide the course of history ! —well , so much for the wings of doves
0	afterwards they gave out that she had died , and her funeral toolc place , but actually she escaped to martinique and there married a frenchman
0	after he had had the goodness to carry out the second puncture with his own hands , he took a dignified leave and did not return
0	and i soon came to the speech of that one , the make-bate , the losel , in the italian room , have held much parley with him , and he had much to tell me of the quality , fundament , and substance of hell
0	he too , like his grandson , had always been in the opposition ; though he had been able to perform his rôle upon a larger stage than had ludovico
0	but it was all just like consul buddenbrook : a little pretentious , not like his forebears
0	i-lis playing was neat and cultivated t his tone not large , but of beautiful sweetness and technically not a little brilliant
0	yet after all , this adaptation took place more rapidly than one might have thought possible ; for was not time up here at the berghof arranged and organized to the end that one should get very rapidly used to things , even if the getting used consisted chiefly in getting used to not getting used ?
0	don ’ t talk to me about your cousin
0	behrens would like to persuade him ; but the doctor ’ s interest in the matter was single , whereas his own seemed equivocal ; he was not at all clear that he would not do better just to die in peace , with his ribs intact
0	only certes i should suffer the knives of pain therefor , even in the time , as the jittle sea-maid suffered thetn in her legs , which was my sister and sweet bride , and named hyphialta
0	my fury at the obscene prank of that small-beer schleppfuss knew no bounds - yet it was an impersonal fury , no evidence at all of prudishness in myself
0	the members of a certain sect , and even other persons of devout and serious character , submitted to flagellation in order that the spiritual impulse might be strengthened
0	you consider it necessary ?
0	i knew it , once
0	his delivery contributed to the effect , for it was entirely calculated to impress the young
0	now just tell me thi : is herr mantel-sack the sort of person one ought to be afraid of ?
0	you do know il , do not you ?
0	herr settembrini , for instance , that time when the weakness of the flesh had prevented him from attending the congress for the advancement of civilization at barcelona , ought to have had a saint elizabeth at his side— !
0	gerda had lifted her head from her work , and thomas , startled , looked at his sister
0	i know too well what i owe to you and to myself within these walls
0	ye would visit me deliberately here in italy of all places , where you are entirely out of your sphere and not on the peasant tongue at all ?
0	either the experience of death must be the last experience of life , or else it must be a bugaboo , pure and simple
0	we met these two young ones , the doctor and i -- he pointed to tom and christian , in their blue tunics and leather belts -- in king street , coming home from school
0	'oh , do not mention it -- i have been sitting for some time !
0	if a thing has size , one can not call it vice
0	sucl a llobilization for war , however stern and grim a face it wears , must always have something about it like an unlicensed holiday ; however unreserv- edly one 's duty , it seems a little like playing truant , like running away , like yielding to unbridled instinct
0	but don ’ t overdo it , he said ; that ’ s my advice
0	ran through him like tidings of great joy
0	they talked about business , the business of each one of those present ; but even this subject roused no great enthusiasm
0	i have convinced myself that it is not possible
0	on my side , let me make you an honourable declaration
0	i am alone with myoid helene , who cares for my physical part , and to whom sometimes i read aloud from my
0	when did you come ?
0	he may regard the general , impersonal foundations of his existence as definitely settled and taken for granted , and be as far from assuming a critical attitude toward them as our good hans castorp really was ; yet it is quite conceivable that he may none the less be vaguely conscious of the deficiencies of his epoch and find them prejudicial to his own moral well-being
0	his facial expression was of one with something bad-tasting in his mouth , and he ate without a word
0	my god , breathed frau schönfeld at him , what a tan this demon has—he gets it from the helio—it makes him look like a hunter of eagles !
0	wasn ’ t it the most utter bourgeoisiedom , the sheerest utilitarian philistinism , to make truth depend on the interest of mankind ?
0	he had been successful in the past , but was that not because of the enthusiasm and impetus drawn from reflection ?
0	the snow where it had been shovelled was melting and settling ; the paths were beginning to be slushy ; the friends wore their overshoes
0	the glass improvised inexhaustibly of the pangs of birth and the first kiss of lovers ; the crown of sorrows , the fatherly goodness of god ; plunged into the mysteries of creation , lost itself in other times and lands , in interstellar space ; even mentioned the chaldeans and the zodiac ; and would most certainly have gone on all night , if the conspirators had not finally taken their fingers from the glass , and expressing their gratitude to holger , told him that must suffice them for the time , it had been wonderful beyond their wildest dreams , it was an everlasting pity there had been no one at hand to take it down , for now it must inevitably be forgotten , yes , alas , they had already forgotten most of it , thanks to its quality , which made it hard to retain , as dreams are
0	but all the various conversations around the table flowed together in one stream when jean jacques hoffstede embarked upon his favourite theme , and began to describe the italian journey which he had taken fifteen years before with a rich hamburg relative
0	is it possible for any human being to disregard his love ?
0	others are transmitted by a freedom movement christened wenvolf : -a band of raving-mad lads who hide in the woods and break out nightly ; they have already deserved well of the fatherland by many a gallant murder of the invaders
0	rosaline , as the lover never tires of portraying her , is the dark lady of the second sonnet sequence , elizabeth 's maid of honour , shakespeare 's love , who betrayed him with the lovely youth
0	leverktihn , surrounded by the women , schildknapp , helene , and myself , had sat down at the brown square piano and flattened the pages of the score , vith his right hand
0	regardless of his programme , hans castorp devoured her , with his sleep-weary eyes
0	you will see , everything uaii be put right by a gdod marriage
0	however , it seemed fairly clear that dr ting-fu was right
0	the affair at the schlaginhaufens ' was not a dinner but a nine- o'clock evening company with a buffet in the dining-room next the salon
0	so then i learned that it , vas often thus
0	but the decline , the falling-off , the begin-ning of the end
0	it was only an episode , preceded by others ( he had worked as conductor in small state theatres in the reich and switzerland ) and followed certainly by others still
0	dr faustus willingly , said she ; only too bad my maxi ( that was herr schweigestill ) is out on the farm with gereon , that 's our son , they wanted to try a new manure-spreader gereon bought , so the gentlemen will have to make do with me
0	with the easy adaptability of youth , which suits itself to any environment , hans castorp had begun to imitate this indifference
0	herr hugo weinschenk spent eight or ten days doing nothing but smoking : then he began to read the papers and write letters
0	but a la longue they bored me
0	three steps from the door he trod on a cracker of such exceptional quality that it made a noise like dynamite
0	frankness for frankness : something shrinks together inside me , it makes me squirm when you use the word as you do use it in ref- erence to yourself
0	and hans castorp ’ s case was scarcely of such severity as to give him any special claim to attention
0	the camp thou hast left before the battle
0	the two spent twelve days in stately domesticity in the dix- huitieme salons and apartments of castle tolna , in drives through the princely estate and along the gay shores of the plattensee , attended by an obsequious retinue , some of whom were turks
0	i never go to sleep properly
0	but just then ida would say , come , little hanno
0	i left kaiser- saschern and settled with wife and child at the edge of the isar , in this dignified city , seat of a bishopric for hundreds of years , where with the exception of some months during the war i have passed my own life in convenient touch with the capital and also with my friend , and shared , in love and solicitude , the stresses and the tragedy of his
0	is that you , good soul ?
0	it is the revocation
0	this it was which since yesterday had filled him as if with a heady , in-toxicating draught , had worked in his heart in the darkness of the night and roused him like a budding love !
0	they also invited the numis- matist dr kranich , schildknapp , rudi schwerdtfeger , and my- self ; but not zink and spengler , nor the little theatre people who had been clarissa 's colleagues
0	romans xiii : 'for there is no power but of god : the powers that be are ordained of god
0	time had moved steadily on , and brought more than one change in its train
0	adrian 's own family had been settled for several generations at buchel , a farm belonging to the village comillunity of oberweiler , near weissenfels , whence one was fetched by 'wagon after a three- quarters-hour journey by train from kaisersaschern
0	but she only whispered , kissing all three of them , for jesus christ 's sake -- and my blessed jean 's
0	he went up quickly , skipping a step in his usual way
0	hans castorp , thus slapped on the mouth , had to look on while ferge brought out the fatal étui from beneath his cloak , and handed one pistol to wehsal to pass on to naphta
0	you don ’ t mean to say the man is a jesuit !
0	it was a day like its predecessor : cold , mist , wind
0	so full of horror and rebellion , and anguish , and—well , perfectly indescribable
0	her pribislav eyes glided rapidly down his figure , as he sat there one knee over the other , with a deliberate insouciance which had all the effect of scorn ; they paused for a space upon his yellow boots , and then carelessly , with perhaps a smile in their depths , withdrew
0	he pushed his chair up to hers and stroked her hair , in an effort to console her
0	he said annthrr time there is a ship of our line being launched to-day , and i shall christen it
0	but in the long run , pretty stupid , is not it ?
0	for just as little as one understands the new and the young , without being at home in the traditional , just so must love for the old remain ungenuine and sterile if one shut oneself away from the new , which with historical inevita- bility grows out of it
0	but now we are all experts , all critics : we note that the idea is nothing new , that it all too much reminds us of something in rimsky-korsakov or brahms
0	and senator buddenbrook agreed
0	i will look after the tea , said tony gr� , and wait for you in the dining-room
0	imagine , he said to himself , he talks about irony just as he does about music , he ’ ll soon be telling us that it is politically suspect—that is , from the moment it ceases to be a direct and classic device of oratory
0	we have not it -- where should we get twenty-five thousand marks from , i should liks to know ?
0	at that moment the glass door on the left slammed shut , with a rattle and ringing of glass ; he did not start as he had on the first occasion , but only made a grimace of lazy disgust ; when he wished to turn his head , he found the effort too much for him—it was really not worth while
0	but also you are an at- tractive case , that i freely admit
0	i sha not have any mercy !
0	heart-piercing moving to the last—very
0	for then herr wenzel , barber and member of the assembly , appeared , with his in-telligent face and his red hands , his razors and other tools , and the basin of warm water which he had fetched from the kitchen ; and the consul sat in a reclining-chair and leaned his head back , and herr wenzel began to make a lather ; and there ensued almost always a conversation that began with the weather and how you had slept the night beforr , wpnt on to politics and the great world , thence to domestic aflaiis in the city itself , and closed in an intimate and familiar key on business and family matters
0	and at the directors ' meeting of the buchen railway yesterday , consul hagenstrbm simply talked me down , refuted my con-tentions , nearly made me appear ridiculous
0	and now he ’ s come to this
0	c ’ est à dire : en faisant ton portrait !
0	for some years now she had believed that each christmas was her last ; and she strove with all the powers at her command to give a depart- ing brilliance to the feast that was held in her small over-heated rooms
0	but a narrative which concerned itself with the events of five minutes , might , by extraordinary conscientiousness in the telling , take up a thousand times five minutes , and even then seem very short , though long in relation to its imaginary time
0	the family feeling which led him to cherish the past history of his house extended itself even more strongly into its future ; and he was influenced , too , by the loving and expectant curiosity concentrated upon his son by his family am ] his friends and acquaintances , even by the buddenbrook ladies in broad street
0	it must have been a frightful onslaught
0	for within , in the salon , there is a flower-decked small table , serving as an altar , with a young priest in black vestments and a stiff snowy ruff like a millstone round his neck , reciting the service ; and there is a great , strapping , particu-larly well-nourished person , richly arrayed in red and gold , bearing upon her billowing arms a small something , half smothered in laces and satin bows : an heir -- a first-born son !
0	what are you doing here ?
0	then he drew a deep breath and sat up
0	they did not judge or criticize like col leagues ; their comments were meant to annihilate , to leave their author alone in the field
0	two years up here , and still capable of such projects—ah , yes , your heart is sound , no need to despair of you
0	that 's the wife 's work
0	the roller , provided vvith metal tongues , turned along the tuned teeth of a comb and played , at first briskly and daintily , then slowly running down , three well-harmonized , demure little tinkling melodies , to which echo listened always with the same rapt attention , the same unforgettable mixture of delight , surprise , and dreamy musing
0	all i have to look out for is the dowry of my ward
0	the notice of the bridge party was attracted , the players were drawn by curiosity and came up holding their cards fan-shaped in their hands
0	sometimes , too , little buddenbrook was allowed to sit up with the organist at the sunday service in st mary 's -- which was quite a different matter from stopping below with the other people , in the nave
0	wherever he went , he suspected , he gibed , he vented his spleen ; in short , his days were filled with hunting out and hounding down all his fellow-creatures who did not possess that inestimable advantage which was the only one he had
0	a man may have a simple , childlike temperament ; but mu- sic is the mysterious revelation of the highest wisdom , a divine service , and the profession of music-teacher a priestly office
0	there was an uneasy stillness for some time
0	resembled was not the word : they were the same eyes
0	inez walked this road , of course with the cordial approval of her mother , and came to grief , as her sister did on hers
0	dr grabow came once more , to see that everything was being done
0	for years back , ever since father 's death , the whole back part has been going to pieces
0	they both have their good sides ; what i have against settembrini ’ s—the free-thinking line—is that he seems to imagine it has a corner in human dignity
0	then the carriage rolled along castle street and over the koberg , crossed broad street , and braked down the steep de-cline of fishers ' lane
0	this giant lamento ( it lasts an hour and a quarter ) is very cer- tainly non-dynamic , lacking in development , without drama , in the same way that concentric rings made by a stone thrown into water spread ever farther , without drama and always the saine
0	there lay the broad meadows , with the coneshaped summit of the schwarzhorn towering in the background , still in snow , and close in on the right the snow-buried skaletta glacier
0	disease and death as nobility , life and health as vulgarity—what a doctrine whereby to hold fast the neophyte to the service of humanity !
0	it is in the family papers
0	the elder kr� was bolt upright , enthroned between madame antoinette and frau senator langhals , dividing his pet jokes and his flourishes between the two ladies
0	turned into swiss currency , this was so advantageous that he had never spent one instalment when the next arrived , enclosed in a letter of a few typed lines signed james tienappel , conveying his greetings and best wishes for recovery , together with the same from grand-uncle tienappel and sometimes from the seafaring peter as well
0	not for an instant
0	from the rugged slopes came the sound of cowbells ; the peaceful , simple , melodious tintinnabulation came floating unbroken through the quiet , thin , empty air , enhancing the mood of solemnity that broods over the valley heights
0	i can still hear a certain deutschlin , konrad deutschlin , a ro- bustfellow with hair hanging in strings on his forehead , adding : and everything was once nothing , my good probst , and then be- came something
0	you paltry wretch , said the stare with which hans castorp measured the mannheimer—said it without the shadow of a doubt of its meaning
0	and how do you come to be here so late ?
0	well , tom , i must say i was ashamed of hagenstrbm
0	yes , here seemed to sound two voices , with differing counsels
0	you will not believe that your father played lightly and unre-flectingly with your happiness in those days !
0	but it could not : the painful , rebellious feeling sank away again , and he was still
0	but that again , in its turn , was belied by his blackness and pallor , so that some aura of the questionable always hung about the man
0	and when herr brecht opened the door , his invitation was repeated by josephus in such a way that somehow hanno was laughing when he went into the operating-room and sat down in the queer big chair by the window , next the treadle machine
0	there , if i am not mistaken , there is a tireless discursive argumentation and a cursed lot of dialectic tension
0	you ask a woman : do you love him ?
0	that a pastor from riga could thus bamboozle him behind his bark ?
0	he did what he could with those two hands , often adding his voice , which crowed and cracked , but never badly ; no , it was all even ravishing , by reason of its fervid musicality and enthusiastic rightness of expression
0	he ate enormously at dinner
0	evening , m ’ boy , said behrens , who stood talking in low tones with krokowski and the oberin , and nodded ruefully to hans castorp , with his upper lip drawn back
0	they two , alone together , as two beings are together in only one other human relationship , have , like them , the one acting , the other suffering him , shared a secret that binds them for ever together
0	and , contrariwise , one can conceive of a world so spacious that its time system too has a majestic stride , and the distinctions between still , in a little while , yesterday , to-morrow , are , in its economy , possessed of hugely extended significance
0	this show-piece did indeed give a singular tone to the silken chamber
0	the gentleman in the ulster looked at morten as one looks at a servant , blinking gently without seeing him , and said in a soft voice : is herr pilot-captain schwarzkopf at home ?
0	for the behaviour of these people was really due to the indescribable atmosphere of aloofness which he carried about wherever he went
0	how should i get on without them ?
0	it is not advisable to fall ill up here ; you aren ’ t taken any notice of
0	and began tapping as before
0	the others would have burst out laughing again , but adrian shook his head at them with his finger on his lips
0	he sat on his revolving stool with his face turned towards us , in the same position as ours , bent over , hands between his l { nees , and in a few words brought to an end his lecture on why beethoven had not
0	he would approach his fea- tures mistrustfully to the glass , pull a wry face , hold his chin with thumb and forefinger , stroke his cheek in disgust and then wave his face away with the other hand so expressively that we , adrian and i , burst out in loud laughter
0	the hofrat , still lost in thought , let him stand
0	the old man named each one to his grandson , pointing with beringed index finger
0	sesemi weichbrodt stood on her tip-toes , kissed her pupil , now frau permanerjer , explosively on the forehead , and said with her most pronounced vowels : be happy , you go-od che-ild !
0	so then i came round with alnlost ridiculous promptness , described the event as inconlprehensible ; allowed that a nlistake , a wrong bottle was quite possible , yes , probable
0	the products of animal metabolism , such as albumen , glycogen , animal starch , in short , were present in them
0	he does not hate us in the least
0	the persistence of poverty and sickness had been in the interest of both parties , and the position could be sustained just so long as it was possible to hold to the purely religious point of view
0	you can ’ t call it time , quoth hans castorp , thick-tongued
0	it is on account of my cousin , herr hofrat
0	what he had said , at bottom , was that he alone had the right to enjoy the pleasant things we had been regaled with
0	he went on , and ran his hand down the whole of his left side , very close , but not touching it
0	it reminds me of things dr krokowski says in his monday lectures
0	even the overdiecks were very lively
0	christian went on , and his voice was hollow and rasping
0	as before , he ordered a bottle of kulmbacher
0	we were touching upon this subject earlier in the afternoon , when we spoke of the responsive nature of women
0	in class leo expressed the desire to study theology , in order to prepare himself for membership in the society , in case he should be found worthy
0	this is the fact
0	but on the third day it seemed as though nature suffered a sudden reserve ; everything turned topsy-turvy
0	something jesting and commonplace , of course
0	what makes him limp like that ?
0	yes , he is my cousin , he confirmed her , unnecessarily
0	well , he may be innocent , after all
0	the chandler , it appeared , let his upper storeys to a bohemian ladies ’ -tailor , who in his turn let out lodgings
0	for now , instead of the dimness of the hall we have the rather pensive light of a declining spring day in the season of melting snows ; and our hero is seated in his wonted place at the bedside of mynheer peeperkorn , in friendly and respectful converse with that great man
0	every man , dumb with the shock , folded his hands upon his stomach and looked at his fellows or at the windows , where fists were being shaken in the air and the crowd was giving vent to deafening and frantic yelling
0	good , then freedom was the opposite of inborn sinlessness , freedom meant the choice of keeping faith with god , or having traffic with demons and being able to mutter beastlinesses at the mass
0	even when he seemed to rest , as he sat with the paper after dinner , a thousand ideas whirled about in his brain , while the veins stood out on his temples , and he twisted the ends of his moustaches with a certain still intensity of passion
0	hagenstrbm ! -- the word seems to have corns from nobody knows where -- down from the sky , or up from the earth
0	what do you make of that ?
0	and what an education !
0	her native genuine sweetness - the way , for instance , in which the dark-brown hair was dravvn back from her brow and sensitive temples , leaving the ears free and lying heavy at the back of her neck - set its stamp on the hands as weli
0	reason and enlightenment have banished the darkest of these shadows that tenanted the soul of man—not entirely , for even yet the conflict is in progress
0	he hiccoughed gently two or three times , was silent , and ceased to move his lips
0	she turned toward the door , with her pot of flowers , wrapped up in tissue paper , under her arm ; and thomas , after greeting her again , said in an elevated voice to the shop girl , give me a couple of roses , please
0	erica will be like me -- with grunlich and perma-neder
0	she said ly—ric , as hans castorp involuntarily noted
0	that was beautiful , and i praised it highly
0	of course , it is possible that she is consciously or unconsciously seeking a mate herself -- but i know the child , and i feel sure she has never yet found her heart , as the saying goes
0	to mitigate adrian 's acco\lnt by subjecting it to any kind of editing ; to dismiss the dialogue in a few numbered paragraphs ( will the reader please note the protesting quotation-marks i have given the word , vvithout concealing from myself that they can remove from it only part of its indwelling horror ) ; to do this no regard for the possible failure of the reader 's capacity could possibly move me
0	one believes in the coming of war if one does not sufficiently abhor it
0	they all sat down , and the consul and the broker talked by turns for the next few minutes
0	always the crass , obscenely comic figure of the divei has been nearer to them than the eternal majesty ; and kumpf , in his way , was a man of the people
0	the young man assured himself by a side glance that frau chauchat was paying no heed ; then stood by the bed in his accustomed posture , his weight on one leg , his head on one side , his hands folded across his stomach , reverently , reflectively gazing
0	but let me tell my tale
0	but the half-conscious cravings were stronger ; and in the desire to have them strengthened and justified from outside , he first revealed his plan to his sister
0	rising on tiptoes to peer into joachim ’ s throat , she asked : tell me , young un , do you ever swallow the wrong way ?
0	it seemed to hans castorp that not only he himself had arrived at this point , but that all the world , the whole show , as he said , had arrived there with him ; he found it hard to differentiate his particular case from the general
0	he was not out for change , new sense impressions , distraction , recreation
0	and no wonder , he said to himself
0	hans castorp was silent a little space
0	they sang in chorus—one could understand the words quite well :
0	this invisible figure is frau van tolna and i can not set her before the reader 's eye or give the smallest idea of her outward appearance , for i have not seen her and never had a description of her , since no one i know ever saw her either
0	his mogith was small and mobile , with two yellowish pointed teeth in the otherwise vacant gum of his lower jaw , and he was pressing these into his upper lip , aa-he stood absently by the door with his hands in his trousers pockets and the black and white down on his head waving slightly , although there was not the least perceptible draught
0	the senator breakfasted hurriedly , and the frau consul , tony , clolhilde , and christian meanwhile took their leave
0	hans castorp was forced to acquiesce
0	two months before i came , a student who had been here a long time hanged himself down in the wood , after a general examination
0	or would you rather stop on here and let out floors to different families ?
0	the windows were shrouded , daylight shut out , and two electric lights were burning
0	she lurned her pretty 'cad , and looked -- at me -- and said , 'you just get on , my lad , and hold your tongue !
0	with suppressed eagerness he had opposed those who had thought to take over , on the hofrat ’ s departure , the changing of plate and needle , the switching on and off of the current
0	but i can not follovv
0	i would show you the door !
0	only a few old hands , joachim said , could wield both blankets at once , flinging them into position with three self-assured motions
0	said kranich , and got a bravo !
0	but i have to obey the order -- that is my share , and you can look on at it
0	what a goodly idea !
0	instruction in magic , if you like
0	i never write a letter
0	inpossible , but refreshing , so adrian in a good mood characterized the work , which he had begun to write down even during the composition of the ensemble piece , carried in his mind and developed , burdened as it was with the work on the quartet , of which one would have thought that it alone must have consumed a man 's organizing powers for long and to the utmost
0	several times the shattering , headlong destruction has come breath-takingly near my retreat
0	it belongs to the realm of the great confusion
0	you know -- it even happened several times that he said ame ' instead of ' !
0	taking walks up here is very beautiful—but appears to have its difficult side
0	vanity , said the hofrat , and vexation of spirit
0	who was it threw christian out ?
0	creatures like that one has to love , whether one will or no ; they vex you with their heedlessness , but that is only one reason the more for loving them ; it makes you so happy to have to care for them in spite of yourself
0	they submitted to herr settembrini ’ s breaking up the little party and disposing of themselves without giving naphta the chance to come along supposing he had been inclined
0	his voice had grown quite strangely excited
0	i can surely go to sleep without being disturbed ; they will behave themselves , he said
0	he raised his arm as he turned to go
0	it was probably among the most acceptable of the children 's books in the shop , with pictures in english taste , a sort of kate greenaway style and not at all bad rhymes
0	it may cost the government a few window-panes -- but that 's all
0	such expressions repeated themselves in the letters
0	still it seems to be the case , and i point it out in connection with the statement that leverl { uhn in the text for his incommensurable choral work by no means confined himself to the revelation of st john , but tool { in this whole prophetic tradition , so that his work amounts to the crea- tion of a new and independent apocalypse , a sort of resume of the whole literature
0	on a smaller scale they too were monstrously incredible and exag- gerated ; the scene displayed the same vicious san-culottism
0	so now they knew—though very probably not all of them were capable of an opinion on what they heard
0	well , that is very flattering to me , wenzel -- just put a little more lather on my chin , will you ?
0	lord bless us , thought hans castorp , in shamefaced consternation
0	she says no more , she goes on with the cure , and loses weight by the week
0	but he did have all the sensations which the drunkenness of passion knows , when it sees its own case duplicated in the outer world , and which form a most fantastic mixture of disgust and fellow-feeling
0	is it a good solid amount ?
0	senator langhals spoke with some heat
0	not all that happens in madness is therefore simply to be prevented , and the obligation to preserve life was in this case obeyed in scarcely anyone 's interest save the mother 's - for undoubtedly the maternal would prefer an irresponsible son to a dead one
0	the answer was in the sense that this defect only brouglt the lovable closer to the suffering soul ; that without it there would have been no hope at all , it was just that which had made the fickle one ac- cessible to the cry of pain ; more still , and revealing enough : that the shortening of life which ight result from it was ltiore of a consolation and assurance to her , vho demanded possession than it was a moderation of her love
0	this director wulicke was a most formidable man
0	what was this , then , that was in the air ?
0	hans castorp sought and asked for him through the house ; was sent here or there where he would be certain to find him , and found only that he had gone
0	perhaps all your nerves are short on the left side !
0	he had not even smiled on her entrance ; and this immobility of his mien said all
0	his eyelids drooped , so that the long brown lashes lay over the deep blue shadows ; and his closed lips were a little wry
0	her black veil played about her , and her full skirt lay spread out in picturesque folds
0	but not alone a freak of nature , not simply a hoax
0	in my eyes , it is reason ’ s keenest dart against the powers of darkness and ugliness
0	we started with the idea that youth has closer relations with nature than the mature man in a bourgeois society - something like woman , to whom also has been ascribed , compared with man , a greater nearness to nature
0	it was a russian kiss , the kind that is exchanged in that spreading , soulful land , at high religious feasts , as a seal of love
0	things haven ’ t changed much with you , in the mean time
0	he passed on , in his everlasting check trousers , and left hans castorp behind , presumably , and to a certain extent actually , staggered by so much allusiveness ; though he was stirred to irritation at its being taken for granted , and muttered through his teeth after the departing back : carducci-latini-humani-spagheti—get along , do , and leave me in peace !
0	stretching out his large , white hand , with the long , trembling fingers , he said agree , my dear young patron : eighty-four thousand marks -- it is the offer of an honest old man
0	i am free to confess that the novel experiences of these kridwiss evenings , combined with my participation in adrian 's solitary work , were responsible for the mental strain of my life at that time and in the end for the loss of a good twelve pounds ' weight
0	from time to time he saw ' rudiger schildknapp , the like-eyed ,
0	i am inclined to look at people and say : so that ’ s you , is it ?
0	the ground-floor , settembrini explained , belonged to the chandler ; naphta was domiciled a floor higher up , with the tailor ’ s shop , and his own quarters were in the roof , where he had a peaceful little study
0	accordingly hans castorp set out on this tour of investigation , which began by descending from the meadow with the hut into another and rather deep gully that dropped off from right to left
0	bined cellos and flutes , half lyrically passionate and half burlesque , which in the prose , at the place , but her eye - by this light , but for her eye , i would not love her , recurs in a wildly carica- tured way , where the darkness of the eyes is intensified by the pitch , but the lightning flash of them is this time given to the pic- colo there can be no doubt that the strangely insistent and even unnecessary , dramatically little justified characterization of rosa- line as a faithless , wanton , dangerous piece of female flesh - a description given to her only in biron 's speeches , whereas in the actual setting of the comedy she is no more than pert and witty - there can be no doubt that this characterization springs from a compulsion , heedless of artistic indiscrepancies , on the poet 's part , an urge to bring in his own experiences and , whether it fits or not , to take poetic revenge for them
0	he arranged his small black felled hand upon the boy 's shoulder , and looked up at thi
0	it certainly could not be considered strict objectivity , there was much more free-thinking and subjectivity about it than leo naphta would admit—it was , indeed , quite as much politics as herr settembrini ’ s didactic phrase : freedom is the law of love of one ’ s kind
0	you ’ d say the eye slit was cut obliquely , but it only looks so
0	i have just received your important letter , and hasten to thank you for the consideration you show me in asking for my consent in the affair under discussion
0	settembrini , corrected the italian , clearly and with emphasis , making as he spoke a mocking bow
0	hans castorp respected work—as how should he not have ?
0	everything now depended upon the question : how far was the salvation of the deceived one involved by her receiving and using the unholy preparation ?
0	a quantity of little woolly ringlets covered his round head
0	and it makes me nervous to hear him scolding , about the cold , and behrens , and frau magnus because she is losing weight , and about pretty well everything
0	dne just must not mind
0	he said sententiously , and put his nose in the air
0	he seemed to be darkly dreaming for a moment ; then he got up
0	adrian suggested that they should take a walk , one talked bet- ter walking
0	dr heidekind scolded , and insisted on a change of air ; a complete change , not a stay at norderney or wyk on föhr—that would not mend matters this time , he said ; if they wanted his advice , it was that hans castorp should go for a few weeks to the high mountains before he took up his work in the yards
0	be assured that thy psychological feints do not trap me , any better then do the theological
0	his stomach seemed to have a prejudice against the good cod-liver oil
0	i have often heard
0	then , overhead in the salon , the harmonies would rise and surge like waves , with singing , lamenting , unearthly jubilation ; would lift like clasped hands outstretched toward heaven ; would float in vague ecstasies ; would sink and die away into sobbing , into night and silence
0	i do not say , answered hans castorp , i do not say that she ever returned it
0	next time ( that would be in four weeks ) it is bound to show further improvement
0	but christian 's gaze flickered absently over her head ; he would probably have stopped without her suggestion , for he seemed to be sunk in a profound , disquieting dream of maria and her depravity , while his little round deep eyes wandered back and forth
0	a mountain stream came flowing in its shallow , stony bed down the right-hand slope , poured itself foaming over the terraced boulders lying in its path , then coursed more calmly toward the valley , crossed at this point by a picturesque railed wooden footbridge
0	and the thought , again , almost did him good , berausc it was a simple , comprehensible , normal thought , that one could think and express -- quite another matter from this brooding over a mysterious disgrace , a blot upon his family 'scutcheon
0	there could be no better example of the quotation as dis- guise , the parody as pretext
0	perhaps if i got up my latin i could read it
0	i-io ' w much speaks for the man the deep , intent friendship of delacroix , who writes to him : j'cspere vous voir ce soir , mais ce moment est capable de me faire dcvenir fou
0	strange to say , hans castorp ’ s only reply to all this was a query as to whether it was possible to get porter up here ; when joachim looked at him , in some astonishment , he perceived that his cousin was overcome with sleep , that in fact he was actually nodding
0	'keep it to yourself
0	so the hundred years make an impression on you too ?
0	in old age the flesh becomes tough , that is because the collagen increases in the connective tissue—the lime , you know , the most important constituent of the bones and cartilage
0	aloud he said : you are good !
0	since her time he had flung himself with redoubled conviction into the arms of the clear-eyed goddess , of whose soothing powers hofrat behrens had so morally discoursed
0	have you a copy of the will here , betsy ?
0	and leopardi , thought hans castorp , who definitely despaired of science and progress ?
0	for , how-ever my life seemed to go awry , i was never quite lost
0	his inheritance from his mother , in-deed , half the interest of which had always found its way to hamburg , was managed by herr stephan kistenmaker -- in so far as it was not already spent in advance
0	it was rather a misnomer to speak of the village , since scarcely anything but the word remained
0	i didn ’ t know it
0	privately , she sometimes thought that the splendid von went with her better than it did with armgard ; for armgard did not appreciate her good luck , dear , no !
0	i only feel really fit when i am doing nothing at all
0	—and thus your catarrh is , in my view , a third-line phenomenon , dr krokowski concluded , very softly
0	have you ever asked him where he learned them , from his father or from whom ?
0	how lovely she looks again !
0	plantations , the harvests being manufactured in refining works on the property itself
0	we are entering into times , my friend , which will not be hood- winked by psychology
0	let it he as it is
0	thomas , smoking his cigarette , looked about keenly , and when they carne to the grain he called herr permaneder 's attention to its condition
0	you made a fine figure of yourself !
0	naphta responded , with disagreeable composure : my good sir , there is no such thing as pure knowledge
0	but i would also recall the share which german artists and friends of art had in the founding of the international society for contemporary music , in , and the performances by the society two years later in prague , when choral and instrumental portions of adrian 's apocalypsis cum figuris were given before a public including famous guests from all the lands of music
0	joy , he said , quoting aretine , held brilliant court within his , settembrini ’ s , breast ; a joy due to the blessing of the springtime—to which commend him
0	he did not put out his hand
0	he : oh , thy father is not so ill placed in my mouth
0	he did not ask if we understood that , nor did we ask ourselves
0	hans castorp looked at her , and all the modest and confiding friendliness native to him spoke in his eyes
0	when you entered it from the corridor on a day of cold and damp , or when the cutting tramontana blew , the warmth of it laid itself about you like a shawl , so that for very pleasure your eyes would fill with tears
0	tony looked a long time at her name and at the blank space next it
0	the patient , hands folded on his chest , smiled daily at the blithe address , smiled with a friendly , albeit rather harassed mien , watching the doctor ’ s yellow teeth , that were visible through his beard
0	it is different with your cousin
0	vacuity , monotony , have , indeed , the property of lingering out the moment and the hour and of making them tiresome
0	said the consul angrily
0	but all that won ’ t bring it up to a thousand francs , say what you like
0	it was not to be
0	dis pensed from oral examination on the basis of the maturity of his written worl { , he had taken leave of his teachers , with thanks for all they had done ; while on their side respect for the profession he had chosen repressed the private annoyance they had always felt at his condescending facility
0	here too there was music , a small , red-uniformed orchestra , conducted by a bohemian or hungarian first violin , who stood apart from the others , among the dancing couples , and belaboured his instrument with frantic wreathings of his body
0	the malay without turning his head followed the movement , until his eyeballs showed white
0	you shall not do that , papa , she went on , quite beside herself
0	oh , justifiably , quite justifiably !
0	one should preserve one 's sense of humour , quand meme
0	as they went , hans castorp discoursed earnestly upon the gentleman rider ’ s cough
0	to condemn as incapacity or ignorance , even as clumsy primitivism , the rejection of perspective eye-deception by pre perspective art ; even pityingly to shrug the shoulder over it : this , he declared to be the peak of silly modern arrogance
0	it dealt—at least possibly , if not quite admittedly—with the non-vital , with existences that took advantage of a ticklish , mysteriously and momentarily favouring chance to return to substantiality and show themselves to thair summoners—in brief , with the spiritualistic invocation of the departed
0	and that , vas all
0	and then , with a start , we remember that he has disappeared from the stage , that his voice no longer swells the general concert -- that he is , in short , departed from among us , and lies some-where ouside the walls , beneath the sod
0	you think there will be a severe storm , tom ?
0	your parents -- i really must ask you if you understand our financial position ?
0	even today in my thoughts i address him breathing vengeance and call him a prize ass in every sense of the word
0	his designs had been of the most discreet and delicate , he had meant nothing clumsy or abrupt
0	they scarcely as yet knew what , but would he at least be in principle inclined to do so , in his great amiability ?
0	he was a weighty man , whose suits were always of the best english cloths ; his eyes were watery blue and prominent behind his gold-rimmed glasses , his nose was ruddy , and his square cut beard was grey ; he wore a flashing brilliant on the stubby little finger of his left hand
0	one may as well go home
0	i fled with my flag
0	yes , papa , said little johann , and took up his post before the door , which closed after the two gentlemen
0	get used to it ?
0	i suppose magnus , the brewer , was rather stupid , after all , with his beautiful characters ’ ; but i do think settembrini might have said what the point really is in literature
0	he has not set any definite time
0	we will even add that he had already begun to treat of them before the arrival of ellen brand upon the scene of action , and the progress of matters into the empirical and experimental stage
0	did i really go pale ?
0	there are things to do , down below , but here—i doubt if anyone would take enough interest in it
0	but hans castorp considered that an answer was due , he felt it incumbent on him to cap the quotation , though it was unlikely he would have produced anything very striking
0	but until after mid-night he still sat in his room , before his harmonium , and played -- played in thought only , for he must make no noise
0	that , vas a definition suggested by the psychology of reli- gion
0	your father has had some heavy losses , due , we all know , to your brother justus
0	and what about western mysticism—and what about quietism , a religion that numbers fénelon among its disciples ?
0	i never knew that—but i ’ ve wondered for a long time what it is about eyes like that
0	hans castorp had had frequent word from his cousin , short messages , at first full of good news and high spirits , then less so , then at length communications that sought to hide something truly sad to hear
0	the soldier ’ s existence—i say this without intending the slightest offence to lieutenant ziemssen— can not be cited in the argument , for the reason that , as an existence , it is purely formal—in and for itself entirely without content
0	the raisin cake he contemplated with an interested eye , but literally shuddered at the thought of eating any
0	yes , and i did not sleep so very well , and the early breakfast was really too solid—i am accustomed to a fair breakfast , but this was a little too rich for my blood , as the saying goes
0	his sighs , in fact , meant nothing , and seemed to arise out of an excess of com-fort
0	the dying girl was indeed a charming blond creature , with eyes of true forget-menot blue
0	many a time and oft we shall be going down to pay him a visit—i am sure of that
0	her son augustus was a blond young man with a prosperous ex-terior , and there was julie his wife , born hagenstrbm , little and lively , with great blank black eyes and diamond ear-rings that were nearly as large
0	was that the hujus ?
0	there were gaps at the tables , all seven of them , at the good as well as at the bad russian table , and at those that stood transversely to the room
0	i-ie was not interested in travel for the sake of sightseeing or cmlture
0	what can i do for you ?
0	he stood there , clutching his sailor 's knot with one hand , felt with his tongue for a doubtful tooth , and listened to the earnest subdued voices which could be heard from inside
0	what new acquisition of house berghof was it which at length released our longstanding friend from his patience-playing mania , and flung him into the arms of another passion , nobler , though at bottom no less strange ?
0	never mind about tilda -- it does not hurt her
0	if the conversation turned upon the buddenbrook family history , christian might be in the mood to speak with serious love and admiration of his native town and of his ancestors
0	many are those who have responded to the call ; there is a considerable membership , in france , italy , spain , turkey , and in germany itself
0	they make pretty free with a human being ’ s idea of time , up here
0	oh , there 's nothing very good about mine , said thomas buddenbrook heavily , and leaned his head against the back of his chair with an air of disgust
0	i must hope that you will not entirely scorn the friendly hand of your virgil
0	your answer does not quite satisfy me—you must forgive me for disappointing you
0	i can ’ t depend on them—not only the first thought that comes into my head , but even the second one , the correction which my reason tries to make upon the first—more ’ s the pity
0	it was , of course , herr gr� , with an expression of im-ploring tenderness upon his face
0	the passionate rapidity of his approach even frightened hanno , at first
0	is that the doctrine of the roman church , which all the religious societies all over the world propagate by means of intrigue , or so they say ?
0	then it was that hans castorp laughed
0	gerda would like to rest a little
0	there was an old post-man , with watery eyes , earrings , and a white beard -- an an-cient oddity whom the senator used to salute on the street and call him herr postmaster : he came , stood in the doorway , and cried out ah hai not come fer that , herr se noter !
0	originally it was to have been three months
0	bathing and swimming -- let the boy have bathing and swimming -- he must bathe and swim , dr langhals had said
0	his patient was rather alarmed by the word comrade—who would have thought it ?
0	do you remember , morten began again , i once said to you that there was a question i wanted to ask you ?
0	and the homage he thus paid was genuine , and profound ; for , as he himself explained , judaism , by virtue of its secular and materialistic leanings , its socialism , its political adroitness , had actually more in common with catholicism than the latter had with the mystic subjectivity and self-immolation of protestantism ; the conversion of a jew to the roman catholic faith was accordingly a distinctly less violent spiritual rupture than was that of a protestant
0	even the hagenstroms have a flap
0	so you are against the works , he answered , and against physical nature , from which man comes and with him his incor- poreal part , which in the end does occur in other places in the cosmos
0	second class , to occupy less prominent places
0	this is a wonderful day , my dear son -- a wonderful day , she repeated
0	hanno might fail his father in all that demanded vitality , energy and strength
0	very well ; this is the object of the sociological pathology
0	she said , giving her query a curt , foreign intonation
0	next morning it showed ° , climbing during the morning to the same level as before
0	i ’ d like to wait for the comrade ’ though , he ’ ll be coming along presently , and just ask him if he is still of the opinion , in a case like this , that the physical is to be regarded as secondary
0	heavy ash-blond hair weighed down her head , so that she held it thrust out side- wise , with extended neck
0	people differ about that
0	he had the feeling , he said , that one should do the honours of mu- nich a bit for the ladies in pension gisela
0	yet it was not the same thing as borrowing a lead-pencil of a perfect stranger ; one might even say it would have been ill-bred to pass by a lady with whom one had been for months under the same roof and not salute her
0	take off your things , father dear
0	she folded her arms , flung back her head , and looked at the ceiling while she spoke
0	oh , yes , you are
0	but her little brown eyes looked as shrewd and faithful as ever
0	and then the dream became reality
0	there , there , little darling -- go to sleep now
0	not any more than i do ,
0	it begins , he said , with the cult of the marble statue that had got down to the bottom of the sea , the boy , who is obviously by thorwaldsen , and her illegitimate taste for it
0	so when i have an opinion nowadays on these subjects , people listen to me
0	she looked pitiable indeed
0	oh , it 's you , said the senator in a low voice , moving his lips cautiously
0	no justify thyself , was here ; no challenge , no priestly court-martial upon one who strayed away and was forgotten of honour
0	we shall sleep to-night in a hotel and travel home to-morrow
0	joachim raised seven fingers
0	it is my painful duty to tell you that your husband is obliged to call his creditors together ; that he can not carry on his business any longer
0	fa sangue it vinol and amelia moved her spoons to and fro before her face and murmured : spiriti ?
0	to rush into controversy with personalities , to be even forward of speech—but then to know how to extricate himself when need was , and his coat-tails , as it were , all but on fire !
0	no doubt he was grateful to his teacher for a kind of instruction
0	he could see them rolling up their velvet eyes and holding out their soft hats for the coins tossed from the windows
0	not blindly , but for that reason suffering the more ; and my inward attitude was that of her mocking sister clarissa , who looked do , vn her nose at the other sex : i should have liked to say to him : hop , man !
0	he answered at once , composed , alert and energetic , and heard the voice of one of the nurses in the house , saying in high , uncertain tones that frau chauchat would be glad if he would come at once to the first storey
0	the rain rustled the half-leafless trees in the avenue , and sometimes gusts of wind drove it against the window-panes
0	fraulein buddenbrook will want to unpack
0	would hamburg consent to be a party to this prussian scheme ?
0	oh , society doesn ’ t know what it wants
0	herr settembrini ’ s literary soul was pleased
0	they had wintered in rome , and in lvlay , as the heat strengthened , they had again sought the mountains and the same hospitable house where , in a sojourn lasting three months , they had learned to feel at home the year before
0	it was an attempt , a not utterly and entirely hopeless attempt ( the second since the failure of bismarck and his unification per- formance ) to norlnalize germany in the sense of europeanizing or democratizing it , of making it part of the social life of peo- ples
0	if this beastly ovid lesson were only over !
0	the family were dining on sunday in fishers ' lane , and he de-scribed how he had to summon all his powers , and crawl on hands and knees to the window to shut it
0	fc'yes , tom , over the desk in your office , answered frau permaneder , and embraced her brother
0	the pillars were faced halfway up with wood finished to look like sandalwood , the upper part white-enamelled , like the ceiling and upper half of the walls
0	his sense of the comic , his fondness for it , his proneness to laughter , yes , to laughing till he cried , i have already spoken of , and i have given but a false picture of him if the reader has not seen this kind of abandon as an element in his nature
0	at the same moment ap- preaching steps were heard on the echoing flags within
0	hanno sat quite still , his small hands clasped round hid buddenbrd dks knees , his mouth , as usual , a little twisted as his tongue fell out the hole in a back tooth
0	ah , that is most amusing !
0	he stoops when he walks , and rows along with his arms
0	he made a fine , sweeping gesture to wave away the imputation that he was a prosperous man
0	to-day she wore her dark red one
0	but she had been lucky : for just before the end of the term god in his loving-l { indness made her fall into the hands of the inquisition , and even under a slight degree of the question she had made a full and touchingly penitent confession , so that in all probability she obtained pardon from god
0	whether from his upbringing , or out of a natural idiosyncrasy , he loathed the slamming of doors , and could have struck the guilty person
0	he considered visiting pastor pringsheim and seeking advire and counsel ; but he gave it up in the end for fear of being ridiculous
0	he had per- suaded himself to put the thundering response in tones which an- nounce the powerlessness of the creaturely good before good in itself : the latter , being itself the source of justice , can not give way before anything that our human understanding is tempted to call unjust
0	but the others were silent : so profoundly silent that the director at length fell silent too
0	but hanno had a reason for absenting himself from the bathing , as well as from the skating and the drill class
0	i can only compare the feeling with the catch in the breath that a child feels in a sving as it flies aloft , the mingled exultation and terror
0	however that might be , it was clear that joachim was preoccupied with his own troubles ; the thought of him could afford his cousin no mental support
0	we must keep together , he used to say to refractory pupils , pinching them on the arm
0	as large as a salon , with stone floors like all the rest of the house
0	adrian and rudiger visited the place by mere chance
0	his face was not striking , but it had at least the stamp of a strong and lively intelligence
0	which was certainly a large order of sentimental superficiality
0	but chris-tian , for a long , long time , eats no more peaches
0	on the business side we have said everything
0	it threw up on its surface a little protuberance , something like a mount of conception , through which it took the stick into itself , lengthwise
0	please , please get up
0	oh , that 's just an expression -- a figure
0	me he shall never see again , whatever he decides
0	but on foot how long is it ?
0	in short , tony 's intentions in the matter of her divorce were not the only dark spot in the consul 's sky ; and the journey to hamburg was pressing
0	this salon was furnished with upholstered fauteuils , bronze candelabra , little gilt occasional chairs , a sofa-table , vith a bro- cade cover , and a richly framed , very much darkened oil painting of , representing the golden i-iorn wlth a view of gai
0	lawyer paravant and frau stöhr went white and red by turns ; the latter suffered pangs of indecision when called on to decide whether it was too high for her to buy at eighteen
0	one could not help feeling that it was by way of being a compensa- tion and atonement for the loss of human happiness and mutual love which had befallen him
0	the wind came up and blew the thick veils of water , tore them apart , and flung them about
0	tom , we will get to work
0	this is the reve-lation : that i shall live !
0	why are you sitting here writing in the dark ?
0	is it not the antithesis of hedonism ?
0	when i think that you have passed all your life in these surroundings -- in fact -- with some interruptions , said frau permaneder , in that extraordinarily throaty voice of which she sometimes availed herself
0	stine voss , who lived by the city wall , and mike stuht from bell-founders ' street , and fike snut from the river-bank or groping alley , their straw-coloured locks smoothed back with a wet comb , crossed the entry into the garden-room , which for a long time now had not been used as an office , and in which rows of benches had been arranged and frau consul buddenbrook , born kroger , in a gown of heavy black satin , with her white re-fined face and still whiter lace cap , sat opposite to them at a little table with a glass of sugar-water and catechized thrm for an hour
0	it sounded like a chal-lenge , like a little trumpet-call
0	when he was obliged to go into the city , adrian brought the boy all sorts of presents : various animals , a jack-in-the-box , a toy railway with lights that switched on and off as it roared round the curves ; a magic casket in which the greatest treasure was a glass filled with red wine which did not run out when the glass was turned upside dovvn
0	yes , how much has happened that had its effect on my own solitary activities , while yet i refused to look without-doors !
0	so it is with schoolmasters
0	of another poem , wherein spirits in golden barks traverse the heav- enly sea and the ringing course of gleaming songs , vre : thcs itself down and wells up again : all is so gently and friendly combining , f-iand seeketh hand in sympathy kind , lights through the night , vind trusting , consoling , all is in union for ever entwined
0	as for myself , i am a humanist , a homo humanus
0	i carry yours here
0	what extravagance , what fanaticism , it will be said !
0	the abstract , the refined-upon , the ideal , is at the same time the absolute—it is sternness itself ; it contains within it more possibilities of deep and radical hatred , of unconditional and irreconcilable hostility , than any relation of social life can
0	he was obliged to spend much time in bed , not only on the days when the quartan fever held sway , but on others too
0	he has never seen any-thing like it , i am sure
0	it was a jewel of great beauty and - to me - incalculable value
0	he had been there a half-hour earlier , and given a camphor injection ; had scarcely been absent for more than the moment of the short crossing
0	just lie still on your back
0	his name was wiedemann , a christian name , not a filthy jewish
0	what an effete and obsolete procedure burial was , under our modern conditions—the price of land , the expansion of our cities and consequent shoving of the graveyards out on to the periphery !
0	it would be the abandonment of certain comprehensive responsibilities which had grown up out of his contemplation of the image called homo dei ; it would be the betrayal of that appointed task of stock-taking , that hard and harassing task , which was really beyond the powers native to him , but yet afforded his spirit such nameless and adventurous joys ; that task it was his duty to perform , here in his chair , and up there in his blue-blossoming retreat
0	there were lively times here in the restaurant on occasion , joachim said , and champagne flowed freely
0	having spent a year with adrian in leipzig , i know how he lived during the other three of his stay there ; his manner of life being so regular and conservative that i found it rigid and some- times even depressing
0	she wept over herr weinschenk 's top-hat , the way he raised his eyebrows at sight of her and let them fall ; over his regal bearing and his balancing fists
0	such were the motives that led him to force his way so blandly into the retreat where genius created and suffered
0	still , i can not see how you reconcile your nationalism with your horror of war
0	the document is extant , i will report on it in its proper place
0	pas prccisement humain mais ex- tremement respectable
0	again the consul was obliged to stop eating and lean back in his chair to laugh
0	the treatment was not wrong , but it was just possibly one-sided
0	others sat straining forward to fling the bait far out
0	he , kretschmar , would leave the ques- tion open , how far adrian was accusing himself in order to ex- cuse his corresponding accusations against art ; for this painting art as a marriage with the mob , as kiss-throwing , gala-posturing , as a bellows to blow up the emotions , was a facile misconstruction and a wilful one too
0	the sleigh or carriage halted before the door , coachman and porter strapped fast the trunks , while friends gathered about to say good-bye to the departing one , who , cured or not , and whether for life or death , was off for the flat-land
0	imagine how i felt !
0	and even here at home there was another source of worry -- for , as yet , there was no certainty whatever that the family name would live
0	disease has nothing refined about it , nothing dignified
0	he should have gone a step further and said that a good style would lead to good deeds , settembrini added
0	hanno could not stop laughing
0	the reader , on the other hand , may very likely find such adjectives the only ones suitable to describe hans castorp ’ s personality or emotions
0	take your wineglass , young man , i will use the water-glass again , it does the crude new wine no shame— with his trembling hand he filled the glasses , hans castorp hastening to assist him
0	you have worked hard -- that must suffice
0	but there were other , more perceptive regions
0	the green blinds in frau gr� 's sleeping-room were gently stirred by the mild air of a june night , for the win-dows were open
0	the beaten french tasted this awful experience in , vhen their negotiators , seeking to soften the conditions of the victors , priced very high the renown , la gloire , ensuing from the entry of our troops into paris
0	i remember the house-warming
0	of late the assistant spent no more time with this particular patient than with the others , but confined himself chiefly to the well , comrade ?
0	his placidity was fully restored by the appearance of the steaming dishes , with their burden of canary-yellow besprent with green , which dispersed a mild warm fragrance of eggs and butter upon the air
0	but on the way to breakfast , and later in the course of the day , they talked about the direction of the berghof sanatorium , and joachim , in his character as inmate , answered his cousin ’ s questions
0	who , what , how could i be , if i were not i -- if this my external self , my consciousness , did not cut me off from those who are not i ?
0	please do not make phrases
0	the cousins met in the corridor and descended the stair
0	yes , my dear good mother : i am complying with the request to send my solemn consent to clara 's be-trothal from the amstel to the baltic
0	the times are not good for merchants
0	he would leave the office in the midst of work , seized with unrest , and roam about the garden , sometimes pausing as if he felt confined in his movements , sighing , and covering his eyes with his hand
0	go on with your work
0	they showed their necks and bosoms , they transfigured their arms by veiling them in illusion ; they did so , the world over , to arouse our desire
0	but perhaps it is only the excitement of thr , celebration
0	i have no great fondness for balls , and having the young people jumping about here ; and , be-sides , there is not room
0	a single light burned in the hall ceiling—and in the adjoining salons dimness reigned
0	dnce a week they sat at the extension table in the dining-room by the light of lamps and candles
0	every lady said to frau consul or her daughter : what a treasure your mamsell is , my dear !
0	no , he had become inwardly aware—one could conceive him paling at the thought—that even as it was , after only a week up here , he would find eyerything down below wrong and out of place , and that the feeling would last a considerable time before readjustment set in : it would seem to him unnatural to go to his office , instead of taking a prescribed walk after breakfast , and thereafter lying ritually wrapped , horizontal in a balcony
0	the movements with which he took up paper and writing materials were so short and jerky that herr marcus ran his two fingers up and down his beard and gave his colleague a long , scrutinizing look
0	from far and wide scholars came to converse with him—one from haparanda , another from cracow— they came to our city of padua , expressly to pay him homage , and he received them with dignified friendliness
0	hurry , do you hear ?
0	it had happened that the sonata had come , in the second , enormous movement , to an end , an end without any return
0	your skin gets like a file , and if the stimulus is very powerful , the hair ducts are erected too , the hair on your head bristles up and the little hairs on your body , like quills upon the fretful porcupine—and you can say , like the youth in the story , that now you know how to shiver and shake
0	he would drink no beer to-day ; he would drink nothing at all , or at most a swallow of water
0	i should not conceal from you , he went on , that the firm has suffered losses already quite apart from this affair , and that the surrender of a sum like this would be a blow from which it would recover with difficulty
0	i am refusing you -- for heaven 's sake , ca not you understand ?
0	the lovers sat quietly together hand in hand , and spoke gently and earnestly of the beautiful future before them
0	lawyer paravant had received out of transcendency a sounding slap on the cheek , and had countered with scientific alacrity , yes , had even eagerly turned the other cheek , heedless of his quality as gentleman , jurist , and onetime member of a duelling corps , all of which would have constrained him to quite a different line of conduct had the blow been of terrestrial origin
0	schwerdtfeger , a little to the left of the first vio- lin , whose place he was soon to tal { e , stood with his instrument under his arm , warm and beaming , face towards the hall and nodding to us with not quite permissible familiarity , while inez , at whom i could not resist stealing a glance , with her head thrust out , her mouth mischievously pursed , kept her eyes obstinately directed at some other point on the stage , perhaps on the leader , or no , farther along , on the harps
0	an astonishing growth of hair , a wilderness of tight little curls , red-brown mixed with grey , made his head look big and heavy , though it was poised easily upon a long neck with an extremely large adam 's apple that showed above his low collar
0	if that is an error , and while without doubt it was an error to yield to the temptation to bring in pfeiffering and the schweigestills before their time , i would implore the reader to attribute such irregu- larities to the excitement which has possessed me since i began this biography , and to tell the truth not only as i write
0	but there is one power , one principle , which commands my deepest assent , my highest and fullest allegiance and love ; and this power , this principle , is the intellect
0	i have the use of my senses
0	he keeps trying to open them wide , and has made a lot of wrinkles , regular corrugations , that turn up on the temples and run straight across his forehead , and his forehead is high and red , with long wisps of white hair
0	if we don ’ t think so , our judgment is corrupted
0	yes , these were two different worlds
0	hans castorp , horrified , shook his fist at her , but she scarcely grasped his meaning ; she was far from any thought of sparing joachim ’ s feelings , and too matter-of-fact to dream that anyone , least of all the next of kin , could be in any doubt as to the character and issue of this illness
0	breathe deep , he commanded
0	it surely did not escape this haughty person with the too short chin when superiority , on grounds which have nothing to do , -ith superiority , gave something away and , vas just as certainly of the opinion that it gave nothing away
0	oh , really , very good !
0	he had been too careless , too generous to attain a solid position in the mercantile world
0	quite right , of course , but 'head bare at prayer was al- ways my - prayer , finished dr breisacher relentlessly , is the vulgarized and rationalistically watered-down late form of something very vital , active and strong : the magic invocation , the coercion of god
0	quite so , my dear jean , she said , though she was far from having understood everything , least of all what these big figures had to do with her engaging a man-servant
0	the walks go better in company , ziemssen , old fellow , what ?
0	if i did not kno , , , how to entertain adrian as schild- knapp did , i did have our childhood tie , our du , to my advantage over the silesian
0	frau stöhr , with her chin and shoulder coquettishly meeting , sought to reawaken lawyer paravant to desire
0	a lake was visible in the distant landscape , its waters grey , its shores covered with black fir-forests that climbed the surrounding heights , thinned out , and gave place to bare , mist-wreathed rock
0	he would gratefully accept the permission to accompany him ; but who was the overfilled ’ and how did hofrat
0	but the statement would be inexact
0	he kept guard over his forgetfulness
0	consul budden-brook was moved
0	complaining and despairing voices sounded in the chimney
0	but it n not flabby ; it does not make yon feel irritable
0	but to return , by way of example , to some of those strains and stresses to which hans castorp ’ s state was prone
0	gabled roofs ; con- nected by a criss-crosse labyrinth of covered courts and passages , and adjoining vvarehouses and cellars
0	my age is sixty , for i was born ad , the eldest of four brothers and sisters , at kaisersaschern on the saale , in the district of merse- burg
0	i said to myself : 'tom has been going about lately feeling very down in the mouth
0	the russians presented their gift , a large round silver plate , with the hofrat ’ s monogram engraved in the middle ; its utter inutility was plain to every eye
0	i tell you , it doesn ’ t matter in the least what a man ’ s views are , so long as he is a decent chap
0	even in the glittering winter they spent days in ettal , oberammergau , mittenwald ; and when spring came , these excur- sions increased , to the famous lakes and the theatrical castles built by the nation 's inadman
0	it guarded against the fever attending the di- gestion of hearty ineals
0	the priest stood on the threshold and spoke soothingly , i can see now just how he stuck his head out and drew it back again while he talked
0	but for all that , behind this so lovely and pleasant artistic production stood—death
0	i much prefer the dinners to the balls myself
0	the actual pain in the nerve seemed deadened ; in his mouth was only a dull , heavy burning sensation
0	and jolly bachelors on fire
0	the man is a boon—for god ’ s sake , is he not a personality ?
0	but consul hagenstrbm 's son limped perceptibly when he went home
0	anyhow , nobody for a long time thought of connecting young adrian in any way with music
0	he put away the book in the drawer of the garden table
0	wehsal shrugged his shoulders , as much as to say that precisely that extreme case was a contingency ; thus reducing to silence hans castorp , who was inclined to forget the fact
0	behrens did not set a limit ; he is a long-headed man , and doesn ’ t play the prophet
0	would holger not make up some poetry for them ?
0	but now it was her haven , her hap- piness : a bourgeois happiness , which obviously looked more acceptable because it possessed the charm of novelty ; the foreign nationality was a new frame into which she would be trans- planted
0	anonymous and communal , said hans castorp
0	well , tony , what do you say to it ?
0	- i have always feared adrian 's proneness to laughter , never been able , like rudiger schild knapp , to play a good second to it ; and the same fear , the same shrinking and misgiving awkwardness i feel at this gehen- nan gaudium , sweeping through fifty bars , beginning with the chuckle of a single voice and rapidly gaining ground , embracing choir and orchestra , frightfully swelling in rhythmic upheavals and contrary motions to a fortissimo tutti , an overwhelming , sar- donically yelling , screeching , bawling , bleating , howling , piping , whinnying salvo , the mocking , exulting laughter of the pit
0	thus he would speak of the dos banderas—the two standards—the satanic and the celestial , beneath which the armies gathered for the great struggle : the one near jerusalem , where christ was the capitán general of all the faithful , the other on the plains of babylon , of which the caudillo or chieftain was lucifer
0	i will keep faith with death in my heart , yet well remember that faith with death and the dead is evil , is hostile to humankind , so soon as we give it power over thought and action
0	kretschmar had not allowed it to upset his belief in the calling of his pupil
0	and when i am his wife , you will see , ida , i will take care that he has ambition and gels ahead and makes an effort and is a credit to me and all of us
0	the cousins sat at a table by themselves , rather apart from the others , for hans castorp was smoking with his dark beer , which he had brought out from breakfast
0	her daughter-in-law , frau consul elizabeth buddenbrook , born kroger , laughed the sputtering kroger laugh and tucked in her chin as the kr�s did
0	poor creature , she said
0	in such adventures , among such discoveries , the night wore away
0	they walked rather rapidly through the entry
0	but when it is fixed upon a human being , with a human face , then we begin talking about love
0	old fiete shooed it cautiously away , taking care not to touch the forehead of the dead , putting on a seemly air of absent-mindedness—of obscurantism , as it were—as though he neither might nor would take notice of what he was doing
0	he does not turn his head , on purpose , but i can see by the expression of his back that he is listening
0	it would upset everything , they would have to begin all over
0	when he did , he blushed unawares
0	as a moderate man and son of culture i have indeed a natur
0	adieu , darling little anna
0	jean , if you love me -- do you want to expose yourself to this danger ?
0	this new evil genius had , like the other , always been present , as it were , in the germ , but now it began to spread itself ; hans castorp had by nature no great predilection for becoming its slave ; yet with something like horror he observed that even he , when he let himself go ever so little , fell victim to a contagion so general that scarce anyone in the circle escaped it
0	he could scarcely see for the fog
0	well , daghestan—i don ’ t know the climate , it is probably better , when all is said and done , than being right down on the water
0	then he went behind the camera , and stood just as a photographer would , legs apart and stooped over , to look inside
0	no , i think there are other doctors in the world !
0	one evening , when they were alone
0	he stroked his mous-tache with his two fingers , punctiliously arranged his writing materials and glass
0	the effect of the inoculations on the entire organism was very noticeable , the nervous system reacted as after hard muscular exertion ; and their strength was displayed in the heightened fever which was their immediate result
0	man ’ s imperishable part , his ashes !
0	'yes , that made an impression , and i have certainly shown my good will , at least
0	the whole remote and lovely spot was wrapped in a sounding solitude by the noise of the rushing waters
0	pig-drawing , a diversion introduced by high authority on a long-ago carnival evening , had had its little day , and led up to geometrical teasers which for a time consumed all the mental powers of the berghof world , and even the last thoughts and energies of the dying
0	director wulicke gave utterance to a sound that was as though the lowest string of his double-bass had been violently plucked , and herr modersohn wrung his small , clumsy , inky hands repeating plaintively over and over
0	they parted , with a brief see you later at the door of number thirty-four ; hans castorp piloted himself through his room to the balcony , where he dropped just as he was upon his deck-chair and , without once shifting to a more comfortable posture , sank into a dull half-slumber , broken by the rapid beating of his unquiet heart
0	noth- ing harder , generally speaking , than getting into real paris society
0	of course in these pages i can only picture in a foreshortened form , just as i did with his school-days , the two years of our youth that i spent at halle with my friend ; the course of them interrupted , indeed , by holidays in kaisersaschern and at his fa- ther 's farm
0	opposed to it stood the protestant , the pietistic sphere , which had its origin in mysticism
0	friendship which caused me much distress and alarm , but always filled me too with pride : genius is a forin of vital power deeply experienced in illness , creating out of illness , through illness crea- tive
0	he proceeded to show himself immensely well informed upon current events , and gave his approval to the state of world affairs , in so far as they were running a course favourable to the progress of civilization
0	hans castorp did not conceal from himself that this smile had in it the seeds of corruption ; he knew in his heart that time was pressing
0	it failed to deliver the renowned meteorological specific in anything like the quantity indicated by the prospectus , quoted by old inhabitants , or anticipated by new
0	he , siegismund gosch , would have it on his hands , simply on his hands , and it would be the ruin of him
0	adrian talked with spengler , who was already in wretched health , his disease having attacked his heart , and laughed with the rest of us at the clowneries of leo zink , who leaned back at table and covered hinself with his huge damask serviette like a sheet up to his fantastic nose and folded his hands peace- fully atop
0	if man fails in feeling , it is blasphemy ; it is the surrender of his masculinity , a cosmic catastrophe , an irreconcilable horror— he drank
0	in whatever touched him she showed a surprising , even an unpleasant effrontery
0	bishop flowed in streams , and sesemi 's ginger-bread was very spicy
0	the gentlemen knew he had a certain grudge against life up here often enough he had railed against it ! —all honour , then , to the mountain spring !
0	settembrini glared at him
0	there were , on the other hand , the two sons of consul hagenstrbm , two fine strapping boys , twelve and four-teen years old , strong and full of spirits , who instituted prize-fights in the neighbouring woods , were the best gymnasts in the school , swam like otters , smoked cigars , and were ready for any deviltry
0	he tried various devices to disguise the weakness , for he could not continually support his chin on his collar ; he would keep his head in action , turning it to the right and left in conversation , or bear hard against the table with the left forearm when he carried a spoonful of soup to his mouth , and support his head with his hand
0	i am a grown man -- you do not in the least know what you have to do
0	she went on , staring before her at the brown carpet
0	verily he had done well , to march stoutly on despite all obstacles , until now human dwellings appeared , in sign that the inhabited valley was at hand
0	according to all accounts he has had to pay up pretty heavily , and transactions with bankers make dear money
0	i have been talking the whole time about myself ; i am a selfish thing
0	consul buddenbrook kissed his daughter on the forehead and said , go up to your child , antonie
0	herr k�n felt a great need to unfasten a few buttons of his waistcoat ; but it obviously would not do , for not even the el-derly gentlemen were permitting themselves the liberty
0	you know now who it was—before this present relationship was established which it would be absurd of me not to respect—with whom clavdia spent—or experienced , or committed—that twenty-ninth of february
0	i ’ ve always been a civilian and cared more about warm baths and good eating and drinking , whereas he has gone in for manly exertion
0	and thomas buddenbrook said yes and amen
0	but there came to be another , more definite goal to his glances , at table , on their walks , and in the salon of an evening
0	but just here , it seems to me , lies the excuse for vice ( you must pardon me , but i incline by nature to excuses , though there is nothing large ’ about them—i am quite clear on that point ) in so far as it is a result of impotence
0	leverkiihn , to 'whom i conveyed these impressions of mine , 'was unusually ailing at this time , in a way that had something humili- ating in its torments
0	on the periphery of its field it would come in contact with the marked counters ; and if the letters on these , when put together , made words that conveyed any sort of sense , the resultant phenomenon would be complex and contaminate , a mixed product of conscious , half-conscious , and unconscious elements ; the actual desire and pressure of some , to whom the wish was father to the act , whether or not they were aware of what they did ; and the secret acquiescence of some dark stratum in the soul of the generality , a common if subterranean effort toward seemingly strange experiences , in which the suppressed self of the individual was more or less involved , most strongly , of course , that of little elly
0	she had a good little head , and did as well in the school as one could desire ; but her conduct in other ways was far from satisfactory
0	the next day , of course , he was more dead than alive
0	no , he did not like going to school -- the old monastic school with its cloisters and vaulted classrooms
0	ah , the fatal facility of youth !
0	he agreed to the qualification , the more easily because what he had vaguely in mind was as un- wagnerian as possible , and most remote from nature-d
0	he sought again and again to pull himself together , to clear his countenance , to tell himself that this was a great day which was bound to heighten and exhilarate his mood
0	we all call her that up here , because it ’ s the only thing she says
0	one group of records contained the closing scenes of a certain brilliant opera , overflowing with melodic genius , by a great countryman of herr settembrini , the doyen of dramatic music in the south , who had written it to the order of an oriental prince , in the second half of the last century , to celebrate the completion of a great technical achievement which should bind the peoples of the earth together
0	you see , the pattern repeats itself on the whole set
0	germany is free , in so far as one may apply the word to a land prostrate and proscribed
0	yet the last traces of the sunset linger above and beyond
0	in the spring there had been a street riot , although a con-stitution corresponding to the demands of the new time had already been drafted ; which , a little later , despite the opposition of lebrecht kroger and other stubborn old gentlemen , be-came law by a decree of the senate
0	such a position requires no certificate or juristic training ; it is arrived at after a term of years of preliminary service by passing the examinations for sec- retary in chief
0	not so hans castorp
0	no , for even the house , the courtyard , and the family itself were all very like the buchel setting
0	youth in the ultimate sense has nothing to do with political his- tory , nothing to do with history at all
0	he stooped slightly too , or rather , shrank together ; though even so he overlooked herr ludovico , and was a whole head taller than little naphta
0	as they sat , behold , there came hofrat behrens through the garden
0	the equipage turned into the mengstrasse , and the fat brown horses stood snorting and stamping before the buddenbrook door
0	the authorities had ceased to devise him distractions
0	he rejected all idea of a monstrosity , whatever attaches in the popular mind to mythological combinations of the human and the animal ; and declared that he did not find admissible mytho- logical fictions of that kind
0	there was too much red all over the face , the nose was badly out of drawing , the colour of the hair badly hit off , too straw-colour ; the mouth was distorted , the peculiar charm of the features ungrasped or at least not brought out , spoiled by the exaggeration of their single elements
0	yet it was enough for him to breathe other air , be exposed to other influences , to bring about a complete estrangement , a hope- jess aloofness in the place of confidence and mutual understand- ing
0	he has nerve enough -- it would not trouble him at all
0	only it sounds strange to hear it like that , hans castorp said
0	and this philistine philosophy , this gospel of work and reason , served herr settembrini as an ethical system
0	sister alfreda had already packed her little trunk and left the berghof , to go to another moribundus in another establishment
0	the hofrat had seen the old as well as the fresh spots , and strands ran from the bronchial tubes rather far into the organ itself—strands with nodules
0	who told you so ?
0	sometimes it was even malignant , this outward beauty : certain conical snails , charmingly asymmetric specimens bathed in a veined pale rose or white-spotted honey brown , had a notoriously poisonous sting
0	the thing was to achieve an absolute cure , and to that end behrens had just lately socked him another six months
0	of germany the , opposite is true , and tl : at you would feel and know , leverkiihn , if you were not adrian leverktihn - in other words , too cool to be young , too clever to be religious
0	he was not going to the meeting-place to be salved and bandaged , but to lay about him , and that in grim earnest
0	behrens never recognized him , though it was broad day , and our beginner had well-nigh collided with him
0	he had a great weakness for the theatre and for other distractions of the great city
0	sundered from the shepherd of his original fold , orphaned , forsaken , full of craving after freer air and forms of existence upon which his native gifts gave him a claim , naphta , who was long past the age of consent , was so impatient for profession that he saved his patron all the trouble of winning this soul—or rather , this extraordinary head—for his sect
0	i do not doubt it , said he , and doubt not of its success
0	natu-rally , she received summary notice
0	she was weak enough !
0	now , hold your head up -- let your arms hang down quietly at your sides
0	accordingly , in the nike salon , rosa schneidewein was served with coffee and the little one with milk and cake
0	i-ie was greatly enlivened
0	the first word she pronounced dolce , with some reminiscence of her musical husband ’ s italian vocabulary ; but the second suggested jubilee , or an attempt to yodel , or goodness alone knew what
0	if chance took her up or down the stairs just as herr weinschenk passed that way -- and chance did this not seldom -- the director took off his top-hat , displaying his short black hair , which was already greying at the temples , minced rather more than ever at the waist of his frockcoat , and greeted the young girl with an admiring glance from his bold and roving brown eye
0	the many-sidedness of his activities , while they made me anxious for his health , his thirst for experience , accompanied as it was by a critical attitude , justified such dreams
0	dead and buried hopes spring once more to life -- and again are blasted
0	once more he would rejoice in real , solid time , the long , vital years of youth
0	i see that i must be very quiet , for the present
0	by which he meant that he still had an interminable deal of work to do before he arrived at the goal and could settle back to enjoy himself
0	joachim , preux chevalier , said something to her in english , which she answered in a monosyllable without ceasing to chew , and relapsed again into silence
0	but this was to much for his powers of self-command , his shrewdness and resource
0	weak human being that he was—though tolerably well equipped with the weapons of civilization—what he at this moment knew was the fascination of venturing just so far into the monstrous unknown , or at least abstaining just so long from flight before it , that the adventure grazed the perilous , that it was just barely possible to put limits to it , before it became no longer a matter of toying with the foam and playfully dodging the ruthless paw—but the ultimate adventure , the billow , the lion ’ s jaws , and the sea
0	hans castorp too , though there was echoing in his ears that large-hearted of course , of course out of the past , held back , and at the last moment was rather inclined to pass the choice on
0	that was , of course , the right way not to go to sleep , and now he felt not the slightest inclination
0	stopped close in their houses
0	i have just been coming to that conclusion
0	i read it too , of course , for want of a better one ; but it is not so very thrilling to hear that wholesale dealer consul so-and-so is going to celebrate his silver wedding !
0	i am next you on the right
0	the ends of sievert tiburtius ' long , thin whiskers are parted over his shoulders , and his small grey eyes now and then open wider and wider , most unexpectedly , and grow larger and more prominent till they almost jump out of his head
0	but i can not wait any longer
0	at the moment of slipping off one might give a start—yet what sleep could be purer than this in the icy air ?
0	the first time i came up , nobody was near enough to get hold of me ; the second time , the scow went over my head
0	when we were schoolboys we used to pinch each other 's arms and say : 'what is the name of the river at swartau ?
0	after the music , however , there would be a long explanation of the relation of this style of music to that of the strenge satz ; and one day herr pfiihl admitted that , while not personally interested in the theme , he saw himself obliged to add a chapter to his book on church music , the subject of which would be the application of the old key-system to the church- and folk-music of richard wagner
0	i-ie had a social presence and had been en- nobled personally by the late king ; was much sought after and high-priced
0	a keen and tortured intellect breathed in the words , and , probing further , the good father discovered a command of fact and a caustic elegance of thought made only the more surprising by the ragged exterior of the youth
0	then you sat down and began to put the inner one about you : first lengthwise , on both sides , up to the shoulders , and then from the feet up , stooping over as you sat and grasping the folded-over end , first from one side and then from the other , taking care to fit it neatly into the length , in order to ensure the greatest possible smoothness and evenness
0	but the consul , after sunday supper , in the hall , made the discovery , thanks to the décolleté of frau redisch ’ s spangled black frock , that her bosom was very white and voluptuous , the breasts pressed together so that the crease between them was visible for some way ; and the mature and elegant gentleman was as much shaken by this discovery as though it possessed for him a new and undreamed-of significance
0	but that he had never done in the klammer pool , only in its counterpart at buchel , the cow trough
0	the look he directed upon me as i approached had something violent and unbalanced about it , quickly resolved , to my great grief , in gloomy repugnance
0	what is there to hear , my dear wenzel ?
0	therese weichbrodt had given up her pensionnat in the past year
0	the sky above the valley was a deep southern blue and the pastures beneath , with the cattle tracks running across and across them , still a lively green
0	all works of art whose function it is to express the soul and the emotions , naphta responded , are always so ugly as to be beautiful , and so beautiful as to be ugly
0	but do explain this one thing to me , he went on
0	hans castorp said whimsically
0	he marked off the outer limits by lines dug with his heel in the snow , the inner by means of two canes , his own and settembrini ’ s
0	but they did recommend it , from the beginning
0	is not it possible for him to leave himself time enough ?
0	it seemed as though he feared and avoided not only the indelicate expression of deep and solemn feeling , but even the feeling itself
0	no , she is dead
0	ever since the first sunday in advent a great gaily coloured picture of a certain ruprecht had been hanging on the wall in grandmama 's dining-room
0	of course this misfortune was only revealed afterwards
0	his table-mates grasped quickly the state of affairs
0	i am lying up here , he said , paying full pension
0	upon this point elly was silent
0	the management was on the ground-floor
0	we are familiar with that spirit—and we have no great love for it
0	how make plain to the sober intelligence of the flat-land the changes that took place in the inner economy of our young adventurer ?
0	over his waistcoat he wore a long , thin gold chain that had belonged to his grandfather , and on the fourth finger of his broad but delicately articulated right hand was the old seal ring with the green stone
0	yes -- pneumonia , said dr langhals , with a solemn and correct bow
0	it was undoubtedly aware of itself , so soon as it was life ; but it did not know what it was
0	they did not even spend the night at schweigestill 's , for both had to work next morning and must take the train back from waldshut to munich
0	a moment later she leaned over and began to count the prune-pits on her brother 's dessert-plate : tinker , tailor , soldier , sailor -- finishing triumphantly with senator when she came to the last pit
0	eternal snow , if you like
0	ah , it was already familiar to their ears ; yet he would wager the cousins had never before rightly grasped its meaning and its majesty : the word was—civilization !
0	it is probably not only disgraceful , but stupid into the bargain
0	as for exports , well , we send a little corn to holland and england , it is true
0	she began to guess
0	somebody gasped with the effort he made -- then all was still again
0	wherever heir ballerstedt thought explanation necessary , he puffed himself up , said well !
0	it was cut with a modest little round neck like a schoolgirl ’ s frock , hardly so much as to show the base of the throat , or the collar-bones , or the slightly prominent bone at the back of the neck , beneath the soft fringes or her hair
0	the devil fly away with gaffky !
0	and he was underhanded
0	he began in a low murmur , so that very few understood his opening sentence or made anything out of it
0	of course they did not - how should they ?
0	it was early afternoon
0	ah , the principles and points of view constantly did that ; it became so hard for hans castorp ’ s civilian responsibility to distinguish between opposed positions , or even to keep the premisses apart from each other and clear in his mind , that the temptation grew well-nigh irresistible to plunge head foremost into naphta ’ s morally chaotic all
0	they stood and looked out over the dripping slope across the narrow , stony strip of beach , out to the turbid , restless sea
0	what he actually lacked , in fact , was an emotional bridge between two extremes
0	that italian who—whom i did not like
0	strangeness , tension , even suppressed hostility there was of course enough between them ; it is surely rather remarkable that a comparatively insignificant personality could have held them together
0	afterwards , too , he realized that frau stöhr had nudged dr blumenkohl in the side , and then looked about at their own and other tables , trying to catch people ’ s eyes
0	for the rest , he asserted his independence to himself and others by the funda- mental refusal to be obliging : when one needed him , he was defi- nitely not to be had
0	career -- what a lovely word 'career ' is !
0	the removal of joachim to this stately receptacle , decorated with lions ’ heads and rings , was the sole affair of the man who came along with it , a black-clad functionary of the undertaking establishment which had the arrangements in hand
0	my own name -- if i may be-permitted to mention it , he continued , waxing eloquent , is-that of most of my forefathers -- bendix
0	in the beginning it is all pretty good ; but why do you suddenly fall from b major into the six-four chord on the fourth note with a minor third ?
0	he was quite absurdly surprised to hear that there still existed such things as freemasons ; and diligently plied the terrorist with questions about the origin and significance of this curious body , which in a few years would celebrate its two-hundredth birthday
0	to es- tablish a fixed relation between the values of the notes did not
0	feddermann , he said , will you please recite the poem ?
0	when he laughs he draws the air in through his teeth in little jerks
0	but the words sounded strained
0	soon afterwards , however , she prepared to leave tow ! l and fill an en- gagement as jeune prelziere in the provinces , which her teacher , who played father parts at the hoftheater , had got for her
0	things even went so far that one day the school-mistress , a certain fr�ein agathe vermehren , felt obliged to call upon the frau consul , and , flushed with embarrassment , to suggest with all due politeness that the child should receive a paternal admonition
0	in other words , they would ask the bathing-master to see the oberin , in order that something might be done to relieve the sufferer
0	five hundred cows are before your mind 's eye , said gerda , looking at her in the mirror
0	i can sit down yonder on those boulders
0	despite his tanned face and broad shoulders his health was not always sound and as a younger man he had spit blood ; in other words , tended to be tubercular
0	it was an extra occasion , i enjoyed it no end—
0	we dealt with the matter of our present mode of ex- istence ; and deutschlin protested that it was poor taste for youth to explain youth : a form of life that discusses and examines itself thereby dissolves as form , and only direct and unconscious being has true existence
0	while they went across the court , thomas said : we will walk a few steps up and down the garden , my friend
0	war , then , and if needs inust , war against everybody , to convince everybody and to win ; that was our lot , our sending ( the very word we use is germanic , the idea pre-christian , the whole concept a tragically mythological , musical-dramatic motif ) ; that was what fate had willed , and 'we - only we !
0	you are very kind , papa , the consul 's wife said
0	there was given to lle a thorn in the flesh , the messenger of satan , to buffet me
0	but that is just the kind of people you pick out to say such things to ! -- if it is neces-sary to say them at all -- and so you lay yourself open to an insolent snub like that
0	i happened to hear somebody say so , and it just crossed my mind
0	i shall not be going too far in saying at once that she is politically suspect
0	i am only eager to make the acquaintance of the great unknown , the bringer of the terror
0	he does seem rather weird , was hans castorp ’ s view
0	i wanted to tell you that i am about to - i told him what i was about to do , told him about helene , how i had met her and we had got to know each other
0	i am quite willing to give adrian 's favourite vvith the like-co loured eyes due credit for the suggestion
0	they did so—by the latter
0	said he , not looking up
0	he was right not to take the separation seriously
0	upon which , herr gr� made another deep bow , settled himself again , stroked his beard , and coughed as if to say : well , let us get on
0	it hovered before him , somewhere in space , remote from his grasp , yet near his sense ; this body , this opaquely whitish form , giving out exhalations , moist , clammy ; the skin with all its blemishes and native impurities , with its spots , pimples , discolorations , irregularities ; its horny , scalelike regions , covered over by soft streams and whorls of rudimentary lanugo
0	such was his ignorant and hypochondriac judgment , right only as to the unfruitfulness of the result , but there wholly
0	when they returned , rudolf re- joiced in the prerogative that up to then , from our childhood on , had been mine alone : he and adrian were per due
0	rudi schwerdt- feger , zinl { and spengler , even schildknapp , they were all there
0	i think it ’ s quite possible i shan ’ t be able to stop , that i ’ ll have to leave—you wouldn ’ t take it amiss , would you ?
0	is there perhaps some porter ?
0	he was a native of north-western germany , and it was common knowledge that when he took the position , years ago , he had done so contrary to his previous intention and plans
0	let us shut our eyes , safe in eternity !
0	he was faithful to morning and evening prayers , asked per-mission to attend one of the frau consul 's sunday school classes , and even appeared on a jerusalem evening in the drawing-room and was presented to the guests , but withdrew affrighted when lea gerhardt began to read aloud
0	then you are a phenomenon worthy of study
0	we don ’ t feel the cold , hans castorp said , with tranquil brevity
0	we are at the end , i suppose
0	then came the ferry , and israelsdorf avenue , jerusalem hill , the castle field
0	you will tire of it—and then , i am not prudish , not an outraged middle-class housewife—
0	he had looked on enough at the sport to know the use of his tools ; and choosing for his practice-ground an almost treeless slope not far behind the sanatorium , remote from the hubbub of the spot where other beginners learned the art , he began daily to make his first blundering attempts , watched by herr settembrini , who would stand at a little distance , leaning on his cane , with legs gracefully crossed , and greet his nursling ’ s progress with applause
0	what do you mean by that ?
0	he stands still in the doorway , with his flowers held out in front of him , and be-gins straightway to speak
0	at half past ten the servant came from the house to announce that the frau senator was receiving guests in the salon
0	he must have been , at bottom , cruelly bored by the small , safe business he did and the petty trans-fer of this or that bit of property ; for this loss , this tragic blow with which heaven had stricken him down -- him , the schemer cosch -- delighted his inmost soul
0	what i call natural and international law , you are free to call the ius divinum
0	do you think i ’ ve no eyes in my head ?
0	yet in their pure white dress they afforded a scene of glorious winter splendour , mounting bold and austere between wooded gorge and wide expanse as we wound among them
0	joachim availed himself of both , finding they gave relief
0	there were pots of marmalade and honey , basins of rice and oatmeal porridge , dishes of cold meat and scrambled eggs ; a plenitude of butter , a gruyère cheese dropping moisture under a glass bell
0	you are right , replied the consul
0	everything was going well , his predictions seemed about to be verified
0	no , it doesn ’ t trouble me
0	but this he only said with his reason—to some extent detached from the rest of him , though after all nearly concerned
0	stu-pid and lazy both -- it is really too much
0	its concern is a cosmology proper to fcaisersaschern and its towers : it leads to astrology , to observation of the position of the planets , the constellation and its favourable or unfavourable indications - quite naturally and rightly , for nothing is clearer than the intimate interdependence of the bodies of a cosmic little group so closely bound together as our solar system , and their near neighbourly mutual reference
0	the first hint came when i saw among his papers a note that he had written with a broad pen-nib : this sadnesse moved dr faustum that he made note of his lamentacyon
0	then he stood a long time in the death-chamber and looked at the short figure under the covers , at the dead face with the mild features and white whiskers
0	he saw , he knew , he understood , no least particle more ; he let himself sink deep in the pillows , quite blinded and exhausted by the morsel of truth which had been vouchsafed
0	have you pupils , master ?
0	every compassion , every grace , every sparing , every last trace of consideration for the incredulous , im- ploring objection 'that you verily can not do so unto a soul ' : it is done , it happens ,
0	it is my duty to point out to your tender years the intellectual perils of intercourse with this man , and to beg you to keep your acquaintance with him within safe limits
0	now for-get the pain , it says
0	ten minutes later he came back , smiling , if rather pale , and with excuses on his lips for the disturbance
0	it is the imitation of a theme composed backward instead of for-ward -- a very , very difficult thing
0	yes , here it is , faust , valentine ’ s prayer
0	and a tiny , taper-decked tree burned likewise , it was said , in the rooms of the bedridden and moribund—each had his own
0	n one felt outraged over the dishonesty : they spoke of it as an act of folly , laughed a bit , and shrugged their shoulders
0	it possessed her altogether
0	that you will see , answered the consul
0	no threats were graven upon the bronze tablets , nor did those who came to petition fear the countenance of the judges he read in fear and trembling , read with design badly and disjointedly , purposely omitted some of the elisions that were marked with pencil in kilian 's book , made mistakes in the lines , progressed with apparent difficulty , and constantly expected the master to discover the fraud and pounce upon him
0	well , all that young hans castorp found worth listening to ; not precisely overwhelming , of a value largely experimental , but still worth listening to
0	one after another he mentally summoned up various people , the thought of whom might serve him as some sort of mental support
0	why she should call me young un i can ’ t imagine
0	and now , with hopeful hearts , we might rlrink together to the family health and to its future -- that future when all the old and elderly of the present company would be laid to rest ; and to the children , to whom the christmas feast most properly belonged
0	the deep-blue , star-shaped gentian and the autumn crocus , pale and poisonous , appeared again among the damp grass , and a reddish hue overspread the forests
0	what is there in it ?
0	you were right to laugh at his ruthful tears - aside from the fact that whoever has , by nature , dealings with the tempter is always at variance with the feelings of people , al- ways tempted to laugh when they weep , and weep when they laugh
0	he stands there , within the aura of her personality as it sweeps past , idiotic with happiness at the encounter , and at the word which has been uttered by her mouth directly for his ear
0	more and morc , after the dilatation of the stomach had been cured without diminishing the headaches and nausea , he shifted his explanation of the symptoms to the brain , confirmed therein by the emphatic demand of the patient to be spared the light
0	it was only necessary that the delicate child should conceal his thin-skinned perceptions and assume an air of unconsciousness ; when there was nothing to prevent his taking friendly advantage of naphta ’ s invitation
0	but she also - it came out by accident - knew pfeiffering ; had secretly made acquaintance with the setting of adrian 's activity , his immediate surroundings ; had , if i am not mistaken , stood under the window of the abbot 's cham- ber and gone away unseen
0	rudolf was always com- pliant
0	i will look on for a while , said he , brushing the wet from his coat
0	so hans castorp , when asked at table , might add a couple of tenths to his temperature , and could never help feeling flattered when they shook their fingers at him and called him an artful dodger
0	her room was next to tony 's , divided only by cur tains from it
0	there was a natural fitness in the fact that after adrian joined us the landscape began to rise and the mountain scenery under snow , though still at some distance , to come into vie , v
0	we came to the rescue , we freed germany from the invader -- tony , chin in hand , stole a look at him and wondered for a moment if he could have actually helped to drive out napoleon
0	thus all waited silently for the consul
0	i have heard him say : the work of art ?
0	before i forget it , julie would rejoin , would you like one of my apples ?
0	he is bankrupt , she repeated
0	but what is politics for , then , if not to give both sides a chance to compromise themselves in turn ?
0	of course he should have said nuremberg
0	on the flashing surface of the snow , shadows , so strong , so sharp and clearly outlined that they seemed almost more real than the objects themselves , fell from houses , trees , and telegraph-poles
0	but what sort of description is that of yourself—an ailing old man ?
0	no , let us be serious , professore !
0	the tea stood steaming in the meissenware cups when thomas entered
0	i wo not urge you
0	the wind had been two days in the south , the sun bore down , the valley seemed shrunken , the side walls at its mouth looked near and bald
0	and scien- tific musicality - applied sometimes to such simple material as the arietta theme of the monstrous movement of variations which forms the second part of this sonata
0	he unfortunately did not succeed in preserving his composure at the nai have and childish outpourings of his sister
0	i wanted to tell him about helene and of my proposed step , but his renlarks did not precisely en- courage me
0	what is the flesh ?
0	lawyer paravant and the magnus couple were still in the hall , frau stöhr and the kleefeld in the salon
0	for human progress snatched up ever more peoples with it on its brilliant course ; it conquered more and more territory in europe itself and was already pressing asia-wards
0	she looked him in the face
0	from them , or from one of them - he left me the choice -life had once , borne by cosmic projectiles or simply by radiation pressure , arrived upon our formerly sterile and innocent planet
0	well -- er -- i really could not repeat it to a lady
0	the inheritance is a matter of real importance for us
0	a gloomy , taciturn look came on his face
0	the fish-market , how-ever , was held around the fountain in the market-square it-self
0	i find it very serious
0	once a woman , perhaps
0	he had two desires : one of them , the stronger , was to be alone with his thoughts and his stock-taking projects ; and this his balcony assured to him
0	the dance was beginning
0	after a while he asked : et toi—où as-tu été ?
0	hans castorp recalled having heard similar sounds the evening before , though his weariness had prevented him from heeding them : a struggling , a panting and giggling , the offensive nature of which could not long remain hidden to the young man , try as he good-naturedly did to put a harmless construction on them
0	for instance , he , vas always the last comer at a party , he had to feel himself waited for , other people must always wait for him
0	i am still young -- do not you think i am still rather pretty ?
0	but i warn you , castorp , if you are going to give way to your civilian feelings and set up a howl , i ’ ll simply show you the door
0	she busied herself about the room , summoned the malay to take the coffee-machine , then withdrew awhile , and on her return , softfooted , took part standing in the others ’ talk
0	but her eyes , too thoughtful to close themselves , slowly followed the movements of a large insect with a long body , which perpetually besieged the glass with a million soundless motions of his wings
0	perhaps our hero himself was not quite comfortable either ; though he refused to give himself any trouble to wrestle clear of vagueness and involution and arrive at certainty of how much time had gone over his head since he came up here
0	it did not come
0	self as descended from the german humanists of the time of the poets
0	also he occasionally mentioned social affairs , visits , dinners , balls
0	tony was resting in her room
0	i beg your pardon , hans castorp said , a hymn to the devil ?
0	the way he put it , it sounded like shoving music off on me , as though it were more my affair than his
0	do not deny it -- it would be sacrilege
0	he had seen them coming along the level path half-way up the slope ; now they were stalking downhill directly towards him ; he heard their voices
0	it was incomparably more so
0	your position in the matter is quite clear
0	this is nice clean work
0	'how ' means 'what did you say ?
0	a manifestation of the highest energy - not at all abstract , but without an object , energy in a void , in pure ether - where else in the universe does such a thing appear ?
0	as he passed through the dark hall , he felt in his pocket for the letter
0	a gold chain , bequeathed him by his grandfather , now hung about his neck , with the family arms on a medallion at the end -- a rather dismal design , showing on an irregularly hatched surface a flat stretch of marshy country with one solitary ,
0	it was really more for decorum ’ s sake that she had tried to introduce a little sobriety into the mood of her son , not realizing that precisely the middle course , the golden mean , was impossible up here , and only a choice of extremes offered
0	there is so much to be done !
0	its quiet but modish cut was at once marked down by the cousins , whose worldly glances were met by their counterpart , only quicker and keener , from the little man ’ s own side
0	for , as you probably know , permaneder 's right to my dos , is , legally speaking a property right
0	hans castorp threw off his covers , sprang up and strode to the corridor door and back
0	there is a trap door on to the roof from the attic
0	the few roads kept open were like tunnels , with towering walls of snow on either side , crystal and alabaster surfaces that were pleasant to look at , and on which the guests scribbled all sorts of messages , jokes and personalities
0	i should think that , as my brother , you could ostensibly take the place he had -- that of confidential clerk
0	your remark is incomprehensible , settembrini answered him , which doesn ’ t prevent it from being at the same time silly
0	this had led to a crise de nerves , an outburst of despair on clarissa 's part , which went to the mother 's heart , and seiler had been asked to terminate the training and use his connections to get her a start as a beginner
0	others besides friends gathered round as well , curious on-lookers , who cut the rest-cure for the sake of the diversion thus afforded
0	hans castorp interrupted him again
0	little red spots appear on the breast and abdomen , about the size of a lentil
0	i must take my cure
0	in all these years , i have always longed to be out in the world again ; it is so dull here in this house
0	indeed , he might cherish the thought that in making her his he would be raising and rehabilitating her
0	i do not see , my dear friend , why my presence -- but no matter
0	music-stand , and the bas-reliefs of singing cupids over the doors
0	but how get at the confession ?
0	it had a view of the ocean , which was the main thing
0	look , that bench is in a pretty place
0	asked herr gr� , slowly stiffening
0	i-iere it often anunted to a rigidity , a more academic than artistic specu- lation in notes , a mosaic scarcely any longer effective musically , seeming rather more to be read than to be heard - and so on
0	at last they were settled
0	he had drawn up a chair for his sister beside himself , and slowly drank his tea and ate a biscuit as they talked
0	she had grown very old , and lived quite alone at the end
0	it was this very power , quiet yet compelling , that caused consul tienappel all unconsciously to gaze at his nephew ; and now even open-mouthed , for he found his nasal passages obstructed , though , so far as he knew , he had no catarrh
0	here i am -- and i have come with a heavy heart
0	frau permaneder loved these visits
0	i should say so , he answered
0	some- body once warned him in jest not to make some girl- or it might perhaps have been a married woman - unhappy , and he had actu- ally answered , arrogantly : oh , there are so many unhappy !
0	one sunday , as she sat in st mary 's with her parents and brothers , pastor k�ng began preaching from the text about the wife leaving father and mother and cleaving only to her husband
0	after all , these acquirements were premature , they must have burdened his young system , in addi- tion to the preparations for his finals
0	naphta evidently meant to hold humanity fast to its old , irrational position in the face of established biological fact ; meant to force it to remain at the stage of primitive religion , where death was a spectre surrounded by such mysterious terrors that the gaze of reason could not be focused upon it
0	and then , when i see her before me i always think : 'you are an old woman with a big daugh-ter , and your life is over
0	llill not have had nuch joy of him , nor even known ho ' w to take him , at ] cast in so far as they set store by inolfensiveness , expansiveness , friendly responsiveness
0	afterwards— afterwards , yes , gladly
0	he propped his head on his hand and read in his mythology bonk , munching mechanically the while , because that was proper to the day : marzipan , sweet-meats , almond cream , and plum-cake ; until the chest-oppression caused by an over-loaded stomach mingled with the sweet excitation of the evening and gave him a feeling of pensive fnlicity
0	this was the beginning of september
0	the succession of postcards began with the joyous announcement that joachim was with the colours , and a description of the fanatical ceremony in which , as hans castorp ironically couched it in his reply , he had taken the vows of poverty , chastity , and obedience
0	but in a boy 's eyes , as i see it again in retrospect , most gay and glorious of all was the comprehensive display of percussion in- struments - just because the things that one had found under the christmas tree , the toys and dream-possessions of childhood , now turned up in this dignified grown-up display
0	he took up his wanderings again
0	i feel we understand each other , and now—to the point !
0	senator buddenbrook carried out his plans
0	that must be a military trait in my character , after all , if i may say so—
0	you see what kind of trouble i get into every minute—and me so anxious to go my own simple way , unspotted from the world
0	it was furnished as a reading- and writing-room , with oak panelling and a light , vaulted ceiling , bookcases , a centre table covered with newspapers in holders and surrounded with seats , and writing appurtenances arranged in the bay-windows
0	but why , wlen obviously there was no need to take pains ?
0	the state of his health obliged him to give up his theological studies , after which he spent some years in a school belonging to the society , where he acted as prefect and preceptor of the younger pupils
0	and came and found them asleep again , for their eyes were heavy
0	this music has simply nothing in common with the spirit of the sp'ring celebration , which after all was in a certain vay the preparation for it : i mean with the spirit of hum- ble glorification
0	hans castorp rejoined that it was probably all true ; he and his cousin were naturally more or less prone to such dangers—it was the same old story about the delicate child of life , he understood perfectly
0	but the air helps us , helps us hear , if you understand what i mean , this thin , dry air up here
0	it is arsie-versie in the matter , for 't is the brain which gapes at their visitation and looks forward expectantly , as you to mine , that it invites them to itself , draws them unto it , as though it could not bear at all to wait for them
0	reason is not the highest thing on earth
0	i pay every homage to reason , settembrini answered
0	what i ’ d like to say is—i mean , you said , herr hofrat , if i understood rightly , you said : in another relation
0	well , it ’ s like this : it can not have escaped your acute apperceptions that there is something about your case that doesn ’ t hold water
0	the remark sounded final ; but he was far from letting the subject drop
0	then they stood about , looking first at the pump and then at the director , their faces pictures of distress ; and the director , meanwhile , had turned to dr goldener , who hurried up with a very red face and spoke to him in a deep hollow voice , fairly babbling with excitement between the words
0	oh , certainly -- of course he will buy it
0	during its progress joachim entered , and sat down by the open balcony door ; his cousin half reclined in his bed , with his head on one side , and his eyes swimming with pious enjoyment as he listened to the mounting harmonies , and bestowed a momentary metaphorical shoulder-shrug upon settembrini ’ s twaddle about music being politically suspect
0	you reached it after passing the hall , the garderobe , the kitchens and domestic offices ; you could not miss the door , it had a porcelain shield
0	{ noterich 's craving to make himself heard pla ) ting cello and snorting the , vhile
0	interjected the frau consul , shocked
0	the consul quite approved of this , and argued that it displayed love of one 's neighbour , a sense of human fellowship , and a lack of snobbishness
0	the day had come
0	this is naturally a thing to keep wry about , but after all not at the length - when the houre-glasse is set , the red sand has begun to run through the fine-fine neck - ah , but only just begun !
0	but frau schwarzkopf watched tony all the time , to see how much she admired the young man -- and really , it was most interesting , he was so learned and so jolly , all at the same time
0	but admiration and sadness , admiration and doubt , is that not alrnost the definition of love ?
0	when you lie here and look at it , from a distance , it makes you shudder
0	both of them , eh ?
0	true , he had to pay for it : for full two days—that is to say , for the space of ten meal-times , madame chauchat never looked his way
0	but we must be clear on this point , \iatthaeus , said he , that the social ideal of an economic social organization comes from autonomous thinking in its nature enlightening , in short from a rationalism which is still by no means grasped by the mighty forces either above or below the rational
0	on the th of august the news reached me in freising that that remnant of a life had been quenched : a life which had given to my own , in love and effort , pride and pain , its essential content
0	all this seemed to me so much be- neath his dignity that i wished he had told the truth rather than made the fiddler responsible for the idea ; yet i could not quite suppress the question whether our pixy platonist might not have had a hand in the enterprise
0	naturally , in his case it was not the same kind , certainly not ; he had what would have been called at home a feverish cold
0	herr gosch tried to lift his glass to his thin lips , put it back on the table again , cursing through his shut teeth , and struck the offending arm with his fist
0	it was his fatherly duty to occupy himself a little with the child : so , while the plates were changed , he would examine him and try to stimulate his sense for facts
0	that was young schwarzkopf , tony answered
0	on the other hand , if he were overtaken unawares by the storm , he would probably in any case not find his way home
0	her chin was so deeply buried in her hand that her four bent fingers clutched her under lip
0	the lame man took them up in the lift to their own storey
0	leo zink and he were on a cool , sometimes even ticklish footing ; i have often noticed that charmers do not appreciate each other , a fact equally applica- ble to masculine and to feminine conquistadores
0	it was a sort of half-monthly thousand and one nights ’ entertainment , spinning itself out at will , calculated , like the stories of scheherazade , to gratify the curiosity of a prince , and turn away his wrath
0	but the comparison has indisputable justice on its side
0	ru- dolf repeated his wooing , only this time not for adrian but him- self
0	for the molecule was composed of atoms , and the atom was nowhere near large enough even to be spoken of as extraordinarily small
0	it was not matter and it was not spirit , but something between the two , a phenomenon conveyed by matter , like the rainbow on the waterfall , and like the flame
0	he lived in the rambergstrasse , near the academy , as a lodger with the widow of a senator from bremen , named rodde , who with her two daughters occupied a ground-floor flat in a still new house
0	the frau consul looked toward the glass door and , still embracing her daughter , stretched out her hand to her grand-child , who stood there shyly with her finger to her mouth
0	i find your train of thought highly edifying , mynheer peeperkorn
0	the young man took the book in both hands and ran it quickly through , from cover to cover
0	this was the line he sometimes took
0	very well , answered justus kroger , sitting down again with a shrug of the shoulders
0	while he breakfasted below , hans castorp did the same above , his down quilt tucked behind his back , in enjoyment of the good appetite a change engenders
0	he cast about for means to refine upon the position
0	there were two curving prongs of bright steel , extremely sharp-pointed ; a slightly spiral centre portion of gold-inlaid ivory , in which the prongs were somewhat movable and could sink up to a point ; and a bulb of semi-hard black rubber
0	the whole company burst out laughing
0	for the sake of goodness and love , man shall let death have no sovereignty over his thoughts—and with this—i awake
0	we scarcely know how to explain why hans castorp , with all his native love of falling water , had never visited the picturesque cascade in the valley of the fluela
0	in other words , they are the humanistic callings , and if you go in for them you have to study the ancient languages by way of foundation , for the sake of formal training , as they say
0	but he did not know if such courtesies were practised up here ; probably the established order was more powerful than the rules of chivalry
0	what you been doing up here ?
0	hans castorp laughed , to hear his cousin speak thus , quite simply , without explanation
0	pieter peeperkorn lay grievously ill , the day after that evening of cards and champagne we have described—and no wonder
0	i must , must not i ?
0	dh , you can leave that to me , she said , quite undismayed
0	himself by the unnatural correctness of his language , which he used in order to intimidate the master
0	the one saving grace was that he could rail at it
0	he is a born objector , i saw that at once , down on the existing order ; and that always gives me the impression that the person is
0	by all means i am a humanist , because i am a friend of mankind , like prometheus , a lover of humanity and human nobility
0	or he would draw up a chair and sit down at the corner of the table , between hans castorp and the schoolmistress , or between hans castorp and miss robinson , and look on while they ate their pudding , which he seemed to have forgone
0	it changes its meaning ; it abides as a light in t
0	adrian said that he found spengler intel- ligent and agreeable to talk to
0	and the consul puts his hand on the old man 's shoulder and gives him a thaler
0	he could still hear old johann softly humming in the bed room
0	mon- signor hinterpfortner and i are certainly no longer alone in the trembling - and at the same time , god help us , secretly sustain- ing - realization
0	and when he stands there and talks , in his guttural dutch voice , there ’ s something unmistakably robust about him
0	her figure was full and well-proportioned , the impression she made both capable and rustically simple , as one saw her small work-hardened hands , the double widow 's ring on the right one , poised on the firm strong hips , bound by their stiff apron-strings
0	he closed his burning eyes and groaned
0	but if he , vas not there , that visitor - and i shudder at the admission which lies in the very words , seeming even conditionally and as a possibility to en- tertain his actuality - then it is horrible to think that those cyni- cisms too , those jeerings and jugglings , came out of the afflicted one 's own soul
0	and herr consul does not take it ill of me , do ' e , now ?
0	and then he recited , appropriately and with effect , two of the prayers customary on such occasions
0	but notwithstanding all the importance he attached to the projected improvement , he jumped away from the theme and demanded that joachim tell him more about life up here and about the guests—which the latter straightway did , being only too pleased to be able to unbosom himself
0	cyanosis indicated abrupt stoppage , a violent apoplectic arrest of the vital functions
0	but you are right -- what is there to say ?
0	sometimes consul kroger or sesemi weichbrodt came too , with her simple sister
0	somebody must have some esprit , settembrini said , looking straight ahead , with a melancholy air
0	and finally there was thomas buddenbrook himself , as a somewhat younger man
0	i will tell you -- it is too new
0	hand on his shoulder
0	is that worthy of a brother , you will permit me to ask ?
0	no , naphta went on
0	they left behind their own accustomed valley , and the change of scene refreshed their spirits
0	every one wanted to revise the constitution and the franchise , and the citizens grumbled
0	the hair half covered the ears , and as i grew up it was slowly silvering ; it was drawn tightly back , as smooth as glass , and the parting above the brow laid bare the whiteness of the skin beneath
0	she said , with her whole strength ; and looked at them all with a challenge in her eyes
0	shrove tuesday came on apace ; before one had actually seen it on the way , it arrived
0	it appeared that the stranger , who might be about settembrini ’ s age , was a housemate of his , the other tenant of lukaçek the ladies ’ tailor
0	well , i will tell you
0	hanno and several others did the same
0	but -- but -- she saw him before her , saw his gold-yellow whiskers , his rosy , smiling face , the wart on his nose , his mincing walk
0	but i assert they are that the more , and the poly- phonic character of the chords is the more pronounced , the more dissonant it is
0	he declined to accept that brutal fatum et factum
0	if you feel any inclination to blub , kindly suppress it
0	had he enjoyed himself ?
0	he desired to do so
0	it won ’ t do you gentlemen any harm , i take it
0	but now they stood with their mother about their father 's death-bed , weeping ; and a message was sent to meng street , though the feeling was not entirely wanting that their rich relations were somehow or other to blame for this misfortune too
0	he was tired of the cooking , he said ; they all were , up here , and it was customary to grumble at the food
0	wait , i have it—it was avdotia
0	herr gr� had turned his gaze upon her
0	somebody has been flown away with—by the devil
0	once again she yielded , to gain a present peace , and was thereby more than ever in his power
0	this corre- sponded , vith my own feeling
0	lie must have preserved it for a while and then in some moving to munich , to italy , to pfeiffering , it must have got lost
0	reason and magic , said he , may meet and become one in that which one calls wisdom , initiation ; in belief in the stars , in numoers
0	iwersen , the proprietor , a blond giant of a man , in a woollen jacket , was in the doorway with his wife
0	pastor wunderlich had not changed colour ; he looked as pale , re-fined , and alert as ever , while drinking down glass after glass of wine
0	but kant has shown in the most forthright words that such a thesis can not support itself be- fore the bar of reason
0	one word from thy sweet lips
0	thy life shah be cold , therefore thou shajt love no human being
0	you aren ’ t like a picture in a physiology-book , there ’ s a hitch here and there , and you haven ’ t cleaned up your gaffky , you ’ ve even gone up a peg or so , it ’ s six this time—but never mind , don ’ t pull a long face , you are better than you were when you came , i can hand it to you in writing
0	but what 's a man good for , but to wear himself out ?
0	do not say that , thomas
0	he had taken a small thermometer from a red leather , velvet-lined case on his table , and put the mercury-filled end under his tongue on the left side , so that the glass instrument stuck slantingly upwards out of his mouth
0	that villain learned in the law , to , , , horn in a weak moment she had surrendered , used his single conquest to enforce her
0	mynheer peeperkorn had presided at only one evening festivity in all these weeks ; and the group had taken but one short walk
0	the more secret they were , the more they required a third party , the intimate friend , the good man , to whom and with vvhom one could talk about them - and that was i i saw it and took my role upon myself
0	she was sometimes seized by attacks of panic and whimpering , caused by the lassitude which seemed to be constantly on the increase , or by her rising curve ; when she would come sobbing to table , the chapped red cheeks streaming with tears , and wail into her handkerchief : behrens wanted to send her to bed , she would like to know what he had said behind her back was the matter with her , she wanted to look the truth in the face
0	what joachim had said about his cheeks was fully borne out ; they were really purple , and set off his head garishly against the white surgeon ’ s coat he wore , a belted smock of more than kneelength , beneath which showed striped trousers and a pair of enormous feet in rather worn yellow laced boots
0	very good , very good
0	as for tony , the consul was gratified to see with what self-possession she defended her position in the town as a buddenbrook born ; for as a divorced wife she had naturally to overcome all sorts of prejudice on the part of the other families
0	herr gr� , with measured tread , passed between morten and his mother and went out the door
0	it had been a gesture not only of deliberate , but also of natural and instinctive disdain ; and that feeling was quite comprehensible to hans castorp
0	but the way it passed over the tiny intervening unmarked strokes showed that all the figures and divisions on its path were simply beneath it , that it moved on , and on— hans castorp shoved his product of the glashütte works back in his waistcoat pocket , and left time to take care of itself
0	she gave me a camphor injection , applied icecompresses and friction—and here i am , saved for humanity
0	there was a red-haired greek girl , another of unknown origin with a face like a tapir ’ s ; the voracious lad with the thick eye-glasses , and another fifteen- or sixteen-year-old youth , with a monocle stuck in his eye , who carried his little finger , with its abnormally long nail shaped like a salt-spoon , to his mouth when he coughed , and was manifestly a first-class donkey—these , and numerous others
0	hans castorp ate heartily , though his appetite did not turn out quite so stout as he had thought
0	you are so eager—you are very ambitious—she continued thus to mock him , in her slightly veiled , pleasantly husky voice , with her quaint pronunciation , giving a foreign sound to the r and making the vowels too open , even accenting the word ambitious on the first syllable , with exotic effect ; rummaging and peering the while in her leather bag , whence she fetched out , first a handkerchief , and then a little silver pencil , slender and fragile , a pretty trinket scarcely meant for use—the other , the first one , had been something more to take hold of
0	our readers will believe us that his antagonist insisted on giving him tit for tat , paying in the newest-minted coin , receiving in his turn another just as good ; thus the conversation proceeded , on the lines laid down
0	the rest is just a pretty feeble play on words
0	he commanded them the more absolutely in that , so far as he knew , he had never sought the leadership , but was rather called to it against his intention and desire
0	i know , morten , she answered gently , looking away from him at the fine white sand sifting through the fingers of her free hand
0	then there was a quaint old model of a ship ; and right at the bottom a rat-trap
0	to others , wind instruments , to still others strings a
0	as for herr gosch , he was not in the habit of sleeping in the daytime , he was glad enough to get a few hours ' sleep at night
0	herr gr� now said good-bye and departed for hamburg
0	he narrated with colour and vividness
0	as for the old frau consul , she was quite prepared to think of the new house as a logical consequence of all the other blessings which had fallen to her lot , and to give thanks to god therefor , accordingly
0	here now is a third , of quite different mould , not only equalling in disinterestedness those other simpler souls , but even excelling thenl in the ascetic renunciation of any direct approach , the inviolable observance of his privacy , the aloofness , the restraint , the persistent invisi- bility
0	they had a sweet sound in the ears of the daughters of uncle gotthold
0	they fetched the patient at her humble lodging , in glorious , frosty-sunny weather , and escorted her through the english quarter , so named after the hotel d ’ angleterre , and along the main street , lined with luxurious shops
0	he thought his mother had , perhaps ; the others did not seem to be aware
0	from him he gets the charcoal-burner ’ s faith in reason , freedom , human progress , the whole box of tricks belonging to the classicistic-humanistic virtue-ideology
0	you must go on alone now , she said
0	kenness ; so giveth he his soul thereto and cometh among the carrion
0	natures like adrian 's have not much soul
0	i have not asked what you would do in this or that case , but what you to-day , now , will do
0	how could anybody call them airs ?
0	certainly , of course , james tienappel acquiesced , rather intimidated
0	from all quarters of the fatherland came long-haired , black-coated gentlemen , to enjoy the pious intercourse and the nourishing meals , and to be furnished with the sinews of their spiritual warfare
0	not a dressing-gown , for he never used one , even in the mornings , only when he got up in the night and sat an hour or two in his chair
0	hans castorp turned his attention to the preparations for taking joachim ’ s x-ray
0	but in that kingdom they know that he who tastes even once of its fruits belongs to them
0	undoubtedly , though only superficially , as herr settembrini , in his plastic way , had remarked , the comfort on board an ocean steamer did make one forget the element of risk in the circumstances
0	it was , take it all in all , a happy youth for tony
0	how angry i have been !
0	i think i ’ ll just have to present you , as briefly as possible
0	certainly , of course , hans castorp said
0	in the modern style of doing business , there is a thing they call usance
0	he pressed his lips on her brow
0	ience of religion - ideas both of which have somethi , ng provisional about them , for theology therewith prolonged its life
0	and yet , like all the simple , inevitable things , they soothe , they ronsole , after all
0	heaving a sigh , her eye-glass ribbon behind her ear , she had betaken herself thither , since such and only such was the prospect life held out to her
0	it fills it in and breaks it up , so that there ’ s something to it , something going on—to quote , with due and mournful piety , those casual phrases of our departed joachim , all echo of which so long ago died away
0	do we really grasp the meaning of the fact ?
0	suits it to leave the ash long , i don ’ t knock it off more than a couple of times
0	but do not you think it 's cruel to let me know that only out of in- humanity i am what i am and that humanity is not becoming to me ?
0	and cherish with affection true
0	the natural instinct toward industry , common to all these good burghers , began to assert itself : they ventured to bargain a little , to pick up a little business here and there
0	tell me , engineer , he said , how have your family taken the news ?
0	our consent , she repeated after a pause , sadly , and rather bitterly as well
0	i have heard of such things , mostly in hesse , where a few of the landed gentry are in the hands of the jews
0	she lived in the twilight of her curtained living-rooms , and dreaded the sun , the dust , the crowds of townsfolk in their holiday clothes , the smell of coffee , beer , and tobacco ; and above everything else in the world she hated getting hot and upset
0	his little round eyes seemed to have sunk deeper in his head , his cheek-bones and his large aquiline nose stood out more prominently than ever , and the ash-blond hair seemed to have been just touched with a pdwder-puff where it parted on the temples
0	professor kumpf 's good out-and-out ways with the devil were child 's play compared to the psycho- logical actuality with which schleppfuss invested the destroyer , that personified falling-away from god
0	plastic themes in which the apocalyptic work abounds , rising to his mind , there at once to be checked and chilled , to be bridled and bitted and made to take its proper place in the thole structure ?
0	he usually drank out of the little gold mug which uncle justus gave him
0	un- fortunately , my dears , such is the case
0	you ’ re going to hook it ?
0	he said , and pressed his hand imploringly—and the latter noted that the excitement of the journey , the sleepless night , the emotion , made joachim ’ s head tremble on his neck , as his own did when he took stock—hans , he said earnestly , come down soon !
1	there are poor students enough
1	there were consul hagenström ’ s two sons , ages fourteen and twelve , two fine stout lads , strong and high-spirited , who organized real boxing matches in the woods outside of town , who were the best gymnasts in school , swam like seals , smoked cigarettes , and were ready for any kind of mischief
1	because as things stood with people up here , he thought , anyone who had the honor of being healthy didn ’ t count and wasn ’ t going to be asked any questions—and that annoyed young castorp
1	hans castorp made a personal inspection of the deceased
1	she was in despair over this savage burst of antagonism between the two nations to which she belonged , france and germany , and which she believed should complement one another , not brawl
1	from alphabet to syntax and grammar , from counting and the four arithmetic operations to calculating ratios and simple proportions , from memorizing little po�ms ( there really was no memorizing ; the verses were grasped and mastered immediately and with great precision ) to putting into writing his own thoughts on topics of geography or local history-it was always the same : adrian cocked an ear , turned away , and assumed an air as if to say , yes , fine , that much is clear , enough , go on !
1	but , then again , i ’ m not that surprised , either , because i ’ ve never really felt all that splendidly healthy , and when i think of how both my parents died young—then where was such splendid health supposed to come from ?
1	pribislav hippe no longer appeared living before him , as he had eleven months before
1	the young man kept one thumb wedged between the buttons of his jacket ; he scowled , even puffed out his cheeks in defiance
1	or i did know it
1	herr grünlich strode with measured steps between morten and his mother and out the door
1	we ’ re home , settembrini said and for the cousins ’ sake pointed with his cane to a little house before whose gate they had now halted
1	the sanatorium ’ s closer from here
1	it isn ’ t there and yet it is—and that makes for lifelikeness
1	he was clearly anxious to have it understood that humanity was not some idea discovered by freethinkers , their exclusive possession , but that it had always existed and that , for example , the acts of the inquisition had been inspired by the most touching humanity
1	had grünlich in fact been a nobody ?
1	she looked so splendid , and although i have no notion of the finer points of violin playing , i do know that she was able to make her instrument ( a genuine stradivarius ) sing—indeed , it almost brought tears to one ’ s eyes
1	no one knew what thomas buddenbrook was thinking , no one was allowed to know—and that was what was so terribly difficult : keeping the rest of the world ignorant of his sorrow , his hate , his helplessness
1	if winter means darkness , snow , cold , warm radiators—then this is winter again , there ’ s no denying
1	he searched his pockets for a pencil , but could not find one , and neither joachim nor the teacher had one to lend him
1	but of course , he realized angrily , the real scandal is that the walls are so thin and that you can hear everything so clearly , and that ’ s simply intolerable !
1	you should marry someone from here and stay on forever
1	there was no trace now of the new and fresh spirit that thomas buddenbrook had once brought to the firm ; and his partner , herr friedrich wilhelm marcus , whose invested capital was small and who therefore could never have exerted any significant influence , was by nature and temperament a man lacking in initiative
1	good lord , is this still just my first day ?
1	he said softly , four years …
1	then the door slammed and the equipage rumbled off
1	for it is said : be sober , be vigilent !
1	but she hardly seemed to understand what he wanted—since , quite rightly , the idea would never have occurred to her that it might be more tactful to spare joachim and she was much too businesslike to think that anyone , and certainly not a close relative , could possibly indulge in self-deception as to the nature and outcome of the case
1	frau chauchat likewise indulged in filter-tipped cigarettes that she took from a russian enameled box decorated with a speeding troika , which she had laid within easy reach on the table ; nor did peeperkorn scold his neighbor for yielding to the pleasure , though he did not smoke himself , never had
1	the upper class of this commercial and democratic city-state bequeaths its children the burden of higher civilization , and hans castorp bore it on his shoulders with a certain easy dignity
1	jist a tiny li ’ l deal , ma ’ am , with the walkmühle brewery
1	the question of where they would live was settled in an exchange of letters
1	i ’ ve had enough of it , christian said
1	do but recall the lusty temper of the folk among you in germany 's midst , along the rhine and everywhere , in the excitation of high spirits and yet constrained enough , full of foreboding and ill at ease-the hot yearning for pilgrimage to the sacred blood in niklashausen in the valley of the tauber , children 's crusades , and bleeding hosts , famine , insurrection , war , and pest in cologne , meteors , comets , and great signs , stigmatical nuns , crosses that appear upon men 's garments , and now they hope to advance against the turks
1	one afternoon , after looking in vain for him in his room , i found him sitting at a little harmonium that stood in a neglected corner of a hallway in the living quarters
1	hans castorp wrenched himself out of his paralysis and quickly stepped forward once again
1	no doubt of it , that will rouse them for your spirit , that will win them to the faith
1	herr grünlich asked in a gentle voice , apparently what i am reading is not to your taste , fräulein ?
1	they would chat about one thing or another , and the time until second breakfast , which joachim faithfully used for a rest cure , was so brief that even a downright dimwit or lamebrain could not have managed to be bored , whereas it gave hans castorp an opportunity to feast on his impressions of the first three weeks up here and to meditate on his current situation and what it perhaps might lead to—so that he had almost no use for the two thick illustrated magazines from the sanatorium library that lay on his nightstand
1	they all fell silent , smiled , and looked at him expectantly ; here and there someone would add a nod of encouragement to his smile
1	what can i say , herr behrens ?
1	and he left no doubt of his certainty that they all , without exception , labored and were heavy laden
1	the bridge of the nose was thin , its curve delicate ; the cheeks above the beard were set back in the shadow of the cheekbones and seemed even a bit gaunt
1	oh , thomas , christian said , shaking his head very seriously and lifting an index finger rather ungracefully , as far as that goes , that ’ s something you can ’ t really understand
1	it would have been considered totally uncouth and cruel to mention to someone that he or she had been here for three years to the day—it was not done
1	in her dismay , tony stopped eating for a moment
1	it was agreed that joachim should be returned home , and the berghof took care of all arrangements necessary for the transport and whatever else seemed fitting and stately
1	but must afore all else , he continued , also excurse -he corrected himself and said , excuse , but then repeated , excurse-myself to you and beg you to take no offense that our hound praestigiar ,
1	it ’ s all settled and arranged
1	the issue then was the incapacity of the husband to support his family , right !
1	they ’ re coming here to threaten the council
1	and so , after the first interruption in adrian 's cure , its continuation with dr zimbalist came to an end
1	and with her eyes gazing heavenward , she gave fervent expression to her honest emotions , and earnestly , slowly , weightily , she said , no , no , you all know how it is in life
1	he smiled as he addressed him , and once again hans castorp felt sobered at the sight of that delicate , mocking curl of the lip under the sweep of the black moustache
1	in short , no giving up !
1	but what ’ s that odor ?
1	willaert , the founder of the venetian school
1	she hastily let go of her chin and looked him squarely in the eye
1	one need only recall , moreover , the , admittedly very infrequent , introduction of jazz sounds for purely infernal purposes-and i may then perhaps be pardoned my ironic use of the term streamlined for a work that , in its basic intellectual and psychological mood , has more to do with kaisersaschern than with a modern sleekness of attitude and whose nature i would prefer to call ( to use a daring term ) explosive antiquarianism
1	he hated this musical value , a term that he could associate with only one thing : chilly arrogance
1	she saw to it that he would never forget her ; but he , who would never see her again , never forgot her for her own sake , either , and her name-the one he had given her from the beginninghaunts his work like a rune , legible to no one but me
1	all these ecstatic writings , proclaiming judgment , pedagogically fanning the fears of eternal punishment , and arising out of pre­
1	back already from pöppenrade ?
1	he did it , as before , in the stern tone of a cross-examination , adding a scowl
1	oh , but of course you would have to go see for yourself , she said eagerly
1	this is the moment of crisis
1	to prove it to us , he exposed his aquarium to sunlight , while shading it on three sides ; and behold , within a very short time the whole dubious crew-mushrooms , phallic polyps , tiny trees , and algae meadows , plus those half-formed limbs-bent toward the pane of glass through which the light was falling , pressing forward with such longing for warmth and joy that they literally clung to the pane and stuck fast there
1	honor to whom honor is due
1	but would you also like to go upstairs first , perhaps , and rest and refresh yourself a bit , and then come back down here to me ?
1	and now we have a new phenomenon—about which the narrator would do well to express his own amazement , if only to prevent his readers from being all too amazed on their own
1	above all else , love of the fatherland and a boundless hunger for glory
1	to this date i have heard but one gewandhaus concert with schumann 's third as piece de resistance
1	but that ’ s the problem , she continued , crossing her arms , laying her head to one side and tapping the floor crossly with her foot
1	there ’ s snow in january , but almost as much in may , and it can snow in august , too , as you ’ ve noticed
1	you are saving me the embarrassment
1	what about the truth , my dear sir , which is so intimately bound up with freedom , and its martyrs—whom you claim have slandered the earth , but who are instead the planet ’ s most beautiful and everlasting ornaments ?
1	these gray gables were tradition , something old and trustworthy , and they had taken her back in , and here she would live again
1	one of his idiosyncrasies was that at such moments he was impervious to all objections
1	which brings us back to our previous question about his mediocrity or more-than-mediocrity , to which we do not wish to give a conclusive answer
1	there are indications that at one time the brotherhood of the lodge was symbolically sealed with blood
1	we are seriously concerned that the term may be misunderstood , be associated with undignified and outdated notions , with an obsolete model that in no way does justice to the reality we envision here , the product of untiring advances in musical technology , developed to elegant perfection
1	there are sailors with bare tattooed necks , their hands stuck in their wide , low trouser pockets ; grain haulers with blouses and knee breeches of black glazed linen and faces expressing vast integrity ; wagon drivers , who with whip in hand have climbed up on piles of grain sacks to wait out the election results ; servant girls wearing scarves , aprons , heavy striped skirts , and little white caps perched at the backs of their heads and carrying large market baskets over their bare forearms ; the women who sell fresh fish and vegetables , wearing their straw scoop-bonnets ; even a few pretty farm girls with dutch caps , short skirts , and long , pleated white sleeves puffing out from their brightly embroidered blouses
1	should i have someone give you a special copy of the house rules ?
1	and when his uncle asked him what he meant , the nephew replied , jargon
1	the same boy who brooded over arithmetic without any hope of ever understanding it , despite all his special tutoring at school , understood everything that herr pfühl said to him at the piano , understood it and made it his own—if you can be said to make your own what has always belonged to you
1	for she was an artist ( as adrian had been informed beforehand by frau reiff ) , a designer for smaller opera and operetta stages in paris , for the gaite lyrique and the old theatre du trianon , who created and sketched the costumes and sets that served as models for tailors , carpenters , and painters
1	his side-whiskers had been freshly curled , and his face was especially pink this early in the morning
1	gerda , who had said goodbye to christian at the door , entered the room now , and her exotic , close-set brown eyes had taken on the enigmatic shimmer that music always seemed to leave behind
1	the reader can believe us when we say , however , that his opponent was man enough to respond with a brilliant comeback , which he then received in kind ; and so it went for a while and the conversation flowed on into issues previously touched upon
1	i , for my part , was never able to attain such clarity , although it was clear to me that anyone who found himself in a situation where he must ponder such matters would have to assume certain precedents , or indeed predecessors—though i did know that director behrens , who as you are perhaps aware is an amateur painter in oils , had in the course of a great many sittings produced a magnificent portrait of her , with a lifelike mastery of the skin that , just between us , certainly takes one aback
1	i remember that both during the trip there and while we sat at dinner in the neatly kept hotel cater-corner
1	can you believe , for instance , that it was only very shortly before my marriage that i learned that the confederation ’ s laws concerning the universities and the press had been renewed ?
1	my grandfather was half norwegian , and his name was morten
1	but just as the delicate strains died away something truly dreadful happened—it burst over them like an unexpected , fierce storm , overwhelmed them , paralyzed them
1	i am a thorough civilian myself , my cousin often reproaches me for it
1	how are you taking this ?
1	what ’ s your opinion , tom ?
1	tom and tony , who didn ’ t like fish and had been attentively following the adults ’ conversation , called up to the head of the table in unison , oh yes , tell us about it , grandmama !
1	otherwise it is merely a pleasant banality , good for singing calm little songs down on the plains
1	that is what moves me , makes me love them so—the spirit and purpose , if i can put it that way , that lies at the basis of their being and allows them to live together like this
1	rebellio carnis is what the jesuits call it
1	yes , yes , he said , we both have been through a lot , tony
1	and then she revealed to him the whole story of babbit and what had occurred in the bedroom
1	and so it was that , after taking only a few steps down the path of life , he came to regard music as something extraordinarily serious , important , and profound
1	when he washed his neck and arms , his numbed hand simply let the sponge drop to the floor
1	but since , and quite rightly so , dr krokowski continued , one ought not conclude that the whole was itself a perversion simply because its parts were , one was therefore compelled to enlist the legitimacy of the whole , if not its whole legitimacy , and apply it to each of the perverse parts
1	en un mot , the fourberies gracieuses had to be closed again after a very short season , but the experiment had not proved unfruitful for me , either , since it had brought me into contact with the elite of parisian artistic life , with painters , musicians , poets , and in paris today-as i may surely note even here in this spot-there beats the pulse of the living world
1	because externally grünlich was a gentleman—to a tee
1	and in the next instant little johann stood up in bed and stammered something unintelligible ; his odd , golden-brown eyes were wide open now , staring not at the real world all around , but at some totally different world inside him
1	which room have you chosen for our discussion ?
1	for some distance , the darkness of the sea was illuminated by circling and darting will-o ' -thewisps , by the luminous energy with which many of the fish came equipped , so that the entire body of some was phosphorescent , while others were at least furnished with an organ for light , an electric lantern , which they presumably used not only to light their own path through the eternal night , but also to lure prey or signal for love
1	he sat down and began to improvise
1	would take more of a man than i but i ’ d rather have a hearty snack than a whole day of tasteless air
1	for what were lost in the flames were the body ’ s more mutable components , which even in life were burned up in the body ’ s metabolism ; but those components that participated least in life ’ s steady flow and that accompanied human beings through their adult life almost without change , proved to be the most fireproof ; they formed the ashes , and by collecting them , the survivors kept what was immortal about the deceased
1	they dance and whirl and cheer
1	for children did arrive , and with what propriety , with what resolute , one would almost like to say , heroic denial of circumstances that were increasingly less favorable to bourgeois luxury , they were tended and reared-for a world , so to speak , as it had been , not as it would become
1	and then tony would reply , good lord , you ’ re forgetting yourself , sir !
1	his traveling companion ignored it , too , and greeted hans castorp , who had risen from his chair—though she did not extend him her hand , but simply smiled and gestured for him oh , but please to resume his seat and oh , but please not to let her interrupt his tête-à-tête with mynheer peeperkorn
1	finally she asked in a gentle but firm voice
1	i ( keep mutinous silence )
1	he did not drink-always just lightly sweetened tea with no cream , although that three times a day , to be sure-did not smoke , or at most only on rare occasions and , then , quite free from any force of habit
1	by the beginning of april , joachim was a lieutenant
1	above the door was an ornate gilt inscription , just one shining word—quisisana—and the idyllic little cottage was known all over town by that name , which everyone pronounced with soft zs and very indistinct as
1	all such matters were not only foreign and of no significance to religion as such , but also inimical to it ; for they were the constituents of life , or so-called health , which was to say , ultraphilistine , utter bourgeois existence—to which the religious world was ordained to be the absolute opposite , indeed the very genius of opposition
1	and his voice began to waver strangely
1	and with that farewell , which likewise sounded ghastly , since he pronounced it like d ’ gods , he would move on , heading for joachim ’ s balcony
1	in the course of our four semesters at halle , these were undertaken two or three times in corpore-that is , when baworinski put out a call mustering all seventy men
1	true , things were different then—the stories they heard now were from long ago , almost a century past ; it was history , and from history , at least ancient history , they had learned in theory about the type of person presented here—a man of courage , uncompromising in his hatred of tyrants and consumed by the fire of liberty—though they had never thought they would come into such direct human contact with one
1	he was wearing his clinical smock—a stethoscope stuck up out of the breast pocket—embroidered slippers , and no collar
1	on both occasions , along with other pieces representative of this new intellectual music , works by leverkiihn-unfortunately in the absence of the composer-were performed before an audience that was by no means unreceptive , i might say , an audience whose artistic views were republican
1	they certainly would not call that making-do , they replied , and followed her through the solidly built house , looked into the family living room at the front , where the pungent odor of pipe smoke noticeable everywhere was most firmly entrenched ; and then on to the abbot 's study , an agreeable room , not so very large , somewhat older in architectural style than the exterior of the house , its character more that of i oo than i o-wainscoted , with uncarpeted plank floors and stamped leather covering the walls beneath the beamed ceiling , and with pictures of saints in the low-vaulted embrasure and on squares of painted glass fitted into some of the ring-leaded windowpanes ; a wardrobe with iron hinges and locks stood against one wall , which also had a nook where a copper water kettle was hung above a copper sink
1	how strange the word sounded in schleppfuss 's mouth !
1	but it is my sad duty to tell you that your husband has been obliged to stop all payments and is no longer able to carry on his business
1	but it is also possible to imagine creatures whose space requires time to move at a pace so monumental that in their experience our terms for describing intervals like just now and in a bit acquire the vastly expanded meaning of yesterday and tomorrow
1	no , he said , i am not equating them—you ’ re the muddlehead
1	what a coup , what a triumph !
1	oh , love is nothing if not foolish , something mad and forbidden , an adventure in evil
1	peter döhlmann will be there , of course ; he ’ s never in town this time of the year ; his business just trots along on its own like an old hound dog , i guess
1	a cavalier à la mode
1	good heavens , the sheets have to be hemmed
1	frau schweigestill , who was in fact farther away , was beside him more quickly than we who were closer , since , though i do not know why , we hesitated for a second to assist him
1	he was deeply wounded , perplexed at himself and not just himself ; for the suspicion that had crept into his soul after the first mishap now
1	and yet most certainly not everything in breisacher 's remarks was in order ; one could easily have refuted him , pointing out to him , for example , that the spiritual disdain for animal sacrifice is first found not among the prophets , but in the pentateuch itself , where moses himself declares sacrifice to be patently secondary and puts all the emphasis on obedience to god , on keeping his commandments
1	i worry about so many things , and everything is so hard for me
1	at the entrance to front row people were sitting on their stoops and mending nets ; barefoot children came running up , curious to have a peek into the carriage
1	herr ballerstedt swelled up , waved his limp fist , worked his lips , raised his eyebrows , and stared young heinricy straight in the eye
1	the director replied , much as he had—if we may remind the reader—when hans castorp had declared before his first examination that he had a little fever
1	it is like a painfully loving caress of the hair , the cheek-a silent , deep gaze into the eyes for one last time
1	but joachim was so insistent about cutting the party short that there had to be another , unspoken reason—one that hans castorp had come to understand only too well ever since he had realized the precise meaning of joachim ’ s blotchy pallor and the peculiar , woeful way he wrenched his mouth at certain moments
1	he would rather not drink beer today—wanted nothing at all , thanks , at most a little water
1	i beg you , please regard the delicate symbolism of his garb
1	he felt as if christian only told this story with such relish because it gave him an opportunity to scorn and ridicule work
1	the thursday family day was canceled
1	diminished , director behrens dictated
1	it had been the highpoint of his life
1	she watched him go , her face set in the same long-suffering pout with which she had greeted him
1	one ought not , my boy , leave to the suburbanite the final word as to what is sick and what is healthy
1	he turned his back to them
1	what has led man into darkness , and will continue to lead him ever deeper is unbiased ’ —that is , a philosophical—natural science
1	i am firmly resolved to do it
1	they took the bark of this tree , then ground it into a powder , mixed the powder with rasped coconut , rolled the mixture in a leaf , and roasted it
1	it ’ s madness to hold on to the house , it ’ s just dead capital—and it ’ s my job to know about such things , isn ’ t it ?
1	as a matter of fact , the old gentleman had few good words for ida jungmann
1	there was no energy left to run or even increase his stride , and so he simply let his body fall forward in the hope that his legs would manage somehow not to trip him up , but would keep going on their own , stumbling and wobbling as best they could—and he arrived at the outer gate just as the bell stopped ringing
1	he accepted the temperature chart and looked it over while his patient quickly undressed above the waist and hung his garments on a clothes stand next to the door
1	wait until herr throta left and then go to gerda and speak his mind , have it out with her ?
1	and since the real world , the valley populated by human beings , very quickly closed behind him again and was lost from sight , and since no sound could reach him from down there now , he was soon deep in his solitude before he even knew it , more deeply lost than he could ever have wished , so deep that the feeling verged on fear , which is the prerequisite of courage
1	i fear the presence of a tendency that threatens to become an indelible trait of character unless one opposes it head-on
1	i said that adrian returned to the spot to which an impudent porter had led him
1	still only in his mid-forties , that witty man had unfortunately succumbed to his heart trouble
1	then suddenly something happened—a soundless , terrifying something
1	mais c ’ est un sauvage ! —where was i ?
1	do you hear convention abandoned ?
1	grünlich approached me as a man with the best recommendations—a pastor ’ s son , a christian and urbane man
1	thoughts and images tumbled topsy-turvy in hans ’ s mental workshop
1	and then he pulls out his pince-nez ( he always carries three of them , on long cords that dangle at his white vest and get all tangled up ) , sets it on his nose , which he wrinkles up tight , and stares at me pleased as punch , with his mouth wide open , so that i simply have to laugh at him
1	love of humankind , nothing more , and so it , too , was political , it , too , was a rebellion against everything that had soiled and degraded the ideal of humanity
1	and what does she say to me ?
1	peeperkorn was sitting up in bed now and with a lightly trembling captain ’ s hand he would occasionally set the wineglass to his ragged lips and take great , thirsty gulps
1	in the corner , to the left of the sofa and chairs , was a work of art : a painted wooden sculpture set atop a large pedestal draped in red , a profoundly terrifying work , a naive pietà—very effective , almost grotesque
1	you wouldn ’ t believe it , madame permaneder , nor you , senator buddenbrook—but my house on sand strasse has grown utterly too small for us
1	it was precisely for such pronouncements that adrian had an especially sharp ear
1	it leveled everything out by means of abstraction , and since an orchestrated idea was frequently the idea in and of itself , its very substance , there was often hardly anything left of instrumental music when played on the piano
1	his thoughts were not his thoughts—just as he would never have taken the notion to fight a duel on his own , but had only adopted it from naphta , the little terrorist ; they merely showed that he , too , was enveloped by the same inner state that had possession of them all—it had enslaved herr settembrini ’ s beautiful reason , had made it its tool
1	rudiger schildknapp , the translator , who was considerably older than we , probably in his early thirties , was , as noted , a member of the same circle ; and since he was the only one with whom adrian was on closer terms , i too became better acquainted with him and spent many hours in the company of them both
1	for such qualities , my good man , people in the
1	something deep within him resisted the idea , and he knew how to avoid it
1	your temperature has nothing to do with it
1	two pages later , it read : i have had a policy written for my youngest daughter in the amount of courant-thalers
1	but never mind , tom
1	between cries he would reach out his little hands to those around him and wail , help !
1	come by anytime you like , whenever you feel the need for a little colloquy
1	and now , two days after the pastor had departed for home , madame buddenbrook had , with visible hesitation , made a certain disclosure to her son
1	it certainly can ’ t be more than that
1	no , thank god , he saw no one
1	and now , do go in and savor your taking of nourishment
1	no , twenty-eight , hans castorp said
1	you have the conscience of the butcher ’ s dog , but you ’ re a loser , a dolt , a poor fool
1	the wild headlines from below now found their way directly to his balcony door , they sent the berghof into spasms , filled the dining hall with an odor of sulfur that constricted the chest , seeping even into the rooms of the bedridden and moribund
1	your guardian angel has been whispering in your ear
1	is apparently come back already , for i am no more alone : someone is there in the twilight , seated upon the horsehair couch that stands with table and chairs nearer the door , toward the room 's middle , where we make our breakfast of a morning-sits in one corner of the couch , his legs crossed , but it is not sch , it is another , smaller than he , not so comely by far , and no true gentleman whatsoever
1	but it ’ s so dreadfully far away…
1	to the pedagogical temperament , that implies rebellion
1	but if we ascribe our keen awareness of this historical-psychological problem to our national honor and identify the striving for a new unifying order with our germanness , then we are well on our way to subscribing to a myth of dubious authenticity and indubitable arrogance-that is , to the nationalist myth , with its structural romanticizing of the warrior , which is nothing more than natural heathenism in christian trimmin�s , with christ designated 'lord of the heavenly hosts
1	does she know of your plans ?
1	sometimes even justus kröger and his family would appear , or sesame weichbrodt with her uneducated sister
1	that they , citizens who went about their business in seeming honesty and tried to know nothing , though at times the wind blew the stench of burned human flesh up their nosesdeclares that they share in the guilt for these horrors that are now laid bare and to which he forces them to direct their eyes
1	when the moral courage to decide and differentiate between fraud and reality begins to melt away , that marks the end of life itself , of formed opinions , of values , of any improving deed , and the corruptive process of moral skepticism begins its awful work
1	but i do think dietrich ratenkamp ’ s alliance with geelmaack was inevitable—fate simply took its course
1	he knew that his hometown , this town of ships and commerce , where highly respectable businessmen with incomparably principled faces strode along the sidewalks tapping their walking sticks , was no cradle of stainless morality
1	vesicular , he said , then once more , vesicular—that was good , evidently
1	we live on a very pretty square in the middle of town , with a well in the middle , just like on the marketplace at home , and our house is very close to the town hall
1	how charming—clear , bell-like , dainty tones floated up from the back of the room and filled the silence with a sweet , graceful , tender melody
1	in any case , she said in conclusion , offering her hand again with her customary heartfelt motion , i hope that we have not seen you for the last time
1	but the attack lasted no longer than a second
1	or better : the circumstances made preparations superfluous—that was the humiliating pan
1	but we had not yet come to that back then
1	over the years , the apartment grew more beautiful still , or at least more crowded and colorful , for dr lnstitoris
1	she hurried off , and her patron promptly received what he wanted
1	did i not explain it with the name kaisersaschern ?
1	the series of postcards had begun with the cheerful announcement that joachim had assumed his duties with all due fervent ceremony , during which , as hans castorp replied in his card , he presumably had sworn poverty , chastity , and obedience
1	to be sure , popóv might have choked to death on his mouthful of fish ; but , in fact , he had not choked to death and despite all his unconscious cavorting rage had evidently quietly managed to keep from doing so
1	ah no , your great coup is already behind you
1	then and there , as a result of that rebuke , hans castorp had reached his decision , which he made known to the others , to pay his personal respects to their departed housemate and say a silent prayer beside his remains
1	friederike and henriette , the two older girls , had grown bonier and gaunter with the years , whereas pfiffi , the youngest at fifty-three , was much too short and fat
1	after helmut 's departure we· spent a little time-as if he were still within earshot , so to speak-talking about unimportant matters
1	you do me great honor , and have paid me for my services for many a year now—and i am a man of modest circumstances
1	around noon , there was a good deal of traffic on breite strasse
1	i don ’ t know if you know the feeling
1	born in dresden , although his heritage lay more in the coastal lowlands , a blond of medium , trim stature , he had the polish and winning urbanity of saxon civilization and , being both genial and ever ready to please , was a zealous frequenter of salons , who spent every free evening attending at least one and more commonly two or three soirees , blissfully applying himself to flirting with the fair sex , from young girls to more mature women
1	and he repeated his injunction that there should be no strenuous concentration or forced visualization of their anticipated visitor—the only thing that helped was a casual , floating attentiveness
1	his head would lower until his chin lay on his chest , and he would hold that pose awhile—lost in thought perhaps or musing in a doze—half-asleep , before lifting his head for the next page
1	he certainly insisted on that difference and spoke of music as if of a foreign power , some marvelous phenomenon that did not , however , touch him personally , spoke of it from a critical and condescending distance-but speak about it he did and had all that much more to say , since it was during those years ( the last one i spent with him at school and my first two semesters at university ) that his musical experience , his knowledge of the world 's musical literature expanded quickly , so that very soon indeed the gap between what he knew and what he could play lent a certain obviousness to that difference he was so emphatic about
1	what are we to do ?
1	although everything can ’ t be just like before
1	he accepted others ' devotion- !
1	frau permaneder was silent
1	in short , i am at the gentleman ’ s disposal
1	with herr grünlich skittering now ahead , now behind him and then pulling back the portieres , he strode across the dining room and into the sitting room
1	hans castorp ’ s long , pliant footwear bore him in all directions : along the slope on the left in the direction of clavadel or to the right on past frauenkirch and glaris , the shadowy ghost of the amselfluh massif looming up out of the fog behind them ; he also skied the valley of the dischma and the hills rising behind the berghof , in the direction of the wooded seehorn , only the very tops of its two snow-clad peaks visible above the tree line , and toward the drusatscha woods , behind which he could see the pale , murky outline of the rhätikon chain buried under snow
1	madame chauchat was wearing a blue dress with a white lace collar
1	i saw one very young officer in full marching gear standing on the rear platform of a streetcar , looking back , obviously preoccupied with thoughts of his young life , staring off into space and deep inside himself-and he abruptly pulled himself together and with a quick smile checked all around to see if anyone had been watching him
1	it is my belief , by the way , not only that those who read me will , in time , come to understand my inner turmoil , but also that in the long run· it will not be foreign to them , either
1	but i ’ m glad that there are at least some other families that don ’ t have to kowtow to them , and that , for instance , we buddenbrooks …
1	you would not be sitting here acting like this if it were not quite excellent in comparison with my own
1	who would have thought it !
1	there is no miracle-worker , no mr individual creator behind it—it is an anonymous , communal work of art
1	i will be sensible—i already am
1	this , for example—and she pointed toward the breakfast table crowned with flowers from the garden—is fräulein jungmann ’ s handiwork
1	—had been , insofar as his illness and a stay up here of still quite indeterminate length had interfered with his plans ; this was a critical time in his life , perhaps even a turning point , one could not know for sure
1	the tragic outcome was first , this ideal did not actually suit her personally , and second , the epoch itself , which changed and undermined everything , no longer permitted it
1	if a house is bought from an inheritance that is yours to begin with ?
1	i am sixty years of age , having been born in ad ij , the eldest of four children , in kaisersaschern on the saale , district of merseburg , the same town in which leverkiihn also spent his school days-which means i can postpone a detailed characterization of them until the appropriate time
1	oh , clavdia , that is quite extraordinary
1	and thus am diligent , zelo virtutis , indeed almost overburdened and overbusied with matters , for am still hearing lectures of higher learning , history of philosophy from lautensack and both logic and encyclopaedic of philosophic science from the famous bermeter-vale
1	he would live there in the world of the flatlands , among people who had not the vaguest about how one had to live , about thermometers , about the art of wrapping oneself , about fur-lined sleeping bags , about three promenades a day , about—it was difficult to say , difficult to enumerate all the things people down there did not know about ; but the notion that joachim , after having spent more than a year and a half up here , would now be living among such ignorant people , that notion , which applied only to joachim—and merely from a great distance and only quite hypothetically to himself—so confused hans castorp that he closed his eyes and dismissed it with a gesture of his hand
1	doltish-eyed hermine kleefeld shoved her way to her table , over near one of the doors opening onto the veranda , and greeted the thick-lipped lad who had hitched his jacket up so unbecomingly
1	for example , there were the gymnastic games that were supervised by herr fritsche , the physical-education teacher , and held out on castle yard once a week all through the summer—and there the town ’ s young males were given a chance to show and develop their courage , strength , agility , and reflexes
1	herr grünlich fidgeted nervously back and forth in his chair
1	let ’ s give you a few polite thumps
1	music grows wild , he said
1	but you do things in order to enrich yourselves
1	although she perhaps felt the grief of the consul ’ s death more than the others , after having been so close to him in recent years , and although she had twice shed bitter tears today at the thought of him , it was probably the prospect of a little family council , of an earnest little conference in which she would play a dignified role , that gave such a glow to her pretty cheeks , such liveliness to her eyes , such a sense of satisfaction and importance to her movements
1	i was first received by an elderly lady who serves as a social companion and with whom i was forced to speak french ; but then gerda arrived and we chatted away , as we had the evening previous , for a good hour or more ; except that this time we found ourselves drawn even closer to one another and strove to understand and know one another better
1	as a young man , hans castorp had learned the exhilarating thrill of brushing up against powers whose full embrace would destroy you
1	i have a tradition behind me
1	you are still young and will marry again
1	i had thought we would have breakfast up on schatzalp or wherever at least once
1	frau chauchat appeared at breakfast in a flowing open-sleeved lace peignoir , and stood there at attention—having first slammed the glass door—and charmingly presented herself , as it were , to the dining hall , before proceeding in her slinking gait to her table ; and her attire suited her so splendidly that hans castorp ’ s neighbor , the teacher from königsberg , expressed her unequivocal enthusiasm
1	plainly , i am so cold
1	i ’ m sure he ’ d grab at the chance
1	in langensalza , had suffered from lung problems and was forced to spend a few months in a sanatorium in the harz mountains
1	i would never have confessed it to you if , as you put it in that old-fashioned poetic way , you had not opened the book of your heart to me
1	i would not say they disrupted it
1	hans castorp occasionally thought about the literary views that the man had offered on illness and despair—which he had found incomprehensible , or so at least he had pretended
1	he : sly cap !
1	to schwerdtfeger on adrian 's account , who had expressed some wish about a zapfenstosser concert ( it was a ticket for jeannette scheurl , i believe ) , to which schwerdtfeger had offered an objection or two
1	yes , my good sir
1	for people like myself , there is riothing about this monster that could lay claim to goodness , beauty , greatness ; and i will never understand the happy cries of hosanna that the so-called works of god-the physics of the universe , that is-can evoke from certain temperaments
1	your eyes adjusted only slowly to the darkness and learned to make use of what light there was , which was augmented somewhat by the dancing flames in the fireplace
1	her face had something almost malaysian about it : slightly prominent cheekbones , narrow black eyes that shimmered gently , and a smooth lemony complexion that one would look far and wide to find anywhere
1	he was merely tired
1	work , time , and illusion are one , together falling victim to criticism
1	the portrait had no head , it was the skeleton of a human torso inside a foggy halo of flesh—the torso of a woman , he realized
1	it was a sultry august afternoon
1	as for your buttons , if i ’ m not mistaken , i haven ’ t mentioned a word about them
1	( the word comrade had made hans castorp feel rather uneasy )
1	if she would say yes , she could take her place in the world , set herself up quite nicely , which is what she really wants , and within a matter of days she would love her husband
1	the fellow with the choirmaster and the golden pot ?
1	and it smelled a little like rotting seaweed
1	all he could see were dancing flakes , which seemed not to fall but simply to fill the air in a throng of dense eddies ; the icy blasts singed his ears with sharp pain , took the strength from his legs , and numbed his hands , until he no longer knew if he was holding his poles or not
1	by prying them out with a lever
1	and where will i be once i am dead ?
1	hans castorp waved this off
1	in its fundament it is merely a continuation of your extravagant existence
1	but that 's an escapist attitude , came a final mutter
1	first , we really have nothing significant to say about the matter , because we have settled accounts with gosch , and it is up to him to do business as he pleases
1	and so it flattered my vanity all the more ( i do not deny it ) that a very lively demand for me to perform-though i had always played purely as an amateur-came from the much larger and more elegant circle of people whom the ambitious frau dr
1	and now i have to ask you something , tony said , after they had taken a few more steps—she had decided she must
1	i maintain , however , that the more voicelike and the more explicitly polyphonic the character of the chord , the more dissonant it is
1	if , hans castorp said , if i need it
1	the consul repeated , shaking his lowered head
1	but what about the pinions of eagles ?
1	dazed and giddy , he quivered with exhilaration , just as he often did after a colloquy with naphta and settembrini , except this time the feeling was incomparably stronger—which may have been how he came to excuse his own inertia in fighting off such attacks of self-narcosis by reminiscing drunkenly about their discussions
1	granted , the destruction of our cities from the air has long since turned germany into an arena of war ; and yet we find it inconceivable , impermissible , to think that germany could ever become such an arena in the true sense , and our propaganda has a curious way of warning the foe against incursion upon our soil , our sacred german soil , as if that would be some grisly atrocity
1	so tell me all
1	for my part i leave it to the reader whether such things deserve laughter or tears
1	joachim ’ s pose was growing more and more official
1	for did not a false primitivism-which was , once again , romanticism-lie close at hand ?
1	all of which had so shattered his self-confidence that he now dared not look anyone in the eye
1	can you not abate this nuisance , this icy breeze ?
1	he asked them , first the dressmaker and then frau stöhr , how long they had been up here—the former had been a resident for five months , the latter for seven ; he marshaled his english to ask his neighbor on the left what sort of tea that was she was drinking—rose-hip , he learned—and whether it tasted good , to which she responded almost stormily in the affirmative
1	well done , the director said
1	you maybe heard my name mentioned , ma ’ am , by your daughter
1	lebrecht kröger commanded , beside himself now
1	she hardly ate a thing
1	he ’ s an ass , of course , but at least he knows his latin
1	yes , thanks , i ’ ll just put it here against the leg of my chair—it ’ s fine there for the moment
1	for they valued his participation in theological and philosophical debates , to which , though without leading them , he would often give an interesting turn with just an interjected remark ; and they especially enjoyed his musical talents , which were very useful , since he knew how to provide their
1	are his misfortunes the result of his own carelessness and dishonesty ?
1	if you ’ d like , my son can walk you there
1	several gentlemen—senator möllendorpf , dr oeverdieck , consul kistenmaker , gosch the broker , c f köppen , herr marcus from the office , and captains kloot and klötermann—have all asked me to send their greetings
1	there are so many different tortures , castorp , and if a man is subjected to one torture , all he wants is for it to end , that is his one and only goal
1	johann , he said in a high , pleasant voice , without extending a hand to his brother , how is he ?
1	his position in the matter is really quite clear
1	among whose adherents one may include fenelon , who taught that every act is flawed , since the will to act is an affront to god , who alone can will to act
1	did he not love her from out of his world of oratorios , with its musical theology and mathematics of magic numbers ?
1	he was already smoking his second cigarette
1	but it all centered around the curious equation of worth and sensual passion , around the fixed and strangely euphoric notion that inner worth could only be fulfilled , could only be realized in desire , which evidently was equal in seriousness to
1	i am beginning to surmise that you liked him as well
1	you had to pay close attention to keep from accidentally breaking a leg
1	but before the honeymoon was over , she had been struck a blow so unforeseen , so startling , so incomprehensible that it had robbed her of every joy in life
1	hans , he said , and in desperate anguish he squeezed his cousin ’ s hand , and the latter noticed joachim ’ s head trembling from lack of sleep and the excitement of the trip , just as his own did when he played king
1	( dedicated to my friend otto grautoff )
1	they wanted goods to be produced on the basis of need and loathed the idea of mass production
1	it was the longed-for release
1	notwithstanding a good many painful experiences in life , her body was unbent and her eye was still clear
1	technology and comfort-having those , people speak of culture , but do not have it
1	he occasionally mentioned social events as well—visits , banquets , balls
1	he watched the merchants in yellow mackintoshes , like the one he himself was wearing , as they streamed at noon toward the exchange , where things could get quite fierce , as he well knew , and someone might very suddenly be motivated to hand out invitations to a grand dinner , in hopes of prolonging his credit
1	in reality—that is , in any sense beyond this secret connection with her—he could not possibly have anything to do with a strange woman who lived her life at various resorts , separated from her husband and yet never wearing a wedding ring , who had bad posture , slammed doors behind her , rolled her bread into little pills , and doubtless chewed her fingernails ; deep chasms separated her existence from his , and he could never have defended her against criticisms that he himself acknowledged
1	yes , that was his way of doing things
1	thank you , ida , that helps
1	he would be bold himself , he declared , perhaps even stick his foot in it , by declaring that in such a treatment of the fugue one could see hatred and violation , a thoroughly unaccommodating and problematical relationship with the artform , a reflection of the relationship , or lack thereof , between the great man and one still greater-at least in the opinion of many-johann sebastian bach
1	marusya ’ s laugh , however , the sight of her round , brown eyes , blinking childishly out over the handkerchief with which she covered her mouth , and her full , prominent chest—said to be more than a little ill on the inside—reminded him of something else that had shaken him when he had noticed it recently , and so without turning his head , he glanced cautiously toward joachim
1	this is where i arrived , he said superfluously
1	the firm ’ s capital , however , had been lying fallow for years
1	julie hagenström asked , her bright black eyes sending a sharp glance over to where morten was sitting and watching the elegant swimming party , his face betraying a certain melancholy
1	the students sank into their seats
1	it found itself one day given the designation of an independent form of life by an era that speaks of the century of the child and has invented the emancipation of women , a very indulgent era in generaland youth eagerly agreed to it , of course
1	he had laid his round head to one side , and his guileless eyes sparkled in their little slits as he listened to everything frau grünlich said
1	his hands in his trouser pockets , director behrens rolled back and forth between the balls of his feet and his heels , regarding his work along with his visitors
1	that was neither fish nor flesh
1	he thought it implied a general weak-willed slovenliness , and in that sense , then , a boundless guazzabuglio of tolerance
1	ah , but despite the comfort it offered , his tasteful interpretation was untenable ; one did not believe it for long
1	lebrecht kröger , cavalier à la mode , was a large , distinguished man
1	he was bathed spotless as a baby , and he had his clothes made by a tailor who enjoyed the trust of the young men in his circle
1	and repeated whatever the time of day if he or someone else was leaving , the pendant to the 'nuff !
1	it was , instead , a rather reckless and unpolished variation of this folly , a fusion of frost and heat , like a man in a fever or an october day in these lofty regions
1	did not the simple fact that he had been transferred to the bad russian table express a certain carelessness about his person ?
1	i bear within me the seed , the rudiments , the possibility of life ’ s capacities and endeavors
1	i ’ spect it ’ ll be hagenström
1	he was himself more than a little ill ; but without any affectation , he could say he was more inclined to be ashamed of the fact
1	he will fight the hectic fever with frequent baths , into which the patient is to be placed up to his neck every three hours , without exception , night and day , and during which cold water is to be slowly added at the foot of the tub
1	very remarkable , i said
1	a woman , a rather pleasant lady in fact , though she did live alone and her eyebrows were a bit too regular , who had approached their table in a restaurant in munich , where they had spent a day between trains , came over to say hello to joachim
1	a marriage of love , people were forced to conclude , for although they admitted that gerda ’ s three hundred thousand had played a role , they knew it was merely secondary
1	so what do you say , wouldn ’ t you like to dance ?
1	go on with what you were saying !
1	they had reached the second floor , when hans castorp suddenly stopped in his tracks , mesmerized by a perfectly ghastly noise he heard coming from beyond a dogleg in the hall—not a loud noise , but so decidedly repulsive that hans castorp grimaced and stared wide-eyed at his cousin
1	at early breakfast , each guest found a nosegay of violets beside his place setting ; at second breakfast , a dyed egg ; and at the festive dinner , a little chocolate rabbit decorated with sugar
1	courage , do you hear ?
1	all these costumes had been hastily improvised after the meal
1	in the immeasurable expanses of time , you see how life moves onward and upward from infusoria to man , and you can not deny that infinite possibilities for further perfection still await humankind
1	well , then , he continued , turning on his finest charm , our warmest thanks—gerda ’ s , too—for all your efforts , my dear
1	frau chauchat sat in the first row , but disappeared at intermission , so that from that point on hans castorp could listen to the music ( and it was music , despite the circumstances ) with a peaceful heart , reading the text printed in the program as each song was sung
1	first and foremost : there ’ s the air up here
1	so it ’ s both anonymous and communal , hans castorp said
1	she quickly threw her brother a look of gratitude , because he had seen her distress and now came to her rescue by inquiring whether the gentlemen would care to take a tour of the house
1	that was odd , fräulein kleefeld remarked
1	and yet soft traces of the sun ’ s farewell linger beyond and above
1	how much he must have changed under my very eyes for that to have been the case !
1	enough , the consul concluded
1	was it any wonder , then , that hans castorp , given his civilian sense of responsibility and interest in playing king , felt that he and joachim were obliged to pay him a little visit ?
1	and hans castorp divulged his sad , but for all that , spiffing news
1	in all these years , i have longed for nothing else but to get back into the thick of life , because i am bored here with mother—god strike me if that ’ s a sin , but i ’ m barely thirty and i still feel young
1	she suddenly appeared before him as he lay on his balcony , and her exotic manners made considerable demands on the good breeding of that helpless , cylindrically wrapped gentleman
1	it had sounded so strange there in this lonely , remote place , that fare thee well and much obliged , like words in a dream brushing past hans castorp ’ s senses , numbed by climbing and singing
1	get up , grünlich , she said , sobbing
1	it took little or nothing to do it—and then came this : the realization that i couldn ’ t depend on permaneder even in that regard
1	questions that had been touched on in lectures and discussed in seminars , he skirted every conversation that might have gone to the root of the matter and addressed theology 's problematical place among the sciences and so avoided exactly what , to my somewhat anxious mind , should have preceded all else
1	we had almost forgotten that our audience does not know her , whereas the name is quite familiar to us
1	a congflick , i tell you , ’ nd i know something about what that means
1	she looked up imploringly at dr langhals
1	opening off this room lay bedrooms , rather spacious if likewise simply appointed , a third now being opened for us guests
1	but one can not survive with just james joyce , picasso , ezra pound , and the duchess de clermont-tonnere in the audience
1	you know very well , as do these young gentlemen , that the human progress of which i speak is conceived as infinite
1	after first flipping a switch that turned on both lamps that gave off reddish light and then flipping another that doused the white ceiling light , dr krokowski took his seat under the chandelier , there where the arch of chairs came to an end
1	late evening , after the social gathering , when the crowd had left , was his best time
1	i would like some tea
1	she cried , and her bonnet shook with delight
1	at one time lay brothers used to live in them , but now they were almost always empty and were not really fixed up to be livable
1	what you must understand is that it ’ s your indifference that torments me
1	he spent his quiet evenings at home with gerda , smoking and listening to her play the violin or reading a book aloud with her—german , french , or russian stories that she had picked out
1	but in terms of lighting and heating , of bright , spacious classrooms , cozy teachers ’ lounges , and well-equipped , efficient lecture halls and labs for chemistry , physics , and drawing , it represented the latest in modern comfort
1	why are they so happy ?
1	it had a narrow tuniclike collar and side pockets , and a cross was dangling farther down
1	no peak , no ridge was visible ; it was a misty nothing toward which hans castorp pushed his way
1	the mountains reached out on all sides , beginning with wooded foothills that ran down into the sea , then rising in a semicircle from a midpoint in the distance to where he was , and extending on behind him
1	he was a man with straight-hanging , unkempt , ash-blond hair and a beardless face with agreeable features : very prominent cheekbones ; a hooked , slightly
1	his days and part of his nights were filled with operationes spirituales , with examinations of conscience , with introspection , deliberation , and meditation , and he went about it with such malicious , peevish passion that he found himself ensnared in a thousand difficulties , contradictions , and disputes
1	the diversion lasted several weeks
1	solet aristoteles quaerere pugnam
1	it would be good if we could fend off your catarrh somehow—there are the methods practiced in the flatlands
1	but i ain ’ t gon na leave good ol ’ munich
1	although the barometer has fallen a little , the sky is still shamelessly blue , which looks wonderful with all the flags—and the whole town is full of flags—but it will be dreadfully hot
1	but at last destiny overtook her and brought all her sneering to a woeful end ; woeful i said , because the man who conquered her virginity was in no way worthy of his victory , was not regarded worthy of it even by clarissa herself : a skirt-chaser with a pseudo-demonic goatee , a backstage johnny and provincial roue , a criminal defense lawyer from pforzheim , who came equipped for his conquest with nothing but a cheap , cynical gift of gab , fine linens , and a great deal of black hair on his hands
1	gerda , gerda , what is it ?
1	within three or four months after his father died , he had forgotten death ; now he remembered it , and all the impressions from before reemerged simultaneously—in every precise , piercing , and incomparable detail
1	before the fact of life 's efficacy , my good man , all distinction of disease and health is undone
1	could anyone , anywhere , know what happiness that was ?
1	and she complains constantly about her temperature , and that she ’ s so listless , and unfortunately it ’ s probably a rather serious case
1	he had such a good-natured , mischievous laugh , and when he had asked for water by using a couple of letters with some numbers added , his father had been simply furious
1	under each of the dried plants in his herbarium , he wrote in a fine calligraphic hand the latin names humanistic science had gallantly bestowed upon them , plus a list of their distinguishing characteristics
1	the only person in town who showed any understanding for his taste in literature was herr gosch the broker ; his father was most stern in his condemnation of it
1	every afternoon , having finished his official duties , the schoolteacher-a rather young and delicate man , who never stopped being
1	what was his first day at school like ?
1	friend there in the abbot 's study , though i must admit that had i done so , it would not have been the same
1	i did not like him
1	and although johann buddenbrook was forever complaining in typical businessman ’ s fashion , all the losses had been balanced out over the past fifteen years by a profit of some , thalers courant
1	on the contrary , it was best to diffuse one ’ s attention somewhat , even quiet conversation was useful
1	that such souls are ladies , indeed maiden ladies , can come as no surprise ; for human abstinence is surely the source of prophetic intuition , which is no less valuable for its stunted origins
1	i am , as you see , a little impatient in matters intellectual and would prefer to be denounced as a pedant rather than to leave uncontested views i consider to be as deserving of refutation as those that you have formulated here
1	more toxic than we gave you credit for , my friend , he declared
1	yes , yes , i see it , he said several times
1	what fun it was on a lovely easter morning to search for eggs and marzipan rabbits in the krögers ’ vast gardens
1	yes , and it was really quite sweet of armgard to remember me after all these years since we were friends at boarding school and invite me
1	he knew that people in town were openly talking about the same thought that tony was blissfully turning over in her mind
1	holger had given his word , and they had no right to doubt he would keep it
1	as in so many things , there was a meeting here-of poison and beauty , poison and sorcery , but of sorcery and liturgy as well
1	you should see her teeth when she laughs
1	we ’ ll go to meng strasse later
1	water seeped , trickled , dribbled everywhere—it dripped , then gushed in the forests
1	it would be disingenuous to speak of mourning , but all the same , for a while the expression in hans castorp ’ s eyes was more pensive than usual
1	he would suddenly grow uneasy , get up from his work in the office , and walk in the garden alone ; stopping every now and then as if something were blocking his path or holding him back , he would sigh and cover his eyes with his hand
1	no , my good man , that is no devil 's ware
1	also at that time , he loved more than ever having riidiger schildknapp around-him of the same-colored eyes
1	dear friend , he said , apparently no one has been waiting for me to declare it , but this is a perfect piece of music !
1	and by the by , i don ’ t keep this thing just for fun , he said , noticing that the effect was wearing off
1	he had sat down in an armchair beside the table and was waiting
1	you will do what you think best , my dear , but first stop and think whether it might not be wise to preserve some social decorum
1	he said yes , he reported , and felt embarrassed
1	and hans castorp saw exactly what he should have expected to see , but which no man was ever intended to see and which he himself had never presumed he would be able to see : he saw his own grave
1	not unlike the pastor 's , ah , you sweet tyke , you blessed thing !
1	well , then , professor , it ’ s quite understandable why herr settembrini doesn ’ t like to recall the blossoming of his order
1	on the ground floor was a restaurant , above it was a piano warehouse , and a portion of the third floor was occupied by quarters leased by the doctor , whose name caught one 's eye downstairs on a porcelain sign beside the main entrance
1	from that point on , tony ’ s letters never lost a sense of hopelessness , which sometimes would even break into lament
1	after all , it was the novel conclusions reached during those evenings , together with my participation in adrian 's lonely work , that produced the mental strain under which i lived at the time , and that indeed caused me to lose a good fourteen pounds
1	probably , he answered with a smile that showed he had been prepared for this objection
1	and then he did something that was to become a habit with him : he scowled , pursed his lips , stared up and away to one side , and then violently tossed his head around and stared in exactly the opposite direction
1	not even attempting to disguise his purpose , he found it easy to appeal to herr albin ’ s sense of chivalry , though he did ask that it be kept secret as a matter of personal honor
1	frau grünlich was wearing a cream-colored dress with a satin scarf tied at the chin , and despite a short night ’ s rest she looked splendid
1	and if you are , how can you say such bad things about the body ?
1	her fiancé was with her , an english naval officer , but he didn ’ t exactly keep a stiff upper lip
1	he was still standing there observing , perplexed and lost in thought , when the director happened by
1	oh , you know how they frighten me
1	tony endured the remark in silence—it was no use , tom was quicker than she
1	why , all of dorf and platz , too , knew the nature of his relationship with frau wurmbrandt from vienna , the general consul ’ s wife—one could hardly call it clandestine anymore
1	what has to be done ?
1	people were glad to see snow cover the valley , because that sight—and only that sight , since falling temperatures accomplished nothing—moved management to turn on the heat , at first only in the dining hall , but then in the rooms as well , so that when you unwrapped yourself from your blankets at the end of a rest cure and came back into the room from the balcony , your moist , numb hands could feel warmth stirring in the radiator , even if the dry heat only made your cheeks burn all the more
1	it gives you a certain—wait , a word has just come to mind that i have never used before—it gives you a certain genius
1	unfortunately they did not agree with him , and he told about two little henry clays he had taken a liking to one evening at a party and how they had come close to putting him six feet under
1	an ignominious ending will always be more normal , something quite other than the divine judgment that hangs over us at present , just as it once descended upon sodom and gomorrah-a judgment that we did not , after all , call down upon ourselves that first time
1	what awful posture she had !
1	the child would then suffer less and ultimately not at all
1	his head propped in his hands , count mölln went on reading about roderick usher , and hanno sat quietly watching the show
1	think of those shared impressions
1	but enough of that
1	because they tasted disgusting
1	wherever he went , he drew circles and made calculations , filled vast quantities of paper with figures , letters , numbers , and algebraic symbols ; his tanned face , the face of an obviously unwell man , bore the visionary and mulish look of the monomaniac
1	fraulein scheurl 's undisguised amusement at this defeat of attempted familiarity did not affect him at all
1	and the very next day she knew the name
1	do you know with what a thrill of amusement such felicitous errors fill me ?
1	fräulein clementine , his mother ’ s new lady ’ s maid , a skinny girl with a curl in the middle of her forehead , a pointed nose , and nearsighted eyes , was already up and setting out breakfast
1	all the better , she says , half out of stupidity , half out of impudence , now she won ’ t need her castanets , heaven itself is sending her music to dance by and so—la la la la !
1	if a dinner table suddenly lacked a gentleman and he was asked to fill in , without fail he would say no
1	a child toward the end-that may be
1	well , in a nutshell , the salaries are so insignificant…
1	there were the various offices and honorary posts to which he was appointed , but no new realms left to conquer
1	settembrini accepted the other one from ferge ’ s hand
1	yes , the air is famous
1	i ’ ve always said , even when i was still a silly young thing : this local advertiser is a pitiful rag , really
1	they appear to have developed an appetite for it now , and they can procure some part of it by moving into a house—this house
1	and tony could not visit that silk salon she so admired in the villa beyond the burg gate without madame kröger ’ s starting in : a propos , i ’ ve heard something about an affair
1	you should know that colds are not reçus here
1	i : their misery made me laugh
1	study of the score discloses that the subtlest knowledge of the stringquartet form has been put to good use
1	they ’ re waiting for me in amsterdam
1	what an effort it would be for her to spare me if she had to say no
1	articulation is supplied to the whole by very clearly contrasting tempi , although the movements are to be played without interruption
1	and so he stepped on ahead , pulling a gasping and generally reluctant joachim with him , and by the time they reached the point where the path leveled out and turned off to the right , they had almost pulled even with frau chauchat
1	let me overstate my case : my distaste for music is political
1	never will i offer my hand to that abomination
1	but before long she became used to the sum her brother had named—because all her thoughts and plans were occupied with her future
1	assez , christian , we are not the least bit interested , elisabeth buddenbrook said
1	and then she cleared her throat
1	from the very beginning , his hands had definitely been buddenbrook hands : broad , a little short , but with delicate fingers ; and his nose was definitely that of his father and great-grandfather , though it appeared the nostrils would flair somewhat more softly
1	and it was then that adrian indulged himself in the joke of telling me in the most graphic detail how he and mr capercailzie had climbed into a spherical diving bell , measuring only four feet in interior diameter and fitted out much like a stratospheric balloon , and together had been dropped from a crane on the convoy ship into seas that were of monstrous depth here
1	your statement is incoherent , my good engineer , settembrini said in reply , yet its reprehensibility still shines through
1	not with her immortal soul , oh no , but with her upper lip , her full head of hair , her pretty eyes , and her fine figure
1	he did not like it , in fact , and every time it reappeared he found it embarrassing , as if it were some testy personal or nationalistic prejudice—not to mention the reaction of joachim ziemssen , who would refuse to listen whenever the italian started down that road , would scowl and look away , sometimes diverting the conversation or reminding them that the duties of the rest cure called
1	and by the way , he said , there is also the fourth movement , that incomparable finale with its short marchlike introduction and the recitative so proudly declaimed by the first violin , as fitting a prepara-
1	this air had special properties
1	most of the time i find my way to bed with a match
1	now and then she also made quaint , and totally untalented , attempts at speaking the dialect of bavaria
1	trying desperately to pull himself away , he slipped and fell against the column at his back
1	trembling in all of its beams !
1	moreover , quite apart from the concrete and specific debasement of physical pain or afflictions of the heart , life itself , in and of itself , mere existence , animal survival , is an unworthy and ponderous chain , a vile encumbrance , and anything but noble and proud ; it is an exercise of our human rights and a legitimate spiritual act to thrust aside this burden , so to speak , to be rid of it , and to gain freedom , lightness , bodiless well-being , as it were , by supplying one 's physical nature with this blessed stuff , which grants the body emancipation from suffering
1	had anyone ever said anything about it at school or in church ?
1	a few people were still listening comfortably , but one also saw a good many
1	career ’ —what a lovely word !
1	papa can drive a person to tears , tony said , choosing strong words as was her habit
1	given the kind of life lawyer settembrini had led and all his extensive activities , he could not have been a great scholar of the law , or so hans castorp thought
1	you were , therefore , taking your rest cure , just as duty , reason , and regulation demand
1	and with that he put his little hand out to his sister for her to lead him inside
1	he was corresponding regularly with the flatlands now
1	is freedom , freedom , ’ tis your own !
1	these entries began with an extensive genealogy , tracing the family ’ s main line—how at the end of the sixteenth century the oldest known buddenbrook had lived in parchim and his son had become an alderman in grabau
1	it turned into a two-day migraine , which except perhaps in its severity was no different from earlier attacks
1	the consul did not dare to ask how close a call it was
1	then he made himself comfortable , pulling on his house shoes and a tuniclike jacket , picked up a chart and a pencil from the table , plus a book of russian grammar—he was learning russian because , as he said , he hoped it would be of use in his career—and thus equipped , he stretched out on the balcony lounge chair , tossing the camel-hair blanket lightly over his feet
1	thoughtful , meaningful copying is indeed as intense and timeconsuming an endeavor as putting one 's own thoughts to paper ( at least it is for me ; but monsignor hinterpfortner likewise agrees with me on this ) ; and just as at earlier points the reader may have underestimated the number of days and weeks that i have devoted to my late friend 's life story , so , too , his notion of the point in time at which i am
1	no , he said with a polite laugh , but because i ’ ve caught a little—
1	leaving the building by this exit , you did not approach the garden , but came out facing directly onto an open slope of mountain meadows , dotted with a few tallish firs and several low mountain pines that hugged the ground
1	it took place during a weekend i spent at pfeiffering , after a simple supper that clementina schweigestill-austerely dressed as always-had served us in the large room with the piano
1	beside himself now , the senator leaned against the wrought-iron grate of the cold stove and pressed both clasped hands to his brow
1	by its reception he may have grown a bit cannier , more given to the intellect and would mayhap not read so gladly the diary of goncourt or his abbe galiani had he not the connexion to higher things , had he not his secret memorandum
1	those had indeed been two spectacularly different grandfathers !
1	but he was willing to let himself be influenced , in the sense that it was pleasant to experiment , and so he reined in the protests that piety and good taste would have raised against the settembrinian order of things and decided that what seemed blasphemous to him might be termed bold and what he found in bad taste might , at least in those days and under those conditions , be considered the excesses of a high-minded and noble nature—as , for example , when grandfather settembrini called barricades the people ’ s throne or declared it necessary to consecrate the citizen ’ s pike on the altar of humanity
1	and now , stalwart friends , be so kind as to join me in emptying a glass of this pleasant nectar with good wishes for the prosperity of our most honored hosts in their new and splendid home—to the buddenbrook family , both present and absent
1	but you are badly mistaken if you think that future revolutions will end in freedom
1	my son is much better than i with dates of that sort
1	fear had her babbling pure nonsense as she took the stairs to the third floor and rushed down the hall
1	official channels were used to bring about the impatiently awaited discussion with director behrens ; hans castorp commissioned the bath attendant to pass the request on to the head nurse ; this resulted in consul tienappel ’ s being given an opportunity to make that eccentric lady ’ s acquaintance
1	ah , yes , yes , your good cousin has told me all about it
1	the father provincial himself summoned naphta at the end of his two-year novitiate , spoke with him , and approved his admission to the order
1	hetaera esmeralda-her powdered demiglobes in a spanish bodice , saw her stroke his cheek with her bared arm
1	but then he betrayed himself by suddenly hissing , parbleu , jean
1	hops along like a little dickeybird
1	we were just calling you , the senator replied calmly
1	he looked up into her kirghiz eyes
1	all fine and good
1	a stranger was coming up the path on their left , a delicate man with brown hair and a black moustache twirled at the ends ; he was wearing pastel checked trousers and exchanged a good-morning with joachim as he came up to them—his greeting was precise and melodious
1	but what was humanism ?
1	and he pointed with one massive forefinger at his own two bloodshot , watery , protruding blue eyes
1	his work was done
1	the duchamps , the consul explained , my late mother ’ s family
1	the book opened a sardonic rift between truth and power , truth and life , truth and community
1	as composed and restrained as the almost invisible hairnet holding her hair in place , as detached and energetic as the people of her native land were known to be , she took charge of joachim ’ s care , was spurred on to maternal battle by what she saw , and was firm in her faith that if anything could be done , it would be done thanks only to her energy and vigilance
1	in its physical effect , in the way it grabs one by the head and shoulders , it is one of those manifestations of beauty that border on the
1	to be sure , it is likewise very impressive for a schoolmate of a simpler cast of mind , and since i loved him , i loved his arrogance , too-perhaps i loved him because of it
1	how can i possibly draw with a thing like that—to hell with it !
1	or maybe that ’ s why i was suddenly so interested in him
1	as long as she had been sure that herr grünlich was at a safe distance , she had actually enjoyed the earnest exchanges with her parents and the sudden importance attached to herself and her decision
1	the senator came with his wife and child , and while he and gerda silently shared their amusement at tony ’ s blissful hauteur , he had all he could do to prevent his sister from gorging her adored little hanno with dried currants and port
1	the table had been cleared ; diederich schwarzkopf was sitting there comfortably squinting into the sun , his jacket wide open to reveal his shimmering vest , he and his son had lit their stubby wooden pipes , and tom was occupied with his cigarettes—and now the young men found themselves engaged in lively reminiscences of their school days , even tony joined in with enthusiasm
1	the pained , ragged lips were slightly open
1	hans castorp ’ s gesture implied that he seconded the delay peeperkorn had proposed
1	i could not give him much hope for tonight , but in a weak voice he asserted that it was his duty to try , threw on a coat , and hurried out of the apartment
1	and if they had beheld him all alone at night , bundled in furs , riding through his mountains in his golden sleigh , lit by torch light and escorted by outriders , those peasants would not have seen in him a madman , but a king after their own rude , but dream-stricken hearts , and if he had succeeded in swimming across the lake , as had evidently been his intention , the farmers on the far shore would have defended him with pitchforks and flails against doctors and politicians
1	't is a right pleasurable meeting indeed , was the little boy 's quaint reply
1	she was looking forward to the moment when tom would appear and she would greet him with a dignified nod
1	and now they were on the main road , which was set one terrace-level above the valley floor
1	although i certainly hope you don ’ t think i ’ m not glad to spend time with all of you , papa—that would be the worst ingratitude , i ’ d deserve to be horsewhipped
1	and in considering that inner aspect , he also thought of settembrini , the pedagogic organ-grinder , whose father had come into the world in greece and who explained love for that sublime image to be a matter of politics , rebellion , and eloquence , whereby the citizen ’ s pike was consecrated on the altar of humanity ; he thought , too , of comrade krokowski and what the two of them had been doing in his darkened suite for some time now , thought of the two sides of analysis and how it was not only beneficial to action and progress , but also a relative of the grave and its foul anatomy
1	in short , i could not take any more—i bolted
1	medical journals and reference books ( an illustrated history of morals for example ) were to be found in the room where adrian waited on that first and , again , on a second occasion
1	as before , i am having my difficulties
1	but that ’ s just dropping by , not even worth taking off your hat and coat
1	in her drowsy state , frau permaneder had no sooner discerned this noise than she immediately understood what it was ; and she felt the blood leave her cheeks and rush to her heart—which contracted , but continued to pump in anxious , heavy throbs
1	kai flung open a window , then swiped adolf todtenhaupt ’ s rewritten notes and hurriedly started to copy the section that had to be shown the teacher today
1	he sat up erect on the sofa , crossed his legs , took a puff on his cigar , and , squinching his eyes a little , began marshaling the figures with exceptional proficiency
1	natural flow that was not there originally , and so is not natural at all , but rather a product of art-in short , it is only after the fact and as a mediator that this manager creates an impression of immediacy and organic wholeness
1	right … and when i went back to look , there was just a big wet spot
1	had not a main point on the agenda at our roundtable been a critique of tradition , a critique that had resulted from the destruction of human values long considered inviolable , and had not someone ( i am not sure i know who-breisacher ?
1	as soon as possible , though not without some worry , he arranged a tryst with barbel , and while the sexton was ringing his bells , they spent a most fulfilling hour with one another
1	in my opinion , you have a coccus infection
1	she now had no home , although she was not penniless—her former husband saw to that
1	but there was someone who was present the second time who told me about it­
1	sometimes he sat down up on the little terrace , inside the pavilion , under the shade of its covering grapevines , and , without seeing anything , he would look out across the garden to the red-brick rear wall of his house
1	dr grabow felt the boy ’ s pulse ; his face seemed to have grown even longer and milder
1	it is interesting , it is even good-simply because it is what is coming , and to recognize that fact is both achievement and enjoyment enough
1	true , it would be hard to say goodbye—and the thought could bring tears to her eyes
1	on the one hand , i was shocked , of course , and felt sorry for maiboom , but on the other , i was glad for you
1	we were sitting in the abbot 's study , playing chess
1	if he then continued to play , pursuing some fixed idea , transforming and loosely shaping it , someone from among those standing aroundshort probst , maybe , a seminarian type with greasy , longish blond hair-might ask :
1	the unforgivable sin lies in—
1	in that regard father beissel was quite authentic
1	and when hans castorp objected that he assumed a lowered room temperature was part of the regimen for the cure and presumably a way of keeping the patients from getting too spoiled , settembrini responded with fierce scorn
1	you are trying to get to me by way of my humanistic honor i said
1	he said , puffing out smoke
1	it ’ s almost like someone delirious with fever , isn ’ t it ?
1	her aging face , with its pale mediterranean complexion and large , careworn mouth turned down at one corner , reminded hans castorp of a picture he had once seen of a famous tragedian ; and it was eerie to watch how this pale woman dressed in black matched her long , somber strides , apparently without realizing it , to the rhythm of march music in the distance
1	jeannette scheurl happened to be in zurich at the time and even encountered adrian in the private home where he and schwerdtfeger were guest lodgers
1	schildknapp , the poet and translator , he went on to say , was the most amiable of the lot
1	the tricks life plays
1	sive cry of the soul , into the heartfelt unbosoming of the creatureto occur ?
1	he had resumed the mode of life adapted in his first three weeks—the familiar , regular , and perfectly ordered life at joachim ’ s side ; everything went like clockwork from the first day , as if there had never been an interruption
1	yes , the meals in the dining hall with its seven tables held the greatest fascination for hans castorp
1	the gondola 's windows , had been the mad grotesqueries , organic nature 's secret faces : predatory mouths , shameless teeth , telescopic eyes ; paper nautiluses , hatchetfish with goggles aimed upward , heteropods , and sea butterflies up to six feet long
1	nonsense , by july he was hale and hearty again , for several weeks , until a major physical suddenly loomed up ahead—ordered because of the cursed fluctuations in his temperature
1	and frau permaneder replied with three shouts : you see , you see , you see !
1	they considered the peasant and the craftsman honorable people , but not the merchant or the industrialist
1	i know you are not intentionally saying cruel things to me
1	the host sat at the head of the table , drinking heartily of a nonalcoholic beverage from an exquisitely cut glass and-face rigid as always-joked with the municipal theater 's dramatic soprano beside him , a powerful woman who in the course of the evening thumped her bosom a great deal with a balled fist
1	he did what he could , didn ’ t even go to his tavern for two or three nights—god forbid
1	; and matthiesen , a tall grain hauler in a black jacket and knee breeches , white stockings , and buckled shoes , would even doff his homely top hat respectfully as he passed
1	there was a lady who sat at his table , frau stöhr was her name , and quite ill by the way , the wife of a musician from cannstatt—and she was the most illiterate person he had ever met
1	oh , no offense taken , hans castorp said , and provided the information
1	yes , dear god , i ’ m beginning to get used to the idea that until my cousin leaves , i won ’ t be leaving , either
1	i ’ ve heard of such deals , but mainly in hessia , where quite a few of the gentry have ended up in the hands of jews
1	yes , little johann was actually quite tall now
1	my mind is very clear today
1	vienna and had probably lacked the funds to do so
1	not that people did not joke about it here as well
1	i want to tell you something
1	this portentous term is perhaps explained in part by the fact that frau else at once pronounced the man waiting for us to be a crazy hootowl
1	but one gets used to not getting used to it
1	perhaps the old man was thinking about how he had sat beside the bed of a dying wife that first time , forty-six years before , and perhaps he compared the savage despair that had blazed within him then with the pensive melancholy that showed in his eyes now as he gazed , an old man himself , at the altered , expressionless , and terrifyingly indifferent face of this old woman , who had brought him neither great happiness nor great pain , but who had stood beside him with such clever , good grace over these many long years , and whose life was also now ebbing away
1	senator gieseke told them that kassbaum hadn ’ t lost his sense of humor
1	and she sighed with her half a lung , shaking her head and directing her doltish , sleepy eyes at the ceiling
1	inez imagined all sorts of things about him , the wrong things , and that created a skewed relationship , as if such a relationship was not already skewed enough on its own , given the foolish situations that were constantly cropping up and the caution it demanded in more ways than one
1	all the same , he had not waited for the concerts
1	at that moment her decision was irrevocably fixed for good and all
1	and how often adrian , with his thirst for the comic , would later laugh with me at this tale and at how his father would raise gentle , deep eyes from the book to tell it , and then , apparently quite undisturbed by the somewhat scandalous provenance of his holy writ , return to herr von schweinitz 's verse commentaries or the wisdom of solomon to the tyrants
1	tom opposed this arrangement , but to no avail
1	well , he did hope , hans castorp said , that collars and cuffs were more in evidence with him than with her fellow countrymen at the bad russian table
1	tempers cool , minds clear , certain moods do not remain unaltered with the passage of time
1	he wrote me at length about it and also spoke about the modernity of musical methods that had erupted with monteverdi-about his images of action , his punctuated rhythms , sudden reversals of emphasis , stirring figures ; about the way he had strengthened the musical line by parallels in thirds and sixths and varied his cadences rhythmically ; about his crescendi , tightly woven imitations , widened intervals , thrilling grand pauses , insistent ostinati , and rhythmic repetitions
1	would it have taken much for the works of the hero of these pages , of adrian leverkiihn , also to have fallen victim to their lust for trampling under the things of the mind-a lust quite foreign to so-called mob rule ?
1	and hanno buddenbrook slept , his cheek nestled in his pillow
1	every accented syllable in a text , then , would always have to be represented by a master and the unaccented ones by a servant
1	one day frau permaneder ’ s sister-in-law greeted her with the news that several repairmen and suppliers of household goods had been pressing her , gerda buddenbrook , in the most improper fashion , to settle some large accounts—and tony stood there frozen in place for a while before breaking into dreadful laughter
1	it ’ s an ache , a constant , faint , unsettling ache along the whole leg , and up my left side , the side where the heart is
1	that was all i needed
1	and it made her feel quite calm and serene
1	the splendid vocal organ swelled to its full natural range and power , and indeed if you walked into an adjoining room , leaving the doors open but staying out of the line of sight , it was exactly as if the artist were physically present , as if he were standing there in the salon singing , music in hand
1	once-unfortunately only once-during our stay , he sat down at the badly out-of-tune square piano in our friends ' living room and played for us characteristic passages and a few entire scene sequences from the completed score ( which included even most of the instrumentation for a select orchestra ) of the pleasant , conceited comedic called , loues labors lost , as the piece had been titled in r : the first act , including the scene set in armado 's house , and parts of several later ones that he had worked ahead on-especially berowne 's monologues , on which he had always had designs , both the one in verse at the end of the third act and the rhythmically unstructured one in the fourth , which was musically more successful than the former in expressing that lord 's unremittingly comic and grotesque and yet genuine and profound despair over his having fallen for the suspect black beauty­
1	settembrini hissed in her direction
1	you are speaking of a unity that we are working to achieve , but which , to the great sorrow of all good men , does not yet exist
1	what are you going to do ?
1	it was a decision that raised my heart high with joy-and at the same time compressed it with fear
1	a cold cigar butt was wedged between his lips , and his cheeks were flushed
1	it did not distort his features or diminish him as a man , and its very incomprehensibility—and no one would have had the impudence to attribute it to the quantities of wine he had enjoyed—lent him something grand and majestic , so that they all deferred to him and did not attempt another bite of food
1	madame buddenbrook said , her pale eyes drifting off a little to one side
1	the one person , however , who worshipped thomas buddenbrook ’ s fiancée with a fierce passion from the first moment he saw her on the street was gosch the broker
1	it was probably just a part of grandeur
1	this was his native soil—marshy , soggy , unsteady footing for all , though he trod it with more steady assurance
1	ultimately they all knew this before they sat down , and in his chatterbox way , hans castorp had even blurted it out as they waited with trembling fingers
1	the tarnished giant cylinder of the bass drum was here , whose head was set booming by a felt-covered mallet ; and the copper kettledrum , sixteen of which berlioz still required for his orchestra-he had not known them in the form nikolaus leverkiihn stocked , with a tuning mechanism that allows the drummer to adjust for a change in key with a twist of the hand
1	across the way people were hard at work on the bobsled run—from the top of the northwest slope of schatzalp to the valley below—and it was expected to be open within a few days ; that was , if a warm foehn wind did not spoil everything
1	beg your pardon , but we now come to a parting of the ways
1	but , first of all , i ’ m still rather young—and , then , i had a talk with uncle gotthold , and he was very happy to accept the position himself
1	-even if those conclusions did not lead directly to the plundering of the world by soldiers sworn forever to the cause of christus imperator maximus
1	it seems to me one grants it , both to oneself and others , more readily in the other arts than in music
1	the blood of youth burns not with such excess as gravity 's revolt to wantonness
1	we shall do a portrait of your interior here shortly
1	the care of his teeth—the fillings and extractions , if those were needed—was in the hands of herr brecht on mühlen strasse , the owner of josephus ; but for the care and regulation of his digestion , there was castor oil—good thick , silvery , shiny castor oil , which was administered with a teaspoon and slid down your throat like a slimy newt
1	it is pure chance how i look , or rather , comes about thus , it stablishes itself as circumstance demands , without that i give it any heed
1	worthy townsfolk-and their contemplative mood enjoys the protection of halberdiers
1	those who had been here a year or more did not mention them
1	two people were being buried alive ; their lungs full of the gases of the crypt , cramped with hunger , they would perish together , or even worse , one after the other ; and then decay would do its unspeakable work on their bodies , until two skeletons lay there under those vaults , each indifferent and insensitive to whether it lay there alone or with another set of bones
1	he began the variations movement , the adagio malta semplice e cantabile
1	he let a few ivory game markers run through his fingers ; they clattered into the chest , and he closed the lid again as he turned to leave
1	they reveal the ambiguity of life itself
1	that same evening , as they stood alone in the sitting room by the dim light of candles burning low now among furniture shoved this way and that—and enveloped in the sweet , heavy , thick odor of fine foods , perfumes , wines , coffee , cigars , and flowers that had adorned both the ladies and the tables—the consul squeezed her hands and said , well done , gerda
1	would you like to ?
1	there stood the buddenbrook family vault , with its towering marker , the names in gothic script , a sandstone cross at the top
1	you do not know
1	she had left the bed and was sitting in an easy chair , one elbow set firmly on its arm , her chin buried so deep in her hand that four bent fingers clutched at her lower lip
1	with a volume on embryology propped at the bottom of his sternum , our young adventurer followed the development of the organism from the moment when the sperm , out in front of many just like itself and driven onward by the whipping motion of its tail , crashed headfirst into the gelatin coating of the egg and bored its way through to what is called the mount of conception , a conical protrusion in the outer rim of the egg ’ s protoplasm formed in reaction to the approach of the sperm
1	doesn ’ t he care about her at all ?
1	she saw morten schwarzkopf—he was so real , and he spoke to her , bending forward in that special way of his , now and then turning his kind , probing eyes to gaze at someone else ; he smiled , and wasn ’ t even aware of how beautiful his teeth were
1	they loved to put the existential question , spoke of sacral space or political space or academic space , of structural principle , of dialectic tension , of ontological correspondences , and so forth
1	the day was much like the one before—cold , hazy , windy
1	there it is a mere adjunct to homophonic composition
1	but not a totally detoxified heaven on earth , and there ’ s scant blessing in that—but the escape artist wouldn ’ t believe old man behrens
1	it is truly hideous , you know , the way you are throwing the months around
1	the weight of his personality would have tipped the scales even had he not been , as always , the organizer and director of this enterprise
1	that stöhr woman got huffy merely because i mentioned someone had died—how silly
1	that was after christmas-both fathers , though already turning away and half-estranged from earthly things , had spent the holiday with their families
1	yes , and now you two , the senator said
1	of total terror , sits up erect in his chair , and turns to one side as if he is about to bolt
1	it might well be that getting used to things up here was simply a matter of getting used to not getting used to them—but as for his digestive chemistry and his sensitive , dry mucous membranes that tended to nosebleeds , the adjustment seemed complete at last
1	but old schwarzkopf said , don ’ t go putting on airs , doc , with your metabolism
1	with the aid of sesame ’ s bishop ’ s punch , tony quickly became acquainted with them all
1	he found it similar in many ways to life at the shore : a primal monotony was common to both landscapes
1	and now herr grünlich stood up , too
1	do not believe , beloved brethren and sisters , that for the promission and establishment of the pact i had required a crossway in the wood and many circles and gross conjuration , for indeed st thomas already teaches that for apostasy there be no need of words by which to complish invocation , but rather any deed suffices , e'en without express obeisance
1	it is sure to look quite innocent
1	and hanno would sit there in a limp cold sweat , unable to protest , unable to run away—in a state no different from that of a felon facing execution—and with enormous eyes he would watch herr brecht approach , his forceps held against his sleeve , and he could see the little beads of sweat on the dentist ’ s brow and that his mouth , too , was twisted in pain
1	that thursday at the buddenbrooks , with the consul present , there was only brief , almost indifferent mention made of the forthcoming election , and even at those remarks old madame buddenbrook would discreetly avert her pale eyes
1	time crept by—seven minutes seemed endless
1	a very gratifying sight it is not , and the reader should subtract nothing from the word painful ,
1	my promissory notes are being called in
1	because for a man to be interested in a sick woman was certainly no more reasonable than
1	to keep from losing your boots , you had to bend down at almost every step and grab hold of the tongue with your fingers and tug your foot out of the squishy mire
1	i saw in it the key to his mode of life ; it served as an explanation for what was for me the more inexplicable fact that he managed such things at all
1	like his father and grandfather , like his relatives and friends , he would spend his days sitting at a desk and enjoying a fine , rich meal four times a day
1	and so having been invited for dinner as a good friend of the institorises , i was happy to comply when inez , seconded by her husband , asked me during the meal to keep her company afterward , once helmut had left , as planned , to play cards at the allotria club
1	i ’ m willing to take the everyday china with the onion pattern , frau permaneder said
1	would you kindly explain that to me ?
1	the tooth is in extraordinarily bad condition
1	i would not call myself lukewarm ; i am decidedly cold-but in my judgment of myself i beg exemption from the tastes of that power who dispenseth both blessing and curse
1	i didn ’ t have a hat to take off—
1	and yet his drunkenness did not belittle or demean him , caused him no disgrace , but rather , when joined with the majesty of his nature , it only made him grander and more awe-inspiring
1	a family has to be united , to hold together , father ; otherwise evil will come knocking at the door
1	a skilled expert at all this , in his element in more than one sense , hans castorp stood piously beside the bed
1	my good engineer , settembrini said , angrily admonishing him , pull yourself together and leave me out of such depraved nonsense
1	't is truly a gift
1	by all indications , it must have taken his breath away at once , paralysis of the respiratory system , you know , rapid suffocation , presumably without great pain or agony
1	for me it would be deserting the colors to do what he did , to go down to the flatlands at all costs , despite rhadamanthus ’ s prohibition , and try to be of use and serve progress
1	having come here on a definite practical mission—that is , for the express purpose of having an energetic look around , of checking up on his lackadaisical young relative , as he put it , of prying him loose and taking him home—he was quite aware that he was operating on foreign soil ; and from the first moment , he had been acutely sensitive to a suspicion that he was now the guest of a world , a social community , with a self-assurance as intact as that of the world from which he came , indeed surpassing it in that regard , so that his business energies were at once in conflict with his good breeding—in very serious conflict , because the self-assurance of the world of his hosts turned out to be truly overwhelming
1	aesthetic deliverance or confinement , that is destiny , that is what determines one 's happiness or unhappiness , whether one is comfortably at home on this earth or lives in hopeless , if proud isolation
1	it is one o ’ clock in the afternoon and people are thronged along breite strasse in front of the town hall—the town hall , with its tracework of glazed tiles , its tapering towers and turrets silhouetted against the whitish gray sky , its covered staircase supported by projecting columns , its arcades whose pointed arches reveal a view of the market square and its fountain
1	oxygen , the director said
1	so soft each step , so high and mild the night
1	what i mean is an inversion , an austere and proud upending of meaning , such as i at least find , for example , in the friendly appeal by dr
1	he lived , we suddenly heard , with only one-quite competently , so it appeared , and the ladies soon forgot all about it
1	and yet the thought almost made him feel better , because it seemed simple , plausible , and sane , something thinkable , sayable , in comparison with his brooding over this ignominious riddle , this mysterious scandal overhead
1	which he did , urging her on in pithy phrases
1	rather , her awakened femininity immediately turned to another , for whom she had long been conscious of only serene , half-sisterly feelings , but for whom quite different emotions were now freed within her
1	even though his shoddy exterior was excused by a tiresome lack of money and could not detract from his status as a gentleman and cavalier , which as nature 's truth shone through and counteracted appearances , that same truth was partly a deception , and in this complicated sense schildknapp was an imposter
1	edward the seventh will no longer be able to allow the russians an exit through the dardanelles ; and if austria manages somehow to pull herself together for a more active policy in the balkans , then
1	but just as those miscreants willed it , germany has been so razed to the ground that one does not even dare hope that germany will be able anytime soon to engage in any sort of cultural activity , in the printing of a book ; and indeed i have now and then considered ways and means for having these pages reach america , so that for now at least they could be presented to people there in english translation
1	i ’ ve spent , god knows , sleepless nights coming up with it
1	fine , hans castorp said
1	sister , it was evident that the nature of her successes was more personal , or better , more erotic than artistic
1	that all these discomforts are the end result , the harvest of your vices , your indolence , your constant self-observation
1	but then it would all be over
1	you want more credit ?
1	in a tone that approached apology , he even went into some detail about his reasons for wanting to buy the house
1	listen to that defunct chord-even isolated from the whole it stands for a general technical state that contradicts our reality
1	the traditional children ’ s day had been disbanded , and so thomas buddenbrook was not disposed to inviting and giving presents to all those whom the old woman had gathered about her at christmas
1	after a fairly rapid descent and another level stretch , the path now led back uphill—a steep hill
1	the treatment wasn ’ t botched , its orientation was merely a bit one-sided , perhaps
1	and then we shall see what we shall see
1	don ’ t say that , the director objected
1	he ’ s a learned man , but i ’ m sure that the confederation ’ s outrageous laws dealing with the universities and the press left him completely cold
1	he had taken a room on the fourth floor of a house on amalien strasse , not far from where his friend lived , and there he now sat at his desk , wrapped in a coat and blanket , beside an open window all winter long-for by nature he had an exceptional need of fresh airand consumed in part by hatred , in part by passionate addiction , encompassed by difficulties , and puffing away at cigarettes , he struggled for the precise german equivalent of english words , phrases , and rhythms
1	ontogenetically speaking , it has the same origin as the apparatus for the so-called higher sensory organs up there in your skull
1	she called the deep snow-cover a massive agglomeration ; and one day she caused herr settembrini no end of amazement by declaring that she had been reading a book from the sanatorium library that would interest him , entitled benedetto cenelli , in schiller ’ s translation
1	then let him keep his pin money—there are nobler things in life
1	you can ’ t be sure of that !
1	ordering his companion to wait , the director thrust his way through both doors
1	but then our humorist with his incorruptibly keen eye had realized that this unhappy state of affairs was nothing less than the fruit of prejudice
1	and so now they had the owner of a grocery shop in the senate
1	but enough for this evening about the nationalist commitment
1	wolf , brahms , and bruckner lived for years in the same city , in vienna , and the entire time each avoided the others and none of them , as far as i know , ever met the others
1	herr grünlich did the honors with the silent , tactful , reticent gestures of someone directing guests at a funeral
1	he shouted it , grabbing his rotund wife around the waist right in front of our eyes
1	did director behrens tell you that ?
1	and it was in the light of all this , he went on , that one must regard the work about which he was speaking in particular , the sonata opus i i i
1	he was dazed , felt totally inebriated by something so indescribably new , alluring , and full of promise that it reminded him of the first time he had felt the hopes and yearnings of love
1	she patted his broad captain ’ s hand , still resting on the table where it had fallen , and coaxed him with the suggestion that one could always order something else , something warm , if he liked and if the chef could be talked into it
1	but that was so contrary to her own views , and applied it to her infatuation with the other man-deceived lnstitoris with his own convic-
1	and who should come through the open door behind him—gliding swiftly , smiling delicately , exclaiming , zounds !
1	today is friday—i have my monthly checkup tomorrow morning after dinner
1	that a man can be a caesar in an old commercial city on the baltic ?
1	alfonso , however , scolded her for
1	shaving had become difficult for him , and although he had a heavy beard that grew rapidly , nothing had been done about it for eight or ten days , so that his waxen face with its gentle eyes was now framed by a full black beard—a warrior ’ s beard , the kind a soldier might grow out in the field
1	after four o ’ clock tea in the dining hall—at which
1	we make a smart piece of money with the brewery that neiderpaur ’ s director of
1	oh lord , just this once !
1	they failed to give such things their due
1	although he made slow progress in learning to walk and talk , there no longer seemed to be any immediate danger
1	but what else is there to do ?
1	he asked for someone , anyone , adolf todtenhaupt if need be , to translate—he had lost all interest in trying to examine dubious scholars for today
1	there was a good-sized shipment of rye that i wasn ’ t able to sell at much of a profit
1	less favorable to production
1	entered musical time , only to be relieved again then by the first voice beginning anew , after having yielded the onomatopoetic ding-dong foundation to the second-and so forth
1	and the fiasco was soon complete—you were given the most dreadful dressing-down on the spot
1	his bows were exaggerated , and he let his arms hang down as he looked up at these poor fellows with adoring eyes
1	why should i start up here , of all places ?
1	come here , tom , frau permaneder said , her voice shaking
1	because , then , even being demeaned brings with it a certain stature , and a woman can look down from the heights of her demeaned position to those who have no royal stature , and speak in that disparaging tone you used just now when you asked about timbres-poste and said : gentlemen should at least be punctual and dependable
1	pardon me for saying it
1	it ’ s going to work
1	i ( with rancour ) : how long have i to sit and freeze and listen to your intolerable gibberish ?
1	but corl smolt had swallowed his mouthful by now , and , with the crowd behind him , he stood there , legs set firmly apart , and offered his objections
1	he directed the young man toward the end of the semicircle nearest the chaise longue and folding screen , where elly had taken a seat on an ordinary cane chair , her face turned more to the entrance with its two steps than to the middle of the room ; the doctor then sat down on a similar chair directly in front of her and grasped her hands , at the same time holding both her knees clamped between his own
1	nonetheless our attention was directed mostly to scenes outside , despite marie 's having steered the conversation to shared experiences in zurich , to the evening in the tonhalle and the violin concerto
1	there can be no discoursing with teeth clattering
1	does your mind not take warm comfort in the thought ?
1	naturally the dialectical connection between evil and what is good and sacred played a significant role in theodicy , the vindication of god in light of evil 's presence in the world , which took up a large part of schleppfuss 's course
1	and yet , tony , it all hung by the merest thread
1	she had always known , of course , that someday she would be the wife of a businessman , would make a good , advantageous match worthy of her family and the firm
1	his voice hissed , but his words were cool and businesslike , and nothing betrayed the agitation in his soul
1	less than a year after the death of his brother , the senator , he had moved to hamburg , and there , before the eyes of god and man , he had married a lady with whom he had long been on close terms , one fräulein aline puvogel
1	if i brush up on my latin perhaps i can read it
1	in art , in any case , the subjective and objective are intertwined beyond recognition ; each proceeds from the other and assumes the character of the other , the subjective takes shape as the objective and is awakened to spontaneity again by genius- wouldynamized , as we say-and all of a sudden is speaking the language of subjectivity
1	well-tanned young people of both sexes entered humming a tune , spoke with the dining attendants , and weighed into breakfast with a robust appetite
1	her left hand played nervously with the sofa pillows , and her pale eyes drifted uneasily to the window
1	he had owned only a very few works by bach : a couple of motets , the well-tempered clavier , a toccata , and some odds and ends , all collected in one volume
1	and tolerance was needed
1	first i must ask how my dear family is doing—you and tom and gerda and erika and christian and thilda and ida
1	but the senator spoke to him
1	why not pay joachim ziemssen a visit ?
1	she stretched out her hands , both hands , to them and said , how glad i am to see you gentlemen
1	the mizzle , echo ?
1	there was dignity and honesty in his mouth , which was turned down around a wooden pipe
1	to the right , however , a crackling fire could be seen through the ornate wrought-iron door of the stove , which was set back in a semicircular niche
1	we want you cold , till scarcely the flames of production shall be hot enough for you to warm yourself in them
1	they rumbled and swayed ponderously along the large echoing passageway and down the low steps into the courtyard
1	he was treated for phthisis—and died
1	he lies there , face in the cool muck , legs spread , feet twisted until the heels press the earth
1	the gentlemen dined together in the berghof ’ s restaurant , after hans castorp had shown his guest to joachim ’ s room and given him a chance to tidy himself up a bit
1	and s o what approach d o you envision ?
1	she asked something , directing her question to joachim , even though he was still engrossed in his magazine and hans castorp was sitting there doing nothing at all
1	hm yes— behrens replied with a shrug
1	when it came to the forms of address , he would substitute the oddest circumlocutions—that is , if he could not slur over them entirely
1	you see before you a devastated man , a man who will perish , if—he hastily interrupted himself—indeed , a man who will surely die of grief , if you reject his love for you
1	that ’ s what wives are for , he says
1	he had donned a formal , stiff collar for this evening and so could support his chin on that
1	the consul then left at once for meng strasse , where the firm ’ s offices were still located , ate a second , late breakfast with his mother , christian , and ida jungmann , and did not see gerda until four in the afternoon , at dinner
1	it ’ s not so much , it ’ s rather cheap
1	i am most likely mistaken to hope that your sense of justice is sufficient for you to gauge my indignation upon receiving no answer to my second urgent letter , written upon receipt of your reply ( which i shall not presume to characterize ! )
1	their faces were red and excited
1	cultic music served the purposes of the church , did it not ?
1	she spent many hours weeping over it , because it meant that the firm ’ s venerable shield , a treasure handed down over four generations , would have to be disposed of , that its history would come to an end—even though there was a legitimate heir
1	he said it softly and without looking up , because dr mantelsack had asked him—and was given a nod of approval
1	interrupted only by a quick second breakfast with his mother and by dinner with gerda , after which he might spend a half-hour on the sofa with a cigar and a newspaper , he kept busy at his work until well into the evening—if not his firm ’ s affairs , then customs , taxes , railroads , new construction , the post , the care of the poor
1	and since then business in summer was as lively as that in winter
1	i could only concur with all of it
1	there is , of course , dr grabow continued , absolutely no reason for serious worry at present
1	a year and a half ago ?
1	there i also found rudiger schildknapp , who had not been called up as yet and was spending the weekend with our friend
1	it is so hard to keep them separate , they are so intertwined
1	well , this is no fun , the senator said in a gruff , annoyed voice and stood up
1	really , what a shame , gerda !
1	hans castorp did not let on to anyone that he had not known about his relative ’ s imminent departure , particularly not to the limping porter , who had accompanied the consul to the station
1	and when the news reached the great-aunt at the other end of the table , even she made a sly joke of chiding him ; pretty marusya , who had paid him barely any attention before now , bent forward to look at him , her orange-scented handkerchief pressed to her lips , and reprimanded him with her brown , round eyes
1	the temperature at night had been below freezing , but now it stayed there all day , from morning till evening ; and with only brief interruptions , the snow continued a fourth , a fifth , a seventh day
1	she moved calmly and with undeniable dignity
1	and the engagement of his personality promptly had a bracing , focusing effect
1	noon came and another hour passed , but it was not until erika returned , all flushed from her expedition with ida , her pockets stuffed full of daisies , lady ’ s-smock , and grasses , and reminded them of the gingersnaps that still had to be bought , that they started off on a walk to the village—but only after elisabeth , who was their hostess today , had paid the bill with a good-sized gold coin
1	the senator walked beside her , saying nothing , his head lowered , his hands at his back
1	they said good-bye outside room
1	i was taking a little walk yesterday evening between nine-thirty and ten , and i happened to glance up along the balconies , and the electric lamp on yours was glimmering in the darkness
1	nations that considered themselves genteel may have abolished corporal punishment , but the belief that its abolition was a mark of true progress was only the more comic for being so unshakable
1	no matter what the weather , winter was always in view , if only at a distance—remnants and traces of snow lay glistening in crevices and fissures of the craggy rhätikon chain that seemed to block the entrance to the valley , and a constant snowy salute came from mountain majesties far to the south
1	but the cold continues to rush against me
1	early diagnosis is difficult—particularly for my good colleagues in the flatlands
1	ignominy and disgrace are mild terms for such ruin and bankruptcy , for such ghastly humiliation
1	he begged in a whisper , as if to set an example
1	i always come equipped with those
1	she showed almost no interest at all in sievert tiburtius and his engagement to clara ; but that was not something to which the two of them aspired
1	because , as soon as he began to think of the end of life as something more than a distant , theoretical , and minor necessity and regarded it , instead , as imminent and tangible , as something for which one must make immediate preparations , he began to brood , to search himself , to examine how things stood between him and death and what he thought about matters beyond this earthly life
1	two half-naked old women were busy at a ghastly chore among flickering braziers—their hair was gray and matted , their drooping witches ’ breasts had tits long as fingers
1	could i trust my ears ?
1	what did i think ?
1	you believe i am called to this art and suggest it is no great 'step outside the path
1	she merely let her gaze drift away and asked a question about a totally different subject
1	the criminal was as imbued with guilt as he was with self
1	it was a modest structure just this side of davos-dorf , separated from the road only by a small yard
1	she had chosen two of the largest servings of both the fish and the ham , along with ample portions of vegetables , had bent carefully and nearsightedly over her plate , and consumed it all , without any hurry , but in silent and large bites
1	on business , as far as i know
1	he exclaimed over and over
1	sesame weichbrodt , however , stood on her tiptoes , kissed her former ward—now frau permaneder—on the brow with a soft popping sound , and said with her most warmly exaggerated vowels , be heppy , you good chawld
1	and jean is down with erysipelas and can not help me
1	he felt a weight being lifted from his heart
1	( i just have to hear the word 'smashing , and i take alarm )
1	were there justice upon this earth , it would have been his father—indeed , his father ’ s father—who was elevated to the senate
1	youth 's lust for action and adventure was united with the expedient fun of emergency final exams and hasty graduation
1	the dreadful bombardment of the city of durer and willibald pirckheimer was no longer some distant event ; and as the last judgment fell upon munich as well , i sat here in my study , turning ashen , shaking like the walls , doors , and windowpanes of my house-and writing this account of a man 's life with a trembling hand
1	control yourself , for god ’ s sake !
1	but you couldn ’ t have put me in more foreign soil , i ’ d just as soon end up in turkey
1	what speaks , at least in part , for this spontaneous revolt and urge to flee from his mother , is his suicide attempt upon our informing him that elsbeth leverkiihn had been notified of his illness and was on her way to him
1	but his face was burning
1	he wanted to cover his eyes with his hands and could not
1	you attempted a while ago to help us understand a christian individualism founded in the dualism between god and the world , and tried to prove its preeminence over all politically determined morality
1	and if god takes me , should i die ,
1	he did not even notice joachim working his way through the chairs toward him , and he flinched when his cousin spoke to him
1	he was very pale , his knees had gone weak , his eyes burned
1	they are capable of boldly producing antithetical principles of thought and life in the form of great personalities
1	the living had their rights , too , and so on
1	i will come back tomorrow
1	and why should i even think of forcing my chivalrous services upon your traveling companion ?
1	he sat bent forward , one thumb wedged between the buttons on his jacket , a kind but defiant look in his eyes
1	’ nd that ain ’ t no fault of the consul
1	his presence is more symbolic than real at this moment , but will you permit me to do so now ?
1	they were new texts to old melodies , and the community went on using them that way for years
1	the next morning he had no difficulty learning the name of this unsettling fellow traveler , including the gratis news that the two of them had taken adjoining rooms on the second floor
1	my position remains , he concluded , that ninety-nine point seven is ninety-nine point seven
1	what awaits those who have taken you for liege in your horrid hole ?
1	hans castorp said after a pause
1	when he arrived in leipzig and once again placed himself under the guidance , tutelage , and supervision of wendell kretzschmar , he had long since ceased to be a beginner in the study of music-of that
1	you need to keep that in mind , hanno
1	that they do it with joy , and also with boundless fear and an unutterable longing for home , is both shameful and sublime , but surely no reason to bring them here to this
1	if exposed to the influences of this half-fanatic , half-malicious humbug , both your minds and souls are in danger
1	you puff out your cheeks in amazement at my apologia , but i am the one who has every right to be astonished and not to understand how you in particular
1	then the lesson began , and twenty-five young men now had occasion to prove the same zeal for boron , chlorine , and strontium that they had just shown for ovid
1	oh—and tom , she began , first gazing down into her lap and then making a shy attempt to read his face , what about the furniture ?
1	we ’ ll ride into town together later
1	she quietly laid aside her little handbag , her cape , and her gray cap , which she wore over her white one , and went to work , full of gentle and friendly words , her rosary dangling from her belt and clicking softly as she moved about
1	i was speaking as a theologian and so necessarily sounded like one
1	will you drink a glass of red wine with me ?
1	i have already mentioned the cloister garden above the town , to which our friends , portfolios in hand , climbed every morning to work , each in his separate spot
1	eva is very sweet to me , and herr niederpaur , the brewery director , is an easygoing man
1	it was easy to picture her life to this point
1	the dilemma begins , sir , the real tragedy begins where nature has been cruel enough to break the harmony of the personality—or to make it impossible from the very start—by joining a noble and life-affirming mind to a body unfit for life
1	my god , i don ’ t know how i got off that stage
1	whenever he spotted him , hans castorp was glad both that it was so difficult to come into contact with people who were not tablemates and that his hometown was a large one with many different social spheres
1	that ’ s my wife ’ s handiwork
1	but then he had returned again and again ; every friday as the sun dipped low , driven by an irresistible longing , he had saddled his horse and ridden three miles to hear them
1	he understands that the craft of the freemason is the art of governance
1	and in fact , little soundless flakes were falling more heavily now across the slope ahead
1	we were mere children then
1	snow fell , it turned cold , and the sharp , clear air was full of the cheerful and melancholy melodies of black-mustached organ-grinders , italians who had come to town dressed in velvet jackets for the holidays
1	the vegetable lady , for instance , in her big straw bonnet with bright green ribbons , driving her little cart on the way from the village , would call out a friendly , and a good mornin ’ to you , missy !
1	hans castorp knew her vaguely by sight
1	foremostly is not at all bad
1	he waved a dining attendant over—it was the dwarf—and although she was very busy , she instantly obeyed his forceful gesture and took a position next to his chair , milk jug and coffeepot still in hand
1	presumably it was more an attempt at affability -- -'born of extreme arrogance
1	and so he sank back down on his knees , his face and hands raised toward a heaven darkened by sulfurous fumes , but no longer the grotto ceiling in a sinful mountain of delight
1	over the centuries , the church ’ s love of innovation had consisted of inquisitions , whose task was to throttle all life-affirming ideas , to suffocate them in the smoke of the stake ; but nowadays she was sending out her emissaries to announce that she was all for upending things , that her goal was to replace freedom , education , and democracy with dictatorship of the mob and barbarism
1	a few , here and there , may have understood and been touched by the shyness , the loneliness that enfolded him , by the lofty rigor of his life-indeed , i know that it did occur , and find the fact revealing
1	monkey , little merry fellow ,
1	( he pronounced it iffamy , however )
1	it brought tears to my eyes
1	but i think you ’ ve probably got enough to do for right now just getting settled in , and don ’ t need any adventures
1	he pulled his book back in front of him , opened it , all the while visibly struggling to regain his composure by looking around the room ; he now lowered his head and found his train of thought again
1	death or life—illness or health—spirit or nature
1	an unutterable collapse-economic , political , moral , and spiritual-in short , an allembracing collapse looms ahead
1	there had been fierce , involuntary manifestations of energy much like those that had occurred in hermine kleefeld ’ s room ; at such meetings , comrade krokowski would use his skill to hypnotize little elly , putting her into a waking trance , and then , under all possible safeguards of authenticity , systematically obtain and cultivate phenomena : the turning on and off of lights , hangings on tables and walls , and much , much more
1	written in three movements , it has no key signature , even though , if i may put it this way , three tonalities are built into it : b minor , c minor , and d minor-of which the musician can see that the d minor forms a kind of dominant of the second degree , the b minor a subdominant , and with the c minor exactly in between
1	and when the ghastly procedure was over—and hanno would spit blood in the blue bowl at his side and then sit up pale and trembling , with tears in his eyes and his face contorted with pain—herr brecht would have to sit down somewhere to dry his brow and drink a little water
1	and to see him like that , coming from such a difficult , practical task , made a big impression on me
1	and stopping i t with his own hand , would break into bitter tears
1	an apprentice must be fearless and hungry for knowledge
1	another relative , a brother of frau nella 's dead husband , daria manardi , a gentle and gray-bearded man of peasant stock who walked with a cane , also lived in the family house with his nondescript and sickly wife
1	the song meant a great deal to him , a whole world—a world that he evidently must have loved , or otherwise he would not have been so infatuated with the image that represented it
1	hans castorp was inspired by this meeting , and at the same time he sensed something like a growing anxiety , much like that suffocating feeling of being locked up in a box together with auspicious chance ; what was more , the fact that the long-forgotten pribislav had reappeared up here as frau chauchat and had looked at him with kirghiz eyes made him feel as if he were locked up together with something inevitable and inescapable—an inescapability that both cheered and alarmed him
1	hans castorp replied that the director had taken the words right out of his mouth , had suggested precisely what he had wanted to ask
1	whereas herr settembrini really did help me employ my time meaningfully
1	hans castorp looked up from his bed at his guest , whom he had reduced to silence
1	the devil waxes pathetical
1	yes , as the core of a period in life when one is free to strive , to survey the world with fresh senses and gather in its harvest-and insofar as i spent them at the side of a childhood companion to whom i was devoted
1	and so , although we were always separated from one another in time , each melodic present kept delightful company with all the others , and what we produced formed a charming weft , an ensemble sound , that simultaneous singing could never form-a structure whose vocal pattern we happily enjoyed without inquiring further about its nature and cause
1	low back and arms and that i knew from ramberg strasse ) , where she had hastily thrown herself when death swept over her as she gargled
1	i don ’ t know , tom said , with exaggerated indifference in his voice , trying not to be impatient
1	but that billionaire 's spree , that bombastic misery , finally came to an end one day ; an expression of reason returned to the grimacing countenance of our economic life ; and we germans had some inkling , it seemed , of an age of psychological recovery , of social progress in peace and freedom , of mature and forward-looking cultural endeavor , of a well-intentioned accommodation of our emotions and thoughts to what the world considers normal
1	then very close to hans castorp ’ s ear , she whispered a fervent yes !
1	the old man cried
1	suso , suso , he said , without raising his voice , but in a certain surprised tone of admonishment , and behold : presumably as a result of the soothing , buzzing sound , the animal calmed down almost immediately and let the wizard stretch out a hand and pat his old battle-scarred skull-and there was deep seriousness in those yellow eyes gazing up at him
1	he was already busy settling his affairs
1	you have made the best of your abilities
1	he also told them about the arctic circle , to which business had taken him on several occasions , about the midnight sun and the perpetual winter at north cape
1	and i go down there with permaneder , who takes my dowry and retires
1	madame buddenbrook was already dressed in the silk dress in which she was to be laid out upstairs in the columned hall later that afternoon
1	frau iwersen held back at the door , staring across the room to the bier
1	it was after supper , during the evening social , out in the lobby
1	and things will work out for you , too
1	they walked along in that wide , peaceful , whispering hush of the sea that gives every sound , near or far , some mysterious importance
1	his accent , particularly his it ’ s , betrayed his hamburg origins , whereas starting back in his student days , his cousin had adopted more standard pronunciation
1	finally he turned around and said with measured puzzlement , why , i know that face , don ’ t i ?
1	it was brilliant-a proficiency that was fit for a cabaret performance , almost more impressive than his violin playing , and for which he must have innately been especially favored
1	human suffering goes to his heart
1	they strolled along the beach , right next to the water , where it is easy to walk because the sand is smooth and hard after high tide , where little ordinary white shells are scattered about , and the other kind , too—larger and longer , iridescent—and here and there you find wet yellow-green seaweed with berries like hollow balls that pop when you squeeze them , and jellyfish , the simple translucent kind , and the reddish yellow poisonous ones that sting you on the legs when you ’ re swimming
1	ma è matto questo ragazzo !
1	should have done it long ago
1	in response to my laughing disagreement , he admitted that kierkegaard must therefore have had little respect for our opus r , and that on the whole the man uttered a great deal of aesthetic nonsense
1	i admit , you and the lord are on intimate terms
1	their guide , the estate administrator himself , had told them , with many a sympathetic shake of his head , as if these were facts worth knowing , that the inhabitants ate meat only once a year at christmas and did not even have tallow candles to burn , but literally went to bed with the chickens
1	what are you doing there ?
1	then , to be sure , long before the bathometer read , oo , then , feet , all-around there reigned perfect blackness-the darkness of interstellar space unvisited for eternities by even the weakest ray of sun , the eternally silent and maiden night , which now had to endure being illumined by and examined under a brutal artificial beam , not of cosmic origins , but brought down from the world above
1	settembrini did not like the idea—hans castorp was shrewd and sensitive enough to see that quite clearly
1	carducci wouldn ’ t have been all that happy with him , either
1	we can not call you consul buddenbrook yet , i suppose ?
1	how could i wait any longer ?
1	and i reply : because it loosens and delivers , because it is a deliverance , and not deliverance from evil , but evil deliverance
1	therefore , to your consolation , let it be said that hell will have nothing essentially new to offer you-only that to which you are more or less customed , proudly customed
1	and then our emotions are inflamed
1	he took a step back , spread his arms wide , displaying both palms to her , and spoke with all the seriousness a man of honor and determination can muster : you realize , mademoiselle buddenbrook , do you not , that i can not allow myself to be insulted in this fashion ?
1	i knew from very reliable sources , my friends , the awful risks he was taking behind ratenkamp ’ s back , lending money here and taking out credit there , all in the firm ’ s name
1	dear father , please , take the armchair , he said gently
1	i ’ ve got to be on my way , and i mean right now
1	a great wave flooded up the steps and flowed out along the corridors , streaming into this room as well , which was suddenly filled with life , movement , and noise
1	they live separate lives , one might say , and she visits him now and again
1	it was a clever stunt , and he did it well
1	intellectual abstractions can never be personal , that is the logical conclusion and extension of my maxim
1	my god , a red-haired , red-eyed patient from berlin remarked one evening in the lobby
1	in short , if the sympathetic or awestruck healthy person were to become sick himself , to lose his health , he would soon see that illness is a state in and of itself , though certainly not an honorable one , and that he had been taking it all too seriously
1	but if i tried to see him through the young lady 's eyes , the affair lost its validity
1	you see this knob here , this little raised spot ?
1	the cellos enlarge on this for a while , shaking their wise heads in regret over this riddle , and at a given , carefully considered point in their comments , the wind instruments , after a preparatory deep breath that causes shoulders to rise and fall again , enter with a chorale , stirringly solemn , splendidly harmonized , and played with all the muted dignity and gently constrained power of brass
1	a warm relationship between doctor and patient is certainly to be welcomed , and there is something to the proposition that only he who suffers can be the guide and healer of the suffering
1	i spoke quite rightly , by the way , since the whole wizardry is osmosis , a diffusion of liquor , a proliferous process
1	sit down , he said in his contrabass voice
1	great many of those that came from his pupils , male and female
1	we have him to thank for the hague conventions , superior moral realities that will abide
1	but obviously the thing to do is to sell as soon as possible , he concluded with a shrug
1	no one objected to her dancing at the möllendorpfs ’ , langhalses ’ , or kistenmakers ’ , or in her own home ; no one prevented her from ice-skating on castle yard or in the bottoms down by the trave , or from receiving the compliments of young men
1	he made no pretense of becoming a virtuoso
1	i can see him murmuring his , go on !
1	but if you force me to play such wickedness , i shall resign from my post—i shall do without it
1	the windows and balcony doors of rooms were hung with black curtains , and people dabbled with chemicals under red lights—until a fire broke out , and the bulgarian student from the good russian table came within an inch of being reduced to ashes
1	i ’ ll look in on you again before i go
1	it was not merely that i did not look forward to the event-i will enlarge on my confession and record that i was even tempted to absent myself
1	but then held back as if to let the two of them pass and move on ahead ; they , however , did not understand what he wanted—or better , simply paid no attention since they did not see the point
1	of course , you ’ ve given careful thought to everything that is to belong to us—i mean to erika , her baby , and me—but is it all to stay here ?
1	he sobbed softly two or three times , then fell silent , and his lips stopped moving
1	what a jokester you are !
1	collecting my pedagogical self , i firmly resolved that it be done nice and proper and vowed that i at least would show nothing out of the ordinary and would not fawn over him
1	it has been left to him to provide a general description of this new , unexpected guest , and he did not do a bad job of it—we could not have done all that much better ourselves
1	it was claimed , however , that hugo weinschenk , having immediately received confidential news of these calamities from his agents , had with fraudulent intent reinsured the policies with other insurance companies , thereby passing the losses on to them
1	that at least was hans castorp ’ s impression , a purely dreamy , irrational impression of course , which he could not get out of his befuddled brain for the moment and which even gave him a certain pleasure—such pleasure , in fact , that he tried to recapture it several times during the course of the meal and , indeed , was able to recreate the illusion perfectly
1	ha , ha , how spooky
1	my boshy kock hanna—they wouldn ’ t be that hardhearted
1	but i would much prefer to see the interior portrait you have locked up in your room
1	they arrived wearing mantillas and large platterlike hats and carrying bags of groceries for their visits among the poor—one could hardly prevent them from visiting their sick friend
1	what did he do ?
1	frau chauchat , joachim said quietly
1	i was unable to say much ; schildknapp , always a very good and receptive audience , was much more quick-witted and clever than i in commenting on what had been offered us-whereas afterward i sat over pranzo at the manardis ' table , numb and preoccupied , still moved by those very feelings that the music we had just
1	this was the image of life revealed to young hans castorp as he lay there preserving his body warmth in furs and woolens , looking down on the valley glistening in the frosty night , bright beneath the luster of a dead star
1	the marriage of which little johann was the issue had never lost its appeal as a topic of conversation among the town ’ s citizens
1	that laugh stayed with him ; i often heard it later when , sitting by my side at a concert or in the theater , he would be struck by some fine psychological allusion in the dialogue of a drama or by some trick of art , some ingenious event deep within the m�sical structure , of which the audience had no comprehension
1	the situation was untenable , there were ugly scenes , and although frau permaneder interceded for her with the same eloquence with which she had pled for two family homes and their furnishings , old ida was dismissed
1	and , still shaking his head , he departed
1	then she leaned back and let her pale eyes drift off to the world beyond the window
1	and on june , he gave a speech in the assembly on the most boring topic in the world , some tax problem or other , and it was so excellent and witty that it met with agreement on all points and made a laughing-stock of his opponent , consul hagenström
1	mes respects , monsieur le professeur
1	young commercial apprentices from good families , wearing danish seaman ’ s caps or clad elegantly in the latest english style and carrying portfolios , passed by with considerable dignity , proud of having escaped secondary school at last
1	to speak , to write—indeed that was a splendid humanistic and republican achievement , like that of signore brunetto latini , who had written a book about virtue and vice , had given the florentines their polish and taught them both how to speak and the fine art of guiding their republic by the rules of politics
1	you ’ re very mistaken about her
1	what a hell of a thing to have happen !
1	i will not play it !
1	commercial competence isn ’ t quite enough
1	whenever frau permaneder came over and pressed him to her , he would shed tears ; most of the time , however , he simply sat there staring straight ahead , blinking now and then , but with dry eyes and a revolted , preoccupied look on his face
1	it was not all that stupid of you to leave your hamburg to fend for itself for a while
1	but since this hand has reason to tremble in any case because of my subject , !
1	schildknapp distinguished himself by knowing the names of this or that wall of peaks that could be made out
1	what could he possibly have replied ?
1	you may imagine , then , what forbearance be required amongst thirtyfivescore thousand , to which during one of its fairs , the autumnal
1	the german soul , up-to-date
1	after a final admonition to use each needle only once and to treat the disks the way you would raw eggs , behrens had retired for the evening
1	it was no longer a simple case of lending assistance to the medium ’ s subjectivity so that it might find a mirror in reality , but rather—at least partially , at least tentatively—certain selves from outside , from beyond , got mixed up in things ; what they were dealing with—possibly , though never expressly admitted—were nonvital elements , entities that used the convoluted , furtive opportunity of the moment to return to matter and manifest themselves to whoever called them—in short , the spiritualistic conjuring of the dead
1	well , she has asked me to come for a visit , and i ’ m thinking of taking advantage of the offer very soon
1	they walked to school together because they were neighbors , but usually they just annoyed each other
1	then the rambling old house lay tightly wrapped in darkness and silence
1	that was undoubtedly adrian 's natural opinion as well
1	here we have a harmless antiseptic
1	pribislav had held his head like that , too ; but he had been a model student and led a life full of honors ( although that had not been the reason why hans castorp had borrowed a pencil from him ) —whereas it was all too clear that frau chauchat ’ s careless posture , her door-slamming , and her brazen stares were bound up with her illness , that in fact they were all expressions of that same license young herr albin had praised , the advantages of which , if not honorable , were at least almost endless
1	it can work to his advantage
1	i know only a few , rasmussen replied , his hands dangling chest-high like fins
1	the girl will require one for another three years yet
1	question : how can germany , whichever of its forms it may be allowed to take in the future , so much as open its mouth again to speak of mankind 's concerns ?
1	hans castorp ’ s head was full of thoughts and associations that extended as far as people like the limping concierge and the woman who had kept one hand pressed to her ear for a whole week and was told nevertheless to set her mind at ease ; there were questions on the tip of his tongue , but he could not get them out and decided instead to ask them of the director in private
1	i always have the impression that what is really important to him is not the lecture itself—perhaps that ’ s only secondary—but more especially the speaking of it , the way he lets his words roll and bounce , like little rubber balls
1	you see , here is a door , a courtyard door , it is open , beyond it lies the street
1	and he saw inside him , too
1	you must admit that on its other side it has it suitableness-on that side from which you came by it , and indeed forewarned , on the side of your pretty song with its alphabetical symbol-oh , truly wittily done and very near by inspiration :
1	there was obviously no happier man , no one who could have been more at home in this style of life or have found in it a greater fulfillment of his wishes
1	there was not a breath of wind to brush softly against the trees , not a rustle , not the call of a bird
1	but it was his father ’ s voice , and it said , the lieutenant has been in there with mama for two hours now , hanno
1	does that square with roman doctrine , for which the society weaves its web of intrigue all around the world—or so i ’ m told ?
1	and yet there is something that some of us fear-at certain moments that seem criminal even to ourselves ,
1	it was a miracle , she said , that the horseman had lived to see the holidays
1	because , you see , your heart pounds when you ’ re looking forward to some joyous event or if you ’ re afraid—when your emotions are stirred up , isn ’ t that right ?
1	you refuse , and that ought to be a greater disappointment to me than it actually is
1	early in , hugo weinschenk ’ s petition for pardon was granted by the senate , and the former insurance director was released six months before his sentence was up
1	and as for the degradation of man , its history coincides exactly with the rise of the bourgeois spirit
1	hermann hagenström was the sort of imposing fellow familiar on the stock market of any great city ; he was dressed in a thick , heavy fur coat that reached to his shoes and hung open to reveal a greenish yellow winter suit of durable english tweed
1	a little soothing syrup , perhaps a cup of camomile tea to induce perspiration
1	and he tossed the offending stump into the punch bowl
1	but he who would not hear of the logos , said , reason !
1	when god visits us with affliction , we must bear it with composure
1	good god in heaven , there are certain things that must be taken into consideration in this life , tom
1	he got himself ready for his rest cure , stuck his thermometer in his mouth , put perfected skills to work and with a few deft , sure motions of the sacred art—about which no one in the flatlands had the vaguest—he wrapped his two camel-hair blankets around him to form a solid , unbroken cylinder , and lay there quietly on his splendid lounge chair , in the cold damp of the early autumn afternoon
1	oh indeed , he sometimes truly seemed to be won over-given how extraordinarily easy it was to influence him
1	but i will remind him that through the liturgy and its history , music plays a considerable role in theological affairs-a more practical and artistic role in fact than in the areas of mathematics ' and physics , in acoustics , that is
1	but since his moral states of consciousness kept still , again , and next separate to some extent , the temptation grew to expand relational terms like yesterday and tomorrow—words by which today holds the past and the future at arm ’ s length—and to apply them to still larger contexts
1	but let me ask you one thing
1	he was a stocky , broad-shouldered man with a red face , watery-blue eyes , and a frosted , bristly beard that ran in a fan shape from ear to ear—but the firm red curve of his upper lip was clean-shaven
1	countless local chapters have been established in various countries , their purpose being to inform and educate by means of public lectures and sunday festivities
1	for he had been a monkey , moon , and soul god—a baboon with a crescent moon above his head and above all , under the name of hermes , a god of death and the dead , a grabber and guide of souls , who by late antiquity had become a great sorcerer and served the cabalistic middle ages as the father of hermetic alchemy
1	he saw someone come out , too , a lady who had arrived only recently and whose name he did not know—a small , dainty woman , with curls across her forehead and golden earrings
1	regular birds of paradise , i tell you , and eminently amorous
1	in terms of art , what my friend had woven here was most admirable
1	this was on the night of may
1	nevertheless , the firm of johann buddenbrook was no longer what it had once been—that , too , was such common knowledge that herr stuht on glockengiesser strasse could share it with his wife over bacon soup at lunch
1	whenever herr ferge spoke about these events , his good-natured gray eyes grew wide and his face grew pallid—it must have been horrible
1	hans castorp had sat through the incident with every outward sign of concerned horror , but ultimately—god help him ! —not even this event seemed all that serious
1	he had little appetite and trouble sleeping ; chills , which had always been a problem , now forced him to consult dr langhals on several occasions
1	but since this was not a matter of praise or censure , but simply a factual observation and determination , and since there is always some approbation in every dispassionate recognition of reality , stemming simply from the joy of recognizing it , how could such views not be linked to a multifaceted , indeed comprehensive critique of the bourgeois tradition-by which i mean values like culture , enlightenment , humanity , and dreams like the improvement of nations through scientific civilization ?
1	the senses are diminished , a merciful self-narcosis sets in—those are the means by which nature allows the organism to find relief
1	all the beautiful old furniture , hans castorp went on , remembering
1	never , or at best perhaps in their grandfather ’ s day , had such a gathering of good cheer filled the large house , which had more than enough room for them all
1	be that as it may , he said curtly , let us come to the point
1	it would soon be six o ’ clock , but although twilight was well advanced by now , the oil lamps still hung unlit on their chains above the street
1	we seldom philosophized , by the way , during those carefree weeks
1	i can assure you there ’ s almost nothing to him
1	such rights , settembrini remarked cuttingly , were probably not maintained without a sidelong glance at the canonical share , which had to be subtracted from every will
1	to discreet orchestral accompaniment , a veritable international chorus of celebrated singers , male and female , put their highly trained , god-given talents to good use in arias , duets , ensemble scenes from all the many epochs and genres of musical theater : the mediterranean bel canto , captivating in both its lighthearted and noble forms ; a german world of folklore , rogues , and demons ; french opera , grand and comic
1	but i did it with gravest reservations , under the proudest , most excruciating protest of my spirit against the dictates of my wretched body
1	he slept for three hours—a deep , sleep , immeasurably deep , unlike any he had ever known
1	god neither wanted that nor did he want evil not to occur , but rather he allowed evil to hold sway without wanting or not wanting it , and that , to be sure , worked to the advantage of perfect wholeness
1	both a miracle and , in response to the final compelling voice of conscience , the means by which he triumphed over himself
1	munich streetcars , painted bavarian blue , are heavily built and make considerable noise , whether because of their weight or some special quality of the subsoil
1	and one should not be surprised if at first i shall find it rather daring to utter this new form of address and stumble in the attempt—particularly in the presence of clavdia , who , being but a woman , may not be quite so pleased with this new arrangement
1	i can ’ t pay them
1	yes , unfortunately i am rather ill , herr settembrini replied and hung his head
1	does anyone have a pencil ?
1	but six learned and competent alienists had officially determined the king 's total madness and declared it necessary that he be confined !
1	christian had certainly not grown any handsomer
1	and hans castorp thought that was marvelous—as was also the fact that life here had no cares or worries to block the view
1	they had breakfast on the balcony or under the tall chestnut tree over by the children ’ s playground with its large swing—and johann was enchanted by all of it : the scent that rose from the hastily laundered tablecloth as a waiter spread it out before them , the tissue-paper napkins , the unfamiliar bread , the fact that they ate their eggs from metal eggcups , and with everyday teaspoons instead of the bone-handled ones they used at home
1	the vista broadened to the northeast toward the entrance to the valley and included the lake , as expected—a frozen , snow-covered circle surrounded by forest
1	how could i have known any different ?
1	primitive peoples ’ understanding of such drugs far exceeded our own
1	and now he demanded to know other things
1	a gift of life , i responded , if not to say , a gift of god , such as music , should not have the mocking charge of paradox leveled at it for
1	he saw the evergreen wood below and behind him now ; turning around he quickly descended to the snow-laden firs , a last spur of steep , fogged-in forests , that jutted like a wedge out into open ground
1	whether he understand rightly about life remains a question
1	herr settembrini strode across the room to a window
1	there ’ s simply nothing in it
1	and each time the odor surfaced and he smelled it , he scowled a little more and his lips trembled for just a second
1	but now enjoy your breakfast and the rest of the morning
1	the woman of whom you made mention—pardon me for choosing not to recall her name—frau stöhr , yes , thank you—in brief , it is this ridiculous woman herself , and not her case , it seems to me , that presents our human emotions with a dilemma , as you put it
1	and music can do that as well
1	for god ’ s sake , papa— !
1	after a sigh that sounded like a preface to his remarks , the italian began to speak
1	it was he , out of a sense of his own smallness , who came up with the word inaccessible , which served as an occasion for herr settembrini to stress that , of course , those rocks had surely been scaled
1	he would stand there in his checked trousers , a toothpick between his lips , assume his graceful pose with his ankles crossed , and chatter away , gesticulating now and then with the toothpick
1	as soon as the other guests departed , the three lodgers almost immediately withdrew to their rooms
1	he saw him turn away and , as misery played across the upper lip , slowly sneak an over-the-shoulder look out of the corner of one eye
1	keep that in mind !
1	and we don ’ t even speak of the coupé anymore , although it ’ s as necessary as our daily bread
1	her stay up here went back to long before hans castorp ’ s arrival ; it was more than a year since she had first come here—with a slight infection for which she had been sentenced to three months
1	essay on marionettes , plus the inevitable sonnets of shakespeare , and another volume of plays by the same poet-twelfth night was one , much ado about nothing , and if i am not mistaken , two gentlemen of verona
1	he told us we should find a seat ( the swiss way of asking someone to sit down ) ; and so we did , with the elf between us on the grass , and joined him in looking at his picture book , which among the stock of children 's literature offered in the shop had surely been among the most acceptable , with illustrations in the english taste , in a kind of kate greenaway style , and not half-bad rhymed verses , almost all of which nepomuk
1	hans castorp did not look up
1	you can read it in three boring minutes
1	i can well understand , however , that , given this momentary relaxation in the pat-
1	her dainty finger resting lightly on the glass , ellen brand focused her large , pure , childlike eyes beyond immediate matters and directed her gaze instead at the nightstand lamp
1	but today the wind had shifted around to the west , and simultaneously the barometer had plummeted
1	once before , only four years ago , with the knife already at our throat , with the rope around our neck—suddenly the floor of the exchange was filled with shouts announcing an engagement to mademoiselle buddenbrook , before it had ever occurred
1	you ’ ll have nothing , you ’ ll be poor as a church mouse , you ’ ll have to make your own way , all by yourself
1	and the first hour , religion with herr ballerstedt , was a rather harmless affair
1	the silk cravat wound around his stiff high-wing collar was fluffed to fill the broad , open neck of his multicolored vest
1	he had been lying there dozing for fifteen minutes or half an hour , when he was startled awake by the sudden realization that the assistant was in his room , striding toward him , having entered not by way of the door , but from outside
1	at least this was hans castorp ’ s impression , as he sat there expectantly waiting , along with all the others , to learn in what form unsanctioned love would reappear
1	you have to be quiet
1	please excuse us for having made you wait , kesselmeyer , herr grünlich said
1	the spot at the upper left isn ’ t worth talking about
1	but you compromise us , all of us , no matter where you are , where you go
1	the consul flared up
1	the young men tried to comfort her , said something about the possibility of a happy turn for the better
1	and the very next day senator buddenbrook stood in the council chamber , right in front of the chair formerly occupied by james möllendorpf , and , in the presence of the assembled city fathers and a committee from the town council , he swore the following oath :
1	it was very natural that music should catch fire from words , that the word should burst from music , as happened at the end of the ninth symphony
1	there was a fireplace with imitation coals and stripes of shiny reddish-gold paper that seemed to glow behind the screen
1	but the universal principle of the law had inspired him from infancy on , or so his grandson would have them believe ; and although hans castorp was not feeling all that clearheaded as his organism strained to deal with one of the berghof ’ s six-course meals , he struggled to understand what settembrini might mean by calling this principle the source of freedom and progress
1	in a fit of royal fury at the sudden disruption of his feast of life , peeperkorn first banged his fist on the table and then called out after the scattering company—something about spineless slaves—but nevertheless reconciled himself somewhat to the idea presented by hans castorp and frau chauchat that his banquet had lasted for almost six hours now and would have to come to an end at some point in any case , even lent his ear to a reminder about sleep ’ s holy refreshment , and at last consented to let them escort him to bed
1	what made it possible for certain olfactory nerves to be stimulated by various odors ?
1	there was almost nothing fragmented about it
1	and suggested that i should adopt my cousin ’ s style of life here—lie out on the balcony a great deal , even said i should measure my temperature , too
1	she said nothing , but merely let her eyes sweep over him in a profoundly amazed and profoundly offended glance
1	i ’ m a simple man and don ’ t know much about innuendies [ sic ] and other such refinements , but if you just might be implying … well , all i have to say to you is that you ’ re barking up the wrong tree and are badly mistaken about my principles
1	his affliction was the model of a particularly heavy and welldeveloped stutter-how tragic , since he was a man with a great wealth of urgent ideas and a passionate desire to communicate them in speech
1	heine seehas is a well-known drunk who pushes a little wagon and sells steamed dumplings
1	a quarter till eight , she answered , her thin , red hand—it looked gouty—pointing at the wall clock
1	frau permaneder coughed an audible dry cough that she simply could not suppress
1	and while all this was going on , hans castorp thought he could smell more clearly than before those faint , but very peculiar and persistent fumes that he knew from before , and which , to his shame , always reminded him of a school chum who suffered from an offensive affliction that made everyone avoid him , the same odor that the tuberose scent was supposed to cover up on the sly , but was unable to do , for all its lovely , austere richness
1	they all chinked shallow goblets and drank the first glass down , electrifying their stomachs with its ice-cold , fragrant tickle
1	i have been made an alderman on the bergen line board of directors , and have been chosen as a committee member for the finance department , the chamber of commerce , the auditing committee , and the st anne poorhouse , one after another
1	the eyes gazed out pale and dull from under the idol-like tracery of the brow ; the large , ragged lips hung half-open , like the mouth on the mask of tragedy
1	the decisive thing is that each tone , without exception , retains its positional value in the row or in one of its derivatives
1	i wish to go even farther and admit that i could take no great liking to or place unequivocal trust in anyone at this roundtable , with the possible exception of helmut institoris , who also sometimes attended these discussions and with whom i felt a bond of friendship through my relation with his wife-although , to be sure , his presence awakened anxious worries of another sort
1	the remarkable man quickly came to a decision
1	she sent her warmest regards
1	but we can ’ t let ourselves be cowed , and we need a direct line to hamburg
1	yes , tom said , i know exactly what you mean , tony
1	at first the rooms held the warmth of the preceding summer days—fifty-five degrees , which was considered comfortable—but they quickly grew colder and colder
1	no , to be quite frank , i don ’ t find it that overwhelming , hans castorp said
1	he had now had enough
1	that course seemed finer and more humane—and i ’ m sure you know how clavdia drawls the word out so charmingly in that magical , husky voice of hers—than silence and dissembling , and to that extent a weight was lifted from my heart , when you made your observation just now
1	fine , but don ’ t you think that if he ’ s a jesuit first and a man of intellect , with permutations , second—that the second part has something to do with his illness ?
1	one can imagine adrian 's amusement at these woefully funny accounts of scenes experienced with all the intensity of youth , though we always had to curb our laughter somewhat and keep it within the bounds of empathy-it was the storyteller 's father after all
1	it may serve you in good stead when i say that at your age i took special care , both in bergen and in antwerp , to be pleasant and useful to my employers , which always proved to be to my great advantage
1	what sort of a bet would
1	it corresponds to beethoven 's general technical niveau , does it not ? -as the tension between the utmost dissonance and consonance possible to him
1	you ’ re thinking of the earthquake in messina
1	an apparent chase around the furniture , the crash of an upturned chair , a grab , an embrace , slaps and kisses—and then , of all things to accompany the invisible scene , a waltz was struck up in the distance , the tired melody of a popular ballad
1	an increase in metabolism caused an increase in the production of body heat
1	and if i had run into him down in the flatlands , i ’ m sure i would not have understood them , he added
1	also in the party were the thick-lipped lad from the half-lung club ; fräulein levi , looking as thin and ivory-skinned as ever ; an ash-blond young man who answered to the name of rasmussen and dangled his hands chest-high , like fins at the end of limp wrists ; frau salomon from amsterdam , a lady of ample proportions , who was dressed in red and had joined the young people ; the tall gentleman with the thinning hair who could play selections from a midsummer night ’ s dream and who now sat behind her , his arms hugging pointed knees , his gloomy eyes fixed on the brown hair at the nape of her neck ; a red-haired young lady from greece ; another girl of unknown origin with the face of a tapir ; the gluttonous adolescent with the thick , circular glasses ; another fifteen- or sixteen-year-old boy , who squinted through a monocle and at every cough put his little finger , its long nail shaped very much like a saltcellar spoon , to his lips—a first-class ass , it would seem ; and several others
1	i ’ m jist a poor man , ladies ’ nd gents , but i got a tender heart , and the joy ’ nd happiness what touches my master , consul buddenbrook , who ’ s alliz been good to me , why , that touches me , too , so i ’ m here to heartily ’ gratulate herr buddenbrook ’ nd his good wife ’ nd the whole ’ spectable fam ’ ly , ’ nd to wish this here child a long , healthy life , ’ cause they well deserve it , afore god and man they do , ’ nd there ain ’ t many men like herr buddenbrook , no , sir , ’ cause he ’ s a fine gen ’ leman ’ nd the good lord ’ ll see to it he ’ s rewarded…
1	there were long arithmetic problems that filled both sides of their slates , and when you were done with all the addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division , the answer had to be zero—and if it wasn ’ t , there must be a mistake somewhere , and you had to search and search until you found the nasty little beast and erased it , and you could only hope that it wasn ’ t too far back , because otherwise the whole thing had to be done over
1	but there were unmistakable signs that his sense of personal modesty was beginning to break down as well
1	frau stöhr licked her fingers with gusto
1	hanno , the senator said curtly
1	then i ’ ll be asittin ’ up on the sofa in a silk dress , and you ’ ll be waitin ’ on me , ’ cause … it went without saying that she had been let go at once
1	i thought he was right when , in conversations with me as well , he would emphatically , even urgently champion his pupil 's calling to be a musician , a composer
1	the words , for i die as both a wicked and good christian , provide the general theme for this work of variations
1	and then came a brief improvement : a flickering of life , a deceptive return of energy , an ebbing of the fever , a cessation of pain , a few clear and hopeful words that brought tears of joy to the eyes of those around her bed
1	the underside , however , was inscribed in a variety of ever-changing scripts with the names of those heads of the household who had been its owners over the course of time
1	and now it ’ s come to this
1	i see it here every day
1	and while the cousins laughed , settembrini moved on from the topic of the warmth for which he so yearned , to the subject of his deceased father
1	or the sound of the orchestra tuning up
1	nevertheless , i would note that it is regrettable—though characteristic of the institution—that you have neglected to read what the press has to say
1	as impossible as i t was to find an emotional correlation between his deteriorating health and our national calamity , my inclination to see some objective connection or symbolic parallel between the two , an inclination that may well have been based merely on their contemporaneity , was not vanquished by his remoteness from outside events-though i carefully kept that thought to myself and took pains not even to hint at it in conversation with him
1	frau chauchat broke in now , saying that this was not good for peeperkorn , that the conversation was fatiguing him , might cause another fever attack , and as much as she disliked interrupting their visit , she really did have to ask hans castorp to let that be all for now
1	far be it from me , as to herr settembrini and your friendly sentiments toward him—settled
1	herr hagenström , partner in the export firm of strunck & hagenström , took eager and ambitious interest in the affairs of the town , but his marriage had caused some astonishment among families with stricter traditions—the möllendorpfs , the langhalses , the buddenbrooks
1	in general such a claim to ironic distance , to an objectivity that assuredly has less to do with the honor of the cause than with that of the detached person , has always seemed to me to be a sign of inordinate arrogance
1	yes indeed—and then again , not at all like them
1	outside was gloomy nothing , a world packed in grayish-white cotton , in foggy vapors and whirling snow that pushed up against the windowpanes
1	would such ideas really look good on him ?
1	no , kesselmeyer , listen to me
1	what are you doing ?
1	the woman who read aloud for them sat off at some distance
1	almost like a plank , with a slight rise in the blanket from the feet at the other end
1	it is nonsense , of course , for a murderer to outlive his victim
1	whom the waves of active life have borne upon their shoulders , good fortune playing round his brow , that man had no need of such thoughts
1	degrees—and in the middle of the morning
1	his brother the consul , however , knew—he knew that christian offered the family ’ s adversaries an easy target , and that this was one target too many
1	his tawny golden muttonchops were disheveled , his coat was all wrinkled , his necktie askew , his collar stood open , and little drops of sweat stood out on his brow
1	naphta screamed , conceding with this very human cry that it requires more courage to shoot than to be shot at , raised his pistol to a position that had nothing to do with the duel , and shot himself in the head
1	the director was painting her , interpreting her external appearance with color and oils on canvas
1	the previous chapter , as its continuation
1	it was schubert ’ s lindenbaum , none other than the old familiar am brunnen vor dem tore
1	own , swear fealty to it , identify with it , the day would come when he would very quickly be disenchanted with it as well , be bored by it , be as weary and fed up with it as if he had been force-fed with iron ladles
1	look , he is stepping on the hand of a fallen comrade—stepping on it with his hobnailed boots , pressing it deep into the soggy , branch-strewn earth
1	hans castorp stayed behind on his balcony , depressed and sorely tempted to go see the boss then and there
1	in an hour or so
1	he is the reverend andreas pringsheim , pastor marianus , who , although still very young , assumed the pastorate of st mary ’ s after old kölling died unexpectedly
1	the face assumes an idiotic expression
1	find it cruel to inform me that i am what i am only out of inhumanity and that humanness does not suit me ?
1	it had two curved , shiny steel tines with extremely sharp points , between them a coiled segment of gold-inlaid ivory with tines of its own , which were more pliant or flexible to some degree and could be bent inward
1	or the silent elation that frau permaneder felt when she first heard it and embraced her mother , her brother , and—more gingerly—her sister-in-law ?
1	but then the fellow pulls out a knife , and … for some inexplicable reason thomas did not greet these stories , of which christian had a great many , with applause—although madame grünlich found them delightfully amusing , while her mother , clara , and klothilde pulled back in horror , and mamselle jungmann and erika simply sat there listening with their mouths open
1	he flipped the switch that sent current to the turntable , waited two seconds until it had reached top speed , and carefully set the fine steel point down on the rim of the disk
1	and cast aside the delicate little song as tasteless and insipidly sentimental—rejecting it , however , with a certain austere melancholy
1	i ’ ve always been of the opinion that all men are equal , and that we don ’ t need any middlemen between us and our god
1	in italy , schildknapp had written his former landlords on amalien strasse and secured his familiar quarters anew
1	you say some simple word ,
1	for adrian had let it be known in his notes that he wished to give a favorably disposed gathering of friends an idea of his new , recently completed choral and symphonic work by playing some characteristic passages from it on the piano
1	and so , in the period that followed , he was stricter than ever about drilling hanno in the practical things that would be important in his future life and work ; he examined his intellectual abilities , pressed him for decisive statements about his love of the occupation awaiting him , and burst into rage at every sign of resistance and languor
1	despite his isolation , his curiosity did not go beyond asking if new guests had arrived or any familiar faces had departed ; and he seemed content to learn that only the former was the case
1	you have guessed it , herr settembrini said delicately
1	there ’ s no shortage of ladies—we have the most adorable ladies here
1	had he amused himself ?
1	yes , yes , tony , i ’ ve thought a lot about it myself
1	it is unclear whether this occurred with the knowledge and permission of the latter ; it is certain , however , that christian buddenbrook found , at no expense whatever , the same homey diversions that senator gieseke spent a great deal of his wife ’ s money to enjoy
1	all right , hanno , but first you have to get a good night ’ s sleep
1	he showed signs of life , but was hideously injured
1	this pitiful creature had understood from hans castorp ’ s sensitivity about slamming doors that a certain emotional bond was developing between her young tablemate and the russian woman , and what was more , that the nature of such a bond was less important than that it existed at all , and finally , that his pretended indifference—and given his lack of talent or experience as an actor , he was very poor at pretending—did not diminish but rather strengthened that bond , was a sign that it had moved to a higher plane
1	but they also served another purpose—one that little hans castorp likewise noted , if not admitting it to himself in so many words ; in particular , the masses of flowers and more especially the very well represented tuberoses were there for a more sobering reason—and that was to gloss over the other side of death , the one that is neither beautiful nor sad , but almost indecent in its base physicality , to make people forget it or at least not be reminded of it
1	but the magical thing about it is that what gets preserved in them has been withdrawn from time , has been hermetically blocked off from time , which passes right by
1	people did not trust those eyes
1	he ( gazing down over himself with arms spread wide ) : how then , how then ?
1	there was a preachy flavor to it , although it was delivered in the light , bantering tone of small talk
1	( to use luther 's expression ) with untold crimes , a state whose bellowing proclamations and announcements canceling human rights swept the masses up into enraptured frenzy , and under whose garish banners our youth marched with flashing eyes , brazenly proud and firm in their faith-a patriotism that would proclaim that such a state was forced upon us as something without roots in our nature as a people , something totally alien to us , such a patriotism would , so it seems to me , be more high-minded than conscientious
1	he inquired about tony ’ s fields and cattle , asked how much she wanted for a sack of wheat , and offered her a contract
1	even the merchant tailor in rostock had done very well , and the family had continued to prosper spectacularly ever since
1	but there was little chance that he would be hired—his classes were much too exuberant
1	dear boy , one always has a host of fellows
1	the destruction of the body by fire—what a neat , hygienic , dignified , and indeed heroic idea that was in comparison with letting it decompose miserably on its own and be assimilated by lower forms of life
1	but do not say , 'spe�ks only about aesthetics , do not say ,
1	consul buddenbrook said to his wife : if only i could think of some reason , however delicate , tony might have for deciding against this alliance
1	nevertheless , i do have the resources , thank god , to remedy the situation
1	but then came a bang from the middle of the table , another thump of a fist , as if to make clear that the first knock , too , had not come from the hall , but from inside the room
1	in , although the source of the grant was never clear , it was the world
1	useful visual aids for the instruction of the young
1	i don ’ t want to have anything to do with it
1	he moved toward the buffet and drank a glass of water to calm his heart—or perhaps just for something to do
1	he suddenly cried in a rapturous outburst
1	resisted temptation was , to be sure , no sin , but merely a test of virtue
1	because i can ’ t live down south , by god and all his heavenly hosts , i can ’ t
1	you ’ ve been yowling all afternoon
1	why don ’ t you ever want me to go into town ?
1	i should not misunderstand her : there could be no doubt that rudolf 's character had a certain more noble foundation
1	adrian could have no doubt whatever that in his solitude he had at his disposal what his worldly admirer had to offer-her riches , which as one clearly sensed , were a burden to her for reasons of conscience , though she had never known , presumably could not have led , a life without them
1	consul eduard kistenmaker the wine merchant and consul hermann hagenström held their own on the list
1	he praised the pleasures of riding , the way the body was moved along in comfortable repose past constantly changing scenery ; he assumed an obliging , fatherly tone with hans castorp and even patted poor wehsal ’ s cheek , urging him to lose himself and his unattractive ego in admiration of this bright , shining world , to which he pointed in a broad gesture of his right hand , inside its shabby leather glove
1	are you saying she was kicking with her legs ?
1	they were at a difficult age
1	there was a great deal of loyalty in your conduct
1	see , i want to avoid a direct attack , but i also want to avoid approaching her by mail
1	the door to the antechamber was wide open and her sister-in-law came toward her
1	but such effects were as legitimate as the changes that came with the evolution of the learned doctor ’ s thought—an evolution he saw as not only consistent , but also inevitable
1	they inquired about the young people ’ s plans , which , even at this early stage , included the honeymoon
1	do you call the blue of the sky a sham ?
1	of course , back then it was only a matter of … now , what was it ?
1	ination has the advantage of being identical with the university of wittenberg , since the two were joined upon their reopening at the end of the napoleonic wars
1	our rosenstiel got it for me
1	and so you still believe that spirit is shameless , do you ?
1	at the same time she felt reawakening within her the same emotion that she had toyed with during the days of herr grünlich ’ s courtship : a sense of personal importance
1	i ’ ll not let you talk me out of it
1	in brief , settembrini did not stint in his praise of ugly herr naphta , despite the rather abstract argument they had just had—a dispute that would very soon be taken up again
1	you had to pay close attention to catch each stealthy change in the misty phantasmagoria
1	this was the director ’ s way of offering consolation
1	whereas chamber music usually offers a playground for the working out of thematic motifs , here that is avoided in outright provocation
1	one might even have spoken of a neglect of his appearance , had such an impression not been curbed by the natural distinction that came with his intellect
1	he said , well , collect your thoughts now and continue
1	he was about to vanish beneath them when the farm hand plunged in after him and brought him to shore
1	i do not know , it sounds so 'hifalutin ' and girlish
1	a man and a woman , a pair of highly talented professionals ineligible for competition , executed a feat no one else in the world could do—to great applause and a fanfare
1	he ’ s praising nature because even in her fertile phase she does not confuse us with mystic damps , but provides classical austerity
1	she broke off her chatter , didn ’ t even complete her hand gesture , and turned round to the bed , where the cry had come from—a cry of fear , which was immediately repeated , but now it sounded more anguished , more terrified , and then came a third , a fourth , a fifth , one right after another
1	then step up to the edge of these ashen glacial cliffs of dunes and climb , immerse yourself in softness that seeps cool into your shoes
1	on the following thursday , i heard from him by telephone
1	but listen here , professor—it seems to me he would have no reason , then , for criticizing any fanaticism or terrorism in my cousin ’ s vocation
1	it was bad enough that the anecdotes he told to his assembled family ought , at best , to have been restricted to the club
1	i did it nonetheless , told him in confidence that , from what i could see , even though inez rodde was about to become engaged to institoris , she was helplessly , fatally in love with rudi schwerdtfeger
1	they ’ re not stingy , you know
1	his father had tapped him on the shoulder and pointed out to him that the daughter of wealthy old kröger would bring a handsome dowry into the firm ; and he had concurred with all his heart and ever since had honored his wife as a companion entrusted to him by god
1	but he was vexed by objective problems as well , about which the cousins had already heard : the sort of sanatorium affair with which everyone was only all too familiar
1	but everything in this world is comparative , uncle gotthold
1	kaisersaschern , he likewise first returned home , to buche ! , to attend his sister 's wedding , which was celebrated there and to which , along with my parents , i was invited as well
1	in presenting herself , clavdia had let her eyes sweep right past hans castorp and all the farther regions of the room ; nothing happened at their next meeting in the dining hall , either ; and the more meals that passed without his eye meeting hers—unless you counted frau chauchat ’ s blind , sweeping , impassive gaze if she happened to turn around during a meal—the more unsuitable it would have been to attempt his cavalier ’ s greeting
1	now and then , to be sure , if he happened to be alone with her , his mood could change and he would tease and joke with her , might even try to pull her onto his knee and brush his whiskers against her face , asking in a quivering , jolly voice , have i really nabbed you ?
1	old hinrich had died at the beginning of , and his son hermann—hermann with the lemon buns and the slaps—was now carrying on his father ’ s very profitable export business at the side of old herr strunck ; and within a year he married the daughter of consul huneus , the richest man in town , whose wholesale lumber business had enabled him to leave each of his three children two million marks
1	so why is my heart pounding like this ?
1	heaven has decided otherwise
1	but when i ’ m lying there and watching the planets , then those last three thousand years seem fairly recent ’ themselves , and somehow i feel very intimate with those chaldeans , who watched them , too , and wrote poetry about them—and that ’ s what humanity means
1	dr drögemüller in hamburg told me that all the nerves on this side are too short
1	thomas withheld his judgment
1	he asked , adopting a lighter tone
1	he was tense and nervous , like a young man about to introduce himself to a host of strangers , all the while plagued by the distinct feeling that his eyes and face are red—which was only partly true , because he was actually rather pale
1	frau antonie grünlich stood at the front door—proud of the arrangements she had made
1	she thrust her head slightly toward him , eyes closed , as if just blinking
1	he crossed the wooden bridge and sat down to enjoy the sight of the falling water and rushing foam , to listen to its idyllic chatter , a monotone filled with interior variety
1	it was no different when it came to ice-skating in winter or to swimming in summer down by the river , in the fenced-in area run by herr asmussen
1	you could , of course , present the issue to the lord god or herr marotzke as a topic of discussion
1	it will be said that the narrator is laying it on too thick , being too romantic in associating stupor with demonic forces , even ascribing to it some sort of mystic horror
1	can i bear what it says ?
1	we know that he studied mathematics—know it from the director himself—and recall the chaste motive behind his devotion to the discipline , whose cooling effects and ability to blunt the thorn in the flesh we have heard praised and whose more general rewards would probably have rendered unnecessary certain measures that the authorities had recently been forced to adopt
1	should i likewise return to the sense of gentle affront or distress caused me personally by the subject itself , the mockery of the study of antiquity , which in the work appears as ascetic preciosity ?
1	what a horrible , wretched sight they were
1	after a brief hesitation , the glass moved
1	and for how long ?
1	no wind , no snow
1	the french doorman said
1	oh , papa , i could write pages and pages about him
1	but enough of hans ’ s new tablemates
1	in hans castorp ’ s case the first day of october was exactly like the last day of september
1	c f köppen , he read and nodded to the wine merchant
1	let us get away from this spot , we ’ ll step in there
1	because he compromised the firm and the family , and in tom ’ s eyes that ’ s what i do , too , ida—not with deeds and words , but simply by being a divorced woman
1	soon after the new director ’ s arrival , renovation and modernization of the old institution had begun—according to the very latest hygienic and aesthetic criteria—and been very successfully completed
1	mother had hair like that when she was young
1	at either side of the door were smaller tables , likewise covered with white linen , each ornamented by a little tree with candles aflame and laden with presents—the gifts for the servants and the poor
1	rocks like basalt , remnants of former realities , which the spirit has left so far behind that it refuses even to associate the notion of reality with them , persist in their dogged way ; their very lumpish , dead continuance unfortunately prevents them in their inanity from realizing how inane they are
1	this much was certain from the beginning : the , directive at the end was motivated not by the whole letter , but by only a portion of it , the so-called waggery and buffoonery , the experience with that dreadful porter
1	the majestic countenance was yellow , with pale eyes gazing out from under the raised tracery of the brow ; the expression on the ragged lips was bitter
1	good heavens , armgard said , sitting on the edge of her bed , half undressed , dr neumann is such a fine lecturer
1	forgive me for putting it so pompously !
1	it had caught up with the times , and the gray , dilapidated walls of the former convent school , where the fathers of the present generation had pursued scientific learning , had been razed to make way for a splendid , new , airy edifice
1	fitelberg , that is a patently jewish name
1	( a touching word in her mouth , for she herself never confided in others-though she did in me , by way of exception )
1	what a windbag , hans castorp thought , and did not change his mind when settembrini moved on from this fit of flirtation and returned to casting aspersions
1	well , fine , you find that here as well
1	himself born to be a productive writer and spoke bitterly of being driven by necessity to serve others ' work , of being consumed by a task that brought scant recognition-and what little there was he found galling
1	what i mean is , of course there ’ s no question of my being bored here , quite the contrary—i can assure you that i ’ m amusing myself royally
1	yes , i admit that what contributed to almost all of my ( some might say simple , i shall call it human ) fear of the work was the absolutely uncanny rapidity with which it came into being-the bulk of it in four and a half months , the same time one might have estimated to be required
1	this man stood on his own feet , unencumbered by the chains of custom and reverence for the past—he was a stranger to anything old-fashioned
1	force—the application of dumb , brutal , instantaneous force by the police—without any understanding of intellectual matters , of new ideas
1	yes , things could get lively today , hanno
1	with all their hearts they despised the economic principle that declares price is the result of the workings of supply and demand , and they damned those who lived by the fluctuations of the market as exploiters of their neighbors
1	meaning clearly and straightforwardly , and to pick and choose his german proper
1	and she raised both arms to remove her paper hat from her reddish hair , wound in a braid around her head
1	but does not recognize him
1	for a moment , he thought he was
1	taking the cold compress with a sigh , she began again : when all is said and done , it simply has to be
1	all the flower shops were doing business on a grand scale , and iwersen ’ s , directly across from the buddenbrook home , was doing as well as any
1	ultimately , to put it plainly , it does not exist , this desirability
1	it is not the woman at your table—i refuse to tax my memory for her name
1	those sound like words of farewell
1	but in saying so i am duty-bound , as it were , to justify that feeling , and that will be difficult to do without placing myself and others in a rather ridiculous light
1	oh , you ’ re staying in travemünde for only a short while ?
1	when they came back up from their meal , the package of blankets was lying on a chair in hans castorp ’ s room , and he made use of them that day for the first time
1	foam-born venus and her gallant
1	i felt , living there in halle , whose intellectual atmosphere had for centuries been full of religious controversy-that is , of those intellectual squabbles and clashes that are always so detrimental to humanistic cultural endeavors-i felt there a little like one of my learned forebears , crotus rubianus , who was a canon in halle around , and whom luther called crotus the epicurean no less , or even dr krote , the toad who licks plates for the cardinal of mainz
1	the experience of death must ultimately be the experience of life , or else it is only a wraith
1	it fell in thick sheets , and the sound filled the silence of the hotel gardens with an incessant , desolate , hopeless murmur
1	we ’ re recovered patients , he had said , rid of fever and toxins , practically ripe for the flatlands
1	to remain steadfast while gazing upon the incendiary aspect inseparable from that advance was our manly duty , the chief demand placed upon our heroic courage
1	apparently frau chauchat had practice in determining the direction of his semiwishes
1	what are you laughing about ?
1	signum mortificationis , was that it ?
1	but here mother glances at him out of the corner of her eye , and tom raises his eyebrow , and uncle justus flinches and almost splutters , the way krögers do when they laugh , and pfiffi buddenbrook gives her mother or friederike or henriette a look , and then i ’ m so ashamed that i ’ d just as soon leave the room , and can ’ t even imagine i could ever marry him
1	heads turned from settembrini to naphta—hans castorp ’ s more quickly than joachim ’ s
1	we ’ re going to be sensible , right ?
1	well , there were and are a great many mementos of egypt in freemasonry , and among its secret societies were some that used the name eleusinian
1	they were not always ushered in to see adrian , actually only rarely , which did not bother either of them
1	i already said that as a scholar , as a man of science , kumpf made concessions to the rational critique of biblical faith and , at least by fits and starts , would abandon some things in a tone of intellectual candor
1	yes , christian says , yes , tiburtius , god go with you
1	what does deciderant , patula jovis arbore , glandes ’ mean ?
1	mirth and delight reigned around the table
1	autumn arrived , the first strong winds had begun to blow
1	during the whole quarrel , the consul had stood with his back to his brother , his hands in his pockets , drawing little figures in the carpet with one foot
1	several years before , he had retired with a tidy sum in his pocket and had left the wine business in the hands of his brother , eduard
1	you think he will contest it , simply because of my seventeen thousand thalers courant
1	he was wearing white kid gloves and carried his cane with its silver crook under his left arm
1	why should i think otherwise !
1	i do not like hearing you handing nature over to evil , i replied
1	and now , after three months , with a temperature between and
1	then it wasn ’ t just rain , but a whitish-gray mixture of snow and rain , and finally just snow that came in squalls that filled the whole valley
1	little antonie had not let her grandfather disturb her sled ride , had merely extended her naturally slightly protruding upper lip in a little pout
1	for it was his sincere desire faithfully to defend and uphold that dignity in his own eyes , however difficult that might be after an almost six-month stay among people up here
1	anna asked with a sob
1	even herr stuht on glockengiesser strasse told his wife , who always moved in the best circles , lem me tell you , those two com ’ lement each other real good
1	be careful now , we ’ re going to look right through you both
1	they all assumed that he would immediately cease this pointless activity , to which they responded with disconcerted smiles ; but he went on holding forth in the all-devouring din
1	et je le regrette beaucoup
1	even his youthful mustache , trimmed on a slant to the corners of his mouth , was so spare that it could never have been shaped to a handlebar or extended to points , and that only added to his less-than-martial appearance
1	no , he really had not entirely forgotten his latin
1	his discourses would begin on dove ’ s feet , but soon , when he turned to liberated peoples uniting for universal happiness , there would come a sound as of the rushing pinions of eagles—not that he wished it or even knew whence it came , though doubtless it originated in the politics he had inherited from his grandfather , which had then blended with the humanistic inheritance of his father to create beautiful literature within him , lodovico , just as humanity and politics were blended in the lofty idea of civilization , to which he raised a toast , an idea full of the mildness of the dove and the boldness of the eagle and awaiting its day , the dawn of the day of nations , when the principle of obduracy would be defeated and a path opened for the holy alliance of bourgeois democracy
1	german deeds have always been done out of a certain immaturity , and it is not for nothing that we are the people of the reformation
1	and a good day to you , missy
1	but when by month five she can no longer walk , she writes her husband back by the baltic , and behrens receives a letter from him—the envelope is marked personal and urgent in a vigorous hand , i saw it myself
1	a rosy glow came to her cheeks and lingered there
1	people rubbed their eyes , stared straight ahead , felt embarrassed by the brightness and demanded the return of the dark , so that they could again watch things , whose time had passed , come to pass again , tricked out with music and transplanted into new time
1	she felt so weak that she didn ’ t even try to hold back the tears that slowly welled into her eyes again and again
1	there you will find , if i am not mistaken , an untiring interest in discussion and one hell of a lot of dialectic tension
1	it was a downright racket—it dashed , splashed , babbled , and foamed
1	i told him that i would find a hotel room for the night and look for something suitable the next day
1	gathering her skirts in one hand , she bent low as she took those two steps , and with her other small , heavily ringed hand , she pressed a handkerchief to her mouth—above it , her large , pale , distraught eyes stared at nothing
1	at first the woman pleaded with him in vain-on her knees toward the end-to spare her , to release her , not to force her to pay for peace of mind by betraying the man who loved her and whom she loved in return
1	how could that be ?
1	the rain had stopped , and now and then a bird released a delicate , questioning twitter that blended with the sporadic sound of dripping trees and shrubs
1	a little later , around seven o ’ clock , he would sit there a fifth time—that would be for supper
1	i can ’ t go on , christian replied and sat down facing sideways on one of the high-backed chairs set around the dining table ; he held his hat and walking stick between his knees
1	but let me ask you one question
1	aline is a …
1	he was married and even had a little daughter , but for some time now he had been separated from his wife and lived quite the bachelor life
1	i shall hold to their side , here in my soul , and not with naphta , or for that matter with settembrini—they ’ re both windbags
1	an old woman screeched
1	i really do like it for people to be a little more devout once in a while
1	at first he had to put up with being supervised by the attendant who brought him back
1	frau stöhr , as we know , had felt that way from the first ; she found her own vulgar skepticism , with which she had sent joachim on his way down to the flatlands , confirmed , and did not mind praising herself for it
1	do indeed stand up and enter through the next door to my left , where my bedchamber lies ( the other being farther on the same side ) , take from the press my winter coat that i wear in rome on days of tramontane and brought along perforce , for i knew not where to leave it elsewise ; do on my hat as well , snatch up my plaid rug , and return thus furnished to my place
1	but had he not always known that ?
1	it was learned , further , that since early childhood ellen had experienced visions , although at wide intervals , both visible and invisible
1	the last few days i ’ ve been thinking about a turkish proverb i read somewhere : when the house is finished , death follows
1	and even on days when peeperkorn was free of fever , hans castorp would spend several hours with him and his pearl-necklaced traveling companion
1	of an evening , he was often seen in the deserted and dimly lit dining hall , still sitting at his place , a piece of string carefully laid out in a circle on the bare tabletop ; suddenly he would reach out in a surprise attack and pull it straight , only to hunch over again , prop himself on his elbows , and sink into bitter brooding
1	in reality , it was something entirely different that brought the edginess to joachim ’ s voice and made him mention the recent lecture on botany in such a sarcastic tone
1	subject of of the
1	he shouted and walked to the door—and slammed it behind him
1	hanno stayed behind in the dining room alone
1	i have some important work to do with this gentleman , his father continued
1	i would tell him tales of a father , even i would tell him of the tears in my father 's eye when he would say :
1	you should be ashamed of yourself , worshiping success like that , herr settembrini chided him
1	a russian wave of attack is moving at full force , has taken vitebsk and is now threatening minsk , the capital of belorussia , after whose fall , so the whisperers allege , there can be no stopping the foe in the east , either
1	and so he had left it hanging in place
1	one could in fact remedy that ignominy , he said gaily
1	as he emerged on becker grube , he heard footsteps behind him and spotted gosch the broker , a picturesque figure wrapped in a long coat , who was also heading up the steep hill for the meeting
1	it was late october , the weather was still dry , though already raw and gloomy
1	and then , suddenly , she flinched and swallowed hard , her whole face a play of nervous , eager movement , her lips quickly touching for just a moment—and now she grabbed the pen , plunged rather than dipped it into the inkwell , and , crooking her index finger and laying her flushed head on her shoulder , wrote in her own clumsy hand , slanting upward from left to right : engaged on september to herr bendix grünlich , merchant from hamburg
1	there was such sincere anguish in his voice and in his face , such honesty and despair in his pleas…
1	had that been a heavy burden to bear ?
1	the fresh idea , then-a matter of three , four bars , no more , is it not ?
1	they ’ re young , but so much the better
1	frau stöhr wept with enthusiasm at the sight of what had once been joachim
1	a functional and useful theory of melody was boldly and quickly established
1	the covert words of these learned men
1	at least for now , that made the return home easier
1	he stood there , one hand holding the knot of his sailor ’ s tie against his chest , his tongue scouring a tooth that he did not trust , and listened to the earnest , subdued voices coming from the room
1	he agreed that the outbreak of war had meant a great improvement in the export of russian grain , mentioning that oats in particular had been imported on a grand scale for delivery to the army
1	still incensed , hans castorp asked if that was her husband there , and pointed to a gentleman with hunched shoulders sitting at the good russian table
1	what had been the date on the calendar of his first defiant departure ?
1	he felt both excited and serious about his future profession
1	but from the start , there was not the least reason to give it a name ; the furthest thing from his mind was ever to talk about the matter—that would have been most unlike him and he felt no need to do so
1	but they were undoubtedly at a disadvantage when wit and word and spirit were no longer at issue , and the topic turned to facts , to earthy , practical affairs , to those questions and things where masterful natures truly prove themselves
1	good heavens , mother , she said , i know one should not speak evil of one ’ s neighbor—i do , really
1	was that such an impossible hope ?
1	you ’ ll suffer no further harm , i ’ m sure
1	her reddish , fashionably coiffed hair shone in the candlelight
1	he was carefully groomed as always , but he looked exhausted
1	all religious austerity is , of course , dispiriting for people of lesser stature
1	a postcard arrived from lake constance , in which james tienappel wrote that he had received a telegram requiring his immediate return to the plains on business
1	it was a common error , by the way , an error that could even bring about failure , to believe one had to concentrate one ’ s will and thoughts on the prospective phenomenon
1	that ’ s nice , the senator said , biting the mouthpiece of his cigarette—and said no more
1	sneezing was just as much fun—the way you felt it swelling up with a vengeance inside you , until it became irresistible and you breathed in and out in one great frenzy , gave yourself over to the bliss of it , your face drunk with pleasure—you could forget the whole world in one blessed eruption
1	he entered , and the brass bell above the door yelped like a vigilant puppy
1	the novel and dreadful thing about a decisive military defeat is the overturning of this idea , its physical refutation by a foreign ideology bound up , above all , with a foreign language-the total submis-
1	how pleased i was with her can be seen in my previous description of her
1	he left it to me to put questions to luca ; indeed , he usually stepped away to look at something other than what was being discussed , leaving me alone with the apprentice
1	it was the return home from long , unspeakably painful wanderings , the correction of a great error , the loosening of tormenting chains , the removal of barriers—it set a horrible accident to rights again
1	at some level , i knew all along that i was making it up myself—the park , the trees , the sweet moist air , and all the rest , lovely or hideous—knew it ahead of time almost
1	who showed christian the door ?
1	what do you mean ?
1	he watched her intently , and the look on her face filled him with satisfaction—it was a look of disappointment
1	on those occasions when elisabeth was suffering from a migraine , it was madame grünlich ’ s task to look after the household and make up the menu
1	sometimes it would be followed by no utterance at all
1	the ineluctable recognition of hopeless doom is not synonymous with a denial of love
1	from eight till ten
1	most certainly not , thank god
1	the theory behind such a commonplace phenomenon as fever was self-contradictory
1	she pictured him and his tawny whiskers , his pink , smiling face , that wart beside his nose , his mincing steps ; she thought she could feel his wool suit , hear his bland voice
1	he hadn ’ t seemed to listen ; his eyes had set again , taking on that same fixed , vacant look
1	or did it seem to him just the opposite , that he had lived here now much , much longer than he really had ?
1	it lay in his own hands to correct the situation
1	among other things , he spoke about romanticism and the fascinating duality of this early nineteenth-century european movement , before which both reactionary and revolutionary ideas fell , that is , all those that were not synthesized to something higher still
1	you would be right to speak thus , but lack courage or pretend its lack
1	he also noticed at once that her lack of fluency in his language meant she had to choose simple phrases to express her sympathy
1	seldom had one heard certain pieces by vivaldi , vieuxtemps , and spohr , or grieg 's c-minor sonata , or even the kreutzer sonata and works by cesar franck played more impeccably
1	for his part , adrian , who for some reason-perhaps his short stature or his habitual headaches-had been excused from service indefinitely , intended to spend several weeks at buche !
1	if it should return , the doctor said-and he knew that it had to return within a few hours , since the easing of pressure brought about by tapping cerebral fluid would last only that long-they should apply the obligatory ice pack and give the chloral that he would prescribe and that was fetched from the county seat
1	this bare , hard room was ugly , despicable , and a whole morning full of a thousand ominous dangers lay leaden on his heart
1	at that moment he was universally despised
1	i ’ m sure this modest vintage will not be harmed if drunk from simpler vessels
1	in short , out of both love and fear , i suspected it of an aestheticism that cast the most tormenting doubts on my friend 's statement that the antithesis that would replace bourgeois culture was not barbarism , but community
1	for from time to time she was subject to fits of anxious , whining panic , the result of her allegedly increasing listlessness and the upward curve of her fever chart
1	but joachim , likewise harboring the best of intentions and hoping to move their conversation harmlessly along , spoke up now—yet it sounded almost as if he did so under some pressure or duress , against his will , as it were
1	oh , what rotten , beastly luck !
1	when he finished , he laid his hands in his lap , a gloomy expression on his face
1	barrier to their public performance during his lifetime , especially since one of the songs , the merry musicians , is written for a whole quintet of voices : mother , daughter , two brothers , and the little boy who
1	hans castorp said nothing
1	but his body wanted things otherwise
1	you ca not tell me what pigment produces it , either
1	he then added : this bourn�e was more than a little characteristic of the playfully archaic element of conventional restraint , which contrasted so charmingly , and yet challengingly with the modern ,
1	mais apres tout , we are on german soil-indeed , how german , how homey and cozy , how full of character !
1	my temperature stands at a hundred degrees
1	she had suffered four severe hemorrhages over the last ten days , and her parents had come here with the idea of taking her back home while she still lived ; but that did not appear to be a feasible plan—the director said that poor fräulein gerngross ought not to be moved
1	of course you must come along , he said , you and your wife
1	his grandfather was a carbonaro , which means charcoal-burner , by the way
1	ought there not be something embarrassing and depressing about that for me , an ordinary man ?
1	pray note that you have actually lectured me only on the effects of hell , not , however , on what in point of fact and deed the damned have to expect there
1	what do you see in him ?
1	luise ziemssen had the same beautiful , black , gentle eyes as joachim
1	around his neck hung the long gold watch chain that his grandfather had promised him , its fob a medallion that displayed the rather mournful family coat-of-arms : an irregularly hatched background , a bleak moor landscape , and a solitary , leafless willow beside a marsh
1	when it comes to music , your normally fine sense for what is banal fails you entirely
1	i don ’ t think he will ever be a soloist , she said to herr pfühl , and actually i ’ m quite glad about that , because it has its drawbacks
1	his mother raised her hand in protest
1	he now saw director behrens standing in front of a cupboard or built-in cabinet , his back to them as they entered ; he was inspecting a blackish plate that he held out at arm ’ s length against the dull light of the ceiling lamp
1	herr settembrini listened attentively , his ankles crossed , his arms ditto , all the while daintily stroking the sweep of his moustache with his toothpick
1	no , peeperkorn ’ s desire for reality was rooted in something else : in fear , to put it quite bluntly—in his obsession with honor , in the zeal for duty that hans castorp had tried to explain to herr settembrini and wanted to declare as a kind of military trait
1	about the delay in my departure ?
1	interest in it , only with
1	yes , those were stimulating hours , days , and weeks
1	his valet notified me after it was all over , she answered
1	she ’ s giving her doll a bath
1	well , it was long ago in any case
1	gerda buddenbrook allowed him do as he liked for a while , but at last she decided that he should be given piano lessons
1	whether explicitly or silently , you all ask that same question and acknowledge one another purely out of courtesy and for appearance '
1	among those who had found their way back from the social rooms in the wake of mr blue and miss silent was clavdia chauchat
1	as always , settembrini was wearing his heavy coat with the wide lapels , a frayed turndown collar , and checked trousers
1	he didn ’ t merely think it—he was so in earnest that he spoke it out loud
1	it will be recalled that in the old chapbook , which tells of the life and death of the grand magician and which , with a few resolute modifications of its chapters , leverkiihn arranged as the basis for the movements of his work , dr faustus , his hour-glass running out , invites his friends and trusted associates , magisters , baccalaurs , and other students to the village of rimlich near wittenberg , entertains them liberally there by day , and by night as well , drinking with them a st john 's farewell , and then , in a contrite but dignified speech makes known his fate and announces its imminent fulfillment
1	i stopped and stared at him , though that did not matter to him
1	i was fairly sure all along , but what you said there at the end betrayed you
1	since the onset of winter , his fever chart had been curving upward , and director behrens had mentioned something about injections that he liked to give for chronic high temperature and which two-thirds of the guests , including joachim , regularly received
1	i ’ ve never seen it , but i ’ ve heard that ’ s how primitive tribes do it , celebrating the first night of summer , which is actually the beginning of autumn—the year ’ s high noon , its zenith , and it ’ s all downhill from there
1	those will do the trick
1	this ignorance or brashness proved more useful to him than all else , because the floating rhythm made some of his compositions , particularly those
1	silence and order were quickly established
1	i ’ ve been sitting all along
1	the measles had left him with that same strong need for sleep that very small children have , and he frequently yielded to it wherever he might happen to be , even outside the hours set apart for an afternoon nap
1	that ’ s your true pedagogue—he himself said not long ago that he had a pedagogic streak
1	i don ’ t know why it offends me so much—though i ’ m not saying , jean , that the july monarchy isn ’ t a fine thing…
1	of course , it ’ s in your best interest to have me believe that the others are as calm and trusting as ever
1	anton is gone on the wings of the storm , like a shot !
1	frau stöhr , however , who happened to be sitting not all that far from the trio , had apparently abandoned herself to the film ; her red , uneducated face was contorted with pleasure
1	he asked , his voice wavering on the edge
1	and so a potbellied and knock-kneed king heinrich in lohengrin had to serve as the butt of ridicule-with that round , black hole of a mouth in a doormat of a beard through which he let spill his rumbling bass
1	do you need a shove ?
1	it means that i belong to a fraternity in göttingen—and now you know
1	you will not deny it to me , i know
1	in reality , however , they were one , were united in their opposition to life , to the bourgeoisiosity of life , to ethics , reason , virtue ; they were the single religious principle that they represented together
1	the academic life keeps one young and frisky
1	i am not indifferent to the lass-but you do not like that word-to the girl , then , to marie
1	he spent some time beside the bridge table , where the incurable herr albin , his mouth drooping at the corners , played his cards with a worldly nonchalance
1	at a real premiere , everyone must leap up from their seats at several points during the evening , and while the majority roars , 'insulte !
1	he stammered on for a while in an attempt to plead his cause
1	as for the rest , it would all be over with no consequences , for better or worse , in another week and a half , when he would enter training with tunder and wilms
1	all in all , it had something of the education of a princeling about it , and i recall that i used that very term when teasing my friend , and also recall how he gave his peculiar curt laugh and turned his head aside , as if he would have preferred not to hear it
1	if so , hans castorp thought it was very forced mockery , because his uncle had definitely not been in a mood for jests or mockery when he rushed off like that , but rather had come to the profound realization—and had turned pale with fright picturing it to himself—that upon his return to the flatlands , after a stay of only eight days , everything down there would seem totally false , unnatural , and wrong for a good while , that instead of heading off to his office after breakfast , he ought to take a short constitutional , then ritually wrap himself in blankets , and assume a horizontal position in the open air
1	they sat there for a few minutes , during which the consul and the broker spoke by turns
1	she cried when she admitted it to me
1	then there was the problem of the ground-floor rooms on meng strasse , which would soon stand empty , because the senator planned to move his offices to fischer grube as well ; but that issue was soon solved nicely , for it turned out that the municipal fire insurance company was prepared to rent the space for their offices
1	have we perhaps reached a decision ?
1	specialists have assured me that it ’ s the case with me
1	that ’ s quite , quite , quite funny
1	so , then , have a good trip and give my best to your good father , the consul , and his wife
1	it was a proximity based solely on illness ; all the same , joachim had a great deal of military integrity about him—though , granted , without his even being aware of it , that integrity was being increasingly satisfied by rest cures , to the point where they had become , as it were , a substitute for duties fulfilled in the flatlands , a kind of spurious occupation
1	you will have to admit that her movements are totally restricted
1	and then lavishes kisses upon the corpse from the sole of its feet to the crown of its head , so that her knights , disconcerted by such exaggerated sorrow , feel compelled to pull their mistress off the dead man
1	not only was he repeatedly far too candid about his relationship with inez , but he also went too far in a different direction , culpably and impishly far-seduced by the darkness might i say , if the term seduction may seem properly employed
1	and he had known how to spread his theory among the public—among other methods , by writing popular articles that he had then passed on to the press
1	bending forward , he moved his spoon through his soup , letting his little , round , deep-set eyes drift to the head of the table now and then
1	you ’ ll have to explain that for me
1	but he now blithely started in with it again and backed off ( without taking any offense , by the way ) only after adrian refused a second or third time to respond accordingly
1	that ’ s a display put on by the skin ’ s sebaceous glands , which give off the skin ’ s oils , a kind of protein-rich , fatty secretion , you know—not exactly appetizing , but it keeps the skin supple , so that it doesn ’ t dry out and crack or break and remains pleasant to the touch
1	god was indeed gracious , despite dr grabow ’ s pronouncement that the birth was somewhat too early , and even though matters had not stood at the best beforehand and bethsy endured great pain
1	while joachim was eating his breakfast downstairs , hans castorp would sit up , pillows stuffed behind his back , and do the same , with the healthy appetite that a change in life can bring—and would be disturbed hardly at all by the bustling , businesslike invasion of the doctors , who by this time had passed through the dining hall and were now making their rounds , moving at double time through the rooms of the bedridden and moribund
1	yes , in point of fact , we need to get moving there
1	laundry baskets full of clothes and linens are being carried out of the house
1	it was fun—he stood there for a long time , just trying out this little optical phenomenon over and over
1	i ’ m not saying , of course , that your good mother will be taking a stroll tomorrow morning , dr grabow went on meekly
1	for there could be no mistaking two obvious facts : first , joachim was approaching death with his mind clear ; and second , he did so contentedly and at peace with himself
1	so you see , it is a good thing to have reliable friends after all
1	you shall hear from me
1	joachim , too , after first gazing at his cousin in astonishment , hastened to assure the director that it would indeed be very kind of him
1	damn if i don ’ t
1	it is a miscalculation ; by the light of cold day , it is as impossible as the thing itself , which would be immediately evident if nature rescinded that impossibility even once ; and what we call mourning is perhaps not so much the pain of the impossibility of ever seeing the dead return to life , as the pain of not being able to wish it
1	this would have meant withholding from what was created the free will to turn away from god-which would have been an imperfect creation , indeed not a creation of and an externality apart from god at all
1	but just imagine , mama , yesterday , on theatiner strasse , some high dignitary of the church rode past me in his carriage , he might have been the archbishop , an older man—well , the man leered at me from his carriage window as if he were a lieutenant of the guard
1	and ’ cause she was so cute
1	another was the trip to the shore that he took with schildknapp , the fruit of which , one can say ,
1	hans castorp disputed this emphatically—his cousin was talking almost like settembrini , with no respect or reverence for suffering
1	at the same time , however , he realized with terrible clarity what was happening now
1	and a crazy , preposterous idea rose up inside him , a wild hope based in his fanciful belief that with god nothing was impossible , despite all the men in worsted suits in the world
1	there were problems , he said—the lieutenant ’ s days up here were numbered and the engineer would now be doubling his efforts at rest cure in order to follow his cousin back down to the plains soon
1	when , one day , then , his children returned from a trip to west prussia with this young girl—she was only just twenty—bringing her into the house like some baby jesus , an orphan , the daughter of an innkeeper who had died just before the buddenbrooks ’ arrival , the consul ’ s act of christian charity had resulted in an outburst , during which the old gentleman spoke almost nothing but french and plattdeutsch
1	and on the spot he declared little elly to be a cunning fraud
1	the candles were burning slowly , slowly lower , and now and then , when their flames flickered to one side , the faint odor of wax drifted over the table
1	well , my name is morten , he said , and blushed redder than ever
1	i flatter myself that in general i have not left these gentlemen with the impression that i am an exploiter and their moral inferior ; indeed , i ’ ve run across some who drive a much harder bargain than i but it took just one little bold stroke , which i shall now tell you about , to bring me a bit closer on the social scale to one such fellow
1	and speak right out
1	it was a democracy of banquet tables , to put it bluntly
1	she found nothing more elegant than a tasteful negligee , and since she had never been permitted to give free rein to this passion in her parents ’ home , she indulged herself all the more as a married woman
1	but one day , when left in the room with hans castorp and her patient , who definitely was not asleep , but lying on his back with his eyes open , she blithely remarked , i never would have dreamed it , either—that i would be nursing one of you gentlemen to the bitter end
1	and at the sound of that voice , little johann raised his golden-brown eyes and fixed them—larger , clearer , and more loving than ever before—on his father ’ s face , with its reddened eyelids beneath pale brows and its white , slightly puffy cheeks behind the long tips of the stiff mustache
1	he was beyond happy
1	the green ribbons of her bonnet were draped over her childlike shoulders , and she had to lift one of those shoulders very high whenever she wanted to make a gesture with her arm above the level of the tabletop ; at age seventy-five , she was thinner than ever
1	gentlemen , dr langhals , the presiding chairman , said after a while , in a subdued voice audible to the whole assembly , i assume i have your consent to open this meeting ?
1	he cast the winning costumes one quick glance , and then his lips grew very thin beneath the lovely upward sweep of his moustache
1	and what didn ’ t fall to herr kistenmaker ’ s excess of zeal was ruined by old herr marcus ’ s procrastination
1	it was between the beginning and the middle of february of a new year
1	the spiral staircase down to the bathroom is amusing , i grant
1	that was normal—no one was fond of anniversaries of arrival
1	you tend to take your jokes more seriously than your serious statements
1	look there , i call that advancement o n your part
1	mother ’ s house , this house was that little marked-off spot for me , tom
1	all the more intense , then , was my satisfaction upon receiving this letter from the office in lugano
1	he was its source-the curse , however , was intended for the object
1	but when she came back to him , one had little doubt that he had ever left her mind for a moment
1	he had a bad feeling about this
1	the main thing is that above the positive law of nation-states there arises a universal law with a higher jurisdiction , which allows disputed questions between parties to be settled by courts of arbitration
1	wasn ’ t clavdia right to feel excused from writing , simply because her illness gave her that freedom ?
1	the traces of what had befallen consul buddenbrook ’ s daughter grew more and more blurred , both in town and in the family
1	beg your pardon , but that is not all
1	but tony laid her knife down and cried , just tell me straight out , papa , please !
1	i was quite sure , her mother said , that we would be open to quiet words of reason
1	the achievements that the renaissance and the enlightenment wrested from the past—and may i emphasize , my dear sir , the struggles contained in that verb—were individual human personality , human rights , and human freedom
1	i know very well that there are two or three other people here in town—all of them women , i believe—who could instruct him , but they are mere piano teachers
1	madame möllendorpf immediately reached for her lorgnette
1	so in my eyes at least , your catarrh is merely a tertiary phenomenon , dr krokowski had added very nonchalantly
1	a very aristocratic sort , with a square monocle clamped in his eye—i could never figure out why he didn ’ t cut himself—wore patent-leather boots and carried a riding crop with a gold handle
1	i ’ d be lying if i said i didn ’ t
1	there was someone in my life whose stout-hearted perseverance overcame death , one can almost say , who freed the humanity within me , who taught me happiness
1	still others were fishing
1	what do you have against the body ?
1	ah , and the catastrophes by which free thought hopes to prove its own vitality—ah , those latter-day , spectacular triumphs for which it prepares itself and which it dreams of someday celebrating !
1	here , stand between the portieres
1	dry his chin , my child—here , take my napkin
1	not that i would want for the world to insult you , my good joachim , or your zealot ’ s love of duty
1	how could i not ?
1	in any case , i have already had a few words today with gosch , the old broker
1	you have to eat right , you know
1	yes , you can put it that way
1	nor do i know whether he let himself be won over on that occasion
1	despite which , one ought not to imagine him as peevish ; on the contrary , he was very funny , sometimes even foolish , gifted with a veritable anglo-saxon sense of humor and a personality that the english would surely call boyish
1	such an idea ought never to enter my head , i know , but you ’ ve left me no choice but to think that is whom you mean , tony
1	herr settembrini spoke very graphically , very drolly , about the father in the corner
1	it is ever flattering , ever beneficial
1	in those years , school life is life itself ; it embodies life ; its interests form the horizon that every life needs in order to develop values , however relative those may be , by which character and abilities prove themselves
1	and so , gradually , a general mood began to spread through the town , and its effects soon reached the widow buddenbrook ’ s household itself—at first much to her amazement and dismay , and then to her growing indignation
1	employing all the powers of my imagination , i could not credit this thoroughly fussy and self-absorbed man-whose frame , io be sure , was delicate and exquisite , but physically quite unimposing ( he even had a mincing gait , by the way ) -with any appeal for the opposite sex ; whereas i felt that inez , despite all her reserved virginal austerity , ultimately needed just such appeal
1	through their quartz windows the travelers now stared out into a blue-black difficult to describe but perhaps best compared to the duskiness along the horizon of a sky swept by fohn winds
1	grünlich has set up the big green card table—there are all kinds of papers and pencils on it—where you ’ re supposed to have a conference with him and kesselmeyer
1	and when the high priest mentions that radames has nothing to say , they unanimously agree he is guilty of treason
1	all the same , it was in love ’ s service , naphta declared , that machinery was set in motion by which the cloister cleansed the world of its wicked citizens
1	perhaps she did not even remember any of it
1	well , and where are we then ?
1	yes , that was pribislav
1	are hermetically sealed preserves on the shelf outside of time ?
1	in the end-no , beg your pardon , not n the end , but before all else-your homo dei is really a piece of gruesome nature with a not exactly generously allotted quantum of potential for spiritualization
1	each time he performed the task , sweat beaded up underneath his unruly blond curls and the whites of his pretty cornflowerblue eyes were netted with red veins
1	'voice ' is a very good word , for it reminds us that music was song long before it was anything else-first one voice and then many-and that the chord is the result of polyphonic singing ; and that means counterpoint , means an interweaving of independent voices that , to a certain degree and according to changeable laws of tastes , show regard for each other
1	early services are just starting , but we shall lift our hearts and praise god in the glory of nature , isn ’ t that right , herr permaneder ?
1	the panes of both windows were almost opaque with fog , and only blurred , naked trees and shrubs were still visible outside
1	some garden , hanno said and began to laugh
1	but i ask you , what is there to stand in the way ?
1	then she came back around to her papa and her cousin
1	well , at least we can hope , joachim said , that you ’ ve recuperated here with us and will feel refreshed once you ’ re back down
1	ida sat down next to her , picked up her needle and the darning egg with the stocking stretched over it , and , with her head bent low , the smooth gray hair pulled back tight , and following her stitches with unwearying shiny brown eyes , said , do you think he ’ ll ask tomorrow ?
1	of the screaming , writhing torture of a child-of this child , who folds his trembling little hands and stammers , echo will be good , echo will be good !
1	the tips of his fingers stung and were so swollen that there was no point in trying to use his nail brush
1	then he went on drumming , stamping his feet now , howling , i won ’ t
1	and so this time , too , all voices unite in the verdict of treason !
1	but they decided on the traditional sum of , marks courant
1	about morality as well !
1	this was at a house on mythen strasse , near the lake , the home of herr and frau reiff , a wealthy , childless couple well along in years , lovers of the arts who had always enjoyed entertaining prominent touring artists and offering them a tasteful refuge
1	and it will be a whole new travemünde , right on front row with the schwarzkopfs
1	but it would only have been a wild departure
1	they both climbed in , and the carriage rolled off through the streets
1	when he used his handkerchief , he found red traces of blood , but he did not have the energy to think much about it , although he was easily inclined to worry about himself and tended by nature to play the hypochondriac
1	do not lose yourself in an alien world
1	he opened the door when he heard a soft , anguished come in , and found frau permaneder , still completely dressed , lying atop the down quilt that covered her bed ; the bed-curtains had been pulled back , and there was a bottle of digestive tonic on the nightstand beside her
1	or something of that sort
1	which , of course , put an end to joachim ’ s exuberance
1	yes , that ’ s a good idea
1	several berghof residents studied esperanto and had learned enough to converse in the artificial lingo at meals
1	it ’ s the same as if there were a splotch of ink on this page
1	and even today , among the uneducated , this morel was thought to be an aphrodisiac
1	he demonstrated for us the fingering on a clarinet and on a seven-holed bassoon , whose sound , with its twelve closed and four open keys , blends so nicely with that of the horns ; he taught us about the range of the instruments , how they are played , and much more
1	i am well aware that he would like me to surrender myself entirely to polyhymnia
1	rather than attempting a portrait of my darling subject , i shall probably do more for him by confessing that even today , a good seventeen years later , tears well up in my eyes at the thought of him , and at the same time i am filled with a fundamentally strange , ethereal , not quite earthly joy and serenity
1	for remarkably enough , he also wrote on its tilted surface , very like erasmus in holbein 's portrait
1	in any case , the added emotional experience of observing the patient from mannheim was almost too much for a man like poor hans castorp to have to deal with all at once
1	half sweet , half buttermilk , dieckmann
1	he started all over again—and then suddenly broke off
1	after wandering in confusion and vague ecstasy , the sounds would then sink back down , sobbing and fainting , into night and stillness
1	i note that first and foremost , but am very well aware , my good man , of what lies hid behind it
1	but now , standing beside the mother who had rushed here from elsewhere , he looked at his cousin with her eyes , as it were , as if he had not seen him for a long time , and saw clearly and distinctly what she doubtless also recognized and joachim certainly knew better than either of them : that he was a moribundus
1	but no , thank god , his head was turned in the other direction and he was just preaching away in general across the throng of worshipers ; and yet it was only too clear that this was a new assault and that every word was meant for her
1	he realized he was talking to himself—and saying rather strange things at that
1	he was grateful beyond bounds for the respect shown his origins , his infant christian faith , his personal status in general
1	but then , to be sure , had come the great fugue overture , opus and the majestic fugues in the gloria and credo of the missa solemnis , proof at last that in wrestling with this angel the great combatant had remained the victor here , too , though departing perhaps halting upon his thigh
1	he was frequently confined to his bed , and not just on the days when his quartan fever went about its foul work
1	i don ’ t need a son
1	it was just like in the municipal theater—almost even more beautiful
1	the emotional circumstances we have been describing exacerbated the man ’ s illness beyond measure ; and since he could not fail to encounter forms of life here that displayed the imperfection of which he , wiedemann , was free , those same circumstances led to a dreadful scene that hans castorp witnessed and that shall have to serve as one more example of what we are describing
1	for is not that fledgling moment of dawning freedom , when the school door closes behind us , when the shell of the town in which
1	you have to be awfully careful not to say one word too many , otherwise you ’ ll get an extensive lecture
1	i bore it all and didn ’ t grumble
1	preparatory examination negative , dr krokowski announced
1	fine , it ’ s not permitted in cases like ours , we can ’ t handle that—which is understandable , and so as a reasonable man you reconcile yourself to the fact
1	madame buddenbrook had sighed her last , very brief , and peaceful sigh , the bearers had lifted her flower-bedecked coffin to carry it awkwardly from the dining room , where the funeral service had been held—but his mood did not change , he never wept once ; what remained was that gentle , perplexed shake of the head , and curious became his favorite word , repeated with something almost like a smile
1	the room assigned him-immediately to the right of the entrance and facing the quiet street-had appealed to him because it was tidy and practically but comfortably furnished , and he had quickly put it in perfect order with the addition of his personal belongings , his books and notes
1	my dear father , for heaven ’ s sake , calm down
1	well , give it some thought , thomas
1	that could happen easily enough—it was a smooth tabletop , the edge of the glass was nicely ground , and the pressure exerted by their trembling fingers , light as it was , would of course be uneven , more vertical here , more from the side there , so that in time it would be quite sufficient to cause the glass to leave its middle position
1	everything i ’ ve ever tried to do has gone wrong and ended in misfortune
1	he has buddenbrook hands—and buddenbrooks can span ninths or tenths
1	let it stand as it is
1	it ’ s not a complete physical , but behrens pounds around a little on you and has krokowski jot down some notes
1	it all comes to me , i say
1	she did not trust this illness , and was most definitely not inclined to lie back in her bed and idly let matters take their course
1	and then everyone moved forward to shake hands once again with the dead woman ’ s sons and brother
1	herr grünlich waited in his long-tailed coat and silk vest outside the door
1	i truly like measuring my temperature four times a day , because it makes you notice what one minute , or even seven , actually means—especially since the seven days of a week hang so dreadfully heavy on your hands here
1	and hans castorp replied nonchalantly , nothing new
1	she whistled from her stomach as she passed me by
1	i have only this to say yet
1	before this dog so lowly ;
1	it ’ s one of the things naphta and settembrini argue about
1	he has trouble concentrating , and gets tired quickly
1	i don ’ t want this , i want it boiling hot
1	i beg you to drink with me , to quaff our glasses down to the last drop , arm in arm
1	and his grandfather , who had already pushed back the long , soft flap of his frock coat and pulled a bundle of keys from his trouser pocket , now opened the china cabinet , from whose interior rose a fragrance the boy found both strange and pleasant
1	one could in fact forget completely just where one is
1	i call this light touch refreshing , because it was so much a part of his lifeblood that , in fact , it instilled in one the amusingly comforting sense that one unnecessarily took life all too seriously
1	and , to cap it all , pfiffi , with a little jiggle and drops of moisture at the corners of her mouth , would comment on the child ’ s extraordinary resemblance to that swindler grünlich
1	having spent her last years tormented by gout , she had passed on gently , simply , firm in her childish faith and envied by her educated sister , who still had to do battle with rationalist doubts now and then , and who , although she had grown ever more hunchbacked and tiny , was bound to this sinful earth by a rugged constitution
1	or ho ! —he would hop about in a kind of dance , and tony would make him dance the moment she spotted him
1	he had not wanted to disturb his nephew—a white lie
1	herr kesselmeyer followed the course of these two drops with intense interest ; he even raised himself up a little to stare openmouthed directly into grünlich ’ s face
1	homely edification on the faces of the women
1	should it be your state solely ?
1	for we do not see ourselves as hans castorp ’ s eulogist and want to leave room for the suggestion that , for him , work was simply something that stood in the way of the unencumbered enjoyment of a maria mancini
1	gazing at me , not you
1	they went even further
1	i urgently request the reader , by the way , to credit what i have said here with such feeling to my authorial account and not to believe it represents leverkiihn 's thoughts
1	but once the old masters had been given their due , his partner no longer had to coerce him into the more complicated hand positions and he would glide easily into the vital , subtle weaving of leitmotifs , though always with a look of embarrassment and something close to anger in his eyes
1	yes , he would be late , there was no question of that now
1	evidently and by his own admission , the man was living at the time in a state of high tension , in which invention definitely did not simply cheer , but also harried and enthralled him , in which the flash of a problem as it posed itself-that is , the cqmpositional task as he had pursued it from the start-was as one with the illumination of its solution , barely leaving him time to put his quill , his pen to a rush of ideas that gave him no rest , made him their slave
1	otherwise i ’ d be lying out on my balcony after my evening meal , too
1	i have seen quite a bit of the world , and i have lived among far too many different kinds of people , with far too many different customs , for me to—and i ’ m a grown man in any case , he suddenly shouted
1	hans castorp had no time to concern himself with the titles naphta had bestowed upon herr settembrini
1	urged on by frau stöhr , who had now joined them , they stopped by the kurhaus café just to please karen , who clasped her hands together in gratitude
1	the whole room was fragrant with lightly singed evergreen boughs and glowed and sparkled with the light of countless little flames ; the sky-blue wallpaper with its white statues of gods made the large room look even brighter
1	she still cried just as she had as a child—openly and without any posturing
1	it seems to me that as my brother you should assume more or less the position of chief clerk that he held before , at least in a representative sense , for appearance ’ s sake
1	and , of course , salt water does smart on chafed skin , so he probably got in the habit of using cold cream while he was in the service , that doesn ’ t seem at all peculiar to me
1	the back building had vanished entirely , and in its place rose a new trim , airy structure with several large , high-ceilinged storage rooms and shops that fronted on becker grube
1	in wittenberg or on the wartburg , even in leipzig i would have thought you credible
1	herr köppen said commliments again
1	thousands of them darken the skies of this brashly united continent , and more and more of our cities collapse in ruin
1	and what followed now were the strangest hours our hero ’ s young life had ever known until then ; and although we are not completely sure as to his later fate , although we shall lose sight of him at a certain point in our story , we would like to think that they remained the strangest hours he would ever experience
1	and since , moreover , given such widespread wickedness , there was sore need for an example to be set , the two witches , old and young , were publicly burned at adjacent stakes
1	i chanced to spot a lass
1	of course he should have said : of nuremberg
1	maybe you ’ d be able to whistle , too , if you really set your mind to it , after all it must be something you can learn
1	then , turning to his assembled relatives , he said seriously , if perhaps a little perfunctorily , my heartfelt thanks to you all , my dear family
1	one might imagine such a lad spurring a horse on or swimming in a bay , strolling along the shore with a girlfriend , his lips pressed to his gentle beloved ’ s ear , or in happy friendship instructing another lad to string a bow
1	they were waiting for the old woman ’ s brother , consul justus kröger , who had been sent for as well
1	so , let ’ s forget it , kai , and now you can tell a story
1	triflings and trumpery !
1	his manners were not quite perfect , and his conversation was frankly clumsy
1	all we lack are a couple of palm trees to put at my wife ’ s bay window , and a few suitable oil paintings , which i ’ ll look around for
1	it was to the right of the lobby , directly across from the social rooms , and was used , as joachim explained , primarily for new arrivals or residents who either had missed a regularly scheduled meal or had visitors
1	this passed , and he was working again by early august , and before that month of a great many very hot , sunny days had ended , the oratorio was completed
1	life in prison had not affected hugo weinschenk ’ s physical health—he had always been a man of rugged constitution
1	a pony … no … i … petersen stammered
1	that ’ s fine , marcus , and my hearty thanks for your willingness to assume some of the responsibilities that otherwise might prove too much for me , thomas responded quickly , and casually offered his partner a hand across the table—for the matter had been settled for some time , and all this was a mere formality
1	but with or without a reason for them , these feelings , though far from having a name or being shared , were so powerful that hans castorp carried them silently about with him for almost a year—approximately a year , since it was impossible to fix their beginnings exactly—which at least spoke for the loyalty and steadfastness of his character , particularly when one thinks what a huge chunk of time a year is at that age
1	that was a major blunder , he admitted
1	but it had been inevitable
1	it came in whispers
1	but any child could have seen from his mother ’ s eyes that she was totally conscious and aware of everything
1	i ’ m figuring , the consul said dryly
1	you can not pretend that i had anything to do with your waiting—if indeed you did wait—that i encouraged you to wait , or even gave you permission to do so
1	joachim , too , was somewhat embarrassed
1	the salon , the columned hall , the landscape room , and the corridor were crowded with mourners as pastor pringsheim from st mary ’ s delivered the eulogy by the light of flickering candles ; he stood erect and majestic at the head of the casket , and his clean-shaven face , its expression ranging from solemn fanaticism to mild transfiguration , was turned toward heaven—floating above his wide , pleated ruff and a pair of hands folded just under his chin
1	you ’ ve waited this long …
1	but knock softly , don ’ t startle her
1	the least breath of air brushing the trees made the tinsel shudder and tinkle in metallic whispers
1	but today that firm is shaky , and b grünlich is the shakiest of the shaky
1	he could not think of the lawyer , moreover , without being reminded of fränzchen oberdank , the smoothly coiffed lady ’ s companion and housemaid who had recently been brought up here by her mother , a very dignified provincial lady
1	to your health , lodovico—i wish you long life
1	i feel sick , kai , little johann said
1	it is also the element of music , which itself measures and divides time , making it suddenly diverting and precious ; and related to music , as we have noted , is the story , which also can only present itself in successive events , as movement toward an end ( and not as something suddenly , brilliantly present , like a work of visual art , which is pure body bound to time ) , and even if it would try to be totally here in each moment , would still need time for its presentation
1	but he gave hanno everything he had to give as presents : marbles , wooden tops , even his small , battered tin pistol—his finest possession
1	and form , too , comes only from love and goodness : form and the cultivated manners of man ’ s fair state , of a reasonable , genial community—out of silent regard for the bloody banquet
1	yes , and then we ’ ll walk up to that same bench from this morning
1	his researches , dedicated to psychic dissection and the dream life of his patients , had always had a subterranean character , the whiff of the catacomb
1	but they knew that this was his favorite pose , and so someone had spilled ink on the spot , and herr modersohn ’ s little , clumsy hand was now stained black
1	in particular thomas enjoyed his imitation of herr marcellus stengel , who worked very hard at instructing his students in singing , drawing , and similar diverting disciplines
1	he looked around him now , delighting as always in this boldly intimate spot , which even under these icy conditions was no less beautiful than during the season of blue blossoms
1	and he jumped up , leaned against the wall , and pressed the back of his head against the wainscoting
1	the tea you brought me is ice-cold
1	hans castorp had never seen the phenomenon before , had never believed it could really occur—but herr wiedemann ’ s hair stood up stiff and straight as nails
1	i am speaking of morten schwarzkopf , who intends to become a doctor and , as soon as he is one , to ask for my hand
1	an unhappy poet of my country , a hunchbacked , sickly man with a soul—a large soul originally , but one forever humbled by the misery of his body and dragged to the lower depths of irony , a soul that could produce laments to rend the heart
1	she adjusted the lamp and pulled the large bible over to her—the gilt on its immense embossed cover faded with age
1	one of the finest of the age , a master of our tongue , few could match him , and a stylist in latin , the like of which there is none today , a uomo letterato to warm boccaccio ’ s heart
1	i was truly embarrassed for him
1	what you are preaching is pragmatism , settembrini responded , and you need only transfer it to the political realm to perceive how totally destructive it is
1	joachim began without further ado to strip to the waist
1	when i have paid him , he wishes me a hearty appetite and turns tail
1	he said , sitting up taller against the cushioned back , but immediately slumping again a little to one side
1	her whole body , from her crown to the sole of her feet , was apparently overcome by terrible restlessness , by unspeakable panic and agony , by an inescapable sense of abandonment and hopelessness without end
1	he cast a glance at senator buddenbrook and herr gosch , and since the two gentlemen were deep in conversation , he drew his chair closer to frau permaneder ’ s spot on the sofa , and bent toward her until she could hear his nose puffing heavily very near her own
1	he , too , had spruced up his appearance a little for mardi gras , for in addition to his white clinical smock , which , as a man ever on professional call , he wore today as always , he had donned a genuine turkish fez , scarlet red with a black tassel dangling over one ear—costume enough to lend his already striking appearance an even more curious and outlandish look
1	no , not to people who have no dignity , morals , ambition , elegance , or discipline , not to impolite , unkempt , slovenly people , people who are lazy and frivolous , sluggish and superficial all at the same time
1	but one can ’ t speak of boredom , because boredom comes with the passing of time—and that would be a paradox in relation to eternity
1	only a misanthrope could christen the lack of the word—raw , mute reality itself—with such a name
1	she was sixteen or seventeen years old
1	a bad case of the sniffles appeared to be in the making
1	individualism was romantically medieval in its belief in the infinite , cosmic importance of each single creature , from which came the doctrine of the immortality of the soul , the theory of geocentrism , and astrology
1	hans castorp ate , meanwhile suppressing the tremor of his head
1	considerably exceeds the disquieting number of pages in the one on kretzschmar 's lectures
1	she ’ s in her room
1	he shouted in a booming voice that made the room ring and sent frau permaneder sobbing to one corner of the sofa
1	i wouldn ’ t go so far as to say that the natural order—the size of the earth , for instance , or the time it takes for it to turn on its axis or orbit the sun , the alternation of day and night , the change of seasons , the rhythm of the cosmos , if you like—that all that has been measured out to suit our needs
1	don ’ t make fun of me , tom
1	does it not seem as if the archaized tone had fulfilled its purpose as soon as the story of being led astray was put to paper , as if from then on the tone'was abandoned not only because it did not fit the ruse of those final observations , but also because , starting with the dating , that tone had been introduced solely in order to tell the story in it , to give the tale its appropriate atmosphere ?
1	she asked , pronouncing the word in a strange , clipped way
1	the heavy red curtains at the windows had been closed , and in each corner of the room eight candles burned in a tall , gold-plated candelabrum , not to mention those in silver branched candlesticks on the table
1	that concern is only too justified , for your humanism is done with , you may be assured of that—over and done with
1	and as for his vows , there is such a thing as mental reservation
1	he gazed down at his plate , his eyes swimming with tears
1	he had spent a summer near snow hill back then , and one friday evening , the beginning of the sabbath , he had ridden over just to play the onlooker outside these pious people 's house of worship
1	as if progress , to the extent such a thing existed , was not due solely to illness , or better , to creative genius , which was one and the same thing as illness
1	the word of the apostle , 'he who seeketh hard things shall have it hard
1	veiled in a black cashmere scarf , her knees slightly bent , she was strolling aimlessly in long , restless strides ; and her aging face , with its large , careworn mouth , shimmered dull white against the black veil she had wound around her silver-streaked hair and tied beneath her chin
1	correct , impeccably neat , and elegant , he walked along breite strasse with his characteristic , slightly skipping gait and was constantly forced to greet people as he went
1	herr permaneder moved into meng strasse and dined the following day with thomas buddenbrook and his wife ; the next day , a thursday , he became acquainted with justus kröger and his wife , with the ladies buddenbrook from breite strasse , who found him dradfully funny—they said dradfully—and with sesame weichbrodt , who was rather stern with him , as well as with poor klothilde and little erika , whom he gave a sack of horehound , by which he meant candy
1	his regal face , encircled by white flames , was flushed , and little beads of moisture stood out on his brow and upper lip
1	it seemed everything to him , in fact , except how it really was—always presuming , of course , that time is part of nature and that it is therefore permissible to see it in conjunction with reality
1	in brief , it is true that i visit him , that he visits me , that we take our strolls together
1	the undersigned wish to make the following statement :
1	i know that your father has had some rather painful losses—due , as we all are aware , to your brother , justus
1	but when i recall the grotesque anecdote of how those two saviors of european civilization , the german and the italian ( and both
1	well , fare thee well and much obliged , the one said to the other in a deep , guttural voice ; he now switched his axe to his other shoulder and began to stride down toward the valley , his steps cracking loudly as he forged a path through the pines
1	his own tray would be brought in
1	this then , in passing , is a description of nepo schneidewein , of
1	you can ’ t imagine what it means to grow old , he said
1	poor klothilde came—gray , patient , and gaunt—paid no attention to the teasing , and drank four cups of coffee , offering words of praise for everything in her usual amiable drawl
1	and all the while his old disorder—the one that dr grabow had diagnosed as pavor nocturnus—continued—indeed , grew worse
1	she had not been listening , not outside , not at the door , truly she hadn ’ t
1	was it a struggle with death ?
1	the breadbasket was trimmed with pearl embroidery , the handiwork of meta , who was sitting beside her mother , a polite little eight-year-old in a plaid frock and with flaxen hair tied up in a stiff pigtail
1	of a freelance career
1	he might be acquitted in a large city , perhaps
1	he grew—despite miserable weather , despite wind and fog—grew up , one might say , in his yellow mackintosh , and on the whole was a quite cheerful lad
1	the renaissance as the origin of the deification of the state ?
1	as for me , you know , i love freedom above all else—especially the freedom to choose my place of residence
1	i feel i can speak openly to you
1	yes , there you sit offering me your condescending advice , the wretched man replied , and have no idea how much insult there is in your consolation , that you only humiliate me all the more with it
1	i was sure he would treat them more or less the way he had treated his winfried brothers in halle , but when i remarked how pleased i was that he had quickly made some good connections in leipzig , he simply replied , well , connections
1	i don ’ t want it
1	he passed away last night , the consul said with emotion and grasped the hand in which his brother was holding an umbrella
1	do it in just the same way , he commanded , and signaled for hans castorp to replace him
1	he rolled over now so that he was lying close beside her on his stomach ; and , propping himself on his elbows , he took one of her hands in his , and his kindly steel-blue eyes gazed deep into hers with rapturous fervor
1	i simply ca not help it , adrian , believe me , you must believe me !
1	well , the man was capable of devoting one entire hour to the question , why did not beethoven write a third movement for his last piano sonata , opus i i i ? -a topic worth discussing , without doubt
1	; one finds frequent use of suspension , if only as a rhythmic device , melodic chromaticism , fearful collective silence at the start of a phrase , repetitions like those in the lasciatemi , the drawing-out of syllables , falling intervals , fading declamation-amid enormous contrast effects like the tragic entrance of the choir , a cappella and at full voice , that immediately follows faust 's descent into hell ( itself an orchestral piece of grand ballet music , a galop of fantastic rhythmic variety ) and is an overwhelming eruption of lamentation after an orgy of infernal gaiety
1	seated among the germans and swiss were bearded , elegant russians , looking barbarically rich , and dutchmen with traces of malayan blood—all intermixed with a sprinkling of indeterminate sorts who spoke french and came from the balkans or the levant , a motley set of adventurers for whom hans castorp had a certain weakness but whom joachim spurned as dubious and lacking in character
1	how are you feeling , hanno ?
1	nothing , the pianist answered with a quick shake of his head , a gesture that looked more as if he were shooing a fly
1	i have a legal right to lie here and dream such things
1	ida asked , and frau permaneder came closer , too , trying to understand his troubled muttering and stammering
1	and the director had followed schiller in calling nature god and innate talents the merits of god on our behalf , which we were to bear in humility
1	did you think : i ’ ll marry my stüwing because i love her , and hang the practical considerations—those are nothing but petty , philistine details ’ ?
1	that was what he found truly unbearable , the way the lieutenant avoided him completely , refusing almost every official invitation and preferring instead the easy and private company of his wife
1	madame antonie is simply more vivacious , he went on , suddenly striking a lighter tone
1	fine , my dear friend
1	and shall i now say that for me personally , as loath as i was , as always , to leave adrian 's side , the departure from the manardi house was likewise bound up with a certain secret sense of relief ?
1	december passed , and then , early in january of ’ , the wedding took place
1	it doesn ’ t really fit the rest , does it ?
1	go on , i shouted
1	consul buddenbrook was deeply moved
1	but it was what they now sang to each other , or at times with one another , concerning this situation , interrupted now and then by the muffled tones of the ceremonies several stories above—it was this exchange of song that deeply stirred the soul of the lonely , nocturnal listener , both in regard to the situation and its musical expression
1	he cheerfully showed his lodgings to his young friends , called them private and cozy , thereby supplying them with the right words by which they could then praise his quarters—which they did in unison
1	it ’ s really very awful
1	damn if i ’ m not more tired and flushed than i ’ ve ever been
1	more or less , the italian said curtly , turning his head away and swinging his cane
1	in two or three hasty , soundless , powerful moves , the bier was on their shoulders , and before anyone had time to realize the shock of the moment , the flower-covered casket swayed through the room at a steady , deliberate pace and vanished into the columned hall
1	like most of the guests , they were shaving fifteen minutes from the main rest cure by lingering over coffee and cognac
1	then we ’ ll have a little bankruptcy , a very funny little bankruptcy , my friend
1	shivering and dizzy , he would be overcome with a kind of numb intoxication that left his head flushed and hot
1	not everyone offered her the opportunity
1	and yet , in its way it ’ s an apt expression , seems to me
1	damn , but he had felt the surge of his own energy , and as the energy , so the ideal , to quote feuerbach
1	the tendency toward musical prose reaches its height in the string quartet , perhaps leverkiihn 's most esoteric work , which followed on the heels of the ensemble piece
1	and in any case , one was just either on the basis of one given standpoint or on the basis of the other
1	'because you wo not amount to much , hallelujah !
1	oh , oh , enough , all so undeserved—what a bliss of light , of deep pure sky , of sun-drenched water
1	let no one think i am poking fun !
1	all of you want nothing to do with one another
1	he pushed on , moving ever higher , skyward
1	when the senate met to divide committee assignments among its members , taxation was designated as his primary responsibility
1	if there are things to be discussed , you should have informed me
1	never had he been so happy as at that moment
1	i ’ m speaking in general
1	he had even been given a nod of approval
1	they exchanged a few remarks about its new director , and when consul hagenström declared him to be an absolutely honest fellow for the second time , the senator fell silent
1	i turn about , thrust the bench aside with my knee , and stride back across the carpet , through this hell-hole of lusts , past the vaunting bawdstrot , through the entry , and down the stairs into the street , never touching the rail of brass
1	it was an explosion , an eruption of honest despair , and it burst from her like some elemental force that brooked no opposition , for which there was no rebuttal
1	certainly he had seen me board , but he avoided my glance
1	after everything i previously indicated , indeed explicitly stated about inez 's emotional life , i shall leave it to the reader to imagine the tangled resentments , the embarrassment and shame she felt when observing such dalliances
1	these words , which leverkiihn has his testa , his witness and narrator , proclaim in a ghostly melody moving in steps of pure fourths and diminished fifths and resting atop stationary unrelated harmonies , words that then form the text of the daringly archaic responsory repeated in unforgettable fashion by two four-part choirs moving against one another-these words do not belong to the apocalypse of john at all ; they come from a different layer , from the prophecy of babylonian exile , the stories and lamentations of ezekiel , to which , moreover , that mysterious epistle from patmos , written in the days of nero , stands in very curiously dependent relation
1	he sat huddled in his caped coat , smoking cigarettes and joining in the conversation only to comment on this particular topic
1	and that is mutual , i hope ?
1	what an absurd want of fashion !
1	no doubt of it , johann buddenbrook was also nearing his end
1	in meadows wide alone i stand , he managed , and then it was most definitely over
1	the buddenbrooks were certainly not the only guests
1	he rolled his eyes and his head fell back hard on the wood
1	naturally , the first person to offer his congratulations on the morning of july was herr wenzel
1	hans castorp was silent
1	settembrini , of course , had no objections to any of it ; but ferge as his second and hans castorp as the neutral party were beside themselves , and the latter even turned abusive with wretched wehsal
1	and with a laugh that betrayed his confusion and excitement at having arrived and seeing his cousin again , hans castorp lifted out his valise and winter coat , his plaid blanket roll plus cane and umbrella , and finally ocean steamships
1	over the years , old herr marcus ’ s meticulous , fussy habits had gone beyond eccentricity—they were a mania
1	don ’ t laugh—that ’ s not a joke
1	do you think she ’ ll be happy with him ?
1	and as he was pulled back into the then and there , time and space were abrogated—so intensely , so totally , that one might have thought a lifeless body lay there on the bench beside the torrent , while the real hans castorp was moving about in an earlier time , in different surroundings , confronted by a situation that , for all its simplicity , he found both fraught with risk and filled with intoxication
1	it is beyond dispute , and i thank a friendship that brought me great sorrow and dismay , but always filled me with pride , for the insight : genius is a form of the life force that is deeply versed in illness , that both draws creatively from it and creates through it
1	the consul , however , was cold , was constantly freezing although his head was hot ; and he stopped to consider that if the head nurse had offered him a thermometer , he would have refused it , and yet it would not have been the right thing to do somehow , since it would be impolite to use someone else ’ s , his nephew ’ s for example
1	how could they justify leaving people in such uncertainty ?
1	herr permaneder , whose green hat with its chamois tuft had slipped down over his forehead , stood beside her and joined her in cultivating the bed with his deerhorn cane
1	the director asked , suddenly grasping the young man ’ s hand and gazing down at him from his blue , bloodshot , protruding eyes with their white lashes
1	and what are these primitives cheering about—can you explain that to me ?
1	it could not be expressed more
1	it only made new demands of his heart , and he would be preoccupied and tense all through the lecture
1	so he was demanding that society ’ s unlucky victims should feel terribly guilty and enter the bloody arena out of personal conviction , was that it ?
1	it doesn ’ t do that for our conscious minds , we simply assume it does , just for the sake of convenience
1	she is furious , outraged to the depths of her soul ; her voice is all betrayal and injured love—or she makes it sound that way
1	we measure on a grand scale—it is one of the privileges of shades
1	i ’ m very sorry , he would reply , oh , worthy friend , uomo non educato dal dolore riman sempre bambino !
1	hanno ’ s upper body slowly straightened up , his eyes grew large , his tightly closed lips quivered , he jerked back , drawing air in through his nose—and then that blessedness could be held back no longer
1	instead , obstinately baring her rabbit ’ s teeth , she attempted by way of allusion and innuendo to get to the bottom of the relationship of these three young people , only one part of which was clear to her : that poor karen , as she remarked , could not help enjoying the high life chaperoned by two such smart young cavaliers
1	where work and sincerity no longer agree , how is one to work ?
1	it was much more difficult , however , to maintain command of himself when he sat quietly , doing nothing
1	there is a form of depression in which everything that would normally annoy us and arouse a healthy response of anger , weighs down upon us instead , eliciting only dull , gloomy silence
1	severe migraine attacks kept him in darkness ; he was beset with alternating catarrhs of the stomach , bronchi , and throat throughout the winter of , and they alone would have sufficed to prevent him from traveling to frankfurt-just as they caused his doctor categorically to forbid a far more urgent journey , one that was indisputably and palpably necessary in human terms
1	but that idea suited me better than him
1	there was a fluttery , drolly confused quality to her mind that could evoke even her own heartiest laughter-not at all the laugh of a leo zink ingratiating himself by self-mockery , but rather that of a quite pure heart disposed to mirth
1	the man who offered them to her was a young alsatian industrialist whom business brought to pforzheim from strasbourg on occasion and who , upon making her acquaintance within a large circle of friends , had fallen desperately in love with this mocking , shapely blond
1	his heart was inert , seemed not to be beating at all
1	because they are now headed back down into the dark , maybe ?
1	they promptly agreed , and they took their leave of frau permaneder for the present , saying that they hoped to have the pleasure of seeing her again before they departed
1	ladies and gentlemen—excruciating , heart-wrenching
1	once the ladies and gentlemen have made themselves comfortable in the sitting room and the salon , it will not be long before all these splendid things will be passed around , and one hopes there will be enough , since the whole family has gathered , though not the extended family , because through the oeverdiecks there is a distant relationship to the kistenmakers , and through them to the möllendorpfs and so on
1	he was the other person to whom lukaček , the ladies ’ tailor , had sublet rooms
1	and expressed his best wishes for their metabolisms
1	gentlemen— , the dutchman said , raising his lance-nailed captain ’ s hand in a gesture that both implored and commanded
1	this left the impression that she had rushed here straight from munich , all in one breath—and now here she lay , exhausted but safe , her flight over
1	it would surely have been childish to think that the engineering sciences and the laws of mechanics had been applied to organic nature , any more than one could say that they had been derived from it
1	it was not his normal bedtime , he told himself , and then , of course , he had napped too often during the day
1	he did not , we repeat , let it alter his honestly deferential , if at times slightly brash sympathy for a man of stature—simply because that man shared traveling expenses with a lady from whom hans castorp had borrowed a pencil on mardi gras evening
1	snow , joachim ’ s voice said from behind the glass partition
1	little fräulein weichbrodt had clever and piercing brown eyes , a gently arching nose , and thin lips that she could press together with great determination
1	rudiger had introduced the schlaginhaufens to adrian as well , who , as a monosyllabic stranger , now had superficial , uneventful encounters with eminent painters already elevated to the nobility , with the wagnerian heroine tanya orlanda , likewise with felix mottl , with ladies of the bavarian court , with schiller 's great-grandson , herr von gleichen-russwurm , who wrote books on cultural history , and with writers who wrote nothing at all , but spent themselves entertaining society with literary small talk
1	true , it has grown quite dark
1	that is … no , i don ’ t really know , my child
1	they all laughed , and before the humanist could fly off the handle , hans castorp quickly told about a thrashing he had once received—a punishment still administered sometimes in the lower grades of his high school , where there had been riding crops in every room ; and although social disparities had prevented teachers from laying a hand on him , he had once been thrashed by a bigger classmate , a lout of a fellow , who had applied the supple switch to his thighs and calves , right through his thin stockings , and it had hurt something awful , he would never forget , it had been beastly , almost mystical , and to his shame he had heaved great sobs and hot tears of rage and agony had flowed—and here hans castorp begged herr wehsal ’ s pardon for using the obscure word wehsal for agony
1	his name was wiedemann , a christian name—nothing unclean about his name
1	i am thoroughly convinced that it has something to do with this damned flushed face of mine—it ’ s been bothering me again ever since i got up
1	but let me tell you right off : a case like yours is not healed just like that
1	it is rather contrariwise
1	she loved to receive visitors in the brown silk salon and decided to make no exception in her father ’ s case , for although the exact nature of the current situation was unclear to her , she had a keen and solemn sense of its importance
1	she also chatted long hours away recalling their days together at boarding school , their bedtime conversations , armgard von schilling in mecklenburg , and eva ewers in munich
1	i was merely quoting a passage from the masterpiece of your national literature
1	respectable civilian , i could tell right off
1	i assume what we have here is a mixture of animal and vegetable material—good stuff , indeed , the best , since it must pack one thundering wallop
1	the feeling is not mutual , she said , her eyes still fixed on herr grünlich ’ s chest ; and , having shot her poisoned dart , she left him standing there , simply walked on , her head set back and flushed with pride at her sarcastic rhetorical powers ; but upon returning home , she learned that herr grünlich had been invited to share a veal roast the next sunday
1	the time still given him to read , to quote , to drink red wine and idle about-we did not sell him that , it is naught but time made congenial
1	he ’ s the son of my mother ’ s half—
1	a little exercise would do me a great deal of good
1	after that , i didn ’ t really do much of anything , just lay low
1	and if the stimulus is very strong , the hair follicles become erect , too—and your hair stands on end , on your head and all over your body , like a porcupine defending itself
1	all such therapies , however , are a matter of blind chance , employed more or less just in case they might have some effect , but with no certainty that there is any value , point , or purpose in them
1	instead of being intellectually enriched and morally strengthened by his experience , may he not perhaps find that his knowledge of the disease becomes clouded and confused ?
1	you know all , he repeated , letting go of her hand and pushing his chair back a little
1	crazy kid he was , crazy fellow
1	he had never taken certain of his cousin ’ s resolves all that seriously—at least not as long as they remained pronouncements
1	witness or neutral party , in any case he would have a chance to influence decisions about the modalities , which proved sorely necessary
1	i never found it all that natural , even if i ’ m not a homo humanus
1	culture had been free , had stood at an admirable pinnacle , and if it had long since grown accustomed to being totally irrelevant to the state , its younger repres-entatives wished to regard the great national war that had now broken out as the means for breaking through to a new form of life in which state and culture would be one
1	and finally , you ’ ll need to have more money sent , too
1	leave that to me , peeperkorn replied , and the rest is merely a matter of practice and habit
1	she can sit however she likes , she ’ ll always be tony buddenbrook
1	best wishes for a continued pleasant stay
1	well , yes—proselytizer , fisher of souls
1	armgard ’ s noble status made the granddaughter of the stylish lebrecht kröger flush with admiration ; but secretly she sometimes thought that that splendid syllable von would actually suit her far better—because , good heavens , armgard hadn ’ t the vaguest how lucky she was
1	it was the third day after a quartan attack ; mynheer let it be known he wished to take advantage of the fact
1	what else should i tell you ?
1	in brief , bethsy , i can only sincerely wish that this marriage take place , to the benefit of both our family and the firm
1	he wanted to move on , but farther than just an hour 's train ride in the direction of the mountains
1	that was a long time ago
1	and pretty things they are !
1	he graduated with honors and , true to his resolve , exchanged the life of a boarding-school pupil for that of a novice in nearby tisis—a life of service and humility , of silent subordination and religious training , from which he wrested intellectual pleasures congruent with his earlier wild fantasies
1	but among the solid , honest , and respectable citizens were many who shook their heads and said , peculiar , the way she dresses , and her hair , her posture , that face
1	what a sad figure you cut , let me assure you
1	the gentlemen smoked their cigars as they strode down the wide staircase with its openwork railing of white-enameled wood
1	everything ended in dictatorship , in violence , in any case ; for with the demolition of traditional forms of government and society by the french revolution , an age had dawned that-consciously or not , admittedly or not-was moving toward despotic tyranny over atomized , disconnected masses leveled to a common denominator and as powerless as the individual
1	one day he said , jean—enough , don ’ t you think ?
1	her breasts , which were not voluptuous and highset like marusya ’ s , but the small breasts of a young girl , were pressed together from both sides
1	and continuing the treatments , adrian returned on the next three days as well ; then dr erasmi ordered a three-day pause and asked him to return on day four
1	but the next day , of course , he had been more dead than alive
1	i woul_d certainly not get caught up in detailed reminiscences of this bucolic childhood world , this simple setting of field and wood , pond and hill , if it were not the very world-parental home and native landscape-that enfolded adrian 's early years ( until he turned ten ) and brought the two of us together so often
1	he found a long list of lieder , too , sung to piano accompaniment by artists from the great opera houses—both those composed out of conscious , sublime , personal art , and simple folk songs , plus those that fell somewhere in the middle , as it were , which were products of the intellect and yet written with a genuinely profound , devout understanding of a given national spirit—artistic folk songs , if one may put it that way , with no implication of compromised sincerity in the word artistic
1	but why feed his remorse-if remorse it was that spoke in his words , in his demeanor ?
1	i bowed to inez institoris
1	and in general , those parts of this book dealing with music theory are indebted in many details to schoenberg 's theory of harmony
1	they discussed the communal gift that , following an old institutional custom , would be presented to director behrens on christmas eve and for which a collection was being started
1	not-or not only-because upon his return from the tour of switzerland , adrian had told me , together with other things , about his meeting with marie and had given me a description of her person that included , as a casual observation , the resemblance of her voice to his mother's-along with
1	naphta , he continued , was certainly just as much a revolutionary as herr settembrini , but in a defensive , reactionary sense—he was a revolutionary of reaction
1	and is herr mantelsack the man to inspire fear like that ?
1	she reached her hand out to him and laid her head on her shoulder
1	in short , we all , without exception , did some intensive work there
1	tony caught his look as she got up , but she wasn ’ t embarrassed in the least
1	the sun was gone , and there was an almost inhospitable chill in the air
1	i shall mum it all down on this music paper here , while my fellow in eremo , with whom i laugh , drudges some distance off in our chamber , translating the alien he dotes upon into the homely he detests
1	to be honest , we are not really bothered about leaving the question open
1	it had taken one whole hour to cross a little meadow
1	he began to say his good-byes
1	whereas kafka claimed that salzmann demanded his patients drink the vine ’ s gladdening gift in such quantities—likewise with a view to rounding off their bills—that people were dying like flies , and not of phthisis , but of cirrhosis
1	across his knees was an object , the souvenir that had frightened his uncle the day he had picked it up off his nephew ’ s chest of drawers : the glass negative that revealed the portrait of clavdia chauchat ’ s interior and that he , hans castorp , had most definitely not brought into the room
1	but i knew or feared that his till tomorrow would not hold , but that after my departure he would set to work again and finish what had come over him all unbidden during our conversation-and follow it up with two luminol tablets that would have to give his slumber some depth to compensate for its brevity , only to begin anew at dawn
1	but do l-as a man who can speak of an early , significant infatuation of head and heart with adrian 's cool and enigmatically self-contained existence-do i have the least right to mock the fascination that his solitary , nonconforming way of life had on these women ?
1	what people called thomas buddenbrook ’ s vanity—the attention he devoted to how he looked , the luxurious fastidiousness with which he dressed—was in reality something fundamentally different
1	you see , i ’ ve never met a perfectly healthy person before
1	madame kethelsen wept silent , bitter tears , although she could hear almost nothing
1	and , good heavens , was it not love as well-or what was it , what obsession , what act of will recklessly tempting god , what impulse to incorporate the punishment in the sin , or finally , what most deeply secreted desire to receive and conceive the demonic , to unleash a deadly chemical change within his own body was it-that caused him , though warned , to spurn the warning and insist on possessing that flesh ?
1	the day before yesterday , the niederpaurs had a dinner party , which was absolutely lovely , although i couldn ’ t always follow the conversation and i found the tone rather équivoque at times
1	he had , by the way , only imagined that his fever came from his cold—the objective findings were as usual
1	settembrini replied , i shoot in whatever direction i choose
1	he attended artists ' balls with schildknapp , and there in the illusory twilight of a stylishly decorated hall , he would again encounter the members of the rodde circle-the young actors , the knoterichs , dr kranich , zink and spengler , the daughters of the house themselves ; he might be sitting at a table with clarissa and inez , along with rudiger , spengler , and kranich , perhaps even with jeannette scheurl , when schwerdtfeger-dressed as a peasant lad or in the costume of a fifteenth-century florentine that showed off his pretty legs and lent him more than a little resemblance to botticelli 's portrait of a young man in a red cap-would approach and , caught up in the gala mood , totally forgetting for the moment any need to elevate his mind , and just to be nice , would fetch the rodde girls to dance
1	but hurry now , otherwise you won ’ t get a hot meal
1	seated at the good russian table was a quite elegant provincial lady from minsk , still young and only slightly ill—she had been sentenced to three months , no more—who one day went down into town to shop for french blouses
1	but this delicate , quiet symmetry did anything but calm him—it annoyed and offended him
1	he suffered from occasional hemorrhaging of the lungs and always spoke in an ironic tone of voice , because he considered himself as clever as he was sickly
1	but i feel sorriest for tony
1	because things were not quite as proper as they should have been four years ago ?
1	he gave me his hand first , he declared when he looked up and saw me
1	but that is why the ear 's judgment of what is right and false is directly and irrefutably tied to it , to this one chord that is not false in itself , quite apart from any abstract reference to the general technical niveau
1	and what was probably a weakly illumined cloud clung to a cliff , motionless , like an elongated tatter of smoke
1	ah , that was like the proverbial patient who keeps shifting in bed , hoping each new position will bring relief
1	well , you see , hans castorp said
1	and yet he felt some sympathy for the melancholy fate of his clairvoyant great-aunt
1	and what in the world does that have to do with politics or the lack thereof ?
1	it ’ s sniffles , director behrens , hans castorp replied
1	i had not expected him to meet me at the train station , had not even notified him of my exact time of arrival
1	but now you are advocating an economic system whose morality deprives the individual of freedom and dignity
1	i don ’ t think you have any justification for that remark
1	he repeated it with a snort , bent forward , began to shake , to gasp for air , and could no longer contain himself
1	but adrian 's illness was one of those serious cases that tended to immobilize rudiger 's charm-indeed we know that any sense of his being urgently needed resulted in his being perversely sparing of himself
1	conductor to try out the works of young composers ( but with the public excluded and only musicians present ) in order to give them the opportunity to hear their creations , gain experience , and school the imagination on the reality of its sound
1	he had her repeat the name and spell it for him before he actually grasped it
1	your eyes , his mentor said , try in vain to conceal that you know how things stand with you
1	the mistress of the house watched her guest take the first bite
1	youth in search of light would never be won over by that kind of fanaticism
1	they often dropped by to spend fifteen minutes with anton karlovitch ferge
1	then he drew a long breath , raised his arms shoulder-high , and let them drop to his sides again
1	he would intentionally bring unfinished work to kretzschmar in order to be told what he already knew on his ownin order then to make fun of the artistic sense of his teacher , which corresponded , in fact , to his own : the artistic sense ( with the emphasis on the second word ) that is the real agent of the work-idea ( not the idea of a work , but the idea that is the opus itself , the objective and harmonic structure at rest within itself ) , the true manager of its unity and organic wholeness , plastering over cracks , plugging holes , establishing the
1	you see , when it comes to death , when one speaks to the dead or about them , latin comes into its own
1	he would hear his cousin get up from his lounge chair and walk back into the room with dr krokowski , presumably to show him his fever chart ; and then the conversation might continue a while longer , to judge from the delay before the assistant appeared at joachim ’ s door by way of the hall
1	for although i was two years older
1	she was never as stunning as you , but there was a time—i was already a young girl—when she was a truly beautiful woman
1	and yet , for all that , the accomplishments of protoplasm remained quite inexplicable—it seemed that life was prohibited from understanding itself
1	and then , as a matter of course , christian began to disregard the constraint of office hours , to appear later and later each morning , puffing on his after-breakfast cigarette , before finally starting his preparations for work ; he would then go to the club for his midday meal and not return until rather late , sometimes not before evening , sometimes not at all
1	they are satisfied with her lung
1	nothing is truer than that in the fugue beethoven never achieved the technical assurance , skill , or ease that mozart commanded
1	the sound of cowbells drew him on and he found the herd , too ; they were grazing near a wooden hut , whose roof was weighed down with stones
1	hans castorp interrupted quickly , staring at him with large blue eyes , the whites broken with bloodshot veins
1	the consul experienced life here , gathered impressions—and we do not wish to spy on him any further
1	luise ziemssen was a brave woman
1	and suddenly the trembling , hasty , furtive voice of benthien the clothier floated out over the assembly : gentlemen , gentlemen
1	and i will assert that an untruth of the sort that enhances energy is a match for every unprofitably virtuous truth
1	there was shock and sadness in his eyes , but he pressed his lips together hard , creating folds along his cheeks and at the corners of his mouth , an expression he usually reserved for the completion of a profitable business deal
1	possessed him entirely , and for him there was no longer any doubt that he was indeed a victim of the devil
1	a stylized golden ear of grain twined its way among the portraits , and at the bottom , likewise in gilt letters , the years and stood side by impressive side
1	what happened to me ?
1	each item was offered twice—and not without good effect
1	frau schweigestill finished this tale as they descended the stairs again and stepped out into the courtyard to have a look at the stalls as well
1	so goes it-though leo zink , the faunus ficarius , has still scaped it yet , but the spruce and prudent spengler was snatched right early
1	life , young man , is a woman , a woman sprawled before us , with close-pressed bulging breasts and a great , soft belly between those broad hips , with slender arms and swelling thighs , with eyes half-closed in mocking defiance , demanding our most urgent response , the proof or collapse of our resilient manly desire—collapse , young man , do you understand what that means ?
1	far more characteristic of this psychological situation , however , so schleppfuss suggested , was the restraint imposed upon another young man of that same era , for it had come upon him through no fault of his own , but through female sorcery , and the means by which he had rid himself of it proved quite tragic
1	can it be your manchester eyes have failed to notice the existence of a social theory that promises the victory of man over economics , a social theory whose principles and goals coincide exactly with those of the christian city of god ?
1	to be frank , tom , it ’ s my most fervent wish
1	you spoke of a course of practical activity on which you intended to embark shortly
1	it is going to live … and thinking that it and i are separate instead of one and the same—that is the illusion that death will set right
1	i was glad to be on hand to provide adrian protection
1	but of course , to be sure , his uncle hastened to reply , losing control of his lower jaw ; he now explained that he could stay only eight days , or rather , just a week , seven days actually , perhaps even only six
1	if one of fräulein weichbrodt ’ s charges played a joke on someone , she would laugh aloud in her amiable way , so heartily that it almost sounded like a wail , until sesame would rap insistently on the table and cry , nelly ! —though it sounded more like nally ! —intimidating her into silence
1	because he loved everything about the theater : the smell of gas lamps , the seats , the musicians , even the curtain
1	he enjoyed-and could spend hours-making clear to his pupil the influence the french had had on the russians , the italians on the germans , the germans on the french
1	we shall ask dr ting-fu from our table
1	but at the same time his eyes , seeking out the distance , registered a special look , and the dusk of their metallic flecks would retreat deeper into shadow
1	both wine and coffee , hans castorp heard him say , were good for fever—quite apart from their regaling effect , they were very good for his intermittent attacks of tropical fever , one of which kept him bedfast in his room for several hours the second day after his arrival
1	the chaldeans already knew about it , too—the chaldeans , if you please , that ancient tribe of semitic or arabic magicians , highly trained astrologists and diviners
1	hermetic ’ —i ’ ve always liked that word
1	yes , yes , tony , my child , came ida ’ s voice
1	his accompanying letter did not exactly reveal the strong , unshakeable faithfulness of the love he felt for her
1	certainly , she replied , there were satisfactions , although it was very difficult
1	he himself had it on the best authority that it came from neighboring planets enveloped in a much more favorable atmosphere containing lots of methane and ammonia-like jupiter , mars , or venus
1	herr köppen flung himself in exhaustion onto one of the hard chairs that lined the walls of the wide , bare , severe-looking room
1	he himself chooses not to do it
1	there is no earthly point in a contest where one of the competitors possesses supernatural powers
1	my cousin ’ s profession makes it quite inappropriate for him to concern himself with politics , and i voluntarily forgo the pleasure—don ’ t understand a thing about it
1	it is not just that you are weak-willed—you never fail to excuse your weakness and justify it
1	whether due to his general bent for paradox or out of courtesy , he called hegel a catholic thinker ; and in response to the priest ’ s smiling question about the basis for this comment , inasmuch as hegel was actually the state philosopher of prussia and generally considered a protestant , leo had replied : the very term state philosopher confirmed he was correct in pointing to hegel ’ s catholicity in the religious sense , if not , of course , in regard to church dogmatics
1	sometimes it was the bark of roots that had such qualities , like those of a vine on the malay peninsula called strychnos tieuté , with which the natives mixed snake venom to make upas-rajah , a drug that when introduced into the bloodstream , with a dart or arrow for instance , led to almost instant death , although there was no one who could have told young hans castorp how it actually did so
1	but given the singular statements that memory has just now dictated me to write , statements of what i might call a specific intensity , there can surely be no doubt about the fact to be communicated here
1	when he finished speaking , he did not open his eyes ; he remained just as he was—his head thrown back , his hands stretched out before him , still holding the little silver pencil—quivering and swaying there on his knees
1	you know i ’ ve always had a great liking for him
1	herr schwarzkopf ’ s sole reply was to raise his gray eyebrows very high and grab both arms of his chair in his tanned , hairy sailor ’ s hands
1	then he sat up , folded the telegram , slipped it in his breast pocket , and stood up to return to his guests
1	mynheer peeperkorn , an elderly dutchman , had for some time been a guest of the sanatorium berghof , which quite rightly appended the adjective international to its name
1	and mingling among them , the middle-class folk : shopkeepers from nearby , who have stepped out without a hat to exchange views ; young , well-dressed merchants ; sons , who are serving three- or four-year apprenticeships in offices run by their fathers or their fathers ’ friends ; schoolboys with bookbags and backpacks
1	suddenly she saw what looked like silk curtains parting , like the ones in her grandparents ’ salon
1	a new beginning , after that farewell ?
1	would you like me to introduce you to some patients now and then ?
1	it seemed no less absurd that she should marry herr grünlich than it had ten minutes before , but she was beginning to find considerable satisfaction in the importance of her position
1	it was to be a birthday present for a friend
1	the bell rang ; class was over
1	for he refrained from mentioning anything about the matter , just as joachim avoided the name of someone else who had departed for a while
1	whereby you could be quite sure that he had said the same thing there as here and wanted to leave everyone with the illusion that he most preferred to be with them-a $ if that simply had to be of greatest importance to each
1	he sat down on the counter , holding her hand in his , and went on : now , listen to me , anna
1	yet after spends its purest weal
1	it was clear that everyone took pains to dignify and honor sunday ; both management and residents supported one another in the effort
1	apart from their greeting that morning , he had not yet had an opportunity to speak with christian ; but he had watched him carefully during the festivities and noticed that he was unusually serious and uneasy , that in the course of pastor pringsheim ’ s homily he had inexplicably left the salon for several minutes
1	many thanks , deutschlin , adrian said , laughing
1	adrian most certainly did fling himself into those immeasurable realms that astrophysical science attempts to measure-only to arrive at measurements , numbers , orders of magnitude to which the human mind can no longer relate at all and that lose themselves in theory and abstraction , in the domain of the non-sensory , if not to say , nonsensical
1	your mama and i want to talk , you see
1	when you stop and consider , it is , after all , the true , genuine humanist form of art
1	yet these pious works were , at the same time , an end in themselves , and the satisfaction he found in feeding porridge to sickly frau mallinckrodt , in letting herr ferge describe his infernal pleural shock , or in seeing poor karen clap her hands with joy and gratitude , despite the bandaged fingertips , was not only of a vicarious and relative kind , but also genuine and immediate
1	then he turned around and left
1	children and grandchildren observe in order to admire , and they admire in order to learn and develop what heredity has stored within them
1	quite so , quite so
1	because this much was clear , that if one went about it the way he did , one could say some very stiff things without driving people from the room
1	the little glass was so full that the bread ran down on all sides and formed little puddles in his plate
1	certainly your parents lack for nothing , and no one could be more delighted by that than i they live life in splendid style—as their circumstances permit…
1	timm , would you stand in for him , please
1	but since that ’ s how things have turned out , i can only say it was a lucky thing i came up here and got myself examined
1	the servants are dividing things up right under my nose , because severin has the keys to all the cupboards
1	those standing around him were about to break into laughter once more , but adrian put a finger to his lips and shook his head at them
1	please continue , he said ; and it sounded as horrifying as if he had said , we shall see now , and woe to anyone who …
1	people who were only slightly ill did not count for much—he had often overheard conversations to that effect
1	and your journey , sir , to join us here was pleasant , i hope ?
1	can ’ t you give me some advice ?
1	the center of town was lively and crowded—it was saturday , market day
1	he did not wish to offend either side , he said , but apparently the subject had now turned to progress , to human progress , and so in a certain sense to politics , the republic of eloquence , the civilization of the educated west ; and in that regard he would like to say that the difference , or if herr naphta preferred , the opposition between life and religion could be traced to that between time and eternity
1	but do you not think , herr buddenbrook , that your son-in-law ’ s bankruptcy might not mistakenly tend to put your own situation in a bad light ?
1	i am inexperienced in that area , settembrini replied , but find myself in rather good company in that lack of experience
1	above all else , it is my duty—
1	after a lengthy conference with gerda buddenbrook , he had hanno brought in to conduct a thorough examination of his status praesens , as dr langhals called it , inspecting his own fingernails
1	bustle in the streets
1	socialism is at the gates !
1	during rest cure , the numbness in face and hands was much more painful than on sunny cold days
1	i have observed an aversion on your part to
1	and to think that it was the half-lung club !
1	but only later did this sort of art provide the illustrations for it
1	i wasn ’ t trying to tease you
1	it was kind of a biweekly thousand and one nights spun out at random , and , like scheherazade ’ s stories for a curious prince , each lecture was calculated to please its audience and prevent acts of violence
1	and then , after something was said about the current price of rye—fifty-five thalers and still falling , damn it—and perhaps a comment made about some event in the life of one of the town ’ s families , herr wenzel vanished down the ground-floor hall to empty his shiny shaving bowl out on the cobblestones , and the consul climbed back up the spiral stairs to his bedroom , where gerda was awake now
1	what were my very words to both you and him—not ten but a hundred times ?
1	he was breathing cautiously , as if he expected to smell that odor , that strange and yet so oddly familiar odor
1	we can ’ t let him be convicted
1	swhen i obey my goad 's behest ,
1	and thomas buddenbrook turned away
1	he stood there bent down over the table , but with his head held to one side so that everyone could see that he had his eyes closed , and drew blindly with a pencil on the back side of a calling card ; and without any help from his eyes , his massive hand traced an outline , the profile of a pig—more simplified and slightly idealized than realistic , but it was undoubtedly a rudimentary pig that he managed to assemble under such handicapped circumstances
1	rotten , rotten , she said
1	his father was a literary type himself , you know , and i believe the grandfather was , too
1	he spent nearly his whole day with her , engaging her in religious and secular conversation or reading aloud to her in his high , cracking voice that bumped along in the droll accents of his baltic homeland
1	conditions here were most beneficial for encouraging him , because people lived together in a restricted area and followed a rigid schedule mandatory for all
1	they hung up their coats and for the second time today they entered the dining hall , where the meal was in full swing
1	perhaps it can merely avoid doing damage by speaking along ritardando
1	i have those in my head , thomas said , leaning back , staring across to the landscape room and letting his yellow pencil sweep back and forth over the tabletop—and now he began to explain how matters stood
1	would you like to hear about it ?
1	this is no apparatus , no machine , he went on , extracting a needle from one of the colorful tin boxes set out on the table and screwing it into place , this is an instrument , this is a stradivarius , a guarneri—you ’ ll hear resonances and vibrations of vintage raffinemang
1	the reader will sense the irony intended , though truly without any malice , by my evidently , since there was in fact no evidence for such a conclusion-unless , that is , it had been present from the very beginning and the relationship between the two had undergone no development whatever since helmut first approached the senator 's daughter
1	it was clear that dr mantelsack was calling on people in no regular order whatever and did not care at all who had not been examined for some time
1	he just waved me aside
1	even massenet is bewitching , lui aussi
1	h ( which anglo-saxons call a b ) and ends on an es ( known in the english-speaking world as e-flat ) , with e and a alternating in between-a basic motif with an oddly melancholy sound that pervades his music in a variety of harmonic and rhythmic disguises , assigned now to one voice , now to another , often in its inverted form , as if turned on its axis , with the intervals still the same , but with the notes in reverse sequence
1	fine—and with that you have opened the door wide for every sort of crime
1	pale and trembling , he closed his eyes and sank into lethargy
1	he wore a dignified black pleated coat and pea-colored trousers , much like those he had worn for his first visit to meng strasse
1	that ’ s no reproach , tony , the consul said sternly
1	he asked with a laugh that was half annoyance
1	but , despite countless personal visits , she kept on writing frequent letters to him in pfeiffering in this same fashion
1	you know what you ’ re eating there
1	he evidently gave the matter no thought , but regarded this precious link in an invisible chain , which he placed on his finger when composing , as nothing more than the connection between his solitude and the world-which for him seemed faceless , with scarcely any personal definition , and concerning whose individual traits he apparently had far fewer questions than i was there , i asked myself , something in the external appearance of this woman that would explain the basic principle of her relationship with adrian : the invisibility , the avoidance , the refusal to meet ?
1	who was it that left just recently ?
1	can anyone understand what that means ?
1	herr settembrini had the honor of being a member
1	he trembled as he read and was profoundly stirred by the rigid , but impressive antitheses so evident from the pages of these documents : impeccable deportment on the one side and rascally , disreputable laxness on the other
1	it seems to me that the spiritual possibility of finding salvation in repose is widespread throughout all mankind
1	movement is the only thing that can help
1	just as he was leaving and crossing the corridor , he met his father and a gentleman in a long black coat coming up the stairs
1	oh , dear god , i ’ ll pray every day
1	he ’ s saying to himself , anyone !
1	and with that , the reluctant debtor had been outfoxed and at least that particular matter was settled
1	yes , he is , papa , he ’ s sitting in the pensée room , looking at our album
1	you ’ ve won yourself a place in life , a position of honor , and now you stand here , so cold and self-assured , and reject anything that might confuse you for even a moment and throw you off balance
1	it ’ s so strange—sometimes i ’ m certain it is going to go into spasms or some sort of paralysis , permanent paralysis
1	no , kesselmeyer , i implore you , just calm down and listen to me
1	adrian confessed that he always found something intelligently calming about baptist spengler and enjoyed talking with him-but he was much less susceptible to the confiding familiarity of another guest who attempted to break through his brittle shyness
1	i always envy you when i see you sitting there and working , and it really isn ’ t work for you
1	i was won over to her not only by the gentle night of her gaze ( to which i knew just how susceptible adrian was ) , by her charming smile , her musical voice , but also by her friendly and intelligent reserve , by the businesslike assurance , indeed standoffishness of an independent professional woman who disdained any sort of cooing femininity
1	interruptions—yes , the consul repeated with an obliging smile
1	the consul had been dead for two weeks now—it was half past five in the afternoon of the day on which the will was to be read
1	the various branches of this once rich , powerful , and proud family had withered , died , and rotted away , and little kai had only one aunt who was still alive—and his father was not on speaking terms with her
1	it ’ s quite irresponsible of him
1	my fondest greetings to papa , christian , clara , thilda , and ida jungmann
1	disdaining the bombast of numbers , he had originally intended to instrument the score for the classical orchestra of beethoven , and it was only for the sake of armado , the comically pompous spaniard , that he had included a second pair of horns , three trombones , and a bass tuba in his orchestra
1	frau stöhr in particular became wildly talkative , and her willful face , its cheeks lined with tiny wrinkles , turned scarlet above her ruffled collar
1	you ’ re a scandal to the whole town , and if this house were mine i would turn you out , i would show you the door !
1	isn ’ t everything going just fine ?
1	of course there are exceptions , fräulein tony , he said heatedly
1	i have learned how to bear the truth , believe me
1	even though they are dead , jonathan said , and tears came to his eyes-�hereas adrian , as i could well see , was shaking with suppressed laughter
1	the spirit demanded that he take on not just the role of poet and prophet , but of composer as well
1	and what else might be recorded here after her own name , given to her in honor of her grandmother antoinette ?
1	it ’ s all kept secret from me
1	madame grünlich did not miss the chance of telling this story at the dinner table that evening for all to hear , so that even elisabeth broke into her spluttering kröger laugh
1	the director had predicted it all , and it all happened as per regulation , with no deviations from the norm worth mentioning
1	frau permaneder loved these visits
1	the long , pointed tips of his mustache still extended beyond his cheeks , and they were fuller now—but pale and sallow , without blood or life
1	composing means commissioning the zapfensti : isser orchestra to perform an angelic chorus
1	i only have to keep an eye on my ward ’ s dowry , the rest is no concern of mine
1	only yesterday he had been totally caught up in his normal train of thought , preoccupied with what had just occurred , his exams , and with what was about to occur , his joining the firm of tunder and wilms ( dockyards , machine works , and boilers ) , and looking well beyond these next three weeks with as much impatience as his nature allowed
1	it is hard to say how such people actually first come to betray themselves ; they can not , it seems , do or refrain from doing anything that does not betray them—particularly ( as a certain gentleman who had no trouble forming opinions remarked ) in the company of people who have only two things in their heads : the first being their temperature , the second their temperature
1	there is no determining precisely when it was written , for the document bears no date
1	she led dr langhals into the next room , crossed her arms , and laid her head back , trying at the same time to press her chin against her chest
1	you and your loved ones can rent a pretty little house or an apartment somewhere outside the town gates , for instance
1	herr grünlich had pulled an armchair over near her window seat ; he sat down now , forcing her to take her seat again as well ; bending forward , he took her hand , limp with helplessness , in his own and continued in an impassioned voice , fräulein antonie , since that first moment , that first afternoon—you recall that afternoon , do you not ? —when there in the circle of your family i first saw you , an elegant , unimaginable vision of loveliness , your name has been written—he corrected himself—engraved on my heart in indelible letters
1	i ’ ve become quite convinced of it
1	nor do i batter her ears all that much with it , since at present i pursue harmony and the punctum contra punctum principally in theory , with books , pen , and paper and at my own devices , which is to say : under the oversight and discipline of amicus kretzschmar , to whom every few days i bear my exercises and works for censure or approval
1	but the headrest was adjustable , and behrens tried it for comfort , stretching out on it with his useless plate still under one arm ; pretending to be fafnir guarding his treasure , he began to snore like a sawmill
1	no one listened to him
1	midsummer night celebrations , with fires and dances around the leaping flames , everyone joining hands
1	at which point several more letters were exchanged concerning his plans , and in the summer of christian buddenbrook did indeed sail for valparaiso , where he had found a position
1	what does that matter ?
1	as a kind of identification , like a passport or membership card
1	and then all of a sudden they demanded that hans castorp immediately make an appointment to be examined
1	i ’ ve lost all hope
1	symptoms both in themselves and in those who compose back to the past
1	he conducted himself sensibly , cheerfully , even-temperedly ; whereas christian seemed moody , capable on the one hand of the silliest comedy and on the other of behavior so odd that it would terrify his entire family
1	really a bit too peculiar
1	attendant fatigue and a propensity to nausea ( accompanied by headache ) , is the reason for my reticence and worry-it will , it should induce me to abstain
1	the apocalypse abandons orchestral interludes , with the result that at more than one point the chorus takes on an amazingly explicit orchestral characteras in the choral variations that represent the hymn of the , redeemed who fill the heavens , where the nature of the chorale is preserved simply by having all four voices moving constantly to the same rhythm , while the orchestra accompanies or opposes them in the most richly contrasted rhythms
1	herr von maiboom needs money , he needs a great deal of money very soon
1	would it seem so absurd to you if you were to crown the honor you do me-l am tempted to say , for my salvation-through services of which posterity will perhaps know nothing , or again , perhaps it will , by acting as my mediator , as the interpreter between me and life , as my intercessor with fortune ?
1	a horrible incident at a meal one day , however , did make an impression on the young man
1	and none of the good citizens sitting near him on the heavy , carved wooden benches , drinking their pints , understood what the advent of a gerda arnoldsen meant in the modest life of gosch the broker , who longed for extraordinary events
1	no shouldering the wheel , no budging the cart , he wrote a few weeks later from the capital of bavaria , in a parody of kumpfian style that was his way of announcing that he had begun composition of love 's labour 's lost and of prodding me to bring the rest of the adaptation to a quick conclusion
1	let us assume , for example , that the symptoms of the incubation stage—moodiness , fatigue , lack of appetite , restless sleep , headaches—are usually present even when the patient , on whom his family pins all its hopes , is moving about in good health
1	returning home from wendell kretzschmar 's lecture , we had the feeling that we had heard the missa , and that illusion was not a little influenced by the picture he had impressed on our minds of the haggard and hungry master there in the doorframe
1	diederich schwarzkopf did not offer to shake hands ; he simply let his heavy frame jerk forward briefly , as if to say : that ’ s how it ’ s done
1	i am enchanted by the idyllic world with which you have been wise enough to surround yourself , maitre
1	i hope they will let me speak with her there
1	yes , we might note that there was much to discuss and share : about matter as a disreputable degeneration of the immaterial , about life as an impudency of matter , about illness as life ’ s lascivious form
1	and still intent on punishing him , fräulein engelhart claimed she was sure they were
1	oh , how hard and sad it all is
1	unfortunately , there is normally some sort of moral judgment involved in identifying traits of character , whether for the purpose of praise or censure , even though every such trait has its two sides
1	and besides , there ’ s something so cold , so disillusioning about a ring—it is a symbol of a woman ’ s dependence , it seems to me ; it makes a woman seem practically a nun , turns her into a wallflower , a touch-me-not
1	yes , jean , the first to leave us
1	my head is full of all kinds of ideas about time—a whole complex of thoughts , let me tell you
1	they were later permitted to admit their error in making this gloomy prophecy ; but no one could deny that hanno was somewhat backward in his development
1	isn ’ t her name tatyana ?
1	to which the consul , still drumming with this newspaper , replied , just eat
1	her resourcefulness in searching out hidden objects was greeted with much applause and admiring laughter , and that might have been the end of it ; but when she began guessing her complicated task , people slowly fell silent
1	up in his living room , there where i had heard inez 's agonized confessions , i told him , after first preparing him with a few words , what i had witnessed
1	which is to say , that adrian returned to that place on account of one particular person , the one whose touch still burned on his cheek , the nut-brown lass in the jacket and with the large mouth , who had approached him at the piano and whom he called esmeralda
1	hans castorp felt sincerely sorry for his cousin—you could read in his eyes his sadness at the impending loss of a human companion—but he pitied him most when he thought about how the poor fellow would have to stay on here without him , whereas he would be living down in the flatlands , hard at work in the service of transportation technology , which brought nations closer together
1	and let me tell you it ’ s quite an event for me
1	gentlemen , he said , one word more—my brother christian ’ s nerves are not good , he doesn ’ t handle these things well
1	should we jews-since we are a priestly people , even if we do mince about in parisian salons-not feel ourselves drawn to germanness and not allow that to dispose us to irony over against the
1	you know best yourself about all the things consul hagenström has done to try to eclipse you in business , to do you harm—it ’ s not for me to tell you about that
1	a game of carom , senator ?
1	thomas was back on meng strasse by the end of july , but , like other gentlemen whose business kept them in town , he visited his family at the shore several times
1	if only we had a bit of frost , a bit of snow
1	he no longer stares down the illness with a hostile eye ; he is a biased and hardly unequivocal foe
1	petersen called out in a fit of gallows humor
1	the effect was so overwhelming that hans castorp closed his eyes and whispered to himself , my god !
1	and what was it like for me ?
1	people smoked with gusto and in scattered groups discussed how the session was going
1	gesturing hospitably with his little right hand , he was trying to lead them to the silk-upholstered chairs , but hans castorp , as if spellbound , headed straight for the wooden sculpture and stopped in front of it , his hands on his hips and his head tilted to one side
1	more precisely , hans castorp had recognized her
1	oh , it was genuine , quite in character—that was the one good thing about it
1	is there a bank out there in the world somewhere , perhaps , that will put one thin dime on the table for you ?
1	except , there is the other side
1	hans castorp had his answer at the ready
1	i can only be grateful , you know , that my father , grandfather , and great-grandfather paved the way for me , and that a great deal of the trust and esteem they gained in this town have automatically fallen to me
1	her sex knows no pity or concern when staring at the horrors of passion , an elemental emotion with which the female is apparently much more familiar than the male , who is not at all at ease with it—and if she finds him in that state , she never fails to greet him with mockery and schadenfreude
1	i can ’ t say i ’ ve got him figured out after only today , but if we get together with him often enough , maybe we ’ ll both be able to
1	and so hans castorp decided to be on the alert and not to step aside if ellen brand should have further adventures
1	it has little to do with boldly scrambling about in the mountains , as opposed to lying calmly beside the sea
1	but here—well , i doubt if they ’ ll be interested up here
1	soon , then , there developed an intolerance of light and sound-more disquieting than his previous moodiness
1	therese weichbrodt was a well-read—indeed , almost learned—spinster , whose life was a series of small , earnest battles to maintain the faith of her childhood , her optimistic piety , and the conviction that she would one day be recompensed in the great beyond for her hard and lackluster life
1	of what i said to him about the significance of the day , the point of my coming , he obviously understood nothing
1	a man joined the ranks of berghof society , a thirty-year-old former businessman , who had wandered from sanatorium to sanatorium for years now with his fever
1	and then herr ansermet raised his baton and adrian heard his root-canal work-his sparkling impressionist nocturne , which he himself did not take seriously , had not taken seriously even as he wrote it , but which left him sitting on pins and needles at its critical performance
1	not with water , of course—it ’ s a wax doll
1	let me see , please , he said curtly
1	you draw your salary and never come to the office—although that ’ s not what exasperates me
1	and extending one long arm , he handed his stethoscope to dr krokowski , who stood up and grabbed it , so that he could perform his own little assistant ’ s post-examination on joachim
1	i thank you , young man , i thank you
1	laughing excitedly , lieutenant joachim burst in on his cousin , who was in the midst of his evening rest-cure duties
1	or they rowed across the trave to priwall , where they looked for amber
1	she was really very pretty , little tony buddenbrook was
1	but the very next day , his first monday up here as a visitor , brought another standard deviation from the routine—and that was one of the lectures dr krokowski gave in the dining hall every two weeks before the entire german-speaking , nonmoribund , adult population of the berghof
1	and in a case where an impenitent soul had violated the law , temporary merciless procedures were no less justifiable
1	the others , however , said not a word
1	as a friend , do you want me to spend the rest of my life in this hermit 's cell ?
1	yes , indeed , once the idea had occurred to him , it had ripened quickly to a wish that he hoped he might be able to realize for himself and his family , provided , of course , that herr gosch did not intend to make all too great a profit from the sale—ha ha
1	no doubt about it , he had meant something by that
1	for the beautiful word gave birth to the beautiful deed
1	it was quiet in the house and out on the street
1	what a mild bit of teasing was needed to induce ever-alert virtue to don its armor
1	there were no declined invitations-on the contrary , as i said , there were only additional requests for permission to participate
1	the focus of the group , she was sitting on the sofa behind the round table at the far end of the small salon , her face turned toward the game room
1	the large room sank more and more into twilight
1	twenty-eight sauces for fish
1	on another occasion they are sitting at supper and the rays of a brilliant sunset fall directly on the good russian table
1	we are inquiring , rather , about that experience ’ s moral character—and , to be frank , do not expect a very cheering answer
1	he turned serious , abruptly , surprisingly , as if a mask had fallen from his face
1	he saw that the enchantment was broken , that he was released , set free—not by his own actions , as he had to admit to his shame , but set free by elementary external forces , for whom his liberation was a very irrelevant matter
1	how kind of you , hans castorp said
1	your beatrice is returning ?
1	but at every possible opportunity he devoted himself energetically to his guest
1	his systematic eradication of suffering
1	but the more staid and settled folks should eat well at our table
1	and aloud he said , very fine , herr settembrini
1	with which he brought some pleasure to an end
1	first came an argument between radames and amneris
1	i will see to it that she does not suffer through no fault of her own
1	a long walk up here can be lovely , but it has its drawbacks , too , it seems
1	but in response to my consoling pleas , he simply said , spare yourself , spare yourself and make the sign of the cross !
1	they hung their coats on the stands outside the dining hall , and entered it , a bright , low-vaulted room , where voices buzzed , dishes clattered , and dining attendants scurried about with steaming pots of coffee
1	you can ’ t just walk up to him so calm and cool and
1	just a moment , thomas
1	and the place has one shortcoming , you know , it ’ s not soundproof—that is rather annoying
1	even when hans castorp left home to study , he regularly sent his things home to be laundered and mended—for it was his maxim that no one in the empire except residents of hamburg knew how to iron—and a badly creased cuff on one of his pretty pastel shirts filled him with a terrible unease
1	then they looked at one another and smiled , and since there was nothing more to say , they turned away , first shoulders , then backs , and walked off
1	using the occasion of music
1	morten spoke out of naïve and goodhearted outrage
1	analyzed and put into words , his feelings might have been expressed as follows : there was something religious , gripping , and sadly beautiful , which was to say , spiritual about death and at the same time something that was the direct opposite , something very material , physical , which one could not really describe as beautiful , or gripping , or religious , or even as sad
1	and the unspoken suspicion rose up in him that if she was ill—which she surely was , almost hopelessly ill , since she had been forced to come up here so often and for such long periods—her illness was , if not entirely , then at least in large part , of a moral nature , and was therefore , just as settembrini had said , not the cause or result of her carelessness but in fact identical with it
1	ah , how can anyone speak of a resemblance at this point ?
1	in all likelihood , i shall never get married , she said with some effort , because of the peppermint powder in her mouth
1	for after the failure of a certain plot to overthrow the state in turin , in which he had been involved both in word and deed , he very narrowly escaped prince metternich ’ s hirelings and spent the years of his banishment fighting and bleeding for a constitution in spain and the independence of the hellenic peoples
1	just where are you young folks headed ?
1	kumpf had accomplished his with good cheer and a healthy trust in god and now re-created it in plain german for us listeners
1	he pulled himself together , all the same , and quickly peered at hans castorp , who just had time to pull his own eyes away and gaze off vaguely into the air
1	hans castorp ’ s humiliating depression had been vanquished by the greetings he had exchanged with clavdia chauchat , and strictly speaking , the real basis of his present satisfaction was his awareness that it had been overcome
1	i had to laugh and literally winced when in this same connection the gentlemen suddenly turned to dentistry , and quite concretely , to adrian 's and my symbol of musical criticism , the dead tooth !
1	the upper parts of the lungs were brighter now , but the director was still not content
1	in his youth he was , as he told us in his peripatetic extemporizations , a radiantly enthusiastic student of our classical poetry and philosophy and boasted of having learned by heart all the more important works of schiller and goethe
1	he only received a letter from him , one that he refused to answer
1	he placed a scientific embargo on the child , held sessions with her in his analytical dungeon , and hypnotized her , so it was said , in an attempt to develop and train the possibilities slumbering inside her and to probe her previous psychic life
1	a large clod of din struck his shin—it certainly hurt , but how silly , it was nothing
1	that dark hair i mentioned half-covered the ears , and as i grew older slowly turned silver ; she wore it pulled back so tight that it shimmered and the part in it exposed white skin above her forehead
1	still in the grip of cold horror , foul scolding whispers still in his ears , he found himself lying in the snow , his head resting on one arm , his legs stretched out before him , his skis still on
1	one b l a z i n g august
1	raising her brows , she looked down now through her pince-nez—she had to use it for handiwork now , although she had no idea how to put it squarely in place—and fixed her eyes sternly on her needles , which flew and clattered softly at a bewildering tempo
1	anticipation , curiosity , joy , and apprehension all merged in my mind to become a profound excitement
1	there should be an end of privileges and arbitrary power
1	how i love the stormy surge of yearning that is its essential character , the romanticism of its tone-since , after all , it is handled with the strictest modern methods ; a thematic work , to be sure , but with such strong transformations that there are no true
1	general shrieks—and no one was willing to listen to any more
1	the nature of the forces they were about to study was such that they simply could not unfold in white light , could not become operative
1	it was a realm where clinical brightness and cleanliness held sway , everything done in white on white , the doors glistening with white enamel—even the one to dr krokowski ’ s reception room , to which one of the learned man ’ s calling cards had been tacked and which lay two steps lower than the hallway itself , so that the room behind the open door looked rather like a suite
1	you entered my room , it was dusk , and you turned on the light
1	decisions must be made—decisions of incalculable significance for the future happiness of europe , and your country will have to make them , they must come to fruition within its soul
1	it is at times hard to differentiate , you see
1	he had especially favorable words for the impression ursel 's fiance , now her husband , had made on him
1	he bent forward , shaking his head and addressing the empty air with great emphasis
1	they lived in the via torre argentina , near the teatro constanzi and the pantheon , three flights up , and had a landlady who prepared breakfast and a light supper
1	it was furnished so simply…
1	the polish affair of honor was everywhere studied with great passion , and people clenched their teeth when they discussed it
1	i spotted it at once
1	settembrini commanded with a scowl
1	how can he think up so many notes , left and right , all at once ?
1	a monumental work of lamentation like this one is , i say , by necessity an expressive work , a work of expression , and as such is a work of liberation in much the same way as the early music to which it is linked across the centuries sought to express liberation
1	he was hastening his own demise
1	but i took adrian 's look with me into battle-perhaps it was that look , and only ostensibly typhoid fever carried by lice , that brought me home to his side again so soon
1	as rollicking as in the prater
1	then she had got over it , had totally recovered , the doctors said—because she had wanted so much to marry , to live and to marry , and she had succeeded , had been completely cured , was perfectly healthy when she married her dear , robust husband , who had never given a thought to such a thing happening
1	the consul paced back and forth in the room , sighed , shook his head , gave a shrug
1	life really is more festive as a twosome , don ’ t you think , ziemssen , you sly old dog ?
1	it would depend on the universal unity behind all of music 's dimensions
1	but confronted with the statement that atoms were so small they were no longer small , one lost all sense of proportion , because no longer small was tantamount to immense ; and that last step to the atom ultimately proved , without exaggeration , to be a fateful one
1	she returned it meekly , then more meekly still , that is , lowered her eyes more and more , as her head slipped slowly toward her chest and shoulder
1	or to be more precise , it did not take three days , but only a few minutes of one of them to accomplish this
1	two weeks ago , i was two on the gaffky , a trifle , the best prospects
1	and it must be awkward to have people talking about you like this behind your back
1	a massive dose of musical knowledge-and his own excited participation in it-became part of his life in those days , only to come then for years to what at least appeared to be a total standstill
1	then she would straighten up and begin to moan ; she tossed back and forth , pushed and wrestled with her monitors , whispered hot babble in their ears , made a series of sidelong whiplash movements as if trying to fling something out of her , gnashed her teeth , and once even bit hans castorp ’ s sleeve
1	he has spoken rather ungraciously about that part of the press , he continued with a forced ironic smile that , for a moment at least , touched tony to the quick
1	and upon being summoned so politely and exotically , that lady joined the trio and clasped elly ’ s fragile wrists in both hands
1	since the seamstress had said something to him at the same moment , he had no chance to determine who the malefactor was
1	have you ever taken an ocean voyage , tenente—or you , my good engineer ?
1	if someone desired his agreeable company on a trip to a spa for a cure prescribed by the doctor , his refusal was all the more certain the clearer it became that the other party set store by his companionship
1	but i ’ m feeling older than i am these days
1	have we roused civilization ’ s pedagogic policeman to the point of drawing his sword ?
1	and he began to wait for seven minutes to pass
1	it all starts with the adoration of the marble statue of a boy-evidently by thorvaldsen-that has found its way to the ocean floor , he said , and that , against all prohibitions , she finds far too much to her liking
1	the cold doesn ’ t affect you , does it ?
1	hanno looked absolutely miserable , and kai was lost in thought
1	he thought about what grabow had said—there had been so much that he had left unsaid
1	but then they let their penitential atonements sing , gave them over to the resonating breath of the human voice , which probably has the most bovine warmth of any sounding board imaginable
1	and so you wandered around and never found your way home
1	well , of course , it was well known that the director did oils—what did the teacher want , it wasn ’ t forbidden , everyone was free to do so
1	and so , for the first time , the little count entered his friend ’ s splendid home—and was frank in his admiration , but not the least bit shy
1	with a flourish , dr mantelsack made a mark fraught with doom next to mumme ’ s name and scowled as he paged through his notebook
1	i don ’ t see , dearest , how my presence—but no matter
1	here you have your legitimation—thank you so much
1	they make special note of his services in the brochure
1	it was well known on meng strasse , in the club , and all over town that the person responsible for all this was a woman by the name of aline puvogel , who lived alone with her two pretty children
1	talk , talk , talk , christian wailed pitifully
1	the more secret they were the more one needed a third party , a confidant , a good man , to whom , with whom one could talk about them-and i was that man
1	but he had to answer the same question several times , every other day really , and finally , with some impatience in his voice , he tried to settle the issue once and for all , declaring that as far as he knew no one was planning to depart—people didn ’ t normally leave here that abruptly
1	and turn again to the lord !
1	she once had an even greater triumph—over pastor trieschke from berlin , whose nickname was teary trieschke , because every sunday he would begin to weep at some point in his sermon
1	now the pastor turns to the two godparents and instructs them as to their duties
1	she said it herself : things , events , experiences , good fortune , love , and pain were not being given their due if they remained mute and were merely enjoyed or endured
1	it turned out that these growths were of purely inorganic origin and arose with the aid of chemicals that came from blessed messengers pharmacy
1	the band was playing a polka
1	only settembrini showed no response
1	he watched her , his eyebrows raised—his small , deep-set eyes weary and sad , but also betraying the extraordinary suspense of this moment
1	we did not know this
1	n s s t d !
1	they then took the elevator down
1	because hans castorp was not on a restricted diet—why should he have been ?
1	a brick , half a brick , gentlemen !
1	i would never have thought you capable of wounding me like this
1	my dear friends , this was no wretched crank-box , the old-fashioned sort with a turntable and stylus on top , plus a misshapen , trumpetlike brass appendage , the sort of thing you might have found at one time set up on a tavern counter to fill unsophisticated ears with nasal braying
1	at the point where , or so it appears , you consider illness to be so elegant or—as you put it—so venerable ’ that there is absolutely no rhyme or reason ’ why it and stupidity should belong together
1	here i lie , paying full price , he said , and i want to get something out of what is offered , too
1	he had the feeling , he said , one ought to do the ladies at the pension gisella the honors of munich in some small way
1	had you but courage to say to yourself : 'where i am , there is kaisersaschern , why then , of a sudden the matter would be in accord , and master aestheticus would no more need sigh the want of fashion
1	he implied , however , that he intended to present it as merely a change of universities-to some extent he represented it that way to himself
1	hans castorp was more or less familiar with the plot , knew the rough outline of the tragic fate of radames , amneris , and aida , who sang to him from the cabinet—an incomparable tenor , a stately mezzo with that splendid break in the middle of her register , and a silvery soprano
1	sky of blue or meadow-land , but as -thou sky of blue ,
1	the common man at any rate has never done so
1	in the most ticklish situation he had managed—with good grace and quite impromptu—a vindication of drink ; he had , moreover , just in passing , brought the conversation around to civilization , of which , to be sure , little was evident in mynheer peeperkorn ’ s primitive , menacing pose ; and finally , by asking his question , had relaxed that grandiose pose—it would have been quite inappropriate to respond with a raised , clenched fist
1	as they moved into the smoking room , herr kesselmeyer remarked cheerfully , you had a pleasant journey , i hope , consul buddenbrook ?
1	a respectable , christian gentleman , her husband said
1	i don ’ t understand—it ’ s better for such things to be used by the family
1	we had just celebrated a little feast , had enjoyed food and drink , and linking arms in an elevated mood , in a humanely relaxed and adventurous spirit , we sought out our nocturnal couches in the small hours of the morning
1	germ a d e
1	tout cela est un peu embarrassant , n 'est-ce pas ?
1	he was the great master who had first given the florentines their polish and taught them both how to speak and the fine art of guiding their republic by the rules of politics
1	it ’ s really strange what all puts those little muscles into motion
1	woods and meadows ?
1	it beats for human reasons and because my spirit is truly happy
1	turned letter , composed in the purest and most dignified german
1	and pray for my poor soul !
1	the line of the horizon lay high , its vastness seemed to climb—this was because hans was gazing down on the bay from a considerable height
1	one hand lay crossed on his chest , the other was extended beside him on the quilt , just the tips of his crooked fingers peeping out from under the very long , wide sleeves of his nightshirt—they twitched slightly now and then
1	his news had animated them ; the conversation at their breakfast table was livelier than at any of the other six
1	she likes you to leave her ash long—i knock it off twice at most
1	you did put that very wittily
1	they all stood there frozen in place for a moment
1	but later , she said that holger probably was not allowed to do that
1	this , however , brought with it a psychological state that , on a different level , resembled that of his father
1	she hesitated for a moment at the words consent to his proposal—it all sounded so stilted and forced ; but she managed to speak them with dignity for the first time in her life
1	then i would take into consideration those feelings that i pro forma presumed to be hers , without actually believing in themshow consideration , then , more for the reasonable basis on which she would in all probability marry the man , and spoke with measured respect for his solid qualities , his knowledge , his humane integrity , his splendid prospects
1	voted his productive energies was likewise of highest rank , even if it lacked the intellectual distinction of keats 's lyric poetry
1	all is by kindness , by goodness surrounded , offering comfort , a hand grasps a hand ; even at night by its light we are bounded , timelessly held by an innermost band
1	she first breathed fussily on her handkerchief and then pressed it to her eyes to keep them from turning red
1	strangely enough , hans castorp ’ s only reply came as a question—did they serve porter here ?
1	his curious fellow citizens could find no answer to such questions in those blue eyes under their reddish-blond brows ; and hans castorp , being an unwritten page , would probably have had no answer , either
1	pharmacology and toxicology were one and the same thing—we were healed by poisons , and a substance considered an agent of life could , under certain circumstances , in a single convulsion kill within seconds
1	there was a flare of blinding white , and all the night-eyes squinted stupidly
1	no , my dear mama , i am not asking you for a written blessing of our union , for i shall be leaving for home the day after tomorrow
1	and you really are ill , aren ’ t you ?
1	just as tony had expected , and indeed wanted , the wedding festivities were carried out with no great to-do
1	his graying beard was cut round and full ; he had terribly bushy eyebrows and a long , spongy nose
1	his friend was named kai , count kai mölln—a boy from an aristocratic family , but whose appearance was totally unkempt
1	and as for the private discussion he hoped to have with director behrens , he was granted his wish on the sixth day
1	i do not understand , rudolf , i cried
1	whatever hopes he might have were just as easily fulfilled or disappointed here as on some schatzalp or other
1	glass is more transparent
1	courts of arbitration—the very idea !
1	i ( duly mocking ) : you love what is most extraordinarily durerlike , first your 'how i should freeze to pursue the sun ' and now the hour-glass of melancolia
1	frau permaneder was so caught up in her woe that she didn ’ t even remember to dry the tears streaming down her cheeks
1	he turned each word over in his little , toothless , mobile mouth before uttering it with incredible effort
1	one day hans castorp was steering his way down the shoveled , looping path , on his way back to dorf to return his skis to the grocer ’ s , when he ran into the director—but nothing came of it
1	i told you no !
1	the contrast between his very unkempt appearance and the noble pedigree in the delicate bone structure of his face with its slightly aquiline nose and slightly pursed upper lip was more striking than ever
1	i envied them that
1	the consul opened to pages already turning yellow and of stiffer , coarser paper than those he had added
1	well , man alive , on me dit , que vous avez pris froid , ich höre , sie sind erkältet , vy , kazhetsya , prostudilis ’ , i hear you have caught a cold
1	having a look at the scenery , are you ?
1	was left once silence fell ,
1	as far as my sister in frankfurt goes , it ’ s all arranged
1	a deed , for example , was the assassination of privy councillor kotzebue by karl sand , who had belonged to a radical fraternity
1	alone in the room where inez 's bust gazed , distinguished and disagreeable , from its pedestal , my thoughts drifted to where , as one can well believe , they had already dwelt often and at length over the last few hours
1	how could it be otherwise ?
1	but you would have had no right , because three of my children are on my side !
1	mynheer peeperkorn could depend on his guests , on every single one of them
1	a man named uzzah had thoughtlessly touched the chest , the so-called ark of the covenant , when it threatened to slip off the cart on which it was being transported , and had immediately fallen over dead
1	or was that brief burst of laughter-which he would release , more in mockery than amazement , after the last ding-dong echo had died away on the evening breeze and which i would know so well later , too-was it meant to say that he could see through the little song 's construct , which is simply that the start of the melody is pitched in sequence by the second voice , so that the third part can serve as the bass for both ?
1	summer vacation at the shore !
1	hanno watched with genuine delight
1	one can say of the town-and i really would rather speak in past tenses , since it is the kaisersaschern we knew in our youth of which i speak-one can say of the town that it had preserved a strong sense of the medieval , not just in outward appearance , but also in atmosphere
1	even though it was performed in frankfurt , a city whose spirit was one of the most easygoing and open in the reich , it goes without saying that this did not happen without angry protests and loud , embittered claims that art was being mocked , a musical crime perpetrated , without charges of nihilism and ( to employ the most common term of abuse at the time )
1	you know what a straightforward , hardworking man he is , a perfect model of a husband in a certain sense—he has no use for taverns , always comes directly home from the office and spends his spare time with us
1	this was the sophisticated life—people walked about with strange drinks in their hands
1	you have the mind of a child , tony , he said despondently , pleading with her
1	and what gives you the right to act that way ?
1	i watch his eyes sometimes , and there is so much going on in them , but he keeps his mouth shut tight
1	how did she act ?
1	but we have kept silence soon these five years and must sometime converse with one another and deliberate the whole matter and the interesting circumstances in which you find yourself
1	but this same aura of a somewhat perilous piety , in which the bloody odor of his profession played its role , had also been his undoing
1	tell me , she suddenly asked , is it true that an egg is as nutritious as a quarter-pound of meat ?
1	there are four of them
1	within a few weeks she grew sickly and died—nothing left but leathery corpses
1	and what an education that was !
1	tony said , i ’ ve never been so happy to go to travemünde in all my life—for all kinds of reasons
1	sixtus kridwiss , however , at whose home they held their disputations , remained in his seat , but with a very agitated look-along with some twenty others who still remained after these departures , though many of them were standing now , evidently ready to flee
1	nor was he consumptive , or at most , like almost everyone else , had had a touch of tuberculosis in early youth
1	and she opens her eyes wide , or even bats them , and replies , he loves me so much
1	at first he would whip his head around indignantly each time and with angry eyes follow the latecomer to her place at the good russian table , even scold her under his breath , rebuking her between his teeth with a cry of outraged protest
1	outside the concert hall i ran into a gentleman from the kridwiss circle , professor gilgen holzschuher , the durer expert , who had been in the hall as well
1	he had been certain that he would sink into sleep at once , but it turned out he was wrong , and whereas he had barely been able to keep his eyes open before , they simply would not remain closed now , but kept fluttering open restlessly the moment he shut them
1	he regretted the end of each , but his consolation was that very soon , in two or two and a half hours , he would be sitting there again—and once he sat down it would be as if he had never stood up
1	joachim looked in bewilderment from one to the other , and hans castorp raised his eyebrows and gazed down at his path
1	oh , and things went badly for both parties
1	but they should have paid more careful attention to time during those three weeks , the way you did measuring your temperature , when the prescribed seven minutes became a significant period of time
1	you can sit there brooding like a deaf-mute for the rest of your life for all i care !
1	by their very nature , the sum of these nothings was not all that serious
1	she was almost pretty , had clear , rather too defined , but agreeable features and a little double chin
1	prude would truly be most ludicrously inappropriate , but which·
1	but the more physical part of him was inclined to abandon itself to the muddled state threatening to engulf him as exhaustion grew ; he did take note of this tendency , however , and let his thoughts linger on it
1	and again : did i actually do so ?
1	from his mother 's side , which was especially obvious as long as he was clean-shaven , that is before he grew that very off-putting imperial ; but that did not happen until later years
1	you missed nothing , of course
1	tions , so to speak
1	how could you miss it ?
1	that was the case with a six-voiced canon by j b bach , in which he had reworked a thematic idea by frederick the great
1	we ’ re only as young or old as we feel
1	there was also a group busy dragging , pulling , and shoving a deep-drafted boat with mast and boom into the water
1	holding her batiste handkerchief to her eyes with both hands now , she managed to say amid her sobs , oh !
1	do you deny that it has literally come true , making life itself a veritable hell ?
1	was the symphonic tone-painting in one movement
1	for him the beginning of all things had its music-it was the music of the beginning and likewise the beginning of music , the £-flat major triad of the surging depths of the rhine , the seven primitive �hords , like cyclopean stones hewn from primeval rock , out of which the fortress of the gods rose up
1	for it is indeed the case that this astute , true , and super-clever music is constantly , painfully wooing the melody of folk song-a melody forever unrealized , both there and not there , appearing as fragmented sound and vanishing again within a musical style spiritually alien to it , but out of which it still constantly attempts to give birth
1	it hurts a great deal—but go with god ’ s blessing , gerda , and with our thanks for not having left earlier , when thomas died
1	frau chauchat had likewise dressed for the occasion and was wearing a new gown , or at least a gown that hans castorp had never seen on her—of thin , dark , almost black silk that sometimes took on a tawny shimmer ; the rounded cut of the neck was small , almost girlish , barely deep enough to expose the throat or even a hint of the collarbone—or her protruding neck bones visible beneath a few stray hairs when she thrust her head forward in that special way
1	this was it , this was the drunken darkness that had filled him since the afternoon , this was what had stirred in his heart in the middle of the night , awakening him , quickening like first love within him
1	the dog continued to rage , and then adrian , after watching and smiling at him for a time , walked over
1	he was probably forty years old , a fat man , not pot-bellied , but with fat , soft limbs and white , well-padded hands ; he had a clean-shaven , round face with a double chin , strongly defined , arched eyebrows , and , behind those horn-rimmed glasses , almond-shaped eyes full of melting mediterranean merriment
1	they sat opposite one another , their faces illumined by an electric table lamp with a red shade
1	the sty is not pretty , although i don ’ t suppose she always has one
1	my cousin is checking right now
1	indeed , hans castorp did not feel he was required to pay any regard to such aberrations , evidently they lay beyond the limits set by an uneasy conscience demanding that he at least try to be influenced—and its demands were indeed audible , so audible that whenever herr settembrini would sit down with them or join them in the open air , he would ask the italian to expand on his ideas
1	first-class case , he said
1	i know that what you got yesterday was a kick in the pants , wasn ’ t it ?
1	in hope of encouraging you , i have angered your pride and can see with my own eyes that i am working against
1	the consul , who has also turned pale with fright , begins to scold him , and even his grandfather raps indignantly on the table , forbidding him any such foolish pranks
1	there was opera in every shape and form
1	the veiled cast of his eyes revealed that he was suffering from a headache-and oddly enough , the same signs had been noticeable in his father , too , both in the church and at the table
1	mademoiselle therese weichbrodt , who with the years had shrunk to even shorter stature than before , was present as well
1	i would kill myself
1	and i break off anew , because i now recall that i broached the topic of genius and what is surely the influence of the demonic upon it solely to illustrate my doubts as to whether i possess the necessary affinity for my task
1	he would stand around on the floor of the exchange for hours on end , looking very important—although he had not the least business there
1	you behold me : therefore am i here for you
1	the baby had been given to the gray sisters in bamberg , but from then on the mother had been nothing more than a gray young miss herself , and with her only company a canary bird and a turtle her parents had given her out of pity , she had withered away in her room from consumption-but , then , the seed of it had probably always been inside her
1	but the difference is that back then there was such a to-do about it , and everyone was pushing me and torturing me , and now they ’ re all so quiet and still about it , simply assuming that i ’ ll say yes
1	good god—so that was part of the bargain , too
1	he called lead pencils leads
1	there were very old , yellowed , tattered letters that worried mothers had written their sons working in foreign lands , on which those who received them had noted : received and taken to heart
1	relation to the evil and ugly-the problem of quality without comparison
1	could ye not watch with me one hour ?
1	sister leandra covered the mirror above the dresser with a cloth
1	it had been a ticklish nuisance , he confided in a half-whisper , since this was the main rest cure and silence was the rule
1	is unmistakably found in the proudly despairing no !
1	it was clear to me as well that it was not by chance that the completion of the work and the end of his sojourn in italy failed to coincide
1	to my mind you listen most attentively and are merely impatient to know more and all
1	a ticklish matter , all the same
1	an epoch-making development for our maritime commerce—simply not to be overestimated
1	the historical movement of musical material has turned against the self-contained work
1	i said that there is no more equality among people here than in prussia
1	my lord , we all have our faults , and he is such a competent , high-principled , hardworking man
1	only what is not fictitious , not a game , is still permissible-the unfeigned and untransfigured expression of suffering in its real moment
1	now , he said , i view you all with refreshed eyes
1	but what should i say , ida , when he asks ?
1	well , i for one think very highly of my profession
1	we will do it on a saturday-as far as i know you have no classes on saturday this semester
1	but at the start of the new month , bad weather set in—damp , gloomy days , with a mixture of snow and rain , then snow , clear and simple ; and except for an occasional splendid burst of summer , the bad weather continued for the rest of the month and on into september
1	i had some rather confused dreams
1	under the impetus of brain and of motor nerves extending from the spine , belly and rib cage stirred , the pleuroperitoneal cavity swelled and contracted ; the breath , warmed and moistened by mucous membranes along the trachea and laden with secreted material , streamed out between the lips , now that oxygen had bonded with the hemoglobin in the blood deep in the air sacs of the lungs
1	his personal experiences here—the nature of which we have attempted to indicate on several occasions—had forced him at certain moments to cry , my god !
1	illuminated now , the plates revealed pictures
1	and justus kröger said , steady now , tom , my boy , steady
1	i can see , he said , continuing to stroke her hair , i can see , my dear child , that you are moved by fine and worthy principles
1	which means that truth is—
1	she looped her arm around him , so to speak , not around his shoulders , but around his head , her hand resting on his brow , and then with her black eyes directed at kretzschmar and still speaking to him in her sweet , resonant voice , she rested adrian 's head on her breast
1	she died when i was still small
1	whenever frau permaneder came to visit her sister-in-law , she would draw her nephew close to her and tell him about the buddenbrooks ’ past and about their future , a future for which they would have only him , little johann , to thank—and , of course , god in his mercy
1	what would be in there for him ?
1	one should not begrudge me my little bit of revenge , hans castorp went on
1	and the man of the logos defended passion !
1	he said , turning to me , and an-
1	then came a morning when hans castorp found it was forty-eight degrees in his room , and the next morning it was only forty-three degrees
1	by us i mean adrian , myself , and georg , who was already thirteen when his brother and i were eight and ten years old
1	the jesuit , a well-traveled man with cultured manners , a pedagogue by passion , a judge of men , a fisher of men , sat up and took notice at the first sardonic , clearly articulated answers the wretched young jewish lad gave to his questions
1	for such a young patient , he was not reacting well ; they had resulted in headaches , fatigue , loss of appetite and weight , had at first raised his fever slightly , but then had not got rid of it
1	a gin , a schiedam gin , my emerenzchen
1	hans castorp laughed in surprise—meanwhile trying to recall who minos and rhadamanthus were , exactly
1	my feelings for her have always been those of a brother , a comrade , and my becoming intimate with her and letting this stupid relationship that she clings to simply drag on-it has , on my part , all been merely a matter of my doing my duty as a cavalier
1	am i not a man ?
1	fine , but what does that really mean ?
1	she was all alone in the world , too , having left her husband and children—as she freely admitted to the cousins—for another man ( still half a boy ) , only to be left in turn by her lover
1	they would lower their voices to chat , and although the glass partition did not completely separate the balconies , joachim next door could not make out what they were saying—did not even try for that matter
1	the little gathering was silent
1	my dear , departed jean left it to me to choose a guardian
1	ten on the gaffky
1	what i also foresee is some sense of emptiness that is sure to be mine once i have added a few words accounting for the close of this great composer 's life and have put the final stroke of the pen to my manuscript
1	so was i and i ’ ll go on speaking more or less poetically , too—because the moment seems to call for it , that ’ s why i am speaking this way
1	it just seemed that way to me
1	a thousand thanks for your letter telling me about armgard von schilling ’ s engagement to herr von maiboom of pöppenrade
1	there was absolutely nothing cheering about it
1	after supper adrian exchanged hardly another word with marie godeau
1	and what about you ?
1	so , the poet concludes , with the desperate logic of therefore and thus , i turned into a sty and laid me down among the swine
1	you find beethoven pure , clear , and natural in comparison
1	tony was struck dumb with envy and humiliation
1	what all have not the police refrained from acting upon in our own day-again in compliance with the times , which certainly do permit such things again of late
1	gazing into cottony nothing , eyes easily closed and drifted into slumber , and at just that moment a shiver passed over the body
1	and why lust , you ask ?
1	slow pace , that there might be reserved for you years , decades of lovely , nigromantic time , a whole hour-glass of devilish time , of genius time
1	it was curiosity , but also the pull that my friend 's personalitycoolly aloof , indeed shy in its arrogance-had on so many people , that soon drew this or that visitor in the opposite direction , to leave the city and look in on his retreat
1	that ’ s tony all over , the consul said
1	the young man arrived about ten o ’ clock in the morning and had a bite to eat with the family in the parlor
1	we others stayed a little longer
1	and if the people at his own table did not make much fuss about the end of his isolation , how could anyone else in the dining hall have done so ?
1	and from his very first day up here hans castorp had felt an immoral appetite to taste that experience—in particular at the five prodigious meals in the cheerfully stenciled dining hall , where he had had his first slight , and relatively innocent , dizzy spell of this sort
1	the labels in the middle of the ebonite disks were different colors , but otherwise the eye could not differentiate them
1	we should join at the first opportunity
1	and even frau stöhr , who as a woman of principle had likewise held her ground and met head-on every temptation to make her own wild departure , had remarked to her tablemates that krokowski had really been rather obscure today with his classical mushroom
1	the man made it clear , however , that he fancied himself a specialist whose activities had to take place backstage , with only the results of his endeavors displayed for pious review by the bereaved—all of which aroused hans castorp ’ s mistrust
1	when will you be back ?
1	to be sure , we ’ ll do everything possible and feasible
1	might almost say , personal pressure-responding in writing to my letter
1	her reddish hair , which swept back high on her head in a little crowning swirl and lay in broad , carefully coiffed waves over her ears , matched well with her extraordinary soft white complexion and the few little freckles
1	this , then , was fräulein brand , elly , the friendly little danish girl , who rode a bike and used to sit on an office swivel stool—and there were things about her that no one would have even dreamed possible on first or second glance at that shining face , but that began to emerge within only a few weeks after her arrival up here and that dr krokowski saw as his task to uncover in all their strangeness
1	he wears the ceremonial ruff of what has been , and you put on austere black in his honor
1	he ’ s not the sort of man who is out for a lot of money
1	she bent toward him , bent down to him , over him , he sensed her organic aroma , sensed the lacelike pounding of her heart
1	your themes-they almost always consist of even values , of half , quarter , eighth notes ; they are syncopated and tied , to be sure , but nonetheless persevere in what is often a machinelike , stamping , hammering inflexibility and inelegance
1	you offered me eight percent , and i gave you your extension
1	two constituent values and qualitative components are required for genuine sacrifice : the cause , and the object sacrificed
1	those ninnies do not know , you see , and if they know can not alter the case , that the uppermost metavenereal process is accelerated by such general treatment
1	then he turned to the apprentice and said , that will do
1	and in the same moment , virtually tumbling head over heels , the professor left his platform and headed directly toward petersen with long , inexorable strides
1	this is not true under all conditions
1	it is a regular hustle and bustle
1	a propos—how is she feeling ?
1	nor would i forget that we marched off to war at the time with a comparatively pure heart and did not believe our previous behavior at home had been such that a bloody global catastrophe need be regarded as the inevitable logical consequence of our domestic conduct
1	there was a double door , with clothes hooks in the space between the two
1	no one would guess that is supposed to mean you
1	ah , gentlemen , nothing could be easier !
1	we can not leave it at just the three of us , we shall need company
1	you ’ re right , hans castorp said
1	forgive me , madam , for speaking so candidly
1	they sat as if spellbound , and when the sounds of departure had died away outside , zur hohe was once again heard to utter his peremptory , beautiful !
1	then with a tip and a stumble it headed for the p , pulled away , and moved to the o what was it going to spell ?
1	( it was the young fellow with the saltcellar fingernail )
1	hans castorp felt the blood rush to his heart again—it began to pound
1	so lovely a case
1	and travemünde , too , the schwarzkopfs , she said slowly , and her eyes rested dreamily for a while on the spot where erika ’ s stocking had been darned
1	but now , more to our liking , it was almost empty , with only two parties besides our own dining at distant tables near the dance floor : at one was a sickly-looking gentleman with his nurse in deaconess habit , at the other a group here for winter sports
1	it had been marvelous beyond their fondest dreams and what a dreadful shame it was no one had written the poem down , so that it was doomed to be forgotten , for it had a quality about it that made it as hard to grasp hold of as a dream
1	but it ’ s the master
1	she would slip into curses and in righteous outrage name the names of the people who had been detrimental to her life—and thus to the buddenbrook family as a whole
1	but enough of adrian 's participation in munich 's highlife !
1	he ’ ll give the child an entire table service of pure gold and won ’ t even let us thank him for it
1	he knew that his wife and i were old friends , and that i ’ m your sister , and since he was in such straits , he had his wife do his work for him , and in turn she has enlisted me—you see ?
1	you can ’ t believe how he looked when they brought him in
1	not daring to stir , he lay there with his hands folded—and was allowed to watch
1	the consul listened as long as there was music to be heard
1	but what we should do , damn it , is to sit ourselves down and accomplish something , just as our forebears did
1	the signature beneath these proclamations was that of an entity named christus imperator maximus , an energy who enlisted and commanded troops prepared to die in the cause of subjugating the globe , who issued bulletins much like orders of the day , reveled in laying down implacable stipulations , proclaimed poverty and chastity , and could not get enough of unquestioned , unbounded obedience to his fist-pounding demands
1	fine , let it pass for all i care
1	the formation of breast milk
1	well , tony , what do you think ?
1	and pribislav said nothing at all , simply gave the mechanism a quick check and shoved the holder into his pocket
1	it was such a lovely , festive , absolutely extraordinary evening—they all understood and felt it , and for now no one would even think of making use of the gift of life called sleep
1	it was indicated from several sides that they should withdraw a little from these noisy precincts for the purpose , so that they could enjoy their picnic relieved of this racket and not as deaf-mutes
1	so all gifts are to be returned ?
1	that may sound bizarre , but it is far from improbable or unprecedented , and given certain conditions it can happen to any of us at any time ; under such conditions , nothing could prevent us from sinking into profound ignorance about the passage of time and so about our own age
1	the most important factor , to be sure , was the easy , refined , and irresistibly charming way he had of embodying that history and turning it to his own account
1	he stood there on bowed legs , bent in a kind of question mark , and his little , deep-set eyes gazed at his brother ’ s face—and it was so silent , cold , dismissive , and impeccable , so totally beyond all human reproach
1	closer to hans castorp , then , one on each side of the table , came herr and frau magnus—the beer-brewer from halle and his wife
1	natural , or supernatural , phenomena—there has already been mention made of his clairvoyant great-aunt , whose melancholy story had been passed down to him
1	my respects , you are a brave man , frau else said when adrian returned to the gate
1	closer to their goal a beautiful view opened up onto a rocky formation of the zügenstrasse
1	but things were surely different for him as a civilian
1	the music , the music was starting up again—what an idiotic racket
1	who easily shed good-hearted tears when she laughed and frequently nodded to her niece in order to repeat-her face damp , her voice wobbling-one of her neighbor 's humorous comments that in her opinion she simply had to share
1	but it proved impossible for her to keep her word , because now and then her path inevitably led her either past the display windows of the shops in the back building , which had been leased almost immediately at very handsome rents , or past the venerable gabled façade itself , where now the name of consul hermann hagenström stood just beneath the dominus providebit
1	cheers on all sides
1	he came in a bell-shaped pleated coat , not in the latest fashion but of the best quality , lending him an air of solidity and dignity—and smiling and pink-faced as always , his thinning hair carefully combed , his whiskers curled and scented
1	to let yourself get discouraged over something like that—
1	madame buddenbrook was silent for a moment
1	she ’ d be in completely over her head
1	in a jocular , everyday sort of way , surely-with `` i am certainly curious to hear about it or something of the sort
1	who would have expected that of him ?
1	the harbor pilot said in a gruff voice , turning to herr grünlich
1	sticking out from the short sleeves , his hands were always a pale gray , as if impregnated with dust and dirt ; but they were narrow and exceptionally fine hands , with long fingers and long , tapering fingernails
1	half sitting up in bed , with mighty shoulders and majestic head turned toward his visitor , he stretched one arm out across the bedclothes and held his freckled captain ’ s hand erect at the end of the woolen sleeve , forming a precise ring of thumb and forefinger , thrusting the other finger lances in the air ; and his mouth formed the words as sharply and exactly , as graphically in fact , as herr settembrini himself might have wished , and he added a throaty rolled r to words like difference and occurred
1	in this connection , moreover , it came as a matter of fleeting surprise to learn that in his youth rudi had been forced to undergo an operation that cost him one of his kidneys
1	i shall be ruthless
1	in short , she can ’ t be measured by ordinary standards
1	and that was the end of the attempt by the flatlands to reclaim hans castorp
1	and so he had finished well-and he had to finish well
1	it lasted two hours , and it required a great deal of self-denial , human sympathy , and friendly goodwill for me to stay with it
1	i made serious inquiries about my son-in-law
1	he feigned a couple of steps in the direction of the dining room , then held back as his eyes searched for his mother , who was bringing up the rear at the side of pastor wunderlich and about to cross the threshold
1	they were twelve in all when they sat down , with hans castorp seated between their majestic host and clavdia chauchat
1	but they add up , bethsy !
1	it ’ s probably some of the good china
1	and after they ’ ve done that for a year or so , if all goes well , the lung will have rested long enough to heal
1	breathing heavily and not rightly knowing how he had got there , hans castorp found himself lying in the splendid lounge chair on his balcony—because there was a rest cure between dinner and tea , the most important of the day , in fact , and rigorously enforced
1	their grief was sincere , for they all had been fond of poor , saucy , proud clarissa
1	i will not dwell on the foolish stubbornness of your continuing to use my first name and informal pronouns
1	leverkiihn , deutschlin said in reply , has his own thoughts about youth , but he also apparently regards it as a specific form of life to be respected as such , and that 's decisive
1	hans castorp had the impression that the latter was the case and that these sparkling trills and grace notes of laughter were due solely to childish giddiness and silly ignorance—and he did not approve
1	it ’ s not as if there were any immediate danger—oh , how foolish of me to even put it that way
1	one ought not , therefore , be all too distressed even by gross symptoms
1	hans castorp could only respond with the brief , stiff , and uneasy bow of a schoolboy on the receiving end of a critical lecture
1	studying ? —oh , and playing the piano ?
1	director behrens had not come , having presumably said his good-byes to her on some other private occasion
1	things might be different awake ; maybe in looking for inner support he would do well to give settembrini ’ s novel nature a try—rebellious and critical , though sentimental and bombastic , too
1	you know that i ’ m industrious and inventive
1	god and nature were both unjust , they had their favorites , chose to be gracious at random , adorned one man with precarious honors and the next with an easy , but ordinary fate
1	with his blue eyes , rudolf observed adrian 's preoccupation , saw how he checked himself and turned away
1	your ladder is pure orient
1	the consul came close to shouting , and then dampened his voice with a glance toward the dining room
1	the golden tree of life is green , true , but a green face is really not quite the thing
1	i ’ m no millionaire , but what i have is well invested
1	as an idealist of the pathological , if not to say a pathological idealist , such a man will see himself at the starting point of a sequence of thought that very quickly flows into the problem of being-in-general—that is to say , into the problem of the relationship between mind and matter
1	this took place at the waldfriedhof cemetery in munich and was attended by everyone in the radde 's circle of friends
1	the program includes various danses macabres
1	demeaning myself by yielding won ’ t make a more devoted son of the rascal
1	a terribly funny man , our behrens , a fabulously funny , amusing man—laugh till your sides split
1	dr krokowski ’ s baritone called him calmly and solemnly by name and repeated his command
1	but although hans castorp was usually repelled by tangled and squalid affairs and even felt repelled in this instance as well , he continued to splash about in these murky waters , taking consolation in the certainty that he was here only on a visit and would soon be leaving
1	sad to say , you guessed correctly about my not knowing the writings of that pope—i assume innocent the third was a pope
1	his embarrassment was unnecessary , because no one noticed him
1	no , no … no , my friend , no chance
1	he ’ s homesick for the sea , gerda buddenbrook remarked
1	it ’ s all a bit mysterious
1	when i first had to take to my bed , i wrote them that i had a bad cold and could not travel
1	the educational system , in its clever subtlety , both met and encouraged his own natural tendencies
1	herr stuht , a tailor on glockengiesser strasse , whose wife bought used articles of clothing and so moved in the highest social circles—herr stuht , whose woolen shirt followed the contours of his astounding potbelly and fell down over his trousers—herr stuht had made two suits of clothes for the young messrs buddenbrook , at a total cost of seventy marks courant ; except that , at the express wish of the two boys , he promptly agreed to make out a bill for eighty , handing back the difference to them in cash
1	then he gave a deep sigh and sat up straight
1	finally succumbing to hunyadi-janos water , he had left his daughter an annuity of two hundred marks a year and relied on general respect for the name döhlmann to ensure that she would be admitted into the johannis cloister
1	already reserved , dear mama , already reserved , herr grünlich replied
1	it is true that his moist eyes were laughing all the while , and apparently he saw the situation from its humorous side , but that was no consolation for everyone else , and ultimately one could not blame the public for avoiding these lectures-and with such unanimity that indeed several times only about a half dozen listeners occupied some front seats , namely : my parents , adrian 's uncle , young cimabue , and the two of us , plus a couple of pupils from the girls ' academy , who never failed to titt�r during the speaker 's faltering seizures
1	but then settembrini continued with dignity , ah , no , i am a european , an occidental
1	yes , as an unsalaried engineer-in-training
1	and so three days had passed since the bill for his second week had been taken care of with a thank-you and a receipt—which is the same thing as saying that he was now in the middle of the third and last week of his scheduled stay up here
1	it is the angel of each single creature , the genius of its life , whose knowledgeable guidance it gladly trusts
1	he now lived the life of a private gentleman , but was a little ashamed of the fact ; and so he constantly pretended to have more to do than he could possibly keep up with
1	after all , his face had something puggish about it , his voice was guttural , and there was more of the boy than of the man about him-though i will gladly grant the lovely blue of his eyes , his trim figure , and his captivating violin playing and whistling , not to mention his general niceness
1	but it upsets me to see such confusion—what with the one preaching about an international world republic and loathing war on principle , but at the same time so patriotic that the brenner pass is the only possible border and he ’ s willing to fight a civilizing war over it ; and the other claiming the nation-state is the devil ’ s own work and gushing about the unification of all mankind , only to turn around and defend the law of natural instincts and make fun of peace conferences
1	but this acrimony with my brother , your eldest son , father—let us not have a hidden crack that runs through the edifice we have built with god ’ s gracious help
1	when inez 's dignity was at issue
1	he did not want rudolf to make
1	but then he started up , looking about in befuddlement , like someone rudely awakened from sleep
1	it involves us all , and if it ends in disgrace , we shall all be affected , because weinschenk is part of the family after all—he sits at our table
1	you ’ re a writer , hans castorp said , a literary man
1	his uncle , nikolaus leverkiihn , his father 's brother and a respected citizen of kaisersaschern , consented to take the boy in
1	all of which proceeds from the later beethoven and his polyphony , and i find it extraordinarily significant that the foes of romanticism-to wit : of art stepping forward out of mere musicality and into the realm of the general intellect-were likewise always foes and lamenters of beethoven 's later development
1	strasse i n a low-slung , rubber-wheeled pram of the most elegant construction , pushed along by their wet-nurse ( for inez did not nurse them herself ; her physician had advised against it ) , a simple woman all gussied up in bourgeois finery
1	more recently , dr krokowski treated this patient no differently from the way he treated all others
1	who wants to play with us ?
1	home from his walk , hans castorp consulted him—and he promptly climbed to
1	the director said with a genial laugh
1	do you see what a sackful of rascals it is ? -was how he would usually conclude his indictment , being far better at words than the lawyer , who would angrily withdraw behind his newspaper after a few braying attempts at protest
1	could not help it ?
1	the idea that youth has a closer relationship to nature than a man matured by bourgeois society-rather like a woman , for instance , who is said to have a greater affinity to nature in comparison with a man
1	the man had covered the walls of his cell with verses
1	then she looked back up at the maid ’ s flushed face , read it again , and looked at the maid ’ s face again
1	he never spoke of higher things , but simply stuck to the facts , and it was a delight to listen to him—particularly for hans castorp , who thought it useful to hear about the russian empire and the life lived there , about samovars , piroshki , cossacks , and wooden churches with so many onion-shaped steeples that they looked like mushroom colonies
1	it spoke well of the spiritual quality of his superiors that his protests and doubts in no way prejudiced the irregard for him
1	i am a simple man , he said
1	do you always mock the people who lay themselves at your feet ?
1	i defend it today as well , he replied
1	and in the brief , worthless time in between , there was a walk to the bench up on the mountain slope , right next to the water trough—the path was teeming with patients , so that the cousins frequently had to greet people
1	in its own way , the other contains a great deal of human dignity , too , and contributes to moral conduct and decorum and noble formality , certainly more than freethinking ’ does—and always with an eye to human weakness and frailty
1	freedom is the freedom to sin , and piety consists in making no use of freedom out of love for god , who had to grant it
1	things that have a certain insipid optimism , which , if you found them in a book , would prompt you to cast it with amused anger or total outrage into the nearest corner
1	his hands behind his back , the senator examined the plaque for a long time
1	but i wanted to wait , he went on
1	as they left , young fritz wept a little again , and although it was only out of weakness , the tears he shed stood in curious contradiction to the dry , businesslike way he spoke and thought
1	for adrian leverkiihn these were years of highly excited and enormous-one is tempted to say , monstrous-creative activity , a kind of tumult that swept even sympathetic bystanders before it , and one could not avoid the impression that it was intended as payment , as compensation for his having been deprived of happiness in life , for having been denied permission to love
1	that would seem really too strange
1	her parents , retired major gerngross and his wife , were likewise touched and pleased , but since they had no friends whatever in the house , they could not even hazard a guess as to the givers
1	but hygiene is probably not the only reason for friction , i would say
1	in exquisite , perfectly enunciated words , he deplored the cold and damp , which were a bitter affliction for him
1	the moment behrens returns , they will all throw themselves on their lounge chairs
1	kai was lost in his own thoughts
1	no doubt there would also be hygienic arguments for maintaining the nation and race , when one day they would proceed to leave the sick unattended on a large scale and kill the feeble-minded and those incapable of survival , whereas in reality ( it was not to be denied , on the contrary , it must be emphasized ) it would be a matter of far more profound decisions , of the renunciation of all humane pampering and emasculation , which had been the work of the bourgeois epoch-a matter of mankind 's instinctively getting into shape for hard and dark times that would scoff at humanity , for an age of great wars and sweeping revolution , presumably leading far back beyond the christian civilization of the middle ages and restoring instead the dark ages that preceded its birth and had followed the collapse of the culture of antiquity
1	but arm your hearts and minds with mistrust , never let your critical resistance down
1	from him he got his charcoal-burner ’ s faith in reason , freedom , human progress , and the whole moth-eaten classicistic-bourgeois ideology of virtue
1	but being unpracticed in such discursive reasoning and anything but intellectually alert after his unsalutary walk , he was easily diverted , and was in fact diverted almost immediately by the round back in front of him and by the arm extending from it , which lifted and reached back , so that the hand—now right before hans castorp ’ s eyes—could tuck at the braid of hair
1	some people go to spain then , but you ’ ll be returning to your bandera , to perform distinguished service above and beyond the call of duty
1	why she keeps saying man alive , i really don ’ t know
1	the intruding shrieks of fear , however , took form , closed ranks , became a melody—and then came the moment when they achieved mastery as a fervent , plaintive chorus of woodwinds raised in strong yet humble song
1	i wouldn ’ t want to be on it , he added after a pause
1	these humane minds were disgusted by the idea of wealth increasing automatically and placed all speculation and transactions involving interest under the rubric of usury , making every rich man either a thief or the heir of a thief
1	then he heaved a sigh and said , i will not attempt to gloss over the specific forms life ’ s natural cruelty takes in your society
1	they were all in on it
1	it was dr ting-fu who came up with the sound idea of turning on the ceiling light—and at once the room was bathed in bright clarity
1	you speak my deepest sentiments , herr grünlich , she said
1	and now you want to stage it yourself , is that it ?
1	this is what happened : after three months of treatment at the hosslin clinic , where i was allowed to see my friend only seldom and always for just a few minutes , he had calmed down-i do not say improved , but calmed down-to a degree that enabled the doctor to consent to private care in the quiet of pfeiffering
1	the chimes of st mary ’ s began their chorale—dong ! -ding-dong ! —with so little rhythm that it was not quite clear which hymn it was , though it was full of solemnity , and while the smaller and the larger bells—one merry , the other grave—tolled four o ’ clock , the bell in the vestibule below rang shrilly through the entrance hall
1	but if the kingdom is to come , the dualism between good and evil , between this world and the next , between power and the spirit , must be temporarily abrogated and transformed in a principle that unites asceticism and dominion
1	you had a right to be called , she said
1	she 's had her fill of town and people and society , of ladies and gents ,
1	at the door , they ran into a delegation of sailors , led by two helmsmen from the wullenwever and the friederike oeverdieck , the firm ’ s two ships now lying moored at the docks
1	he returned to his home
1	you seem to take some sort of pleasure in this , don ’ t you ?
1	a new breakthrough seemed due , the breakthrough that would make us a dominant world power-which , to be sure , could not be effected by moral homework
1	chairs and ice-buckets were upended
1	ah , ah , comme c'est melancolique , tout ra !
1	tame isabeau was enchanted to see him again
1	no motion , if there were no time ?
1	i am convinced that the gray sisters are more loyal , more devoted , and more self-sacrificing than those nurses in black
1	he would arrive , for instance , just in time carefully to spoon her midday porridge into her mouth , to help her drink from her spouted cup if a bite got stuck in her throat , or to assist her in shifting position in bed—for , in addition to all her other problems , an incision from an operation made it difficult for her to lie down
1	his mother , madame buddenbrook , however , took the matter in hand , pulling grabow aside to ask , just between us , doctor , something must be done , don ’ t you think ?
1	i can tell you in two words
1	then he stood up and bowed silently , extending a hand to herr pfühl , who let his hand pass gently and lovingly across hanno ’ s hair , which lay in soft , graceful curls along his brow and at his temples
1	yes , ida , the consul says , i ’ ve been thinking about it , and mother has agreed
1	although one ought to be fair and admit that he alone , and not the lord , has provided the impetus behind the good fortunes of the firm of strunck & hagenström
1	after eight to ten days spent doing nothing but smoking cigars , hugo weinschenk began to read newspapers and write letters
1	they were on their way to their offices and shops , not in all that much of a hurry , nothing was threatening them
1	these ladies and gentlemen were put up in the house , and ida jungmann had her hands full tidying up the various bedrooms and tending to good breakfasts of shrimps and port wine—the kitchen was busy with baking and roasting
1	russians love to go for rides , joachim told hans castorp as they stood together at the front door and amused themselves by watching people depart
1	so be man 's wrong how ever great ,
1	the essence of the situation remains what it has been since the beginning , a physical struggle , and it is each man ’ s duty , however far he may be from nature , to keep himself equal to this situation
1	one day he said , there ’ s something else i must tell you : i have a complete skeleton in my room in göttingen
1	when by chance at one point in the social ebb and flow , a group formed of marie , adrian , myself , and a fourth party , i moved off at once in the hope that the fourth would have enough sense to go his own way as well
1	your mother may find release in the next five minutes , or this may go on for hours yet
1	come back soon , you old muttonhead !
1	hot on their heels came a series of hymns , to be sung to familiar european chorales , appearing in print under such titles as tones of divine love and praise , jacob 's place of struggle and knighthood , and zion 's hill of incense
1	a good one , say i , an it be not too dear
1	and he recalled the calm , generous reply of oh , please , go ahead and look , that he had once received out of the dark night of the x-ray laboratory , when he had thought it necessary to ask permission to commit certain optical indiscretions
1	you enter the fray unarmed against such intellectual chicanery
1	yes , i expected to see that face , he said
1	i had only to deliver the invitation to an excursion , not propose marriage
1	he sank down onto a bench in the pose of a man who has lost the battle of waterloo , pressing a clenched fist to his brow , rolling his eyes blasphemously , and repeating several times over : ha , curses !
1	and he devoted the same deadly earnest to planning a business maneuver or outlining a speech as he did to contemplating a complete refurbishing of his supply of underwear—to do it at last in one fell swoop , so that at least in that regard everything would be in perfect order for a while
1	unwilling to accommodate himself to such failure , he struggled for a while to find a pleasure that either was totally denied him or simply teased him with a distant inkling of itself , and finally out of weary disgust he tossed the cigar aside
1	and he was about to add :
1	he hugged ida , looked around with eyes still wet with tears , contentedly murmured something about aunt tony , shifted in his bed , and then quietly fell asleep
1	believe me—believe this if nothing else—if father were alive , if he were here with us today , he would fold his hands and commend us all to the mercy of god
1	christian , too , had been roused from his bed upstairs and was sitting off to one side , his back turned to the four-poster , his head buried in his hands
1	one must have them
1	on the one hand , he is incapable of keeping his composure when other people are tactless and naïve
1	and yet one could offer her only bitter thanks for that
1	all the same , after the duel with that devil he had one of his fits of laughter out on the street , and it subsided only slowly under the diversion of conversation
1	and if you have formed a different opinion of me , you can go to hell , to pot , or to the dogs—take your pick
1	and i also got tangled up in my own oratory because the whole time i had the feeling that it was inappropriate for me to hold forth like that in adrian 's presence
1	for the second time the storm of this man ’ s emotions rushed over him , and there certainly seemed something genuine about the way he expressed them ; it was the same awful threat he had heard that day when he told herr grünlich about the letter his daughter had sent from travemünde , and once again a shudder passed through him—like any man of his generation , he felt a fanatical reverence for all human emotions that stood at odds with his sober and practical outlook as a man of business
1	his union with her was based on mutual understanding , consideration , and silence
1	the ratio between our real estate and our liquid capital is all out of balance
1	he did it even with me , even with women , who usually did not dislike it
1	i wish you could change seats with me so you could observe her as easily and effortlessly as i can
1	the portrait of clavdia chauchat was hung in the living room , next to the window—hans castorp had spied it with one quick glance as he entered the room , although it bore only a very distant resemblance to her
1	as we turned back to the village , we watched the sun set , and i never have seen a splendor of the evening sky to match it
1	he looked directly into our faces , observing our mirth with roguish curiosity-particularly at mine , it seemed , since he probably wanted to check whether , for my own good , my preposterous dull and stern pedagogy had thawed out
1	we have to extract the roots
1	but he only laughed derisively as he walked away , and within a few minutes he returned with his revolver
1	tony ’ s tears gradually dried
1	but then he fell silent again and thought : hmm , hmm , serious news
1	our feeling , you see , is our manly vigor , which awakens life
1	whereby the eyes ' darkness is deepened all the more by the low pitch , the flash of light within it , given this time , however , to the piccolo
1	you get the details right , and bungle the larger effect
1	he did not ask whether we understood this , nor did we ask ourselves
1	you lay bedridden with pneumonia for six weeks , and here you are sitting without an overcoat , without even a blanket , and smoking cigarettes
1	and what was dr krokowski talking about ?
1	herr grünlich praised the house ’ s elegant grounds , praised the town in general , praised the consul ’ s cigar as well , had a kind word for everyone
1	the drooping bags of skin under her jet-black eyes were larger and heavier than any he had ever seen
1	she held her cup clasped in both hands ; her face vanished into the cup , and she gulped at her milk , pausing now and then for little enthusiastic sighs
1	and as for her profile , his tablemate forbade him ever to say such a thing again
1	everything that hans castorp had anticipated—and all too hastily put into words for herr settembrini as they returned from platz that afternoon before mardi gras—was well on its way to being fulfilled
1	then weariness and disgust would rise up inside him , clouding his eyes , robbing him of control over his proud posture and the muscles in his face
1	she dressed in much the same fashion as sesame , but unlike her was extremely tall
1	after that , he threw himself with redoubled fervor into the arms of the clear-eyed goddess , about whose soothing powers director behrens had so many virtuous things to say ; and the problem that consumed his every thought day and night , to which he devoted all the persistence , all the sportsman ’ s tenacity he had once brought to the conviction of poor sinners—back in the days before his frequently extended leave of absence , which now threatened to become permanent retirement—that problem was nothing less than the squaring of the circle
1	he led them upstairs and down , showing them the rooms on the third floor and those that opened off the corridor on the second , as well as the layout of the ground floor , even the kitchen and the cellar
1	but hanno had not stopped laughing ; he was still laughing so hard on the stairs that classmates in his and kai ’ s vicinity stared at him in cool amazement , were even a little repulsed by such foolishness
1	and out of concern for psychological needs , especially in the case of such a man , one does not even think of physical calmatives and sedatives , of the bromides that were in the house
1	never , in fact , hans castorp said
1	i ’ m so glad , so tremendously glad that things are taking this serene course , and that he will not have to suffer edema of the glottis and other such beastly problems—he will be spared a great many vexations
1	hans castorp—head over heels in love , as people say , and yet not in the happy sense of the idiom , but as one loves when it is forbidden and unreasonable , when there are no calm little songs from the flatlands to be sung , terribly in love , dependent , subjugated , suffering and serving—was nevertheless a man who remained shrewd enough amid his slavery to know exactly what his devotion was worth , and would continue to be worth , to the slinking patient with the enchanting tartar slits ; and she could be constantly reminded of its worth , or so he told himself despite his suffering subjugation , by the behavior of herr settembrini , who only too openly confirmed her own suspicions by attitudes as dismissive toward her as humanistic courtesy allowed
1	and it was quite reprehensible for two or three like-minded girlfriends to appear at the door of the elderly lady who sold woolen dolls in the narrow alley off johannis strasse—although , admittedly , she did have the most curious red eyes—to tug at her bell as hard as they could , and , when the old woman came out , to ask in a deceptively friendly voice whether this might be the residence of herr or madame spittoon , and then to run away screeching loudly
1	but first make yourselves comfortable
1	what he did was to sit down and compose a missive to mlle
1	: further , because your every other word lays bare your nothingness
1	even though not everything had turned out over the years quite the way one , out of shortsightedness , might have wished , she said , nevertheless there still remained such manifold and obvious blessings that their hearts should be filled with gratitude
1	no , no , my deepest , deepest respect
1	saint felix-brazil , i ’ ve always stuck to that sort
1	they had set the light , rustic , stained-wood furniture on the lawn , because it was too warm and close inside the summerhouse , a single white room whose only decoration was a tall mirror framed by fluttering birds and two enameled french doors at the rear—which weren ’ t real ; if you looked closely you could see that the handles were just painted on
1	take for instance the role thin counterpoint plays in romanticism
1	german i shall be , yet you , good sir , begrudge me that i should , in good durer fashion , freeze to pursue the sun-and do so e�en when , quite without regard to the sun , i have urgent business here with a fine creature well-created
1	because the subject came up
1	but , as stupid as i am , i know one thing : that you are a very different man from father , and that when you took over the business you set quite a different breeze blowing , and that since then you have done many things he would never have done
1	he does not appear to have investigated the doctor 's sudden death any further , had no interest in the matter , it seemed
1	his mother had gone to see to her toilette
1	of course , as a man of the south , you would probably suggest poison or a dagger or at the least shape the matter along social and emotional lines , in short , have me play cock of the walk
1	i can not and will not investigate to what extent he believed in the personal existence of the adversary , but i tell myself that wherever there is theology-and especially where it is joined to so juicy a per-
1	they returned to their guests
1	i need it so badly
1	wasservogel had it easy in life , because most of the teachers were quick to praise him for his achievements—just to prove to themselves and the other boys that they would never let his ugliness tempt them to be unjust
1	and i don ’ t think it ’ s out of the question that we ’ ll learn a thing or two out of this
1	and all stuffed full with merchandizes , and the people thronging there gaze upon you with exotic eyes and speak in tongues of which you ne'er have heard a sound before
1	i want to have a home and someone who will show some sympathy when i am ill and we ’ re well suited to each other
1	poor hans castorp—what an error his earlier assumption had been upon first making the acquaintance of those arms through thin gossamer : that once bared , bared against all good reason , those arms would affect him less deeply without the seductive radiant illusion of fabric , as he had called it that day
1	tony sat down at the secretary—its top was rolled back ; she clasped her hands behind her head and stared for a while out into the courtyard , its black cobblestones glistening with rain , and at the damp garden , its green turned to yellow now
1	he was deeply moved by what he saw , or more accurately , by being able to see it , but he was also stung by secret doubts whether it might not be somehow abnormal after all , doubts about whether it was permissible to stare like this amid the quivering , crackling darkness
1	i urge you : consider your self-respect , your pride
1	and before one even thought about it , the moment had come for the robust knock of the bath attendant , announcing that the daily schedule was in force once again
1	life ’ s holy , feminine demands upon our manly honor and vigor—
1	so you also intend to adopt any children there may be—which is to say , legitimate them ?
1	the consul drew on his cigar till it glowed , leaned his head back , and let out the smoke
1	in every vital movement there are demonic forces hidden alongside the ordering qualities
1	one can not say , however , that adrian was unqualifiedly receptive to the little boy 's wishes
1	we have to do something !
1	but he ’ s right , it ’ s even obvious to me that in comparison to you folks up here i ’ m downright green—whereas i never really noticed it at home
1	after all its ordeals , the motif , this d-g-g , undergoes a gentle transformation
1	but do not think less of them for it !
1	and in a beleaguered voice she blurted , what does that man want from me !
1	she didn ’ t answer , didn ’ t even look at him—but silently moved the upper part of her body a little closer to him on their cushion of sand , and morten kissed her slowly and formally on the mouth
1	i came on business … but who could resist
1	it did not appear as if any such objections had found their way to our host
1	the liibeck production of love 's labour 's lost , as unsuccessful as it had been , together with the mere existence of the brentano cycle , had had its own quiet effect and had begun to lend adrian 's name a certain esoteric , if rather tentative renown in the innermost circles of art-though even that was hardly the case in germany and not at all in munich , but only in other , more receptive places
1	he had to complete it all on his own , and he did so
1	and your good cousin should measure , too
1	and all the while there sat feddermann at his desk , big as life , flicking peas in all directions
1	but adrian apparently intended to use precisely these
1	scrambling over the slippery rocks , the visitors moved closer now , and stood there wet with spray , wrapped in misty vapor , their ears crammed and sated with noise ; they exchanged glances and intimidated smiles ; they shook their heads and watched the spectacle , this continuous catastrophe of hurling foam , with its deafening , insane , extravagant roar that frightened and confused them , baffled their ears
1	i assume it ’ s of no further importance
1	but for now , it was i who had been entrusted with a message and i gladly carried out my assignment
1	she paid him no regard , but he devoured her at close range with eyes full of profound sadness
1	karoline stöhr was a dreadful person
1	in short , she confessed a painful distrust of his seriousness , his professions of sympathy , his attentions-when you were sick , for instance , and he would come to see you
1	morten stared in bewilderment at the gentleman ’ s pink face—and muttonchops that looked as if they had been powdered with the same dust used to gild walnuts at christmas
1	of all the teachers , he demanded the most discipline ; his critical eyes would pass down the rows of students , who had to stand at attention and provide sharp , curt answers to his questions
1	and hans castorp had flinched
1	and in your ignorance , your gaze falters , for no organ , no internal sense , can tell you for sure
1	ultimately it contained no less than seven hundred seventy hymns , including some with a vast number of stanzas
1	and of course they could not conceal—indeed , found it irresponsible to be silent about—the fact that little johann was horribly slow learning to walk and talk
1	broad the waves , thomas buddenbrook said , ah , see them surging , watch them breaking , ever surging , ever breaking , on they come in endless rows , bleak and pointless , filled with woes
1	and how is mama ?
1	it was after supper on an evening in autumn
1	and if he was despondent now , if his energies seemed spent—though not , god grant , forever—was that not the logical consequence of this untenable condition , this unnatural and exhausting contradiction inside him ?
1	new s e c
1	oh , but i am speaking german , even if i am speaking french
1	what ’ s this about gentle irresolution and ambiguity ?
1	as for business matters , i have no choice but to respond as the director of a respected firm , whose owner , sole owner , i have become today
1	the senator promised them a considerable bonus for the coming week and sent them on their way
1	you are a greater man than i but now , with a rising voice , he continued , but i shall accompany you , i shall stand at your side , consul buddenbrook
1	until now , such phrases had been known to come only from the mouth of the late consul
1	ah , i ’ m convinced that he halfway knew about his partner ’ s dealings , that he was not totally ignorant of what state his warehouse was in
1	of the gentlemen conversing at kridwiss 's not a one believed any longer in free institutions , particularly since freedom was a self-contradictory notion , insofar as in order to maintain itself freedom is forced to limit the freedom of its opponents , that is , to negate itself
1	but he paid no attention
1	and should he cry the next day in recoil : 'oh foolish desolation !
1	over the years , the buddenbrooks had grown accustomed to not traveling any distance during the summer , and even the previous spring , when gerda had expressed a wish to visit her father in amsterdam and play a few duets with him again after so many years , her husband had been rather curt in giving his consent
1	the body of sound , though not in any way distorted , had suffered a diminution in perspective ; it was , if one may use a visual comparison for an audible phenomenon , as if one were gazing at a painting through the wrong end of opera glasses , so that it looked distant and small , but without forfeiting any definition of line or brilliance of color
1	i feel so very sorry for you… i really do understand , you know
1	once and for all
1	give me an extension , kesselmeyer
1	naturally , the substance that is forced upward by the application of external influences must have a little something to it to begin with
1	i ’ ve been reading out on the beach and simply didn ’ t keep track of the time
1	there was a pause—the last flame burned lower and lower
1	and indeed naphta was clever at making his points , turning a hymn of praise into something diabolic and presenting himself as the incarnation of abiding , disciplined love , so that once again it had become a pure impossibility to decide where god and the devil , life and death , were to be found
1	but of course , joachim said
1	harmful and damnable influences— the consul continued
1	he scowled and looked clairvoyant
1	yes , that ’ s how it goes
1	yes , i confess my own inner intolerance of this free self-expression-confess it with some surprise , since i normally do not take any delight whatever in the role of moral paragon and faultfinder
1	but it seems to me that the most necessary thing is for you to get away for a bit—you need a little change of scenery
1	manuscript , in my has been
1	she both gave it to him and held it back , so that he took it without actually taking hold of it—raising his hand , very close to the pencil , his fingers ready to grasp it , but not actually grasping ; and the gaze from his leaden eye sockets shifted between the object and clavdia ’ s tartar face
1	oh my , oh my—that was all very pretty , was what any honest man would have to say
1	you ’ ll see , that ’ s exactly what i ’ ll do
1	a bell rang out while the music played on
1	let us rejoice and thank god that we haven ’ t yet come to the same pass as the ratenkamps back then , and that we take our leave from the house under more favorable circumstances
1	there was never , i will admit , a bewitching charm about any of my children
1	and joined together , the two terms—worthy of love and worthy of life—became what one called noble
1	i ’ ll die on the spot before i take one swallow of this—you damned cripple !
1	the best thing would be to introduce her personally to his family , to present her to his loving parents , jealous brothers and sisters , and judgmental aunts for their inspection , and for weeks now he had been working on the arrangements and attempting to gain their approval for such an entrevue-and reported to his sweetheart about his progress both in a series of notes and repeated trips to pforzheim
1	johann buddenbrook had taken no steps against his unscrupulous son-in-law
1	then there was a russo-german insurance agent named anton karlovitch ferge , a good-natured martyr ; and the unhappy , but very flirtatious frau von mallinckrodt , who like the others received flowers and whom hans castorp had even fed porridge on several occasions , with joachim looking on
1	there are surely several people here who know the name
1	you shall have my hand on it , adrian said , when we say goodbye
1	tell us , for once and for all , in precise terms , so that we may know
1	ah , i am the last person to want to praise high society to you
1	he wanted , so he would tell them , to allow his pursuit of music to come more to the fore and so would be transferring to the city where the musical mentor of his school years was working
1	frau antonie gathered up some clothes with the intention of spending the night in the sitting room
1	he looked down at the winding road they had followed up to the sanatorium the evening before
1	not quite tidy , is that it ?
1	such words betrayed equal portions of contempt and envy—a definite , though forgivable , weakness in sesame ’ s character
1	place a good-night kiss upon the brow of this charming woman , young man , he said to hans castorp
1	you make a fool of yourself from morning till night with your indecent babblings
1	as far as little elisabeth went , it was impossible to judge her mood
1	rübsam the newspaper editor is the instigator
1	good heavens , you didn ’ t even allow me to finish what i was about to say , otherwise you would have known that i am quite ready and willing to oblige you as present circumstances allow and will add another ten thousand to the seventy without further ado
1	he is simply phenomenal , our meister is
1	well , hans castorp thought , there ’ s a delphic remark for you
1	frau schweigestill put aside for now the question of price , which turned out to be very moderate , including board and maid service ; she first determined with which of her two visitors that day she was dealing , the writer or the musician , learned ( while obviously mulling over her impressions from that day ) that this was the musician , and then expressed her misgivings about his request , solely in his own interest and from his perspectiveand this too put only in a way that suggested he ought to know what was best for him
1	it won ’ t get you anywhere—trust your uncle
1	he : let it be
1	very differently from what he had expected , but all was lost now
1	just for the pure joy of it , since he was quite alone on the meadow , he let his fingers play at the stops of a woodwind he held to his lips , a clarinet or reed pipe , from which he coaxed gentle , nasal tones , one after the other , purely at random , and yet in a satisfying sequence that rose carelessly into the deep blue sky , beneath which the foliage of a few solitary birches and ashes flickered in the sun as the breeze brushed past
1	i ’ ll just go sit on those stones back there
1	tony wrung her hands and pled with them : now , now , tom—now , now , christian
1	only one ceiling lamp was lit somewhere in the deserted lobby , and the adjoining social rooms were hardly any brighter
1	this room was part of a beer-and-dance hall that belonged to the widow suerkringel , but it was made available to the gentlemen of the council on certain days
1	this immense work does not wish to see belles-lettres neglected , either , at least to the extent that they speak of human suffering
1	and as a way of apologizing silently for feeling embarrassed for him , she drew his arm through hers
1	the mother superior would be so happy to be of service
1	hans castorp rolled the cylindrical coffee mill between his palms
1	the matter is of some concern to you , by the way , he said , turning to joachim
1	or when , upon realizing with whom it is she lives in tenderest wedlock , she says to him : oh my sweet son , you are my only child , you are my husband and my lord , you are both my and my brother 's son , oh my sweet child , and oh thou my god , why didst thou let me be born !
1	with proper interest and , to be sure , some private head shaking , we took it all in and as the sky cleared continued on our way to etta ! , which due to its benedictine abbey , including a baroque church , enjoys solid architectural renown
1	it appeared he was getting ready to set the entirety of holy writ to music written by his recipe ; he was certainly the man to entertain such an idea
1	swiss francs , and that had taken a good two weeks
1	whether it suited him , and how he had organized his studies
1	it may well have been ( i gladly believe it was ) that in other places , in enemy and even allied lands , this short-circuiting of fate was experienced as a catastrophe and grand malheur-a phrase that , once in the field , we so often heard on the lips of french women , who , to be sure , had war on their own soil , in their parlors and kitchens : ah monsieur , ia guerre , que/ grand malheur !
1	but take , above all , his ironic relationship with tonality , how it vexes , desists , disavows , and hovers , its mockery of the key signature
1	he can ’ t possibly be leaving now without first speaking to you and your mama , and if you didn ’ t want him , you should ’ ve sent him on his way afore this
1	with tripping steps , his arms widespread , his head tilted to one side in the pose of a man who wishes to say , here i am !
1	in the days of the first mobilization , of the first declarations of war , he got into the habit of reaching out both hands to his visitor and squeezing them in his own—which deeply touched the nincompoop ’ s heart , if not his head
1	oh , he would almost have been happy if he could have called him that , thought of him as that , if he had been able to despise him as a shallow , empty-headed , and vulgar young man who was working off a normal dose of youthful energy with a little music in order to win ladies ’ hearts
1	and she ’ s not all that well groomed herself , despite the plumed hat
1	it impeded the fever that came with digesting larger meals
1	those were the pleasures in life that didn ’ t cost a cent—it was the same , for example , with scratching your chilblains in the spring , when they itched so deliciously—and you scratched away fervently and brutally until you drew blood , just for the mad pleasure of it
1	till death 's great toll i sometime pay
1	the air was heavy with sweet odors from the tidy , neatly outlined beds , and from the middle of tall purple irises the fountain sent a softly splashing jet into the darkening sky , where the first stars had begun to flicker
1	i came here to get away , to find some peace
1	and politics were bound up with literature , too—or rather they were derived from the oneness of humanity and literature
1	and he did that as well , and they all got to know one another
1	i ’ m no innocent from the country , let me tell you , and , believe me , taken just for itself and out of context , this affair with babbit would not have chased me off
1	his mother had died first , quite unexpectedly , while awaiting the birth of a second child , of an arterial blockage caused by phlebitis , an embolism , dr heidekind had called it , triggering instantaneous cardiac paralysis—she had been sitting up in bed , laughing , and it looked as if she simply toppled over in a fit of laughter , whereas in fact she did it because she was dead
1	we ’ ve got it down better now , but it still happens often enough that we have to pack our bags mortis causa
1	he was doubtless still preoccupied with what he himself had last said
1	life is primarily the oxidation of cell protein , that ’ s where our pretty animal warmth comes from , of which some people have a bit too much
1	after a while settembrini stopped , grasped hans castorp ’ s hand , laid his own other hand atop it , and said , my friend , i will not kill
1	my father was on the board of directors of the büchen line as far back as ’ , which is probably the reason i ’ ve been elected to it at age thirty-two
1	it was the middle of the summer of
1	and , with a pious inward glance to heaven , the consul thought , his rebuke of his father hath brought him no blessing ; and gotthold probably thought much the same thing
1	well , just as you like
1	they both stood like this for a moment , facing one another—he in a pose of honest and imperious rage ; tony pale , trembling , tearful , a moist handkerchief pressed to her mouth
1	granted , his stiff collar and high , white necktie were old-fashioned ; but such a term could never be applied to that marvelous article of clothing—he meant the spanish ruff—of which the former were merely present-day traces
1	to rise then clean and holy
1	twenty degrees , tom said
1	we germans have acquired the term per se from philosophy and use it every day without intending anything very metaphysical
1	my dear son , this is a beautiful day … a beautiful day , she repeated
1	the suggestion that someone feel his face was not at all typical of hans castorp , and even he was embarrassed by it
1	and he wasn ’ t able to say anything before he died ?
1	your chief regard wasme
1	you ’ ve made a mistake
1	i ’ ll just tell the kitchen…
1	in late autumn herr permaneder reappeared on meng strasse—it was decided to delay things no longer
1	there was no end to it
1	no , what do you mean ?
1	he had not the vaguest about the artistic world of tradition found in russian and french ballet , as represented , let us say , by tchaikovsky , ravel , and stravinsky , and was not even remotely aware of ideas such as those that the latter-named russian musician later expressed about classical ballet : as a triumph of measured plan over effusive emotion , of order over chance , as a pattern of consciously apollonian action , it was the paradigm of art itself
1	all motion , however , is circular , hans castorp said
1	her hands—those white , somewhat short , but delicately shaped fingers of the buddenbrooks , with small wrists enclosed by the velvet cuffs of her sleeves—handled knife , fork , and cup with movements that for some reason seemed a little abrupt and hasty
1	no , hans castorp said , taking his seat again at the end of the table between the seamstress and the englishwoman and conscientiously unfolding his napkin—although he was still weighed down by his first breakfast
1	and what do you accuse him of ?
1	it takes longer to get acclimatized here , to get used to all these new impressions
1	his pointed chin was thrust upward toward his nose in a look of wild determination , his gray hair hung ominously over brow and temples , his head was tucked so deep into his shoulders that he had finally succeeded in looking like a hunchback—and he exclaimed , behold me now , prepared to speak unto the people
1	but he was not a jew , and that was the positive thing about him
1	and he hummed them softly at first , but soon was singing at the top of his voice
1	i have passed on with naphta and settembrini into these dangerous mountains
1	but that is only a pretense
1	he had not known what else to do and had written his mother that he felt he must leave london and come home for her to nurse him ; then he had simply quit his job and started on his way
1	that was the wiedemann-sonnenschein affair
1	he stood there , helpless and stiff with cold , steaming like a sweating horse
1	for how could you not !
1	and might have turned the critics around as well
1	with the aid of a sort of metal shoehorn that she pulled from the bag hanging from her belt , she looked down into the patient ’ s throat , asking hans castorp to provide light with the nightstand lamp
1	this was the gastrula , the protozoon , the primal form of all animal life , the primal form of flesh-borne beauty
1	because she is a power , and it is servile to accept her , to reconcile oneself to her—that is , to reconcile oneself to her inwardly
1	perhaps it is forbidden
1	ah , it will not be long , and all that will rain down upon us in overwhelming , raw power , will assault us , stretch us , cramp us , drill us , corrupt us
1	but his diligence at being nice was so evident in his fussy approach that clarissa said haughtily :
1	the imp of satan !
1	i know that by family custom i should marry a merchant , but as a scholar morten is an equally respectable gentleman
1	those idealistic powers of resistance to illness and death , whose defeat by the overwhelming forces of base nature so pained herr settembrini , were absolutely alien to little naphta ; and his method for coping with the deterioration of his body was not sorrow and gloom , but scornful high spirits and an unparalleled aggressiveness , a mania for intellectual doubt , negation , and confusion , all of which severely aggravated the other man ’ s melancholy and daily intensified their intellectual arguments
1	will it have sleeves ?
1	our consent , she said after a pause—it sounded sad , even a little bitter
1	but it ’ s the same with all the families
1	she knew these fairy tales almost by heart—she had read them all too many times over the years—and turned the pages automatically with a moistened index finger
1	what a horrible , senseless , irrational act !
1	you ’ ll see quite a few new sights here , just watch
1	i am against works on the whole
1	i take the liberty of informing you , herr grünlich said very calmly , that my time is limited , that my carriage awaits , and that i have had no choice but to come here to speak but a very few words with you
1	he was a diligent juror , broker , trustee , estate executor—and he wiped the sweat from his brow
1	besides , i am too tall for you
1	one 's heart said-or at least mine said to itself-and how sad !
1	the way each note offers a comforting , kindly hand to the other , the way all things are bound up together , entwined and transformed in their kinship-that is music , and adrian leverkiihn is its youthful master
1	is your summer over now ?
1	there 's something about it that 's not quite right , the doctor said
1	they could see the blackish-red hole at the temple
1	the consul hid the paper in his breast pocket and offered his mother his arm , and they stepped side by side over the threshold into the brightly lit dining room , where the others had just finished finding their places at the long table
1	it is properly called prayer , however , because ultimately it is god whom we thereby address ``
1	there were diggings to be had for ziemssen , he presumed , and the moment the engineer ’ s cousin arrived he should take to his bed forthwith
1	for the queen , determined not to be responsible for baptizing a child so monstrously sired , orders him and his princely cradle to be carefully placed into a barrel-not without the addition of an explanatory legend , plus gold and silver for his education-and entrusted to the waves of the sea , which on the sixth feast day bear him to a cloister presided over by a pious abbot
1	he could not get his fill of gazing , and yet he asked himself anxiously if he was in fact allowed to gaze upon them , if it was not a punishable crime for an outsider—who felt so ugly and clumsy and base—to spy upon such sunny , civilized happiness
1	yes , time is a puzzling thing , there is something about it that is hard to explain
1	jeannette scheurl later told me that upon adrian 's return to the table from one such promenade , inez rodde had said to him :
1	gerda would sit on the other side of the portieres , reading a book or doing needlework , and follow the lessons
1	where he was going and why , was something no one else knew anything about
1	he ’ s apparently a very handsome and elegant man
1	letting his cigarette wander from one corner of his mouth to the other , he lifted an eyebrow and tilted his head to the side
1	the chipper great-aunt had invited her tablemates—that is , the cousins , the teacher , and frau stöhr—to a farewell dinner in the restaurant , a lavish feast with caviar , champagne , and liqueurs , during which joachim had been very quiet , speaking only a few words in almost a whisper , so that the great-aunt , being the benevolent soul she was , told him to cheer up and , suspending the rules of civilized discourse , even addressed him with informal pronouns
1	is it really true , gentlemen ?
1	you would be introduced to the finest circles in hamburg and would live in grand style
1	and you wanted to ride the carousel with me—but i couldn ’ t
1	some diners made for available exits , including the doors to the veranda , although it was very damp and cold outside
1	you have to have your chops for breakfast
1	he ’ s pale as chalk
1	i know how i shall have to conduct myself
1	senator langhals asked , so you live up there , buddenbrook ?
1	hans castorp avoided them
1	settembrini now went on to offer herr naphta some information about the cousins , from which it became apparent that he had previously told him about these young men
1	germans simply have both within them , i replied , otherwise they could not have produced it in those two
1	but all the same—he had a full life behind him , and no poor life , either
1	yes , it ’ s over ten years now since i accepted grünlich
1	he walked hastily to the piano
1	is he seriously ill , then ?
1	everything was intertwined and at cross-purposes , a great general confusion—and hans castorp thought he saw that the disputants would have been less embittered , if during their dispute each had not been the harasser of his own soul
1	the path around the sphere , which had been the subject of tortuously clever conversation at kridwiss 's , that path , by which regress and progress , the old and the new , past and future become one-i saw it realized here in a return that was rich in novelty and moved well beyond the already harmonic art of bach and handel , back into the deeper past of genuine polyphony
1	it is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of strangers -how often during those days of collapse and capitulation did i think and suffer through the bitter truth of that statement ; for as a german man-despite the universalist hue that catholic tradition casts over my relation to the world-
1	meanwhile a transatlantic general has the inhabitants of weimar file past the crematoria of their local concentration camp and declares ( should one say , unjustly ? )
1	it ’ s the old story , he said
1	he had gone about twenty steps when he suddenly felt nauseated
1	sweet milk , buttermilk , sour milk , herr buddenbrook ?
1	the idea scares me , as if it meant doing something wrong
1	their conversation also included the head nurse , the doctors , dr krokowski ’ s lectures—it turned out that james would be able to attend one if he stayed eight days
1	we shall see them no more
1	yes , it could storm , even in this high , peaceful valley
1	the total cost , he whispered , including the spinal anesthetic , would come to one thousand francs , since almost the entire rib cage was involved , six to eight ribs , and the question now was whether it could be seen as a promising investment
1	it was a thoroughly surprising poem that he offered in ventriloquist fashion , while those sitting around recited it aloud in admiration , a magical bit of reality , as limitless as the sea , which was its central theme
1	it was a mere digression , an instructive example to sensitize them to the basics of life , an impromptu fantasy , which he then dropped to turn his official and emphatic emotional engagement back to the immediate demands of the late hour ’ s festive abandon
1	but have you any idea of the pain here in my left side ?
1	he was standing with his partner , herr strunck , and made no effort to greet the consul
1	what they cared about was convincing hans castorp to renounce his abstinence
1	but hanno answered , if there were just one day when herr fritsche didn ’ t smell like sweat and beer , i might let someone talk me into it
1	despite your amiable scoffing at the good , i do not doubt in the least that you also love it
1	a drop of whatever it was-paraffin , or some volatile oil , i do not recall specifically , though i believe it was chloroform-a drop , i say , is not an animal , not even a primitive one , not even an amoeba ; one does not assume that it has an appetite , seeks nourishment , knows to retain what is digestible and refuse what is not
1	ah , behold her flashing eye in the slippery light , he quoted—god only knew from what—and turned to blow a kiss at the embarrassed girl ’ s back
1	what a piece of work is a man , and how easily conscience betrays him
1	and there he stood before them , his cigar held between the first and second fingers of his gigantic right hand
1	the numbers were red ; the lower , tapered end was filled with lustrous , glistening mercury
1	the eyelids are half closed , and the cheeks are no longer flushed with fever as at the start , but have taken on a bluish color
1	they lacked all coherence
1	amneris fervently strives to convince the tenor to renounce his slave girl , tells him it will cost him his life , but in response to her desperate pleas , the tragically infatuated tenor , having already turned his back on life , can only reply : i can not !
1	you would have to go see it for yourself
1	and as if these changes were not enough , mamselle jungmann , ida jungmann , who had served the buddenbrook family for forty years , left now to return to her west prussian homeland and spend the evening of her life with her relatives there
1	their juices had such a repulsive odor and taste that if a predator erred and mistakenly attacked in hopes of a fine meal , it immediately spat the morsel out again with every sign of nausea
1	ida jungmann winced and visibly blanched at that
1	it was well known that the pond was very deep in the middle
1	what are you speaking french for ?
1	look at him , a perfect adult male , an absolute apollo belvedere , to a t but inside , joachim is ill , and outside he ’ s too warm—because of illness
1	no , i have no thought of that , either
1	they climbed , one behind the other , walked out onto the bridge where it hovered just above the curl of the falls , stood at the railing , and waved to their friends below
1	to hell with sensitivities—agreed ?
1	suddenly he wanted so much for it to be night , one of those nights when he was lying in bed with a sore throat and a slight fever , and ida would come to give him something to drink and lovingly lay a fresh compress across his brow
1	ah , it appears someone is in a bad mood
1	the family ’ s rather sparse progeny ?
1	he had not forgotten his knack for imitating the late marcellus stengel , and could talk in that voice for hours
1	you look as if you ’ re not feeling well
1	for the sake of goodness and love , man shall grant death no dominion over his thoughts
1	poor fellow—one might have been tempted to say he had the look of a clairvoyant or a sleepwalker
1	for that , some apparatus would have been needed during the ascent to maintain the tremendous atmospheric pressure to which their bodies were accustomed and adapted-and which ( and what a disconcerting thought it was ! )
1	it was warm in the shop , the damp odor of soil and flowers hung in the air
1	young as he was , he had held the hand of many a stalwart citizen who had consumed his last joint of meat , his last turkey and dressing , and then—whether death came suddenly and unexpectedly in his office chair or after he had suffered a while in his own solid bed—had commended his soul into god ’ s hands
1	your sympathies are with the nobility—and do you want me to tell you why ?
1	perhaps one could find humor in the devouring drop ; but that was certainly not how i felt when it came to certain incredible and eerie natural products that adrian 's father managed to breed from some bizarre culture , and which he likewise permitted us to observe
1	the nation 's larger theaters were not interested in her ; she was unsuccessful or had no real success , for the simple reasonhowever hard it may be for the person involved to grasp it-that her natural talent did not match her ambition
1	he had given a concert in nuremberg and his rendition of the partita in e major by bach ( for solo violin ) had created quite a sensation both with the audience and the press
1	i offer it as a suggestion
1	i won ’ t survive it , she said , sinking down on a chair , and sat there perfectly still
1	he had been holding a piece of cake between his fingers as he spoke , but now he laid it back on his plate , unwilling to take a bite after such questions
1	he does have a distinguished look about him , he said , and the inhaled smoke tumbled out with the words
1	but he was not to be thrown off
1	but let me tell you this , i ’ ll repeat once more : i could not care less if you personally make a fool of yourself ; but i forbid you , do you hear me , i forbid you ever to compromise the firm in the manner in which you did yesterday evening
1	financial reasons spoke for this as well
1	it grew cooler by the minute
1	and his jokes were unmistakably meant primarily for mlle
1	why must it seem to me as if almost all , no , all the means and contrivances of art nowadays are good only for parody ?
1	i am too close to my subject
1	green-est meadowland , fare-thee-well , for good ; and this added c-sharp is the most touching , comforting , poignantly forgiving act in the world
1	he sits there in the lap of success and happiness , full of good cheer and general benevolence—please believe me
1	you don ’ t desire just her torso and the fleshly shell of her body ; in fact , if her face were fashioned just a little differently , why , it ’ s quite possible you wouldn ’ t even want her whole body at all
1	fräulein meyer–de la grange , however , raised her pretty eyebrows and asked , the son of consul buddenbrook ?
1	no , no , as chastisement for such ungodly desires he quoted more long passages from holy scripture , prayed for his parents , his wife , his children , and himself , prayed as well for his brother , gotthold—and finally , after one last bible verse and a final threefold amen , he dusted the page with gold-sand and leaned back with a sigh of relief
1	here-language-is-no longer-purged of flourishes-rather flourishes-of the appearance-
1	a highly fertile hypothesis , the director rejoined
1	that , too , was a discharge of transcendent dynamic power , caused by negligence-the negligence , namely , of david , the king who played his harp far too much and who , in fact , had likewise no longer had any understanding of things and had ordered the ark be conveyed philistine-fashion , by cart , instead of having it borne on long poles
1	but the moment herr settembrini introduced the word justice into the conversation , recommending that high principle as the means by which to prevent catastrophes , both domestic and foreign , naphta—who only a moment before had declared the spiritual as too good ever to find earthly expression worthy of it—endeavored to cast doubt on the very notion of the spiritual and to revile it
1	and they let me get up again only when it became clear that my temperature wasn ’ t going away with bed rest
1	someone hearing about it later imagines how ghastly it must have been , but forgets that illness—and my present situation is more or less an illness—batters its victim until they get along with one another
1	and , finally , he saw me whenever i spent a weekend with him-and that was all
1	and when he forced himself to look , he was staring into nothing , into white , whirling nothing
1	just be prepared—you won ’ t be able to hear yourself think
1	he , wehsal , was not the one who would be shot at from that distance , and so it was easy for him to be bloodthirsty—and so on
1	he ( calm and with a player 's persuasive laugh ) : what nonsense !
1	our hometown and st boniface gymnasium and had dropped i n on him from time to time
1	he repeatedly stretched out his right arm , the one with the gold bracelet around the wrist , until it was at about his hip , then raised his hand slightly and pulled it back again along the blanket with a raking or scraping motion , as if he were collecting or gathering something
1	and how happy it must make you that you can be helpful in eradicating human suffering
1	the ether of space—that was exact , was it ?
1	that to strive for it is the highest law of morality ?
1	that god may help the poorer folk
1	and yet , what is the latin word for moisture ?
1	if i did , however , i would laugh right in the face of any ignorant humanitarian who tried to keep me on a diet of pap until i died in my bed
1	names were suggested and rejected
1	death his name is-a rigorous limitation that proved an extraordinary
1	tony sat there , frozen in place
1	this came as a total surprise to adrian ; kretzschmar was enjoying the fun of leaving adrian in the dark , who still suspected nothing even while underway with his teacher from basel to the try-out in geneva
1	on a sunday morning , around nine o ’ clock , the consul was sitting near the window of the breakfast room at the large brown secretary , whose rounded top he had rolled back by tripping a tiny mechanism
1	custom , however , held her in check
1	it helped if settembrini was not present for such lectures
1	i wish to insist on the term at the disposal of and on the expansive gesture that went with it
1	as part of your formal training , as they say
1	no , there was even a certain something about him , about consul buddenbrook
1	dr krokowski said , arriving from the russian barbarians ’ balcony and stepping up to the head of hans castorp ’ s lounge chair ; and as on every other day , the patient lying there with his hands folded across his chest smiled up in amiable vexation at the ghastly word comrade and gazed at the doctor ’ s yellow teeth revealed beneath his black beard
1	you find it difficult to imagine strangers living here ; but it will be better if you don ’ t have to watch
1	several , certainly , joachim replied
1	i ’ ve never set much store by appearances
1	he was terribly agitated
1	hans castorp , at least , was inclined to believe it was so
1	we merely deliver and set free
1	it was quite certain that upon hearing of a catastrophe in her son 's life she would hasten to join him , and if some calming was to be expected , it seemed only humane to spare her the shocking , indeed unbearable sight of her child 's condition , as yet unimproved by institutional care
1	such a velocity of life was some consolation for joachim in light of the five months that still awaited him—if five would in fact be the end of it
1	-which likewise soun�ed very hard
1	there you have it , he said , your music
1	where did i get that beautiful bay with those islands , and the temple precincts , to which the eyes of that lovely lad who stood off by himself directed me ?
1	you did dream about lovely minka , your russian miss , didn ’ t you ?
1	you seem quite at home in eternity , know its every detail , no doubt
1	i ’ ve heard people mention it here and there
1	an international union of freemasons does not exist
1	these customs taxes—one must try to avoid them whenever one can
1	then she set her glasses on her nose , undid the colossal book ’ s two leather clasps , opened it to the bookmark , revealing a heavy , coarse , yellowed page of huge print , took a sip of sugar-water , and began to read the christmas story
1	no , i told you already , he ’ s never been seen up here once
1	prosecutor paravant and both magnuses were still in the lobby
1	if you simply draw it slanted and slit , all is lost
1	adrian leverkiihn plus the town-together that most definitely equaled theology
1	he might come to the table for instance and , with his first spoonful of fruit soup swimming with cherries , bite down hard on a stone , chipping the crown of a tooth
1	'' i am not turning things around , i am stating them as they are !
1	theology declares the soul is from god , that is philosophically correct , for as the principle that forms each individual manifestation it is a part of the pure form of being-in-general , arising out of the thought that eternally thinks itself , which we call 'god
1	his smile probably likewise expressed teasing amusement at a certain resistance to his narrative on my part , which must have been noticeable , for he was well aware of my lack of interest , bordering on distaste , for the pranks and mysteries of natural phenomena , for nature in general , and of my devotion to the sphere of humane letters
1	she laughed , but then made a more serious face
1	everyone wanted to revise the constitution and amend the qualifications for voting—and the old citizens were wrangling
1	do you know him in the world beyond , and are you prepared to bring him to us ?
1	herr naphta removed guilt and merit from the empirical world to the metaphysical
1	spraying brown tobacco juice about the room and constantly hitching at his trousers , their spokesman went on about hundurd years and many a hundurd years more in a frantic voice
1	he hacks away at everything around him , and i can ’ t help it—that always makes things rather untidy and disorderly
1	it was so still that they could hear a distant barrel organ—like the sound from a tinkling music box , it drifted in from some snowy street
1	whoever might be able to achieve the-how would you put it ?
1	though in some sense extravagant , nonetheless has a noble , harmonious , and humanely healthy character and ring , and someone such as myself-to the extent that he makes no claim that his own person has any share in that exalted region or has ever been graced with divinis influxibus ex alto-should see no reasonable argument for shying from it , no point in not speaking of it and dealing with it , while casting a cordial upward glance of reverent familiarity
1	was it sentimentality for music-which stood for all art-to demand , with growing awareness , that it step out of its worthy isolation and find a sense of the communal without becoming common , to speak a language that a man untutored in music could also understand , as he had once understood the wolf 's glen scene , the bridal wreath scene , wagner ?
1	even the oeverdiecks had become quite loud and lively
1	he asked , leaning belligerently on his cue
1	a stroke , he would say , a paralytic stroke , a sudden and unpredictable death
1	allow me to remark , that every sort of torture , every bit of bloody justice , that does not arise from a belief in the next world is bestial nonsense
1	here , too , he said , tugging at the red ribbon in the volume of kleist lying on the table , the issue of breakthrough is dealt with , in the splendid essay on marionettes , to be precise , where it is specifically called
1	he would offer such comments with self-assured vigor , while nonchalantly rubbing his hands and leaning back to one side against the arm of his chair
1	and , being a man of business , he deigns to despise me
1	he was not at all used to philosophizing , and yet felt some urge to do so
1	hans castorp said he had expected herr naphta would know how to react in defense of executions
1	herr settembrini did not reply
1	well , she spends a month here and complains of feeling very ill just be patient !
1	it is my wish to spare you the initial unpleasantnesses and to take you and our little erika home for now
1	moreover , the teachers of the early church had never wearied of warning people against the lies of the philosophers and poets of antiquity , and in particular against sullying themselves with the lush eloquence of a virgil
1	yes , tony said , that ’ s all very fine
1	from them , or from one of them-he left the choice to me-life had come at some point , whether borne by cosmic missiles or simply by force of radia-
1	house , passing good for very fine , and a titch for a little bit
1	hans castorp flinched as the door opened at his back
1	he watched closely as they took their leave of colonel herr von rinnlingen , the local commander , who assured the senator that he was very honored by such a visit and that it was much appreciated , and took note of the way his father amiably but somewhat apprehensively laid an arm around the colonel ’ s shoulder for a moment ; at another home a similar remark was received with a calm , serious look , and at a third with an ironically exaggerated returned compliment
1	it ’ s quite simple , once you can actually see it
1	in sum , we purvey merely that for which the classical poet , the most worthiest of all , so prettily thanked his gods : all they give , do the gods , do the unending gods , to their darlings , entire :
1	but herr grünlich blocked her exit
1	only in the lubeck market courier did an old professor of music named jimmerthal ( doubtlessly long since deceased ) speak of an error in judgment that time would set right , and in a quaint , old-fashioned style declared the opera to be a work full of profound music that contained the future within it , its composer certainly a mocker , but at the same time a godwitted man
1	life was both stylish and monastic
1	tom , she said with soft , touching determination , recovering her voice despite the tears that threatened to choke it , you can ’ t know how i feel at this moment , you can ’ t know
1	what hans castorp found amazing , however , was that joachim would refer at all to dr krokowski ’ s botany , for they spoke as little of the psychoanalyst as they did of clavdia chauchat or marusya—they never alluded to him , passing over his ways and works in silence
1	five million subscribers , the memorandum continued , would therefore in the course of twenty years recycle newspaper worth the immense sum of three hundred million marks , two-thirds of which would be applied to renewing subscriptions , making them much cheaper , and one-third , around one hundred million marks , made available for humanitarian purposes—to finance tuberculosis sanatoriums for the general public , to subsidize struggling artists , and so forth
1	in her present state , she was quite incapable of sharing his distress
1	tony did not appear to have paid any attention to his answer
1	without war the world would soon go to rot , as moltke said
1	and turning his whole upper body to the left , he opened his bloodshot eyes wide
1	for suffering 's impotence and affliction have swelled till illusion 's games can no longer be endured
1	unfortunately everything was political nowadays , there was no intellectual purity left
1	at this point another group of guests left the room : little helmut institoris , who , pale and with his lower lip drawn tightly against his teeth , got up in silent protest ; plus his friends , nottebohm the smooth portraitist and his wife , a buxom woman of marked bourgeois manners whom we used to call the maternal breast
1	he had not failed to include a mole just where the breasts began , and between their soft swellings there was a hint of pale bluish veins
1	alchemy—making gold , the philosopher ’ s stone , aurum potabile
1	i beg you , don ’ t give the boy ideas
1	he opened the upholstered door to his private office , closed it behind him once they were both inside , and gave his sister a questioning look
1	it was a time when our own priests wanted to breathe the spirit of catholic hierarchy into freemasonry , and there was even a flourishing jesuit lodge at clermont , in france
1	all the same , it ’ s a sign of a rather weak will , joachim said , to be so dependent on tobacco
1	it would be difficult to describe the play of emotions on johann buddenbrook ’ s face
1	but individual groups of members on more intimate terms would also be formed for hikes ; and so , together with a couple of the better fellows , we both joined in on repeated occasions
1	and at this naphta begged them to forgive him for laughing out loud
1	the far-traveled client of my small folk was not warned , was he ?
1	slander-once again , my friend !
1	that this nervous condition should appear on solemn occasions , under the influence of emotion and excitement , is understandable
1	prayer , dr breisacher concluded implacably , is a late formvulgarized and watered down by rationalism-of what was once very energetic , active , and strong : the magical invocation , the coercion of god
1	he called out in a voice that chilled me to the marrow
1	orders were given at the inn to have the carriage ready in an hour , since they would want to rest for an hour or so before sitting down to dinner in town ; and then they slowly strolled in the hot , dusty sunshine toward the low roofs of the village
1	the stork , definitely a very strong , muscular stork , had brought all sorts of marvelous things besides their new sister : for thomas , a new sealskin school bag ; for antonie , a large doll with real—how extraordinary ! —real hair ; a colorful picture book for well-behaved klothilde , who in her quiet , grateful way was occupied almost exclusively with a bag of sweets that the stork had also brought ; and for christian , an entire puppet theater , complete with sultan , death , and the devil
1	our conversation took place on the community bench atop mount zion , its maple trees shading us from the afternoon autumn sun
1	then hanno would laugh , too , in quiet , deep amusement ; for , without even looking at one another or saying a word as they sat there high above it all , they were united in the opinion that his sermons were rather foolish babble and that the real worship service was something that the pastor and his congregation probably thought of as a mere adjunct for elevating the mood of devotion—and that something was music
1	they were spoken of disparagingly and considered inferior by local standards , not only by those of higher or highest rank , but also by those who themselves were only mildly ill—which allowed them to shrug off their own cases ; while at the same time , by subjecting themselves to such standards , they were able to preserve and enhance their own self-esteem
1	when memory failed him , he made do by singing the melody to nonsense syllables and words , tossing them off into the air with the splendid back-rolled r and well-rounded vowels of opera singers , and at last moved on simply to fantasizing both text and music and accompanying these vocalizations with theatrical gestures
1	herr kesselmeyer cried , waving his hands in the air
1	here— she said and rummaged in her bag again , pulling out two longish leather cases , one black , one red , which she also laid on the table now
1	yes , christian replied , that ’ s only proper
1	thus saith the untransmogrified sammael
1	which brought him back to the topic of his growing family and his small house
1	flirtatious nature like schwerdtfeger 's , familiarity 's triumph over loneliness had from the start , whether consciously or not , had that special meaning and coloring-which is not to say that it lacked other nobler motives as well
1	country 's condition was still good , fortified by hope , and i was still in the field ) and was executed with all the proper bourgeois trimmings : a civil and a church ceremony , a wedding dinner at the hotel vier jahreszeiten , and the subsequent departure of the young couple for a trip to dresden and saxon switzerland-the culmination of a long mutual testing , which had evidently led to the conclusion that they were surely suited to one another
1	he goes to hamburg , sits down next to christian ’ s bed , and wins him over
1	who have swum in close just for a lark
1	how singularly the years in which i write now close ranks with those that frame this biography !
1	he could feel detachment and security—and the blind intoxication of self-production that made success possible—only if he was half blinded by light in his eyes , which turned other people , his audience , into no more than a shadowy mass in front of him , to whom he could then present himself as a genial , sociable man , an energetic man of business , the dignified head of his firm , the public speaker
1	and hans castorp sat down beside him , hiding his sympathetic surprise—if indeed genuine admiration was not the emotion his sense of justice demanded of him—behind amiable , bright chatter , which peeperkorn seconded with magnificent scraps of conversation and very compelling gestures
1	the thunderstorm cleared , and frau chauchat intervened as well , calling her traveling companion ’ s attention to the general decline in conviviality
1	yet what great compensation , to be sure , what a grand opportunity for flirting in the higher sense of
1	and he took frau chauchat ’ s hand from where it lay on the tablecloth and lifted it to his lips , then laid it back down and let his own hand rest atop it for a while
1	i don ’ t smoke cigars , and i hope i won ’ t need to have any suits made for me up here , thanks all the same
1	my good engineer , my good engineer , the italian said , bending his head forward thoughtfully and letting his black eyes set
1	he took a kind of embarrassed delight in telling about the first time he had approached the town hall in dress uniform and had waited until he was well past before saluting to release the sentry from stiff attention
1	faces quickly took on higher and higher color from the truly marvelous wine—with the exception of dr ting-fu ’ s
1	after initial tokens of concealment and defensiveness , adrian very soon offered his childhood friend access to his accomplishments and endeavors , so that with each visit to pfeiffering ( and of course i came by as often as i could , almost every saturday and sunday ) i was allowed to partake of new sections of the work being born-drafts that grew at times to incredible size from one visit to the next , so that , especially when one took into account a compositional style subject to the strictest laws of intellectual and technical complexity , a person accustomed to a work 's progressing at a stolid , proper bourgeois pace might readily turn pale with horror
1	but nevertheless , one would like to keep in touch , hear something of one another , by mail i mean
1	music always does prior penance for its sensual realization
1	we ’ re all weak human beings with sinful hearts , and if they want to look down on me as a miserable worldly woman , why , i ’ ll just laugh in their faces
1	dressing gowns suddenly appeared—two dressing gowns , one for her and one for erika , made of soft , knitted fabric , with broad trains and a band of close-set velvet bows , from neck to hem !
1	he left halle a day earlier than i , and we had spent his final evening at the theater-just the two of us , without anyone from winfried along ; he would be leaving the next morning , and we parted there on the street as we had hundreds of times before-we simply went in different directions
1	things were quite different , however , when she wrote-and she had an extraordinary love of writing
1	he : who says so ?
1	a citizen ’ s first duty is to stay calm , and impatience never helps anything
1	all the same , he would pale at the thought that the whole thing might turn out to be a pointless folly , and even admitted to himself that his present home was more than large enough for himself , his wife , his child , and the servants
1	of course , of course , consul kröger said , for tears had come to her eyes
1	that , needless to say , makes a great difference
1	after ten minutes , the doctor returned with the three ladies from his inner office
1	your serious and important matter appears to come down to some sort of advance on the harvest at pöppenrade , if i ’ m not mistaken
1	no sooner had you clasped your hands behind your head to gaze at the ceiling and pursue some passing thought than the gong sounded for those who were not bedridden or moribund to get ready for the day ’ s main meal
1	there was something objectively natural and agreeable in the way , for instance , that her dark brown hair , heavy at the nape , was left free at the ears and drawn back from the brow and delicate temples-and that was true of her hands as well , sensibly beautiful hands , not dainty at all , but slender and small-boned , the wrists encircled by the simple cuffs of a white silk blouse
1	but now that joachim had fallen silent , with the muscles in his face working so hard , and begun behaving as he just had , hans castorp took fright , because he understood that the officer was man enough to act—turned pale with fright , for both of them , for both joachim and himself
1	a nice , funny young man—ha ha ha , ha ha ha—and what had happened ?
1	there can be no doubt about that
1	but what a shame , really , that you don ’ t want to stay through the winter with us—want to spend a mere eight weeks , i ’ ve heard , correct ?
1	and the consul puts a hand on his shoulder and gives him a thaler
1	what sums he had not already spent of his mother ’ s inheritance—half the interest from which had always found its way to hamburg—were now administered by herr stephan kistenmaker , who had been appointed to that office by his deceased friend ’ s will
1	their situation in the confines of the two-ton hollow ball was anything but comfortable , their compensation being the knowledge that their shelter was absolutely dependable : built perfectly watertight , it was equal to the enormous pressures and came equipped with an ample supply of oxygen , a telephone , high-powered searchlights , and quartz windows for viewing on every side
1	i wanted some of those pretty colored stars that jellyfish have inside them
1	did his listener know what a deed was ?
1	that requires a quiet enthusiasm that is sweeter and more pleasant , more gratifying than any secret love
1	you said things of such great stature in regard to the terrors of inadequacy , that i find myself quite confounded
1	we had to win , and this was the hard business of winning
1	after that great show of provocation and dissonance , the way it 's all turned into geniality and beer hall bonhomie , all put in apple-pie order , so to speak , reconciling the philistine and assuring him nothing nasty was intended
1	he replied , never , clavdia
1	let ’ s get married right away , too ; separately , i mean
1	it was a musical apparatus
1	but the fact is : it ’ s impossible
1	confessional history ; the middle years are devoted to systematics , which is to say , philosophy of religion , dogmatics , ethics , and apologetics ; toward the end come the practical disciplines , meaning liturgics , homiletics , catechetics , the care of souls , the study of church order and law
1	when she told one of her students , doon ’ t bee seelly , chawld ! , while rapping the table with the knuckle of her index finger—that left an impression , no doubt of it
1	now and then , when i have time , just in passing , as it were , and not that i neglect my own rest-cure duties , i look in on the serious and critical cases—you know , the ones who come here not for their own amusement and a loose life , but to die
1	we ’ ll not be going out in society for a while , and we ’ re not giving any dinners ourselves
1	but the consul responded with approval : a combination of qualities quite becoming to any gentleman
1	you haven ’ t the least notion how repulsively egoistic that is of you and that someday it may well make you the enemy of humankind
1	mynheer spoke in an unusually precise and compact style this afternoon , despite his fatigue from the malign attack of fever
1	now you ’ re getting flippant , tony
1	they saw his head tilt to one side , saw the ragged bitterness on his lips , the image of the man of sorrows
1	and to christian , make something of yourself !
1	it is the end , the despair of hell itself , doomsday
1	working from previous experience in the field , they were planning to construct a model crematorium and hall of urns , and the hope was that it would encourage further far-reaching developments
1	you have already disgraced this family enough , sir , without your forcing us to have a courtesan for a sister-in-law and giving her children our name
1	around r o a french critic of some repute , an ardent admirer of beethoven until the ninth symphony , declared that work to be under the sway of a wearied mind , the dark pedantry of an ungifted contrapuntist
1	on a chaise longue whose foot was turned toward me , so that i could look directly into his face , there lay , under a light woolen blanket , the man who had once been adrian leverkiihn , and whose immortal part now bears that name
1	he let his hand drift down from her head in a gentle stroke along her shoulder , to her arm , and fastening his exotic brown eyes on her bright blue ones , he submerged his gaze in hers
1	cheated , the little minx says—cheated out of everything in life at this cozy resort
1	madame buddenbrook , who no longer liked to travel—apart from her summer journeys , which were more and more restricted to the shores of the baltic in any case—wrote to say she was sorry that she would be unable to visit her daughter at this time , but assured her that god would lend his aid
1	certainly , i ’ m surely not mistaken
1	but hans castorp ’ s posture had stiffened as well now
1	once they had all solemnly gathered in the landscape room , while the servants and all sorts of poor and old people had crowded into the entrance hall downstairs to have their blue and ruddy hands shaken by the consul , the choirboys of st mary ’ s would strike up a carol in four-part harmony—it was so festive that it simply made her heart pound
1	his mother echoed , freezing in place
1	your informative letter has just reached me , and i hasten to thank you most warmly for the consideration you have shown in asking my consent in the matter at hand ; it goes without saying that i am not only happy to give it , but wish also to add my heartiest congratulations , being fully confident as i am that both you and clara have made an excellent choice
1	and in general i would not in any way wish to offend that little gentleman 's natural sense of honor
1	she paged back to the end of the large notebook , where on a coarse folio page the whole genealogy of the buddenbrooks was recapitulated in the consul ’ s hand—with parentheses , rubrics , and clearly recorded dates : from the marriage of their earliest ancestor to brigitta schuren , a pastor ’ s daughter , to the wedding of consul johann buddenbrook and elisabeth kröger in
1	but retreat , decline , the beginning of the end
1	far better , really , if that will were to drift free in a night without time or space , than to languish in a prison cell lit only by the flickering , uncertain flame of the intellect
1	after he had eaten and drunk his milk or malted beer up in the room , and his mother had left to join the other guests for supper out on the hotel ’ s glassed-in veranda , he slipped between those old , thin sheets and , to the soft , strong pumping of his contented heart and the muted rhythms of the evening concert , sank into sleep , without fear or fever
1	when he paused briefly at this point , hans castorp of course asked in feigned amazement , warn us about what ?
1	herr grünlich sat at the edge of the sofa—back straight , hat on knee , ulster still buttoned tight
1	whenever she referred to that landlady in her letters , written half in german , half in french , she called her mother manardi , mere manardi
1	quite right , the zodiac
1	and in reply to joachim ’ s account , he had uttered just two words in italian
1	oh , dr langhals had sent him for his nerves , thomas buddenbrook replied
1	farm , where adrian took extended walks with him and talked jonathan leverkiihn into showing his guest chladni 's sonorous figures and the devouring drop
1	one could not really call dorf a village ; at least , nothing except the name itself was left now
1	one must have the firm conviction that the gentleman is truly honest , and noble , and kindhearted
1	the opposite is closer to the truth
1	our tony should follow your example
1	homo dei—that had been ugly naphta ’ s term for the sublime image when he was defending it against english social theory
1	already by the beginning of his fourth semester , i saw signs that my friend was thinking of cutting his theological study short , even before his first exams
1	the ceremony took place in the social room with the optical toys
1	therese weichbrodt , however , took his head in both hands , kissed him on each cheek with a soft popping sound , and said in a voice so sincere that god himself would have found it irresistible , be heppy , you good chawld !
1	that is an exaggeration
1	they took rabbit ’ s feet up with them , or kept a crow on board ; they would spit three times this way and that , wore gloves of lucky fellow pilots
1	when do you mean ?
1	faith , a world view , an idea—in short , the will—is always present , and it is then reason ’ s task to examine and prove it
1	sat alone here in these halls , near unto the windows , their shutters closed tight , the length of the room before me , and by my lamp read kierkegaard on mozart 's don juan
1	it comes from an era of superstitious contrition , when the idea of humanity was demeaned and distorted into a caricature , a fearful era , when harmony and health were considered suspicious and devilish , whereas infirmity in those days was as good as a passport to heaven
1	you ’ ll get a free copy , castorp
1	i find it terribly catholic—erasing god
1	a few days passed , and young hans castorp had now spent seven months up here , whereas joachim , who already had five months to his credit when his cousin first arrived , could now look back on twelve months , one round year—round in the cosmic sense , as well , for in the time since the small , sturdy locomotive had dropped him off up here , the earth had returned to its starting point , having completed one orbit around the sun
1	i can still picture some of them : the figure of thomas the stableboy , for example , the same fellow who would meet us at the station in weissenfels and drive us back as well-a one-eyed man , and though exceptionally bony and tall ; afflicted with a humpback that sat very high , on which he would frequently let little adrian ride ; it had been , so the meister often later assured me , a very practical and comfortable seat
1	the lad simply will not detoxify
1	it was as if clarissa saw in rudolf a kind of suitor , who had to
1	i simply asserted that a good portion of virtuosity , whether foreign or not , played a role in wagner 's internationally quite popular art-and then charitably diverted him from the topic by mentioning an article on the problems of proportion in gothic architecture that he had recently published in the magazine art and artist
1	it would start up again with amazing regularity at almost every meal—it was impossible to stop and hard to hide
1	he was a bony man , a good three heads taller than dr krokowski , with a shock of white hair ; his neck vertebrae stuck out , and his watery , bloodshot blue eyes protruded ; he had a snub nose above a little short-cropped moustache , which sat slightly askew because his upper lip was turned up at one corner
1	i saw the skeleton of my own hand , hans castorp said , trying to recall the emotions that had stirred in him at the sight of it
1	herr albin , you ’ re young , you ’ ll get well again , you ’ ll enjoy life again in a circle of friends who love you , i swear you will !
1	hans castorp telegraphed back
1	countless familiar faces gazed up from the rows , and when i stood up i found many people i had to greet : the schlaginhaufens and the habitues of their receptions , the radbruchs along with schildknapp , jeannette scheurl , mmes
1	from that hour on , the vile restraint laid upon him was lifted , for no sooner had his love been reduced to ashes than free use of his manhood , so sinfully taken from him , was restored to him again
1	she ’ ll be with us at christmas , and we won ’ t let her get so excited this year
1	seating himself astride a footstool placed in front of the dangling screen , the director turned on the lamp
1	well , and now it turns out that i needed a vacation a lot more than he or any of us dreamed i did
1	the brief peace of —the future gestates in its womb
1	the eyes were closed unnaturally tight—pressed closed , hans castorp could not help thinking , not just closed
1	what i am saying is : is he a proper one ?
1	and , once the divorce was granted , she assumed a serious face and approached him , saying , you did enter it in the family records , didn ’ t you , father ?
1	with a cunning that was actually foreign to him , he pretended that fräulein engelhart ’ s enthusiasm for frau chauchat was not in reality what he very well knew it to be , but that her enthusiasm was some neutral , droll fact that he , hans castorp , as an uninvolved party standing off at a cool , amused distance , could use to tease the old maid
1	and commensurably deep , venerably deep , is likewise his descent at intervals-not only into emptiness and waste and rich sorrow , but also into pain and nauseas-companions , by the by , who were always there , who are part of the propensity , yet now most worthily enhanced by illumination and sensible pot-valiance
1	and at the sight , hans castorp ’ s whole heart opened wide—painfully , lovingly wide
1	excuse me , hans castorp said , to the devil ?
1	his brain , which worked calmly and slowly—particularly since hans castorp retained the habit of drinking porter with his morning snack—gradually filled up with analytical geometry , differential equations , mechanics , projective geometry , and graphical statics
1	he needed his winter overcoat and both camel-hair blankets for his rest cure , and not just of an evening , but during the day , too
1	he also tended to believe in the infinite duration of the state and mood in which he happened to find himself at a given moment , cherished it for just that reason and was not eager for change
1	good god in heaven !
1	thanks to elia ’ s foresight , the family was not entirely penniless when they at last came to rest in a little town in vorarlberg , where frau naphta found a job in a cotton mill , at which she worked as long as her strength allowed
1	defiant , emphatic-elan raised to the sublime ?
1	there ’ s no telling , joachim replied matter-of-factly
1	beg your pardon , h e said , but barbarism i s the antithesis of culture only within a structure of thought that provides us the concept
1	finally , after another month in a convalescent home for wounded soldiers in the taun : us , i did not resist the view that i had fulfilled my patriotic duty and could serve better by resuming my old post of maintaining the educational system
1	i don ’ t rightly know if i should consider myself flattered by the term , but it does sound pretty , i must say
1	everyone felt the touch of an icy finger deep inside , even hans castorp , who was late in finding his way to his splendid lounge chair that evening ; he stretched out and recalled how , as he watched elly ’ s unseemly achievements and listened to her embarrassed explanation , the ground had shifted under his feet , making him feel a little queasy and anxious all over , like a slight touch of seasickness
1	do you have any objection ?
1	elisabeth was determined never to be a white-haired lady
1	i am uncertain whether what i intend by using that term—i might suggest a cordial for the heart ’ as an alternative , if that term did not likewise run the danger of being taken in a more common , thoughtless sense—but that set-tles it , rentia
1	you defended constellation that day
1	tom says that jean would never have permitted him simply to abandon his post in valparaiso
1	a caustic , tormented spirituality drifted toward him in those words ; probing deeper , he discovered both knowledge and a maliciously elegant mode of thought—all the more surprising , given the young man ’ s tattered exterior
1	just once , in the brentano cycle , he said , in the song 'oh sweet maiden
1	through the good offices of sister berta they were admitted to the dead man ’ s room , which was on the second floor , directly under their own
1	an inconsistent gift , the reader will say , for how could i , as a cultivated , ethical man , have anything to do really with that romantic poet 's childish and folkloric dreams ,
1	in the same way , her neck was set in the circle of a flat collar and rose up out of it like a round , indeed chiseled , column and was crowned by the charmingly tapered oval of her ivory-toned face with its delicate and wellshaped nose , remarkable for the animated flair of its nostrils
1	and who had also greeted her with obvious delight , only then to spend the great bulk of his time conversing with his dear jeannette and the social democratic member of parliament , who was a serious and knowledgeable admirer of bach
1	the interesting thing about him was that he never took a sandwich to school for his snack , but a lemon bun—a soft , oval milk pastry with raisins—and , to make matters worse , he would top it with tongue sausage or breast of goose
1	he added as a heartfelt reproach and accompanied the words with a quick snapping movement of one hand , as if he were catching a fly
1	i mean the descent into hell
1	and you ’ ll wake me at six ?
1	you give them occasion to do so at every step-not so much at the beginning , in the days of cette 'phosphorescence de la mer '
1	and in what form or mask did suppressed and unsanctioned love reappear ?
1	it may be that shouting orders at drill could have created a locus minoris resistentiae
1	the philosopher , de anima : 'actions by an actor are performed on one previously disposed to suffer them
1	each had his beauty and honor , he thought , trying all the harder to be fair because he knew his own personal or partly personal biases
1	fitelberg , that is a downright wretched little polish-german-jewish name ; except that i have made it the name of a respected champion of avant-garde culture and , i may say , of a friend of great artists
1	the three had been waiting before the cousins ’ arrival and presumably had precedence on the appointment list
1	we can not oppose you , because any objections we might raise aren ’ t arguments , just sentimentalities , that ’ s clear as day
1	natural interrelations of life and theonomous bond were typical affectations ; one could have put it more simply , but then it would not have been the language of their theological science
1	that 's a teacher for you
1	and mother lying in the next room !
1	what were you thinking of ?
1	we stopped , and guided by a steward we toured the suite of small , overladen , ostentatious chambers that form this fantasy castle 's living quarters , where the melancholic man spent his days , filling them with nothing but the idea of his own majesty , letting von bulow play the piano for him , and listening to kainz 's enchanting voice
1	what do you mean ?
1	the air is simply marvelous !
1	i am well aware that i wrote those empty , premature names under compulsion
1	the satisfaction that old age and infirmity prevent me from offering you by means of weapons , i now offer you in this form ; i offer it in the form of a bond of brotherhood , of the sort that is usually established against a third party , against the world , against someone else , but which we shall establish in our feelings for someone
1	he did not have the least compunction about using this method—he found it perfectly in order , never even suspected he was playing favorites
1	i may be a silly woman , but i ’ ve learned one thing about myself and others , and that is that one only gets upset and angry when one is not quite sure of one ’ s own power to resist an idea and is tempted deep down inside to go along with it
1	do you see the hilum there ?
1	how did such noble sadness square with the rest of holger ’ s behavior , hans castorp wondered , with his unimaginative childish pranks and silly practical jokes , with that unmelancholy slap , for example , to which the prosecutor had been subjected ?
1	the rock wall directly behind the hut was steep and dotted with scattered groups of trees , but it could be circumvented by following what looked like a moderate climb on the right , from where you would then be able to see what lay beyond ; and hans castorp set out to research the matter , leaving the open field with the hut behind him and skiing down into a rather deep ravine that dropped off from right to left
1	—he is silent for a moment ; but then , suddenly , he turns red , throws his six spoons back in the chest , and shouts , but who has told you that i have any other intention than to have a little look at these things ?
1	not just sauces in general , but sauces specifically for fish—that ’ s what ’ s so monstrous about it
1	relaxation of the rules unifying this organic multiplicity into a single higher self was permitted in some cases , and then a multitude of subordinate individuals would be collected in a loose , muddled way to form a higher living unit
1	there was nothing to them
1	that is drivel and the beginning of the end-that is , of the degenerate notion of god held by the psalmists , for whom god has already been banned entirely to the heavens and who constantly sing about god in heaven , whereas the pentateuch knows nothing about heaven as the seat of the godhead
1	but she did not want to be too hard o n him-which she had perhaps been with the word ignominy

1	on the whole , the daily routine was not conducive to it
1	the schaffgosch quartet is playing opus
1	the gas doesn ’ t last that long , of course , and has to be replaced twice a month or so—they more or less pump you up , that ’ s how you have to picture it
1	for now , i would be most gratified if in this context you might find reason to see freedom less as a lovely gesture and more as a problem
1	senator langhals was a little annoyed
1	and , indeed , the whole council was talking about it : the rioters were heading this way , were already within earshot
1	i can not give you a bad grade
1	there was nothing for it—good joachim would have to come along
1	a little extra therapy had evidently been the term employed down in the flatlands , and they let him use it up here as well
1	links in a chain , papa had written
1	thomas seized an opportunity one day to raise a cautious objection to the practice , half in jest , but was rebuffed with gentle dignity
1	more or less in consolation and by way of experiment , adrian now and then called him by his first name as well , though not by the abbreviated nickname that people generally used with schwerdtfeger , but in the full form of rudolf-but he soon dropped that as well
1	people flat-out did not wish to know why opus i r has only two movements
1	what does that have to do with it , my child ?
1	he knows you can take ajoke
1	that lady of noble lineage , the head nurse of whom settembrini had spoken so scornfully and whom hans castorp had seen only fleetingly a few times , was in charge of the widower ’ s household
1	he left directly from england without first returning home
1	then he repeated several times , pain in ol ’
1	the previous autumn , the immense loan france had made to russia for constructing railroads in poland had awakened within him a similar conflict of feelings
1	it is surely self-evident : a norming of sound into ordered units was a precondition and the first self-manifestation of what we understand as music
1	after giving it serious consideration , however , he ended up raising his sons ’ allowances , for it was written : lead us not into temptation
1	but since , given the standard character traits of our species , it was scarcely permissible to declare the retreat from one 's fellows to be in general a symptom of madness-why should it then be permissible when that aversion expressed itself in royal forms ?
1	his stout heart had pulled him through , despite all adversity , and now the first human dwellings had appeared as a sign that the populated valley was near
1	on the contrary : i can but pity any that i would make my own , and in the case of music that pity would be es-
1	but here we are selecting general items from naphta ’ s inexhaustible hostility , when we have matters that are only all too concrete to talk about
1	i can assure you that mankind is about to find its way back to this point of view , to recognize that the task of true science is not the pursuit of worthless information , but rather the elimination on principle of what is pernicious , even of what is merely without significance as an idea , and , in a word , to proclaim instinct , moderation , choice
1	but ever since that failure an uneasiness had remained in his mind , boring ever deeper , telling him he should put himself to the test and once , and never again , play his dearest darling false
1	and like his mother , he still had those bluish shadows in the corners of his eyes—eyes that looked out on the world hesitantly and defensively , especially when he glanced off to one side
1	whom would you credit with theological existence if not me ?
1	and after the senator and his wife , along with frau permaneder and erika weinschenk , had stood in the landscape room for several hours , to receive the town ’ s condolences , elisabeth buddenbrook , née kröger , was consigned to the earth
1	it still bothers me a little somehow , and that may be why this bad mood comes over me , nags at me , and ruins everything
1	zink the painter suffered from asthma attacks that sounded like whooping cough , so that he usually withdrew from society until they passed ; and his friend baptist spengler was subject , as we know , to a host of afflictions by turns
1	i firmly believe that
1	it was not until very late the evening before that it occurred to hans castorp , who was very distraught , that it would be necessary to have a doctor present on the field of battle
1	it was obvious now that the rumor about the director ’ s approach had been an idle threat
1	i don ’ t even want to think about how sad a conviction would be for her
1	oh dog 's life , that one can complish nothing !
1	tony slept long and hard that first night on meng strasse , and the next morning , september , she came down to the breakfast room refreshed and relaxed—it had just struck seven
1	father— herr grünlich blurted out
1	my dear sir , you mustn ’ t demand the impossible from me , he continued
1	we ’ ve added a line in our budget for an immediate payment of fifty million , and you can be sure that we know exactly what we ’ re doing
1	he was also a good fellow and an artist , and i prefer to regard the fact that later on he and adrian did indeed address one another with familiar pronouns and first names not as some cheap triumph of schwerdtfeger 's coquetry , but rather as the result of his honest recognition of the value of this extraordinary man , of a genuine fondness for him , from which he drew the amazing imperturbability that finally won the victory over the coldness of melancholy-a calamitous victory , by
1	at the foot of the stairs to the third floor , the corridor made a little dogleg , passing then along the length of the grand hall to the servants ’ stairs , next to which was a side door leading back into the grand hall
1	here for two years and still capable of such inspiration !
1	inspired by some casual remark , the debate turned to more concrete subjects , moving quickly with the growing interest and participation of all through a series of issues : corporal punishment , cremation , torture , and the death penalty
1	i would be surprised , would be astonished , if wendish-slavic-sarmatian blood was not at work there , and if it was not this massive phenomenon of a man—and who would deny him that—who proved to be a fatal weight placed on one of the two precariously balanced scales of your nation , on the eastern scale , which caused—and still causes—the western scale to fly heavenward
1	there ’ s another letter enclosed , addressed to mother , which says the same thing
1	there had been something so strikingly immediate about her reply that they almost believed they had heard the voice of the late consul calling her
1	well , it was up to him to get himself out now—for he had clearly conjured up dreadful forces
1	you ’ ve grown so big and you look so strong and healthy , and we should thank god for that
1	i myself was profoundly touched to hear him recite this last verse , although i do not believe he was aware of my presence
1	it was not just this lack of a sense of reserve or formal manners , however , that she found alien and disagreeable ; although she did not taste deeply of the life and temper of munich , she was surrounded by the atmosphere of a large city full of artists and people who seemed to have nothing to do , and her own mood often made it difficult for her to breathe in such slightly decadent air , to bear all this with good humor
1	after a period of silence , during which he let this gesture take effect , he added , you did a proper bit of courting there at the end—got in just under the wire , didn ’ t you ?
1	adding more than a few animated gestures , i left it to riidiger whether to consider my words part of the bellicose journalism that so annoyed him ; but in my opinion one had to acknowledge as natural a certain psychological sympathy for a state of mind-itself not without some touching traits-that this one historical moment had shaped from an otherwise multiform german character , even if in the final analysis we were dealing simply with the psychology of a new breakthrough
1	as a mature woman who had learned something about life and was no longer a silly goose , she found herself incapable of believing in their spotless sanctity
1	who can keep you from making your conjectures ?
1	and just you wait , those altona-kiel fellows won ’ t stop their scheming against it
1	he had business in switzerland and had decided to use the occasion to visit hans on his mountaintop
1	it was simply as if we had said our goodbyes only the evening before
1	you don ’ t mean that and you know perfectly well that it would be a shame , a dreadful shame , to let the hundredth anniversary of the firm of johann buddenbrook pass without a peep
1	i shall make do with the water tumbler
1	i suppose you mean it to be repulsive , too ; you quite deliberately attempt to make yourself disgusting , forever cringing and writhing
1	you speak of your brother and sisters as harshly as you speak to me
1	they gloss over it
1	and although there were a good twenty people standing or sitting about the room , the silence was deeper than in a church , and the mood—as the senator very carefully whispered to his uncle justus—was just a little reminiscent of a funeral
1	they are trouble enough , and as a religious man one has to ask oneself whether the world is truly the sole work of a benevolent god or if it is not perhaps a cooperative venture-i wo not say with whom
1	and in any case , one can surely see a danger to culture if the mind closes one eye to what is vulgarly sensual , or even winks at it
1	and if i were to summarize my impression , it is as if one were lured from a solid and familiar point of departure into ever more remote regions-everything turns out differently from what one expected
1	reddish hair , and a tag of a moustache beneath his nostrils-a style popular in those days among the upper classes , and which would later become a hallmark of a face in world history
1	and if we did not previously mention that this was how the long hours had passed so effortlessly for him , it was because we sympathize with the qualms of conscience that accompanied the terrifying bliss of these visions and images
1	in order to get his bearings , he stomped his way around the hut and determined that he had arrived at the back end of it after a good hour—or so he estimated—of pure , futile folly
1	you have to pump with your feet the whole time , sometimes harder and sometimes not so hard
1	unfortunately , i said , your filia hospitalis can not read it to you '
1	in his depressed mood , his inner energies had quietly recovered some strength , too , and his mind was illumined with the clear certainty that the moment had come to break the spell that had been cast over him
1	he wanted to know about erika and even about grünlich
1	shame on you , tom
1	consul buddenbrook ’ s better at such negotiations than many a lawyer
1	but there is not a note in these searing , susurrant tones of the spheres and angels that did not appear with strictest correspondence in the laughter of hell
1	and what a speech !
1	but we were speaking of you—a shipbuilder ?
1	but why does he always rattle on in that overenergetic , peppy sort of way ?
1	all you have to do is show your spunk and not let them get the upper hand
1	the music ceased ; pastor pringsheim spoke
1	and that work , in turn , was bound up with the third of these exceptions : a trip to basel in the company of his teacher , kretzschmar , to attend performances of baroque sacred music , which were to be presented in st martin 's church by the chamber chorus of basel and for which kretzschmar was to be the organist
1	there ’ s still time to ask him to leave the room for a moment
1	one must despise it insofar as it is the principle of gravity and inertia opposing the flow toward the light , insofar-as it represents the principle of disease and death , insofar as its quintessence is a matter of perversity , of corruption , of lust and disgrace
1	but this meeting had a powerful effect as it was happening—and afterward , too , because only when it was all over did he see quite clearly how it had been
1	now that he had such a new , vivid understanding of why joachim had blushed , the whole world seemed new , and that sense of extravagant joy and hope stirred again deep within him
1	from some corner of the room came the incessant voice of herr stuht from glockengiesser strasse , a black coat pulled on over his woolen shirt , who was deeply involved in the discussion and kept repeating with great indignation , outrageous infamy !
1	home-to the past , to the headmistress of her boarding school , to former girl friends-and penned poetry in secret
1	during our st , dent years , the question of freedom was not , or appeared not to be , a burning issue , and so dr schleppfuss could give the word the meaning suitable to it in his class and leave other meanings aside
1	my eagerness to say everything at once allows my sentences to rise like a flood , propelling them away from the thought they intend to set down , until riding waves of words they seem to lose sight of it
1	in addition to the shiny little revolver with which he loved to frighten the ladies , he also owned a pair of officer ’ s pistols , twins bedded together in a velvet-lined case ; they were belgian-made automatic brownings , with brown wooden butts that held the magazines , with bluish steel mechanisms and shiny , rifled barrels , their spare , dainty sights set atop the muzzles
1	and so behrens simply dressed him down : would you please not make such a fuss , he said , and the patient quieted down at once and died quite peaceably
1	it came at two this afternoon , and i would have given it to father long before now , but how can i spoil the mood for him today ?
1	the door was answered by a half-grown lad with close-trimmed hair and red cheeks ; he was dressed in a kind of uniform—a striped footman ’ s jacket and gaiters
1	time , they say , is water from the river lethe , but alien air is a similar drink ; and if its effects are less profound , it works all the more quickly
1	that ’ s precisely it , hans castorp said
1	dr heidekind scolded whenever he saw him and insisted on a change of air , and he meant a radical change
1	hydrostatics , he wouldn ’ t understand , wouldn ’ t have the vaguest , wouldn ’ t even be interested
1	a leetle moore beeshop ?
1	i can see it coming—our gallant local attorneys will refuse to be impressed by the gentleman , will fight him tooth and nail , and the court will have a much more open ear for dr hagenström ’ s argument
1	elly went on slumbering ; she was bent forward , her face almost in her lap
1	royal princes are extended a warm welcome
1	i no longer freeze when i learn that life isn ’ t always so neat and proper
1	at least that ’ s what one normally thinks , is it not ?
1	i kept my peace when you chose to make a payment of , marks courant so that i might set up my own business at the time of my marriage and also promised a single payment of another , as my share of the inheritance
1	to think that someone like you , who uses such grand words for such shameless purposes , can accuse me of demagoguery
1	look there—one of your ivan ivanovitches , without cuff or collar , has got into a fight with prosecutor paravant
1	unprepossessing in appearance , a squat man with a round skull , short-clipped moustache , and brown eyes whose gaze was now musing , now frisky , but always given to smiling , he could truly have benefited the intellectual and cultural life of kaisersaschern-had there been , that is , any life of that sort
1	we told it for its own sake , not yours , for you were a simple fellow
1	and then your buddenbrook ’ s alliz so damn swank in his silk neckties and starch cuffs ’ nd that snazzy little mustache
1	about as much as one milkmaid resembles another and who in·replicated form was called waltpurgis
1	the acorns of jupiter ’ s tree—that ’ s the oak , yes
1	are you sure of that ?
1	grandfather settembrini had struggled for political rights—but his own grandfather , or at least his ancestors , had originally possessed all those rights , which over the course of four centuries the rabble had wrested from them by force and slogans
1	a brief walk up to the water trough or to the english quarter , a little rest in his lounge chair
1	the town was palestrina , the birthplace of the composer-called praeneste by the ancients and mentioned by dante in canto xxv i i of the inferno as pcnestrino , the stronghold of the princes of colonnaa picturesque settlement propped against its mountain and accessible from the church below only by a street of low steps that was not very tidy and lay under the shadow of houses
1	he had seen the cousins coming , he said , from his little window and had quickly finished off the encyclopedic page he had been working on , so that he , too , could join the party
1	you are also aware what inhuman abominations , what bloodthirsty intolerance—without which the artifact behind me would not exist—that epoch brought forth
1	otherwise , there was no other sound except the incessant whetting scrape of the record still rotating beneath the needle that no one had bothered to lift
1	and josephus screamed next , please
1	the week after next , we ’ re expecting pastor mathias from cannstatt
1	almost nothing was said during the ride home
1	when , in fact , there was nothing to that fawning poet laureate and flunky of the julians , that oh-so-urbane inkslinger and rhetorical show-off without a spark of creativity , whose soul , if he had one , was secondhand at best , who was not a poet at all , but a frenchman togged out in a full augustan wig of flowing curls
1	non , j'en suis sur !
1	he now had to sit back up from being bent over with laughter ; and from his face one could read that this was not easy for him , that he felt compromised
1	for in this he was true to type : that he dearly and truly loved living well , and despite his thin-blooded , refined appearance , he clung to the cruder pleasures of life as a gluttonous baby clings to its mother ’ s breast
1	yes , sir , morten replied , trying to give his face a stern , determined look
1	his heirs had drawn their money out of the business , and the consul strongly advised christian not to continue with only his own funds , because he knew quite well how difficult it was to keep a large-scale business going once its capital was suddenly reduced
1	knifelike pains of the little mermaid ; in conversation he also applied to it another , remarkably precise and vivid image that i recalled a few months later , in the spring of r , when the burden of illness was removed from him as if by a miracle and his mind soared phoenix-like to the most sublime freedom and astounding power in a period of unrestrained , if not to say , uninhibited , or at least unstoppable and onrushing , almost breathless productivity-and it was that very image that revealed to me how those two states , of depression and of elation , were not sharply set off from one another , did not break apart without any connection , but rather that the latter had been preparing itself in the former and to some extent was already contained within it-just as , vice versa , the period of health and creativity was anything but a time of ease , but likewise in its own way a time of obsession , of painful urgency and distress
1	change the ending , child , and then it will be a tidy piece of work
1	oh , no , hans castorp said with a laugh
1	yes , sometimes i ’ ve had the fleeting impression that i would actually have been in my element there
1	well , i ’ ve had enough for today , the senator said and thought about getting up , but then stayed seated all the same and laid his head back
1	and by such means , to be sure , pallid liberal theology can take on deeper and stronger , yes , more glowing colors ; it can be truer to the aesthetically antiquated ideas one instinctively associates with the word theology
1	at the mention of the word knife , mynheer peeperkorn had changed his sitting position in bed somewhat , suddenly edging away and turning his face to search his guest ’ s eyes
1	and tony took her place at the table
1	and he came and found them asleep again : for their eyes were heavy
1	we exchanged some introductory correspondence ; i went to see him , and was ushered by his butler into his study , where i found him seated at his desk
1	yes , terror and fear were bound up with them ; hope , joy , and nameless dread could spill over into boundless uncertainty and total extravagance , but at times they could also suddenly press in on his young heart—that is , his heart in the genuine , physical sense—so that he would put one hand to that organ and the other to his brow , as if to shade his eyes , and whisper , my god !
1	one might say you ’ ve ended your novitiate and have taken your vows
1	he appeared to be prouder of this clever feat , a veritable tour de force , than of the actual musical inventions from which the work lived-and that restriction of their uninhibited blossoming left me a little concerned
1	hug it , he said
1	you should have gone back to your work long before this , sur le chantier , or wherever it was
1	he was afflicted by a game known as elevens , in which a bridge deck is arranged in three rows of three cards each , and any two cards that add up to eleven , plus any of the three face cards when they turn up , are then covered anew , until , if fortune smiles , the game is won
1	if only there had not been that quiver in his voice when he spoke of art 's need of redemption , of its being on a firstname basis with humanity-it was an agitation that tempted me , despite everything , to press his hand clandestinely
1	no , it isn ’ t , is it ?
1	dear old joachim ’ s heart and words were brimming over with it ; he spoke about himself , never mentioning his cousin ’ s future
1	the others began to take their seats , hallooing , chatting , and clapping shoulders , and hans castorp , feeling put off by the tone of these opening remarks , was likewise moving to find a spot in the semicircle of chairs , when the doctor turned to address him personally
1	placet experiri , he said , pronouncing the c of placet with the soft italian ch
1	but just in case , he had given much thought to the section of the legal code that permitted divorce should a husband prove incapable of supporting his wife and children
1	echo was truly pleased by these gifts , but nevertheless quickly said 'nuff , once he had played with them , and much preferred his uncle to show him the grown-up objects he used himself and explain their function-always the same items , over and over , for children 's persistence and appetite for repetition are great in matters of amusement
1	the consul had withdrawn a little to one side against the wall , where the chairs were ; since his father was standing he did not sit down , but instead nervously grasped one of the chairs ’ high arms , and watched the old man read , scowling , his head bent to one side , his lips moving rapidly
1	what people have fought for , have stormed citadels for , and what people filled to overflowing have announced with jubilation-it ought not be
1	but every year fräulein weichbrodt went about her last christmas party with such jittery devotion to the task that the evening never passed without some surprise , some mishap , some little catastrophe that made all her guests laugh , but only increased their hostess ’ s mute fervor
1	they said nothing for a long time
1	mamselle jungmann and the kitchen maid had opened the white folding doors to the dining room , and the party moved at a confident , leisurely pace in its direction—one could reckon with a nourishing snack at the buddenbrooks ’
1	his flight from the festivities each evening seemed honorable enough , but the effect was anything but calming ; and then , too , there were certain moments when it seemed as if joachim ’ s good example at doing one ’ s rest-cure duty—and even his expert introduction to its procedures—had a dubious side as well
1	i bid my guide as a final service that he show me to an inn for my meal
1	they were all vaguely aware of this , and although they were not dealing here with a serious and authentic return to life , but a purely sentimental and theatrical performance , during which one would only see the departed person—nothing life-threatening , really—they nevertheless feared being confronted by whomever they had thought about , and each would have preferred to pass on to his neighbor the privilege of expressing such a wish
1	the human body consists of water for the most part
1	it concerned merit , that much i do recall-achievement realized by battle and struggle , by willpower and self-mastery ; and rudolf , who had just praised such occurrences with all his heart , calling them meritorious , could not understand where institoris could possibly get the notion to contradict him and refuse to recognize merit in anything that required sweat
1	there was really something kindhearted and forgiving in the way it did it
1	and then there ’ s krokowski , his assistant—a very savvy character
1	to that eloquent orator and humanist , whom she could not stand and called arrogant and inhumane ?
1	but now what happened ?
1	an organism—a blind , rash , pitiful eruption of the insistent assertion of the will
1	perhaps you would enjoy collapsing dead in front of the closed school gates
1	people endeavored to close that abyss with theories—it swallowed them whole , and was still not an inch less broad or deep
1	have the asses of virtue taken to butting us now ?
1	but when they departed , their faces and eyes were clearer , milder , and more blissfully enigmatic than before ; and inside the room elisabeth lay quite still , with their look in her eyes , their expression on her face
1	of that there can no longer be any doubt , and it is regrettable that no one representing psychiatric science is part of our circle
1	something must have happened
1	she put out her lovely hand to greet her husband , a gold bracelet tinkling at the wrist , and as was her habit she turned the palm upward as far as possible , which seemed to heighten the warmth of her gesture
1	rudolf died-which as the doctor told me immediately after his examination was likely to happen-on the way to the municipal hospital
1	what do you mean , uncle niko ?
1	meanwhile italians were playing barrel organs outside in the snow-covered streets , and from far off you could hear the hubbub from the christmas market in the town square
1	you want to badger me and bore me , until i reinforce your damn phoniness so that you can enjoy your innocent sleep , while others wake and watch and let the gale winds blow
1	maria ’ s the worst of the lot , you see , maria ’ s simply depraved
1	but don ’ t do anything to demean yourself , anna , do you hear ?
1	yes , yes , that ’ s her way of adding insult to injury
1	but otherwise , along with stars of the theater , one saw various politicians of the catholic people 's party , even a noted social democratic parliamentarian , and a few high and not so high functionaries of the new state , among whom there were still people of good family , lik� herr von stengel , a fundamentally jovial man who would try anything once-but also certain elements who were energetically ill-disposed toward the liberalistic republic and on whose brow was boldly written their intent to avenge germany 's disgrace and their awareness of representing a coming world
1	that look on his face , as if he had something foul-tasting in his mouth , had become more and more pronounced ; then he had been confined to his bed , and then he died—no one knew exactly when ; the matter was handled with customary tact and discretion
1	death is a great power
1	i am disturbing you by breaking into your family circle like this , he said in a soft voice , both refined and reserved
1	the explanations she offered little johann for this behavior could only lead him to believe that all his contemporaries either were scrofulous or had what she called evil humors—and that he was the lone exception
1	we have our work cut out for us , marcus
1	but the people in the berghof dining hall were certainly not so flippant and unsteady as all that
1	but within a very short time , herr popóv was seen sitting serenely beside his equally serene young wife at the good russian table , and he finished his midday meal as if nothing had happened
1	hello , my little anna
1	the theme lies at the basis of every sound heard , or better , it lies , almost like a musical key , behind everything and builds the sin-
1	fetch a few friends from the balconies
1	you simply go right over my head , the senator said again
1	upstairs , with thinka in the nursery
1	could not rid myself of that feeling ; and his theological definition of freedom was
1	nonetheless , he seemed to find reassurance in always having to depart quite early , necessitated , as everyone knew , by his dependence on the eleven o'clock train
1	herr stephan kistenmaker , whose own family was growing and who , along with his brother , had been doing very well in the claret business , immediately offered to buy it
1	thomas , elisabeth buddenbrook said , more gingerly now , to avoid unleashing another coughing fit , please believe me—you only offend people by constantly supporting the catholics rather than assisting the black sisters of the protestants
1	i can see already that you have made him happy , can i not ?
1	but how can that be ?
1	hans castorp raised his arms and made a face that said that a great many things were written , on both sides of the question , and that it was difficult to decide what was right and abide by it
1	oh , leave your cousin out of this
1	i left kaisersaschern and with my wife and child settled by the banks of the lsar , in this venerable town that has been a bishopric for many centuries , where , in easy communication with the capital and so , too , with my friend , i have spent my life ( w : th the exception of a few months during the war ) and have been a loving , unnerved witness to the tragedy of his
1	) -baron riedesel , then , saw in whatever was old and historic a bulwark against all things modern and subversive , a kind of feudal polemic against them , and in that spirit he supported the old without in fact understanding anything about it
1	tony went rigid ; she was so stunned that her tears vanished
1	i am an ugly old woman—that may well be—and babbit is prettier , that much is sure
1	i beg you , my dear antonie , to ponder these things in your heart
1	she wore very elegant , dangling gold earrings , which , in a slightly different form , her grandmother had worn before her
1	they had , by the way , an heir in their grown son , gereon ( not georg ) by name , a young man given to new machines and very progressive ideas when it came to farming ; also a somewhat younger daughter named clemen tina
1	but how long that takes can vary greatly—according to how we feel it !
1	and christian would wrinkle his nose and stare at her as if to say , aren ’ t you the least bit ashamed of yourself ?
1	yes , and since then the mother just wanders about , when she ’ s not sitting with them , and the only thing she ever says to anyone she meets is : tous les deux !
1	perhaps that , that alone , was her illness
1	his head was buzzing , his eyelids were like lead , his heart beat like a little kettledrum , and to add to his agony , he took a notion that pretty marusya , who was sitting bent forward , her face buried in the hand with the ruby ring , was laughing at him , even though he had taken considerable pains not to give her any reason to do so
1	the external form of this contamination was a rapid growth of tissue , a tumor , pathologically speaking , which was the cells ’ reaction to the stimulus of bacilli having taken up residence among them
1	only these four were left now from the mardi gras party—they sat there motionless
1	do you recognize her ?
1	and i do not hesitate , for my part , to admit that at this moment i sincerely regret the step that seemed to me so wise and beneficial four years ago
1	one layer of the ectoderm thickened , folded to form a groove , then closed to build a nerve canal , became the spinal column , the brain
1	but the primary reason , after all , was to take a vacation , on orders of dr heidekind
1	he had first returned to william blake and had set to music a very strange poem by this author he so loved : silent , silent night , with its four stanzas , each of three lines ending on one rhyme , the last of which reads , curiously enough : but an honest joy
1	if only i could say it would kill me , but a man can ’ t live with it or die from it
1	there was nothing of his semlinger heritage about him , but he did have a yellow complexion and pointed gap-teeth
1	she wept over herr weinschenk ’ s top hat , over the way he lifted his eyebrows when he caught sight of her and quickly let them fall again , over his absolutely royal posture and his carefully balanced fists
1	by the way , i also notice you are coming to the defense of illness yet again
1	now you ’ ve been convicted by your own pupil of harboring warlike tendencies
1	for some reason tony suddenly scowled and replied , without looking at herr grünlich , hoffmann ’ s serapion brethren
1	and yet the real point should be to inflame our reason
1	be that as it may—the charge of cruelty is a rather sentimental charge
1	but what about the inquiries the consul had made , the books he had examined ?
1	he took a deep breath , letting his hand glide slowly across his brow and eyes , automatically lit another cigarette , although he knew they were not good for him , and went on gazing into the darkness through the smoke
1	i know , dear tony , i know it all
1	just look at that !
1	and joachim , his eyes shifting about and his mouth opening as if to utter a hopeless oh , let his hand trail off in a gesture of immeasurability
1	and what were these comrades chatting about ?
1	and he fetched a bright green box from the cupboard to offer them one
1	it foamed up brown in the little onion-pattern cups
1	what was to become of their second-born remained for the parents an open question that would have to be decided by inclinations and abilities he might demonstrate ; and it was remarkable , then , how early the notion became firmly fixed in their and all our minds that adrian would have to be a scholar
1	true , when you listened to the director talk you might sometimes think he had a temperature—there was something not quite right about the way he spoke , it sounded so brash and jovial and easygoing , but there was also something strange about it , something overwrought , especially when you considered those purplish cheeks and watery eyes , which looked as if he were still weeping for his wife
1	they did not make the attempt
1	that covertly placed considerable funds at the disposal of platner 's marionette theater for the expensive and musically flawless production of the gesta in donaueschingen
1	are you in love with him ?
1	and it was precisely there that herr settembrini revealed himself for what he truly was , the man of progress , of liberalism , of bourgeois revolution
1	for now , i ’ ll just stick with these bloodstains , red wine stains here on the sheet
1	wehsal , who was brought in for consultation , informed them that naphta had stated he did not want a doctor present
1	and yet it was not only , not even primarily , the gambling and the wine that brought forth these high-tension emotions around the table and made faces flush and shining eyes grow wider , so that the whole party was engaged in what might be called a common strenuous effort , all holding their breath in almost painful concentration on the moment
1	in a rather low voice , he said , ladies and gentlemen
1	as the carriage passed
1	the neighbors who lived in the solid , gabled houses propped themselves in their windows and watched the men at work on the scaffolds , took great delight in seeing the walls rise , and tried to guess the date for the roof-raising
1	for instance , i cut my finger or hurt myself some way—and it ’ s a wound that heals for other people in a week , but it takes four weeks with me
1	he challenged you , hans castorp said anxiously
1	that 's funny , very funny , he said
1	one can never expect you to do any work , he went on with easy eloquence now , and you always have some excuse ready at hand , heinricy
1	it was almost eight o ’ clock , but still daylight
1	why did he have to test the thing out on other women , when he had one that he loved , so much apparently that·
1	to which hans castorp merely gave a shrug—in perfect imitation of the shrug he had first seen joachim give the evening before
1	after pointlessly multiplying pi by diameter to find the circumference of innumerable circles , pi by the square of the radius to find their area , the prosecutor increasingly began to wonder if since the days of archimedes humanity had not just been making the whole thing too complicated , if the solution to the problem was not childishly simple
1	justus kröger , the debonair suitier , the son of the old cavalier à la mode , was not a very happy man
1	but he still often had difficulty swallowing when eating , and of late this phenomenon had been accompanied by a temporary shortness of breath , an asthmatic condition , which for several weeks christian believed to be consumption , the nature and symptoms of which he painfully attempted—with much wrinkling of his nose—to describe in minute detail for his family
1	in my opinion it suffices fully if it is heard just once-that is , when the composer conceives it
1	madame kethelsen had gone to her rest as well
1	she climbed the stairs heavily—she was expecting , as usual
1	confidentially , he also had to add , it was somehow awkward , indeed degrading when passion , and a desperate passion at that , was felt by the woman and the man was only fulfilling his cavalier 's duty
1	it seems to me that the whole adagio is still rather unsatisfactory
1	the discipline and elegance , the hushed serenity and intellectual challenge , the well-ordered and well-tended life , the precise yet richly varied schedule—it all spoke to leo ’ s profoundest instincts
1	he was upset , of course , by the polypraxios-nölting affair
1	the body triumphs , has other plans than the soul , and gets its way—quite a comedown for high-minded types who teach that the body must obey the soul
1	no , no , my highest respects
1	well , bethsy , how are you feeling ?
1	i remember we stopped for a few moments beside the
1	how do you mean ?
1	henri 's family , henri himself would learn of his relationship with her if she did not bend to his will once again
1	and if you were to go for a stroll , you ’ d be quite the fine fellow , much like the citizens of palermo who are hung up in the capuchin catacombs near the porta nuova
1	the only am�zing thing was how weak the angels ' watch , in particular over the saints of god , had proved to be in every age , at least in the matter of peace
1	raised eyebrows and faces in which one read the question : what is he getting at , what is this all about ?
1	but especially on days when he had not seen echo , of an evening after the child had been put to bed , he liked to step softly , scarcely noticed into the child 's room and listen to the boy 's prayers , which he said lying on his back , with the palms of his hands pressed together before his chest and with one or both of his nurses , frau schweigestill and her daughter , stand-
1	i call it that , because in my opinion the world 's misfortune is founded in the disunity of the intellect , in stupidity , in a
1	a purple country wine , which between brays the lawyer drank in great gulps like water , a vintage too torrid as a suitable beverage for two meals a day , but that it would have been a shame to water , served to quench our thirst
1	it was terribly hard for me
1	at the time i returned to civilian life , however , he was fiercely devoted to his work-in my view not so much because of its actual object , that is , the gesta music , or not exclusively so at least , but because he was anxious to put it behind h\m and to ready himself for the new demands of genius that were announcing themselves
1	and there plump women sat , burying their hands in fur muffs half smooth from wear and warming their feet at charcoal burners ; they guarded their cold , wet prisoners and called out in broad accents , inviting the strolling cooks and housewives to buy
1	well , then—skin , you say ?
1	but not without talent , certainly not without talent for raising his general metabolism
1	kröger senior , however , was enthroned high and erect between the wife of senator langhals and madame antoinette , dividing his hand gestures and reserved jests equally between those two ladies
1	old madame kröger , uncle justus ’ s widow , had been invited , too ; but she was not feeling well , or perhaps had no suitable dress to wear—it was not certain which
1	that astounds you , does it ?
1	yes , and i ’ ll give everyone your greetings , hans castorp replied , and tell them that you ’ ll follow in five months at the most
1	the musical conventions being destroyed today have not always been so very objective , so fixed from without
1	pleasant voice , pretty gestures
1	yes , senator buddenbrook , one hundred years , he said , balancing the razor in his red hands and deftly stropping it
1	i often watched them at their theological and philosophical debates and pictured how these winfried years would later seem to many of them the grandest period of their lives
1	in short , i was disgusted to my very soul with this woman once i knew and saw what license she
1	so that was head nurse von mylendonk , he thought
1	gracious lady , to what do we owe the honor of a visit from the capital of bavaria ?
1	and so there he lay , and once again , as the height of summer came round for the seventh time since his arrival—but he did not count—the year closed on itself
1	to be sure , a lot depends on the way in which it is spoken about
1	and for that his teacher 's lectures seemed to me a means that i ought not disdain , that indeed was indispensable
1	even consul fritsche came hurrying down the steps of the pavilion—he hoped that at least next year the buddenbrooks would return to help swell the population of his spa
1	to reach the almost ladderlike stairway to the top floor , they had to pass lukaček ’ s door again and noticed the peevish tailor was still sitting on his table , working on the sleeved dress for the old lady
1	i realize i ought not to have included these trifles and crumbs of observation here
1	the ease with which you understand me speaks for the naturalness of the matter
1	his father ’ s name was there , as was in fact his grandfather ’ s , and his great-grandfather ’ s ; and now that syllable came doubled , tripled , and quadrupled from the storyteller ’ s mouth ; and the boy would lay his head to one side , his eyes fixed and full of thought , yet somehow dreamily thoughtless , his lips parted in drowsy devotion , and he would listen to the great-great-great-great—that somber sound of the crypt and buried time , which nevertheless both expressed a reverently preserved connection of his own life in the present to things now sunk deep beneath the earth and simultaneously had a curious effect on him : the same effect visible in the look on his face
1	that it was not
1	tony did of course spend some time with her friends from town on the beach or in the hotel garden , and she was taken along on sailing parties or invited to this gala or that
1	these papers , the italian said , swiftly extracting a package from the pouchlike side pocket of his petersham coat—an oversize opened envelope , which contained several flyers and a letter that he ran through his fingers for hans castorp to see—these papers bear a letterhead in the french language : international league for the organization of progress
1	what is that you ’ re reading ?
1	and since they could not read the monkey directly from their books with the director present , the recitation was a fiasco ; and when they moved on to ivanhoe , only young count mölln could translate a little of it , because he actually had some interest in the novel
1	he awoke abruptly with a delicious start , like a man awakening alone in his bed with love stirring in his heart
1	he turned the pages , however , with his little left arm and hand , and unconsciously held in that motion , they hovered there in an unbelievably graceful gesture , the hand with open palm in midair to the left of the book , so that i felt as if i had never seen a child sitting so charmingly ( even in dreams my own would never have offered me such a sight !
1	he had slipped down too far in his bed and curtly demanded to be propped back up again
1	first he read the advertiser and contentedly finished smoking his morning cigarette
1	well , one can ’ t spend one ’ s whole life being the silly goose i once was
1	the libretto adapted from shakespeare 's comedy love 's labour 's lost , leverkiihn 's mischievous youthful composition , comes from me ; i was also permitted some influence on the preparation of the texts for both the grotesque opera suite gesta romanorum and the oratorio the revelation of st john the divine
1	evenin ’ , my boy , said behrens , who had been engaged in a hushed conversation with dr krokowski and the head nurse , and now greeted him with a melancholy nod and a skew of his little white moustache
1	ah lord , direct and guide us all for as long as we live on this earth…—the pen hurried along , smooth and agile , here and there executing a commercial curlicue while addressing god in line after line
1	i see it as well in the light of a sacrifice , and you can truly demand that i regard it as such
1	more respectable and worthy heights
1	and they ’ re all very high
1	yes , he remarked softly after a pause , it ’ s true
1	nor is obtuseness necessarily harmless
1	hans castorp , as we have said , took note of them in his kindhearted way and he opened himself to them as a way of testing them—from which it became particularly clear that the waking hans castorp was a very different person from the fatuously dreaming hans castorp , who had called settembrini an organ-grinder to his face and tried with all his might to push him out of the way because he was bothering him
1	but it ’ s true , i wouldn ’ t mind a chance to freshen up a bit myself
1	then he looked at his wristwatch—it was :
1	would he have a single moment alone , a single moment to let the muscles of his face relax ?
1	what should i take with me , papa ?
1	yes , you say that as a military man , and i must admit , the military understands these things
1	the tables were turned , and no one had noticed
1	but don ’ t let it annoy you so—it causes wrinkles
1	art is moral , in that it awakens
1	and so they hid behind uncle justus , who sent his wife to see her sister-in-law , who was the wife of oeverdieck the lumber merchant , whose job it was to soften up her aged father-in-law
1	he stole in here quietly to hear music—do you wish to poison his mind for good and all ?
1	the flower of evil , i repeated with a nod
1	one evening after a performance , presumably tipsy from wine , this prickly and brittle , but basically inexperienced and defenseless woman succumbed to his practiced routine-to her own great anger and furious self-contempt ; for , to be
1	her cousins said in unison
1	there are two ways to life : the one is the regular , direct , and good way
1	i think it likely that from the very first your symptoms should not have been traced exclusively to tuberculosis , and i draw that conclusion from my presumption that they can not be traced to it at all now
1	jeannette and schwerdtfeger sometimes played music together , both for the guests of old madame scheurl and privately , and so they had arranged for a joint trip to pfeiffering , with rudolf in charge of telephoning their plans
1	one might have been tempted to think his frock coat gave off a grisly odor , but that would have been pure prejudice
1	it was , to put it in the briefest terms , the dichotomy between aesthetics and ethics , which to a great extent governed the cultural dialectics of the era and was more or less personified in these two young people-the contradiction between a scholarly glorification of life in its glittering thoughtlessness and a pessimistic veneration of suffering , with its depths and its wisdom
1	under normal circumstances , the tall , distinguished figure of the former cavalier à la mode would have revealed that he was beginning to bend beneath the burden of his eighty years ; but today he stood quite erect , his eyes half closed , the corners of his mouth turned down in elegant disdain , the short tips of his white mustache turned straight up
1	it automatically reminded me of it
1	hans castorp remembered that he had heard the same sounds the night before , but had been too tired to pay them any attention
1	toward the end of the meal she would have to excuse herself , and with the assistance of ida jungmann or rieke severin , she would go down to the garden or the back courtyard and suffer the most dreadful fits of nausea
1	i myself later heard him do it at the roddes ' and schlaginhaufens ' , and he told me how even as a very young boy , before he ever took violin lessons , he had begun to develop the skill , practicing just whistling along to a piece of music no matter where he happened to be , and had later continued to perfect his mastery of the art
1	he would have liked to remain behind in the landscape room himself , to sit in an armchair and give rein to his dreams and feelings as the tune carried him along
1	take off your coat , and do sit down , dear papa
1	and yet , as we have said , hans castorp ’ s diminished friends and mentors were still at their best when arguing
1	frau magnus was so far gone that she was sitting on herr albin ’ s lap , tugging at both his earlobes—to which herr magnus reacted with what appeared to be relief
1	the frau senator spoke less engagingly about her daughter frau institoris in munich
1	on the basis of their finding , however , a man who doubtless deviated from the norm , but who for all that certainly was not crazy , was denied the right to dispose of his person , degraded to the status of a psychiatric patient , and locked in a lake-bound castle with windows barred and door handles unscrewed
1	not much hope , my lad—none at all , actually
1	hans castorp ordered his facial expression—had , in fact , already done so the moment he spotted the italian
1	piety , reverence , decency of the soul-these are possible only in terms of man and through man , only when restricted to what is earthly and human
1	at that moment ida jungmann entered the room , holding little erika by the hand
1	it was probably the first time that inez had seen her lover since he had severed their relationship-with considerable brutality , i fear , for it was hardly possible to do so in a nice way , given the desperate tenacity with which she clung to him
1	in a word , it is bourgeois misery organized as a club
1	taking the key , he nodded menacingly several times directly in the doctor ’ s face , turned on his heels , and left the room
1	herr settembrini let silence reign
1	i most certainly did , herr settembrini
1	a recitation begins with a bow , son
1	the preparations he was making were almost concluded
1	well , i was going to escort fräulein antonie to the temple of the sea
1	it drew so evenly that it could easily have served as an hourglass for the man enjoying it , and indeed , given hans castorp ’ s needs , did serve as such , for he no longer carried his pocket watch
1	of course , young hans castorp could not see his way clear to take such carryings-on very seriously , indeed her mere presence seemed prejudicial to the dignity of this place of suffering
1	how else , if inez had considered herself quite unobserved , could she have presumed as a matter of course that i was in the know ?
1	i ’ ll never forget the evening i met her
1	my cousin and i were speaking about that earlier
1	the problem of the highly gifted person was how , despite being progressively spoiled , despite an ever-spreading nausea , he could still hold to the doable
1	ah yes , so he felt serene
1	it was a little business deal—not exactly proper , but certainly not unusual , either
1	not baked , but distilled , my angel
1	take hanno ’ s nervous sleep , for example , the way he starts up and is so frightened by his dreams
1	no , she was wrestling now with life to gain death
1	it lacks some of the details that behrens found there
1	our hostess valued his dialectical skill with words ( spoken , by the way , with a palatinate accent ) and his love of paradox , which would leave the ladies clasping their hands above their heads in a kind of prim jubilation
1	the hills and crags and purest air ,
1	shivers of horror ran down his back
1	it is as if the meister were using this seemingly anarchic piece to take a deep breath before his faust cantata , his most rigorously formal work
1	the concepts of death and corruption play an important role , too
1	this wealthy man 's table was set for about fifteen people for dinner at seven ; with its well-trained staff , supervised by a housekeeper with affected manners and the hope of marrying one day , his was a hospitable house , and it was usually people from the world of finance and business whose company he kept
1	and the ladies—lord , lord , the ladies !
1	hans castorp had indeed adopted the right tone in speaking of them—that of religious submission
1	i can understand , he said , your not giving me the job of finding some place for you
1	he was not smiling at all—no more today than on any other occasion
1	in short , there are winter days and summer days , spring and autumn days , but no real seasons , we don ’ t actually have those up here
1	the letter was handed to the porter , who avoided the postal detour of a mailbox , and took it down to meet the next scheduled train
1	and here his free hand grasped her other hand and he gazed deeply into her eyes , wide with fright
1	no , nothing obtrusive , no coarse claims on her
1	you find that stupid , herr settembrini , and certainly it is vague , which in your eyes is worse than stupid
1	and was it all that much different with me ?
1	and i love erika very much
1	the lowest animals had no nervous systems , let alone a cerebral cortex , and yet no one dared deny that they were capable of responding to stimuli
1	do you see these cavities here ?
1	at this point in the year , the weather everywhere else in the world was worse for patients with lung disease
1	that is classic medievalism , my dear sir
1	mantic works , is none at all
1	farewell , hans—whether you live or stay where you are !
1	i don ’ t think i ’ d fit in very well , you see
1	the piece was clever , tight , tingly , and was reproduced here in all its witty , giddy invention
1	his uncle sat with him at the table and watched as he ate his snack neatly and daintily
1	it is indeed a law
1	everyone was talking about it my first few days here
1	it makes me shudder
1	he was not only anti-pharisaical , anti-dogmatic , but also anti-metaphysical , oriented entirely toward ethical and epistemological concerns ; a proclaimer of an ideal of personality grounded in morality , he was mightily ill-disposed toward the pietistic separation of world and faith
1	i know this from adrian himself : she warned him ; and does not that imply a gratifying disparity between the creature 's higher humanity and that physical part of her , the vile commodity of trade cast to the gutter ?
1	and what acoustic panic flows from the repeated instrumentation for timpani glissandi , a musical or sound effect achieved here by adjusting the pedal mechanism of the timpani to various pitches even as the hands are performing the drum roll
1	and so no one had left ?
1	afterward , hanno went to the salon and got things ready for their music session ; he sat at the piano and waited for his mother
1	the revenge was automatic , prompt , cold-eyed , mysterious
1	that ’ s merely flimsy idealism
1	in this solemn attitude , in this duty , in this reverence of man for himself , there is god ; i can not find him in hundreds of billions of milky ways
1	she asked with nervous excitement
1	joachim cast him a gentle glance and smiled a curious smile—melancholy and slightly mocking , it seemed—but why , he kept to himself
1	i must consider our discussion at an end
1	the two of them did best when intellectual breezes blew , when they debated and could capture the attention of the strollers with one of their elegant , passionate , academic arguments ( though the tone of voice implied that it was one of the most burning questions of the day , of life itself ) the burden of which they more or less carried alone , thereby neutralizing for its duration the presence of the man of stature , who could offer only a brow creased in astonishment and some vague mocking scraps of commentary
1	beer , tobacco , and music , he said
1	you have made a stroke !
1	short order … short order , he said crossly and shook his head as he glanced at his mother
1	well , and what about you , my young member of the civilian population ?
1	our sacred german soil !
1	they will have taken it all quite calmly
1	you and your behrens !
1	how does nature accomplish it through the animal ?
1	artistic thought , he suggested , formed an intellectual category unique to itself , and yet a first sketch of a painting or a statue hardly ever consisted of words-which was evidence of the special bond between music and language
1	as far as rye , oats , or barley go ?
1	they would be staying here
1	that ’ s the second time now , but of course it was the husband ’ s fault both times
1	but her lips were bluish , and the tip of her nose had taken on the same hue , evidently from a lack of oxygen
1	supporting his arguments with all kinds of examples and anecdotes from the books and loose pages that lay on the table before him , even reciting poetry a few times , dr krokowski discussed love ’ s frightening forms—bizarre , agonized , eerie mutations of its symptoms and omnipotence
1	if i am not mistaken , it was on mount zion at home that you once tendered me kindred disclosures
1	they were all there , except klothilde , who had gone to grudging to nurse her sick father
1	that i should shun humankind
1	his head had turned purple again and he was quivering , straining to control himself , until he finally managed to say , well …—and the spell was broken , the battle won
1	after taking his third step—naphta had already reached the cane barrier , without firing—he raised his pistol high in the air and squeezed the trigger
1	that is no python with which we shall do astounding feats
1	oh , that ’ s nothing , mother , he doesn ’ t mean anything by that
1	what do you say to that !
1	it is simply enormement caracteristique , and that same note is indispensable for the series of concerts of international music that i am arrangmg
1	just let him come , just let him dare come to see the house
1	and when herr modersohn entered , try as he might , he was unable to close the door , because a fat pine cone had been stuck in the crack—adolf todtenhaupt had to remove it
1	i had to sell flowers
1	for two years , until last fall , a baroness von handschuchsheim had lived here and rambled about the house-a lady whose ideas , as frau schweigestill put it , had refused to match those of the rest of the world , and who had sought refuge here from that mismatch
1	such suggestions came as a rule not only from jeannette scheurl , but also from the general intendant , his excellency von riedesel , whose patronage of my old instrument and old music sprang , to be sure , not from learned , antiquarian interests as with kranich , but rather from a purely conservative bias
1	how well it speaks for him , that deeply attentive friendship extended by delacroix , who writes him , ] 'espere vous voir ce soir , mais ce moment est capable de me faire devinir fou
1	but you don ’ t lay yourself open to such an insolent dressing-down
1	but then , that form of address had gained general usage during the meal
1	frau stöhr mentioned that we can get little toy trumpets at the concierge ’ s desk , is that right ?
1	suddenly , especially if the sisters had declined to dance , he would grow thoughtful and take a seat at the table beside adrian and baptist spengler , who always wore a domino and drank red wine
1	oh yes , i doubt if he would turn down the offer , the senator said with bitterness
1	you ’ d find things there…
1	this was very much in the spirit of the work , the singer had grasped that spirit with great intelligence
1	she believed , without knowing it , that absolutely every character trait was a family heirloom , a piece of tradition , and therefore something venerable and worthy of her respect , no matter what
1	ence , the name kaschperl gradually became a mere memory , and the dog itself finally preferred to answer to suso
1	after all , i ’ ve seen you wink at the girls
1	eva ewers knew how—fine
1	he had , as noted , given up his commercial ventures ; but he attempted to fill the hours of the day when he was not at the club with various activities
1	but her wardrobe was all bright colors again , she let her hair fall in little curls over her forehead , and she was once again busy with her round of social visits
1	the rest , however , the curvature that by some ethereal , spiritual means escaped the calculable embrace that could turn it into a rational number—that , said the prosecutor , his jaw trembling , that was pi !
1	and all the guests declared they could not stand to see any more snow , it disgusted them , summer alone had more than satisfied them in that regard , nothing but masses of snow , day in , day out , mounds of snow , pillows of snow , whole slopes of snow—it was more than any human being could stand , deadly to both mind and spirit
1	and if we look around for hans castorp in this setting , we will find him in the reading room , the same room where once ( though this once is vague , since neither narrator , reader , nor hero is quite clear anymore as to the degree of pastness involved ) he had been party to important disclosures concerning the organization of human progress
1	i ’ ll paint it a little , he said
1	he 's always too ambitious in the company of ladies
1	am i right to think you would be grateful for that ?
1	i ask you—a man who weeps ?
1	he has close-trimmed white whiskers and salt-and-pepper hair on top of his head that looks like goose down and flutters in the breeze
1	no , these two boys had nothing whatever in common with their fellow students , who were content with simple revenge or obstinacy
1	it was necessary , however , ruthlessly to attack such secondary phenomena
1	young frelon remarked as they drove ’ cross the heath ,
1	he was well aware that she had not agreed to the marriage out of love , but he thought it possible that four years of a life together and the birth of a child might have changed a great many things , that tony might feel bound to her husband now , body and soul , and reject any notion of separation for reasons both christian and worldly
1	he felt the whole world looking expectantly at him to see if he would know how to further the interests of both the old firm and the family , and not just preserve their prestige
1	quite a bit of reading went on at the international sanatorium berghof , both in the common lounging areas and on private balconies—this was particularly true of newcomers and short-termers , since residents of many months or even years had long since learned how to ravage time without diverting or employing their minds , had become virtuosi at putting time behind them , and declared openly that only clumsy bunglers in the art needed a book to hang on to
1	i have no need to throw my money in the nearest ditch to prove the firm ’ s solvency
1	once , when adrian had declined the frau senator 's invitation , remaining in his room because of a headache and a total aversion to society , schwerdtfeger had suddenly appeared at his door , in a cutaway and black ascot , to persuade him , ostensibly on behalf of several or all the guests , to join their company after all
1	around his neck , however , lay a wide , starched , heavily pleated ruff , slanted forward , but sloping upward on both sides , beneath which , to top it all , could be seen a pleated batiste jabot and a vest
1	i already told you that you could be of help to me in this difficult matter
1	simple snapshots were soon considered déclassé and color photography à la lumière was the thing
1	i think maybe you ’ ll come to understand that in due time , after you ’ ve been up here with us a little longer
1	russians , male and female , herr settembrini said , and a tightening was visible at the corner of his mouth
1	well , lnstitoris did not shout , but spoke instead in a low lisping voice , even when proclaiming the italian renaissance as an age reeking of blood and beauty
1	if only mama had not said anything about getting excited
1	i can ’ t be anything
1	what he felt was no different from what a lad in the flatlands feels when he casts that first glance at a girl and cupid ’ s barbed arrow unexpectedly pierces his heart
1	he looked at me , and i believe the color had drained from his face
1	the rest , sir , will follow in due course
1	but enough—the towel , please , wenzel , the consul concluded
1	he obviously said it simply because he wanted to break up the circle , for the very next words from his honeysweet lips were echo does not think it proper to stay out o ' doors now
1	the mere mention thereof !
1	several young women emerged out of the group , ready for a swim with tony
1	it was warmth , the warmth produced by instability attempting to preserve form , a fever of matter that accompanies the ceaseless dissolution and renewal of protein molecules , themselves transient in their complex and intricate construction
1	sometimes little yellow worms wriggled from out their nostrils , crawled down their breasts , and vanished-
1	so , too , the great whore , the woman who sits upon the beast ( for whose depiction the artist from nuremberg blithely helped himself to the portrait of a courtesan , a study he had brought back with him from venice ) is largely prefigured in the very similar terminology of ezekiel
1	not much time at all—let alone to deal with homework
1	i ’ ll go out through the back building
1	why he slighted them , whether out of personal autarchy or because he could
1	good god , thomas , mother wasn ’ t always absolutely right , merely right from her point of view , and i respected that—as long as she was alive
1	and where does it come from ?
1	herr albin even showed him how to load them , and out in the open they practiced firing blanks with both pistols
1	all the langhalses , hagenströms , huneuses , kistenmakers , oeverdiecks , and möllendorpfs—whether business or professional men , couples or suitiers—had attended the party , which concluded with whist and several earfuls of music and was praised in the highest terms on the exchange for a good week afterward
1	but it ’ s his fault !
1	the woodwinds never cover the strings , but always allow them their tonal space and alternate with them , and in only a few passages are strings and woodwinds united in a tutti
1	he asked , lifting one eyebrow
1	it is clear that your nationalist mania loathes the world-conquering cosmopolitanism of the church
1	once it starts , there ’ ll be sleigh rides
1	last spring there had been a riot in the streets , although a new constitution commensurate with the demands of the times was already being drafted , and , indeed , despite the objections of lebrecht kröger and a few other obstinate old men , it had been adopted as the basic law of the city by decree of the senate
1	that exclamation echoed the predominant tone and spirit of these small-talker 's dramatic fantasies
1	all the same , he gratefully accepted the coin
1	this announcement affected hans castorp even more than her previous news
1	or she might sit down on a chair beside the door and listen for ten minutes , only to vanish again without a sound
1	his english correspondence was exceptionally polished and effective , for he wrote english just as he spoke it—it rolled along in an effortless , simple , unconstrained , nonchalant stream
1	such people tend to be suspicious and bitter
1	the second person was costumed all in blue—eyebrows and lips tinted blue , the whole face and neck in fact painted blue , a blue woolen cap pulled down over one ear , and a case or slipcover of glazed blue linen , all one piece , pulled down over him , then tied with a string at the ankles and stuffed with pillows to round things off at the stomach
1	that was her reddish-blond hair , no more elegantly coiffed than usual , just a simple braid wound around her head ; those were her lone-wolf eyes , her rounded neck , her lips , which seemed fuller than they were because they were accented by cheekbones that gave a charming concavity to her cheeks
1	it delighted me to think of her as adrian 's partner in life , and i could indeed understand the feelings she instilled in him
1	he heard a voice murmur : speak to him
1	if there is a god , then the difference exists
1	young behrens came home on vacation now and then , and had in fact been there once already during joachim ’ s stay ; and he told how it had been such a thrill for the ladies of the sanatorium—temperatures rose , little jealousies erupted into spats and skirmishes in the public lounging area , and a press of patients had appeared for dr krokowski ’ s private consultations
1	no , things are not going well for this family , not when there are grounds for scenes such as we ’ ve had here today
1	our defeat was merely a matter of time and of its cost to others-we could have laid down our weapons and forced our leaders to make an immediate peace , had we realized all this ; but presumably only one or two of them even secretly allowed himself to think it
1	whereas you can also use the word human ’ to cover up all sorts of weak-willed slovenliness
1	for the rest cure , what with this miserable cold weather
1	wehsal wanted to know
1	he was a man without vices , she said ( she did not use that word , but some milder one , yet it was clear that was what she meant ) , a pure man-which explained his confiding familiarity , for purity has a confiding quality about it
1	added to which , she was very musical , a pianist , who was ardent in her love of chopin , had made some stabs at writing about schubert , and was a friend of more than one person who had made a name for himself in the realm of contemporary music
1	then the furniture vans lined up along meng strasse and the house was emptied out
1	he slipped the revolver back into his breast pocket , sat back down on his chair , crossed his legs , and lit another cigarette
1	yes , tom , right above the desk in your office , frau permaneder replied and gave her brother a hug
1	where does it come from ?
1	it is all a matter of osmosis , my friend , in whose sportive products you early took such delight
1	i have kept a letter that adrian sent to me in freising from pfeiffering at the time-during his work , that is , on the hymn of praise by the
1	which is why i feel it my duty to correct you
1	and since frau chauchat was already moving toward the door to the room , peeperkorn let this headstrong young man go , although he stared after him for a good while , gazing over both his own shoulder and the malayan ’ s , his brow deeply creased in amazement at such an act of insubordination , to which his royal nature was quite unaccustomed
1	no , not in the least
1	you see , i was paying complete attention
1	there he would sit very quietly , one knee clasped in both hands , and listen : both to the music and to what was said
1	tony cried in despair
1	but of course , youth is capable of most anything
1	where are the glaciers and snowcapped , towering peaks ?
1	a sudden hush came over the classroom , and everyone stood up in unison as dr mantelsack entered
1	yes , by god , i certainly do need that
1	that glance-which would remain unique to him , though one was not subjected to it frequently , but only now and then , and sometimes for no apparent reason-was indeed something new : mute , veiled , so aloof as to be almost offensive , and yet musing and cold with sadness , always ending in a not unfriendly , yet mocking smile with closed lips and in that gesture of turning away , which , however , was an old , familiar one
1	its natural squalor hidden , the world seemed to be under a spell of icy purity , trapped inside a fantastic dream of fatal enchantment
1	that could have meant some badly trodden corns for all parties
1	what was that supposed to mean ?
1	only good manners prevented herr settembrini from breaking into mocking , carefree laughter
1	his plan was to get up early monday morning and do his stupid homework then—and that was that
1	is it not clear to you that purposed speculation on the charm that great guilt exercises upon goodness renders the very act of its grace utterly impossible ?
1	holger ’ s admirers seemed not to be troubled by any of it
1	but why toughen them if civilization and progress demand there be no more war ?
1	don ’ t you see that you are carrying on as if something serious and awful had happened to you , as if your husband had cruelly betrayed you , holding you up to shame before all the world ?
1	i ’ ve always tended to close things up inside me
1	you ’ re quite welcome here , my good herr grünlich , replied the consul , who along with his sons had stood up to shake their guest ’ s hand
1	it might be better not to have her sit , but to paint her from memory
1	at best one could have seen his lecture as devoted to the problem of freedom , which he treated as the basis for confusion
1	and his family shuddered at the despondency , cowardice , and lack of self-respect that had replaced it
1	people stand there , never flagging , while the dirty slush melts away under their feet ; they look at one another , they crane their necks to see what is happening up front
1	will this weapon be able to avert substantial losses ?
1	time , severe attacks very similar to seasickness returned , and kiirbis 's diagnosis quickly began to waver , or rather was reinforced in a different sense-he was now certain in his belief that my friend 's ailment should be treated as a chronic gastric catarrh with a significant dilation of the stomach on the right side , accompanied by hyperemia , which impaired the flow of blood to the brain
1	that blessing comes from my heart , and whether or not you may be of the same opinion , i feel that you can use it
1	the flow of blood was strong and persistent and kept him occupied for a good half hour , forcing him to run back and forth between the bench and the brook , rinsing out his handkerchief , sniffing water to rinse his nostrils , then lying down flat on the planks again , the wet cloth over his nose
1	you do understand , don ’ t you ?
1	you do not want to know anything about other destinees , but only about your own , as something singular- !
1	as it was , for the last several weeks the group ’ s social activities had been restricted by the poor health of their chief , the great pieter peeperkorn , whose malign memento of the tropics refused to respond to either the exceptional climate or the antidotes prescribed by as excellent a physician as director behrens
1	the last flame was flickering behind him
1	a tooth—senator buddenbrook had died of a toothache , that was the word around town
1	she had never regarded this woman , who had entered the buddenbrook household much later than she , as a full-fledged member of the family ; indeed , in her later years , she had begun to assume the airs of an old family retainer with exaggerated ideas of authority
1	i share your opinion completely , my good friend
1	as a cripple—gentlemen , you must grasp the situation in its entirety—leopardi lacked the love of a woman , and that in fact was what made him incapable of preventing his soul from being stunted
1	hans castorp waited , his eyes blinking , his lungs full of air
1	one beer , six milks
1	there was evening—and there had just been morning
1	fame and virtue lost their luster for him , he viewed nature as evil—and she is evil , stupid and evil , i agree with him there—and he despaired , horrible to say , he despaired of science and progress
1	there were six or seven people of various ages , from very young things to a few who were somewhat further along in years
1	frau stöhr called him a money magnet and could point to a pearl necklace that madame chauchat had been wearing with her evening gowns since her return and that in karoline ’ s opinion could hardly be considered evidence of transcaucasian marital gallantry , but rather was the result of shared travel expenses
1	but it is not at all proper to speak of such things at present
1	all this can be weighed quite calmly—indeed , must be weighed calmly , because it is a serious matter
1	i mean her first name
1	as he entered the dining room , gerda greeted him cheerfully
1	and in its musical substance , this piece-which has won , touched , enraptured even reluctant hearers-is , for him who has ears to hear and eyes to see , a reprise of the devil 's laughter
1	the consul could not see her face ; but it bore the same expression it had on many a summer evening , when she would lean against the little window of her room in travemünde
1	it was solely because he shared the all too charitable biases of his age , he said , that the great dante had taken that mediocre scribbler seriously and had assigned him such an important role in his own epic , a role to which herr lodovico probably assigned far too much masonic significance
1	as had been the case with several items in the story , this piece of information reminded hans castorp of his own grandfather , who likewise had worn black all the years his grandson had known him , although for reasons profoundly different from those of this grandfather here ; hans castorp thought now of those old-fashioned clothes , the makeshift adaptation by which hans lorenz castorp ’ s true nature , belonging to a time long past , had indicated its dislike of the present , until in death he had solemnly returned to the form appropriate to him—in spanish ruff
1	two green folding tables had been set up for devotees of games—dominoes at the one , bridge at the other , although only young people were playing cards , among them herr albin and hermine kleefeld
1	i was going to have a baby
1	evidently you are amused at the idea of my serenus as a messenger of love
1	they shouldn ’ t make any special intellectual or emotional demands of him , and he wouldn ’ t make any of them
1	and the gently animated calm suddenly filled little johann with a delicious awareness of the quiet , well-tended , elegant seclusion of this resort , which he loved more than anything else
1	and perhaps even more explicitly than ignorant frau stöhr , she represented the union of sickness and stupidity that hans castorp had declared intellectually offensive—for which settembrini had rebuked him
1	but out of idealism and love for the beauty of song , he ignored his distress and , despite frequent sighs , gave it all he had , until finally he sank down at the base of a thick pine tree—totally out of breath and gasping , half-blind , with only bright patterns dancing before his eyes , his pulse skittering
1	just look at him lying there
1	he was one of the smallest boys , one of the grinds
1	and now , she cried , hop to , rudolf !
1	these few lines are penned to say that that same face has not ceased to float before his mind ’ s eye , that during all the suspense and anxiety of the last weeks he has never ceased to recall how last he saw it on that precious afternoon in your parents ’ salon , when you let slip that half-promise with such modesty , and yet to what blissful effect
1	damned if that isn ’ t quite a hike through your house , buddenbrook !
1	this learned man engaged in such serious intellectual endeavors ?
1	what a shame—instead of listening , he was probably reading his russian grammar
1	kai worked on his new literary project the whole hour , and hanno kept himself occupied by conducting an orchestral overture
1	even hans castorp , despite his having once heard that kind , generous oh , please , go ahead and look emerge from the night , held back and at the last moment was quite prepared to let someone else go first
1	and here one bold word that comes from the experiences of our own time
1	speak calmly to her
1	good god , it was obviously no intoxicating bliss for a woman to sleep with helmut institoris !
1	and in short , herr settembrini ’ s unrelenting pedagogy could have packed its bags when confronted with those faces in the violent ward , on which a shudder of religious awe would have had a more humanizing effect than the sort of arrogant moralizing about reason with which this most worthy knight of the sun and vicar of solomon here had chosen to combat madness
1	i can only repeat that the paragraphs and asterisks in this book are simply a concession to the reader 's eyes , and that if it were up to me , i would write the whole thing in one fell swoop , in one breath , without any divisions , indeed without paragraphs and indentations
1	at age eight or nine , adrian probably did not do so either
1	if she happened to be out shopping with him at the pastry shop , for example , she would never forget to reach coolly into one of the bowls of sweets on the counter and hand him something , without even thinking of paying—the baker should take it as an honor , shouldn ’ t he ?
1	he thanked me for being kind enough to take his place , and i did not sit down again after greeting him this second time
1	they were on the main street between the kurhaus and the hotel belvedere , on the way back to davos-dorf
1	this happened in , at the end of may
1	he had been making false progress for a good while now ; wrapped in a vortex of white night , he had worn himself out blindly working his way ever deeper into the indifferent menace
1	it was highly likely that it was a more decisive factor than her dislike of herr grünlich
1	and if in the course of both conversations , recorded and unrecorded , the genius of the place had called him , hans castorp , a joli bourgeois au petit endroit humide—in its way , a translation of settembrini ’ s phrase problem child of life—the question then was : which part of this mixed character would prove the stronger , the bourgeois or the other ?
1	sophie had nodded once more and then vanished into thin air
1	now and then a book or publication would appear that everyone fought over , and even those who had given up reading would grab for it , with only pretended disinterest
1	but you mustn ’ t let it get you down , tom
1	monsignor hinterpfortner has already suggested it on occasion
1	for that we would not earn the price of an end that belongs to us
1	this sort of thing also occurs repeatedly in the thirteen brentano songs , to which i would definitely like to devote a few words before concluding this chapter-my example , in fact , was taken from the admirable serenade , hark , again the flute is weeping , with its final lines :
1	the phantom gentleman who had sat on his sofa in the twilight and nodded to him had , fortunately , not returned
1	sending two boxes of books and belongings by freight and carrying his always rather light baggage ( including a portfolio housing his score and a rubber basin that had served him as a bathtub even in italy ) , he boarded a train at starnberger station , one of the locals that stopped not only in waldshut , but also , ten minutes later , at his goal in pfeiffering
1	the crystallization vessel in which this transpired was filled to three-quarters with a slightly mucilaginous liquid , diluted sodium silicate to be precise , and from the sandy bottom up rose a grotesque miniature landscape of different colored growths-a muddle of vegetation , sprouting blue , green , and brown and reminiscent of algae , fungi , rooted polyps , of mosses , too , but also of mussels , fleshy flower spikes , tiny trees or twigs , and here and there even of human limbs-the most remarkable thing my eyes had ever beheld , remarkable not so much because of their very odd and perplexing appearance , however , but because of their deeply melancholy nature
1	he still had it in his mouth when everyone stood up to leave
1	as the supervising physician , to be sure , he stood far aloof from anything to do with the commercial side of the operation
1	i think he is a good man , klothilde said softly , drawing out the words , although she was the only person in whom herr grünlich had shown not the least interest
1	hans castorp could feel those black eyes , that gaze of reason and morality , resting in deep mourning upon him , but went right on laying out his cards for a while , before he finally laid his cheek in one hand and stared up with a naughty child ’ s sullen look of false innocence
1	and , as always , bluish shadows lingered in the corners of her somewhat too small and somewhat too close-set brown eyes
1	well , as far as the devil went , he and herr settembrini had discussed him over a year ago
1	their cousins , on the other hand , the two sons of dr moritz hagenström the lawyer , were more delicate and gentle by nature , but they excelled in their studies and were model students—ambitious , respectful , quiet , and busy as bees , they almost quivered with alertness and were consumed with the idea of being the best in the class and bringing home a report card marked number one
1	accompanied by a piano , it was sung by a tenor , a fellow with tact and taste , who knew how to treat its simultaneously simple and sublime material with a great deal of good sense , musical feeling , and narrative restraint
1	toward morning he had had an attack of fever , which always left him exhausted and was accompanied now by the unpleasant consequences of drink
1	how pretty , healthy , clever , and happy they are
1	herr albin was commissioned to act as their spokesperson and to negotiate with whatever presences might appear , since he had taken part in séances on a few occasions prior to this
1	at home , his favorite stories were about his office in valparaiso , about the extreme heat that was the rule there , and about a young fellow from london named johnny thunderstorm , a gentleman of leisure , whom he had never seen do a lick of work , goddamn if i did , but who nevertheless had been a very clever businessman
1	that world , however , is apparently willing-whether blindly or correctly , i dare not decide-to take the loss into the bargain
1	often there were also certain children with me in the room , boys and girls , who sang me a motet from pages of notes , smiling right craftly the while and interchanging glances
1	in his absence they asked hans castorp about him , and people even came over from other tables to ask
1	hans castorp had once noticed them in the blowhard ’ s room and offered—against his better judgment , in a spirit of absolute neutrality—to borrow the pistols from him
1	it ’ s only too apparent sometimes that he ’ s not from the best of families , that unfortunately he did not enjoy what people call good breeding
1	and besides , most people find that sort of talk entertaining
1	he was no doubt welcome there , and there was equally no doubt that negotiations for his termination proceeded rather slowly in munich , where they were reluctant to let him go
1	thiefs , thiefs ! , sending them all leaping from their beds
1	hans castorp looked around him—and what he saw was indeed uncanny and malicious
1	the room was filled with men with hands thrust into their trouser pockets , crossed behind their backs , or thrown into the air—all standing in little groups and arguing
1	and then he would accommodate the competition 's social jealousies , by telling how he had been here and there yesterday , at the langewiesches ' and all the rest of them ; at the rollwagens ' , who had those two smashing daughters
1	his face and hands were brown from the sea air , but if their intention in sending him to the shore was to make him stronger , fresher , more energetic and robust , then they had failed miserably—and he was fully aware of that disheartening fact
1	he could not stand it
1	and then there ’ s the snow—it mixes everything higgledy-piggledy
1	but it was in god ’ s hands
1	he was as parsimonious as possible about anything that would not expose him to gossip—except for his own wardrobe , every bit of which he had made by a tailor in hamburg ; he spared no expense in replenishing it and keeping it in repair
1	but when the puppy got back home ,
1	a returnafter that parting ?
1	drooping nose ; a large , expressive mouth ; and brown eyes whose gaze betrayed earnest kindness , and cleverness as well
1	you ’ re wearing a new dress , he said , as an excuse for gazing at her
1	i had the honor of telling your countrymen about that great poet and freethinker once his life had drawn to a close
1	should i have been glad ?
1	the issue , however , is not me , but you
1	but a changed idea-is that still a fresh idea at all ?
1	but that does not mean i think the trial will go in his favor
1	all those things you have established in regard to morality , you and your ailing compatriot—do you seriously suppose they surprise me ?
1	perhaps there were exceptions , people who spent the hours of their rest cure with some sort of serious intellectual pursuit , some rewarding study of one topic or another , even if they did so only to maintain contact with life on the plains or to give a little weight to time , a deeper draft to its keel , and prevent it from becoming pure time and nothing else
1	a few days later , at the corner of breite and meng strasse , as she was returning from a walk , tony ran into herr grünlich
1	it gives me the illusion of independence
1	i ’ ll write more about it as soon as possible
1	the large carved chest , the gold-plated candelabra , and the other items that now belonged to the senator and his wife were hauled off to fischer grube
1	was he walking by the sea , that professor who was first struck by this notion , the faint bitter taste of eternity on his lips ?
1	he would rail ( behind his brother 's back ) against such provocative license and could not be brought around by his sister 's conciliatory words , who alleged that the lawyer suffered from an excess of blood , putting him in constant danger of an apoplectic stroke due to the heat and thus necessitating light apparel
1	in the resounding baritone of the occupant , with that exotic , tapped r sound and a diphthongized distortion of the vowel—and saw his cousin vanish into the twilight of dr krokowski ’ s analytical pit
1	his fiancee was not in attendance , by the way-but had already returned to paris , so one heard
1	bullinger said , employing one of the standard phrases that for some time now had been a favorite of aesthetes and connoisseurs as a way of crudely tempering the awestruck beautiful
1	he dropped all his rs as he said it , and black came out as bleck—and his face was so convincingly comic at depicting this extuhnal sleekness and dapperness that they all broke into laughter
1	because i have shown you your desperate heart and with a savant 's insight set before your eyes the downright insuperable difficulties of composing now-adays ?
1	in any case , being in love inflicted on him all the pain and all the joys that the condition brings with it the whole world over
1	i beg you , herr albin , do put that knife away , put it in your pocket before there ’ s an accident !
1	learn german , and rightly so , since by the luck of linguistic convention her fluent french was her railway ticket to both status and wealth
1	yes , in the contemplation of this music , admiration and sadness mingled in the most peculiar way
1	in simple terms , he agreed to the divorce
1	it was not unusual for him to be unsettled by his own scruples , to feel divided and perplexed in his attitudes toward the world ’ s larger constellations
1	that was japoll—but there wasn ’ t much to salvage there
1	but did you know his sister is divorced ?
1	i might add that i have played a personal role in the destinies of our buddenbrooks on a few occasions
1	though he be called suso , yet of a truth is named praestigiar , did rise up and assail your ears with such hellish yelping and bawling , insomuch as you have ventured such trouble and burthen for my sake
1	for his part , hans castorp regretted this standstill and thought with pride and concern about honor-loving joachim , who with one heroic , courageous effort had ripped to shreds the tough fabric of rhadamanthine rhetoric , sought out his flag , and now , in hans castorp ’ s imagination , stood clutching it , three fingers of his right hand raised to swear his oath of loyalty
1	this substance could then stream from the medium and temporarily congeal outside his or her body to form biologically living organs , which served as grasping mechanisms , the hands that performed those astonishing trifles they had all witnessed in dr krokowski ’ s laboratory
1	her moist handkerchief still in her hand , she sat upright on her pillows and said angrily , four years
1	they still haven ’ t invented rays that can get through layers of fat like those
1	my cousin and i
1	they knew that in our last hours all our loved ones who have gone before come to gather us to them with hymns and blessings
1	god has not blessed us with children , but what would have been mine had i outlived you , let it devolve on him when the day comes that you follow me to that better world , that he may enjoy something of it in this life
1	for the gas fireplace behind the semicircle was putting out heat
1	and so october passed , and november , too
1	for instance , did the seven weeks he had demonstrably , indubitably spent with these people here feel like a mere seven days ?
1	attack and defense were the same in our case ; together they formed the high emotion of our ordeal , of our callipg , of the great moment , of sacred necessity
1	the third day , the morning of the third day , brought with it gentle release
1	coffee cups in hand , plates of cake on their knees , they silently picnicked in the tumult
1	hearing his sister ’ s steps in the dining room , he removed the pince-nez and gazed anxiously into the darkness until tony entered through the portieres and moved out into the light
1	it ’ s six this round , but that ’ s no reason to be down in the dumps
1	tony carefully waded up through the tall , sharp rushes bordering the exposed beach
1	they should not , however , interpret it as mystification , as mere setting of the mood
1	thus he had also refused adrian 's proposal that he furnish the libretto to love 's labour 's lost
1	but your emphasis on that verb leaves me cold , inasmuch as the heroic age that wrested ’ your ideals came to an end long ago—those ideals are dead , or at best lie twitching in their death throes , and those whom they had hoped to finish off have got their foot in the door again
1	no , hans castorp insisted with a ferocity not at all appropriate to the mild objection joachim had offered
1	art 's vital need for revolutionary progress and achievement of the new depends on the vehicle of the strongest subjective sense for what is hackneyed , for what has nothing more to say , for those standard , normal means that have now become 'impossible ' ; and so art helps itself to apparently unvital elements : personal weariness and intellectual boredom , the disgust that comes with perceiving 'how it 's done , the cursed proclivity to see things in light of their own parody , the 'sense of the comic'-what i am saying is : art , in its will to live and progress , puts on the mask of these dull-hearted personal traits in order to manifest , objectivize , and fulfill itself in them
1	that definitely put an end to chivalry—why not go ahead and shoot at each other separated by only a handkerchief !
1	it ’ s different with you
1	let it be , my child
1	for the most part-one might say , almost always-she traveled , leaving her homes , of which she apparently was not fond and from which restlessness or painful memories drove her , to the care of managers and major-domos
1	i am afraid i do not have at my command the means to express , to drive home my feelings and wishes-particularly not in the company of others , before whom i really am somewhat embarrassed to play the lady 's man and cavalier
1	that would continue until the next fad took over—when , for instance , the collection and incessant consumption of chocolate in every conceivable form might become the fashion
1	i was thinking only recently that it ’ s really foolish the way the local ladies carry on about death and things connected with it , that everyone is so skittish , protecting them and making sure the last rites are brought while they ’ re downstairs eating
1	should i not have done so ?
1	of late , however , although the transition had been so gradual his audience had scarcely noticed , his interests had moved in a new direction , toward magical , arcane matters ; and his fortnightly lectures in the dining hall—the sanatorium ’ s main attraction , the pride of its brochure—which were always delivered from behind a cloth-covered table in an exotic , drawling accent , to an immobile audience of berghof residents and for which he always wore a frock coat and sandals , no longer dealt with masked forms of love in action or the transformation of illness back into conscious emotion , but with the abstruse oddities of hypnotism and somnambulism , the phenomena of telepathy , prophetic dreams , and second sight , the wonders of hysteria ; and as he discussed these topics , philosophic horizons expanded until suddenly his audience beheld great riddles shimmering before their eyes , riddles about the relationship between matter and the psyche , indeed , the very riddle of life itself , which , so it appeared , might be more easily approached along very uncanny paths , the paths of illness , than by the direct road of health
1	the crack of the shot raised echoes all around
1	joachim had claimed a seat with his coat , plaid blanket , and roses
1	you ’ ve suddenly come to a halt , have you ?
1	jakobs has done it in the finest taste , as always
1	barely twenty years old , but already graying and balding , the patient was emaciated , his skin waxen ; he had large hands , large ears , a large nose ; grateful to the point of tears for this diversion and their encouraging words , he actually wept a little out of weakness as he greeted them and accepted the bouquet
1	since the days of gregory the great , the founder of the city of god on earth , the church has seen it as her task to bring mankind back under divine rule
1	i sat at his feet in bologna
1	not have the aria ?
1	but the profits had been distributed very unevenly
1	but that had been a dream , and the waking hans castorp was a different man , less uninhibited than in his dreams
1	the four guests from the berghof had run into settembrini there , and then quite by chance naphta had joined them
1	and as far as the rest goes ?
1	by the time you get back to göttingen you ’ ll have forgotten everything
1	in rubber boots and with a turned-up coat collar , he accompanied his cousin again for the first time up to the bench beside the water trough and back
1	all the same , he was touched and glad that the ice had been broken ; for despite his trophy , the macabre gift that he wore next to his heart , he was very fond of herr settembrini , set great store by his presence , and the thought of being totally rejected and abandoned would have weighed down on him more heavily than had the feeling of being a schoolboy no longer in the running and enjoying the advantages of disgrace , just like herr albin
1	i do hope that you ’ ll make yourself comfortable and soon feel right at home here with us
1	why are you forever cringing and writhing ?
1	only we germans have both together
1	beneath it , her virginal breasts lay unencumbered and softly outlined—she was apparently wearing little else
1	that means : the last memories of the perils of human life will have vanished and with them , the spiritual problem in general
1	herr stanislaw von zutawski chose the shortest , and in his considered opinion most thorough and , given the circumstances , most appropriate course of action , after having been indirectly informed that herr kasimir j apoll intended to leave the aforementioned town the following day ,
1	the cousins , the one with a brick-red face , the other tanned bronze , walked along without overcoats , which would only have been burdensome in the glaring sun—young ziemssen wearing sport clothes and rubber galoshes , hans castorp dressed much the same , though in long trousers , since he was not the sort who gave much thought to his physique
1	but naphta had also visited madhouses , and he recalled having entered a violent ward , the kind of place that offered scenes and images for which , good god , herr settembrini ’ s reasonable stare and decorous influence would hardly have been a match
1	but a day without tobacco—that would be absolutely insipid , a dull , totally wasted day
1	his bloodshot eyes wandered eastward for help , to the far left-hand corner of the dining hall
1	you have not been residing here among us for so long now that , taken all in all , the question can be removed just yet from the agenda
1	a thirty-two-year-old man of medium height came across the garden , hat and cane in the same hand , his stride rather short , his head thrust forward ; he wore worsted gloves and a yellow-green wool coat of long cut
1	how could hans castorp not have held work in high esteem ?
1	go ahead and piddle your life away , just as you ’ ve done so far
1	feeble , very feeble , this advertiser of ours , he said
1	the next morning she gave almost everyone in the dining hall a colorful box of konfekti as a memento and then left on her little trip with the two girls
1	in the case of brahms , for whom he had very high regard , he showed adrian the allusions to archaic elements , to old church modes , and how this ascetic component opened an avenue onto somber riches and dark abundance
1	yes , castorp , he said—and this was the first time he had ever addressed the young man simply by his last name—just as i thought , the situation looks rather praeter-propter
1	how long had joachim actually lived up here with him , whether measured until his wild departure or taken as a whole ?
1	she lived in the twilight of her curtained rooms , seldom went out , and dreaded the sun , the dust , the common people in their sunday best , the smell of coffee , beer , and tobacco
1	our smallest unit of time is the month
1	the lamps haven ’ t even been lit yet
1	wehsal rode alone in the second carriage as it wound its way up the looping drive to the portal of the berghof , where they all parted
1	and the needs of my heart , are they to count for nothing ?
1	all the same , he remained determined to put to immediate good effect the bustle of arrival , the hearty billowing of his breath in the cold air , the warmth of his quick walk in the winter morning
1	i : and yet it is only by means of this non plus ultra that one arrives at the highest enhancement of dramatically theological existence , which is to say : at the most reprobate guilt and , through it , at the last and irresistible provocation of infinite goodness
1	it takes two for a divorce , my child
1	tony fell into a dreamy half-sleep , her head nodding under a big , flat straw hat and a gray parasol , which she had propped against the folded-back carriage top
1	he gestured with both hands for those present to look at joachim , insisting they mourn with him
1	bathing and swimming , dr langhals had said
1	this , however , caused that sweet face to look strangely , horribly deformed ; and especially when accompanied by fits of teeth-gnashing that were soon part of the affliction , the impression created was that of a child possessed
1	naphta , who had cast his coat aside in the snow so that the mink lining was visible , started walking , pistol in hand , toward the outer heel mark as soon as it was drawn , before ferge was even done with the other lines
1	the absolute , the holy terror these times require , can arise only out of the most radical skepticism , out of moral chaos
1	madame chauchat was also wearing a belted coat of some warm , fuzzy , large-checked fabric , and had even thrown a little fur over her shoulders
1	; a lucky find like mendelssohn 's on the wings of song , the invention of a musician whom adrian would extol highly to me , saying that metrically he was the richest of allwhat fruitful topics for discussion !
1	but this aroused such a storm of protest from frau permaneder that gerda had to put the idea aside for the time being
1	and then i learned that this was often the case
1	such measurements might well have brought forth disconcerting results—particularly given joachim ’ s dreadfully excited state , in which he would by turns flush darkly with joy and grow pale with anticipation
1	settembrini came , was sympathetic and charming—and having always called joachim lieutenant , he now addressed him as capitano
1	and so you propose to spend the winter with us , do you ?
1	yes , methyl aldehyde , even the toughest bacteria can ’ t take that—hco , but it does burn in your nose , doesn ’ t it ?
1	any concern about her own health has become somewhat secondary , naturally
1	the piano , which had briefly fallen silent , struck up again , now under the hands of the man from mannheim , who had taken over for the slavic lad
1	fine , continue , peeperkorn commanded softly
1	one possibility was fiissen , with nearby neuschwanstein
1	he glided on rubber soles , so salzmann said , to keep the dying from hearing his approach
1	he had uttered this last word more softly than any he had spoken thus far—and without gestures , at most , a quick flash of his glasses
1	he leapt to his feet , but immediately sat back down and cried in a wavering voice that first faltered , broke , and then , in its joy , found itself again , ah , thank you , thank you !
1	he was fairness personified
1	she silently reached for her pince-nez with her other hand , and as her mouth slowly opened wide , she read the notice—and then let out two cries of horror , pressing the palms of both hands to her cheeks and holding her elbows out wide from her body
1	a telegram announcing his imminent arrival was sent directly to the estate , whereupon , or so i assume , hastily agreed-upon arrangements flew back and forth between there and some hotel in vienna
1	we know that spirit—thanks , but no thanks
1	yes—no—the way one knows things here
1	and she ’ s cooperative , even prepares some of our northern dishes , under my direction ; yesterday , for instance , we had sorrel and raisins , but permaneder was so upset with this vegetable dish of mine ( although he did pick out the raisins with his fork ) that he wouldn ’ t speak to me the rest of the day , just grumbled to himself
1	clarissa received the registered letter in pfeiffering , where , for a few weeks since the closing of the theater season in pforzheim , she had been a guest at her mother 's little house behind the chestnut trees
1	fine , joachim said , that ’ s what we ’ ll do for now
1	germany is free , insofar as one can call a devastated nation deprived of its sovereignty free , and it may be that nothing now stands in the way of my returning to my profession
1	hermetism ’ —that ’ s well put , herr naphta
1	it was not clear why the director ’ s comments had sent her into gales of laughter
1	that i am nevertheless devoted to it with all my heart is one of those contradictions which , whether a cause for joy or regret , are inseparable from human nature
1	thomas , my boy , would you be so good , johann buddenbrook said and pulled a large ring of keys from his trouser pocket
1	i may say that i have a good sense of what is legitimate
1	countless numbers of these unmanned , winged messengers of destruction were fired from the coast of france and fell exploding over southern england and , if we are not totally deceived , will soon have proved to be a veritable calamity for our foes
1	her mother said , advise you to consent , my child ?
1	he even took his skis in the cablecar to the top of schatzalp to glide about happily up there , abducted into a world of shimmering , powdery slopes , sixty-five hundred feet above sea level , from where in good weather he had a glorious panorama of the scene of his adventures
1	and yet it would doubtless be—should i ascribe it to the influence , shall we say , to the pedagogic principles of signor settembrini that in regard to your own chivalrous impulses , you have—i beg you , please understand me when i say
1	people wear their best black clothes and take their hats off and gaze at the coffin and seem so serious and devout—and no one dares make bad jokes , the way they normally do
1	that ’ s ivy at the windows , simple wooden furniture , oak
1	the humanist begged the other gentlemen not to believe it
1	she seemed fidgety and laughed incessantly—a very high , silvery-bright , bubbly laugh that left her fighting for breath , which only made her seem that much more nervous , excited , and titillated
1	the hunchbacked mexican , who , because he knew none of the languages represented here , wore the expression of a deaf-mute , was forever taking photographs—a comical figure nimbly dragging his tripod from one point on the terrace to another
1	how right you are to add and yet , jean
1	they left orders for them to be delivered to the sanatorium at once : international sanatorium berghof , room
1	and now the row of wooden beach pavilions , with their little round roofs lay before them , and beyond that , closer to the water , the wicker beach chairs with families encamped around them in the warm sand : ladies with pince-nez tinted blue and library books ; gentlemen in light-colored suits , lazily drawing figures in the sand with their walking sticks ; tanned children under immense straw hats—shoveling , tumbling , digging for water , baking pies in wooden plates , burrowing tunnels , wading up to their naked knees in the low surf , sailing little ships
1	as behrens entered , there was a burst of bright , merry laughter inside the room , but any words were broken off as the door closed
1	i can not describe the suspense with which i looked forward to that gathering
1	what held him back were scruples of conscience—although it was patently most unconscionable to pay no attention to time
1	he gathered up some writing materials to take out with him for his rest cure—because there could be no more delays , a letter home , his third , would have to be written—and went on being angry , muttering things about this windbag and quibbler , who was sticking his nose into things that were none of his business , but who hummed little songs at girls in public
1	he had learned from naphta that settembrini was a freemason—which made no less an impression on him than had the italian ’ s revelation of naphta ’ s jesuit origins and patronage
1	education and property—behold the bourgeoisie !
1	the reporter regretted that there was no conceivable way to catch and bring to the surface some of these ogres of the deep-at least those that were totally unknown
1	ultimately , however , it was not so much consul buddenbrook himself and his personality that set herr gosch ’ s passions afire , as it was the young madame buddenbrook , née arnoldsen
1	and what do you do ?
1	she served it to them in a parlor to the left of the entryway , a vaulted room that was almost a formal hall or rustic drawing room , with a massive table , window nooks that revealed how thick the walls were , and a plaster winged victory of samothrace set atop the colorfully painted hutch
1	everyone seems to be in collusion
1	nor was the management taking a backseat to anyone
1	grief-stricken as they were , her parents held up their end of the brief conversation , as good manners demanded , inquiring about the cousins ’ own circumstances and making other conventional remarks
1	behind him stood the broad structure of the apparatus , a glass retort extruding tubes and half filled with liquid visible on its top rear shelf
1	it was still unclear to me after the evening of the party on brienner strasse , where i became acquainted with marie godcau
1	but if she ’ s been walking rapidly , then she can whistle from inside , and of course she uses it then to startle people , especially newly arrived patients
1	we had spoken about it at supper
1	have a n c
1	i am supposed to join in for these few weeks , hans castorp said with a laugh , looking down at the ground
1	he drank a bottle at every main meal , sometimes one and a half , even two , not to mention the bread , with which he started every meal , including first breakfast
1	do you still recall ?
1	i certainly am , joachim replied
1	for this much is surely clear , that i have not dwelt at length on the preceding primarily in order to explain why i did not feel particularly comfortable in halle , but rather for the same reason that i went into such detail about wendell kretzschmar 's lectures in kaisersaschern : that is , because it is and must be my concern for the reader to be a witness to adrian 's intellectual experiences
1	who shall deliver me from the body of this death ?
1	it will do me good
1	and he was delighted that he had regained the capacity
1	oh , how prettily you express it
1	yes—i do mean you
1	snow had fallen in huge flakes several times over the last few days , but had not stuck and merely left the ground wet ; the drifts of winter had melted , evaporated , and vanished , except for a few scattered remnants
1	but they also enabled him to perceive , understand , and internalize the ever-intensifying accent on shock and indescribable adventure that people up here , both generally and individually , attributed to the matter
1	she stopped , because tremulous , stifled sounds were coming from the folds of her skirt
1	you would see me prepared
1	but of course , herr settembrini !
1	because a man who gets used to making that charge can very easily be lost to life , to the form of life for which he was born
1	his total estate , therefore , came to ,
1	afterward came years of denial and dissimulation ,
1	the sentries came to attention—heels clicked , necks stiffened , chests expanded
1	lieutenant , do take your cousin here , he said , turning to joachim , who had just arrived , and put him to bed
1	director wulicke roared a sound that sounded like someone scraping violently at the deepest note on a contrabass
1	if he ’ s going to the dogs , says she , he can just as well do it down below
1	his change of mind occurred while he was alone in the music room one evening , playing yet once again the recording stamped with the personality of valentin , for whom he felt such great sympathy
1	when it was repeated , he protested vigorously
1	every sensual act implies tenderness , after all , is an act of giving even as lust is taking , is happiness in making another happy , a demonstration of love
1	main thing is , i been hank ’ rin ’ to pay my respects to you , lovely lady , and to see frau grünlich again
1	he then laid it as carefully as possible on the rim of his washstand and decided for now to put on his overcoat and finish his rest cure
1	and if some one or another of my men should happen to take one along as a souvenir … ’
1	hans castorp had been in the music room and came out to see what had become of joachim , and he found him standing in front of the tiled stove , next to marusya ’ s chair—a rocking chair and joachim was holding onto it with his left hand , tilting it back , so that marusya was in a reclining position , looking up out of her little , round , brown eyes into joachim ’ s face , which was bent down over hers , uttering soft , disjointed phrases , to which she would occasionally respond with a smile or a nervous , disparaging shrug
1	the hundredth anniversary would soon be upon them
1	it was not deep in relation to its width , and on all four sides was a kind of passageway where the sideboards stood and that opened as a series of arches onto the central dining area
1	and to be fair , he had to admit that a hand had now been offered him , now , when the impossible was perhaps not quite so impossible as it would be later—joachim ’ s wild departure could be a support , a guiding hand on the road back to the flatlands , which he would never , ever find all on his own
1	and although one of her fur-lined galoshes keeps flapping open in this slush and slows her down dreadfully , she outruns them all
1	is it truly still a danger , or already a fixed and settled fact ?
1	he picked up the red case with a smile and opened it
1	in the sudden silence , the senator stood tall and erect for a moment , staring at the door through which his brother had vanished
1	two months before i arrived , a student who had been here for a long time went for his checkup—and then hanged himself out in the woods
1	yes , tom , i ’ m bored something awful
1	i never would have thought that i ’ d see him so clearly again
1	so you like being at the shore , do you ?
1	he : your curiosity is boyish and indiscreet
1	as you might guess , it has to do with surgery , an operation that they perform up here
1	when class was over , dr mantelsack would chat quite genially with them
1	like thomas aquinas , they regarded trade in general—the basic commercial act of buying and selling for a profit without having altered or improved the product—as a despicable occupation
1	hans castorp gathered his wits to try to catch up , but did not succeed right away , since he had not heard the beginning and then had missed still more of it while contemplating frau chauchat ’ s rounded back
1	o satana , o ribellione !
1	it took them the whole break between classes ; then the bell rang and dr marotzke appeared
1	en fin , the connections i owed to the fourberies came in handy for me and even multiplied when i then opened my office for arranging performances of contemporary music
1	i admit that it took a while before i realized that although on the one hand the church did not wish to be seen as uninvolved , neither was it ready to bless an avowed suicide , however honorable-in short , that what this sturdy gentleman really wanted was for me to lie
1	the effect , then , was rather unpleasant , but that did not prevent hugo weinschenk from being a hardworking , energetic , and respectable young man who earned twelve thousand marks courant a year—or from being , in erika grünlich ’ s eyes , a handsome man
1	we all love people like that , whether we want to or not , because when they annoy us with their carelessness , the annoyance becomes just one more reason for being fond of them
1	but what did the masses want ?
1	he stood there in a limp pose , his eyes directed to the floor , and in a faint , languid voice he said , father …
1	and naphta maliciously agreed , saying that it certainly was not a question of any lack of technical skill
1	but i wanted to say something else
1	the only thing this prosaic young man had retrieved from his hour of adventure , however , had been the shadowy token of a pledge—the possibility , bordering on a probability , that frau chauchat would return here , sooner or later , for a fourth stay , just as the illness , which indeed gave her such freedom , might dispose
1	she smiled in response to the calls , fully aware that her outfit looked good on her
1	what was the point of these tortures , of clinging to life in such an expensive , artificial way , when the case was hopeless ?
1	how would one possibly manage without them ?
1	and back there , on the other side of the hall , is another , larger room
1	apostasy is an act of faith , and everything is and happens in god-falling away from him most especially
1	fine , then i shall accept the consequences
1	meanwhile little johann played some piano pieces he had practiced with herr pfühl and accompanied his mother in a mozart sonata—not without several mistakes but with a rich full sound
1	something like nausea stirred in him again ; but he was too exhausted to think about that
1	but now he suddenly sat up and said gruffly , don ’ t you have any money on you , christian ?
1	and after thinking it over calmly , you ’ ll find that there ’ s nothing unthinkable about it
1	in any case , she was the great-aunt of the yogurt-eating girl , and both were permanent residents of the sanatorium
1	just think , there was a boy who answered to the name of schappeler , and then there was a certain 'social ' arzt
1	she stammered the same sentence three or four times : you ’ ve made a mistake
1	i was speaking with captain kloot down at the docks this morning
1	wiedemann had a quick , furtive glance
1	in other words : the reality of magic , of demonic influence and bewitchment was thereby confirmed , and certain phenomenalike the evil eye , an empirical complex concentrated in the saga of the basilisk 's deadly glance-were thus wrested from the realm of socalled superstition
1	it was a little past three-thirty when a technical assistant who worked down here opened the door to admit the lucky swedish bruiser—evidently his predecessor had been let out by way of another exit
1	the vernal equinox now lay three months in the past , the summer solstice had arrived
1	the latter , in particular , prevailed in naphta ’ s order , which had originated in spain and whose rules of spiritual exercise—in some sense the equivalent of those that frederick the great later promulgated for his prussian infantry—were first drawn up in spanish , so that naphta frequently used spanish phrases in his stories and lessons
1	to what extent hans castorp ’ s calm , callous self-assurance made things seem that way , and to what extent they actually were that way , making any other course of action indeed inconceivable and impossible—that was , from the very start , something no well-bred gentleman could have decided
1	he could see her knee outlined under her skirt , the back of her neck bent forward under the short , reddish-blond hairs that hung loose from the tucked-up braid , saw the neck bones sticking out—and the shudder passed over him once again
1	a lack of noble intent—the church ?
1	it certainly looked as if the last few years had rounded out his education
1	two tall , massive chinese vases were set on the marble mantel , above which hung a mirror
1	would you allow me—and here herr settembrini bent forward on his chair , and with a smile he placed both feet on the floor , tucked his folded hands between his knees , and thrust his head forward at a slight tilt—would you allow me , he repeated with some emotion in his voice , to lend you a helping hand in your exercises and experiments and to play a corrective role whenever i see danger looming in the form of some pernicious fixation ?
1	amongst those rustic blandishments !
1	and let pfiffi buddenbrook sit here every thursday jiggling with joy at my misfortune , let her say , well , how sad
1	the coarse paper revealed some curious remarks on the subject
1	you ran around in a circle , toiling onward , with the feeling in your heart of doing something useful , when in fact you were tracing a wide , foolish arc that led back on itself , just as the teasing year came full circle
1	which he did—just so that he and clavdia could meet head-on , which was something quite different , more dangerous and more intensely alluring than when she walked before or behind him
1	or perhaps i should say , above the mold , for that was how the boy had announced his satisfaction that the mizzle had whicknend the mold
1	but let us leave aside for now the place and its particularities
1	let the exorcism begin
1	what lord berowne calls barbarism-that is , whatever is spontaneous and natural-celebrates no triumphs in this music
1	and there were certain religious and moral reasons as well—they had heard all about them at the university , although they might not be able to recall them precisely at the moment
1	that was inexperience speaking
1	their relation to the oeverdiecks was a distant one and would be quite useless after the mayor ’ s death
1	once this came to light , it seemed imperative that she be placed under the strict supervision of a boarding school , the one run by fäulein weichbrodt , mühlenbrink
1	and here i am stagnating like an old water hole—a stinking pond , and that ’ s not too crude a comparison , either
1	it very quickly recognizes itself in restraint , finds fulfillment in subordinating itself to law , rule , coercion , system-finds fulfillment in them , but that does not mean it ceases to be freedom
1	because i , too , have seen some marvelous cases of acclimatization
1	i ’ m coming along , thomas , he said flatly
1	you depend upon my pride 's preventing me from the remorse necessary to salvation , yet do not make account of there being a prideful remorse-that of cain , who was of the fast opinion that his sin was greater than could e'er ' be forgiven him
1	but what i mean is , vice is surely not insensitive to such terrors , but on the contrary , gives them their full and just due , to the extent that what drives a man to vice is the failure of feeling in the face of the classic gifts of life ; which therefore does not imply , or does not necessarily imply , an insult to life , since it might equally as well be interpreted as an embracing of life
1	god forbid that such an awful thing should happen
1	he let the candle burn , because there was still not enough daylight
1	we ’ ll have to wait and see what comes of it
1	decomposition , corruption , hans castorp said , but that ’ s really just a kind of burning off , isn ’ t it ?
1	from here one entered the grand hall with its vast parquet floor and four high windows , with wine-red curtains and a view to the garden ; this room , too , ran the full width of the house
1	joachim behaved with perfect propriety and kept his eyes lowered
1	never had thomas buddenbrook so impressed his brother as at this moment
1	theologically speaking , kumpf was an advocate of that intermediary conservatism with critical-liberal infusions that i mentioned before
1	his smile was as terrible as his anger
1	at home he gave the impression of a very energetic , prudent , and—despite his elegance—cold , practical man of business ; but when traveling in regions whose customs were strange to him , in the south of germany , for instance , he was all too quick to be polite and self-effacing and assumed a certain impetuous amiability , which was in no way the result of insecurity about his own culture , but on the contrary reflected both an awareness of its solid integrity and a desire to improve on his own aristocratic tendencies—even amid customs he found simply incredible , he would show no surprise whatever
1	yes , it ’ s a perfectly justifiable question , if you please
1	it was indeed also the period during which before my eyes fateful developments unfolded for certain individuals within our circle of acquaintance , developments scarcely noti < ; : ed by the larger world , of course , but that would lead to catastrophes of which these pages will have to speak , because some of them closely touched the life and fate of my hero , adrian leverkiihn-indeed , as i am profoundly aware , because in one of them he was actively involved in a mysteriously fatal way
1	the lower part of the face , however , was long and narrow and was neither buddenbrook nor kröger , but most decidedly belonged to his mother ’ s side of the family
1	but from the way it quickly moved past it , treating it no differently than any unnumbered mark , it was evident that the whole set of numerals and strokes had only been laid under its path , and that it just kept going , and going
1	we had indeed occasionally agreed-or more accurately , we had seconded the commonly expressed opinion-that philosophy is the queen of the sciences
1	his body felt nothing ; they could have burned and pinched him , it would have made no difference to joachim at that point
1	then i know what i must do , she said
1	he was in göttingen
1	his parents took the little coffin back home with them
1	the krögers ’ son jürgen , the postal official from rostock , is home on a visit—a quiet man , dressed very simply
1	two bearded men were coming toward him , axes on their shoulders , but then , not all that far from him , they took leave of one another
1	i can ’ t go on
1	they passed soundlessly down the coconut runners of the narrow corridor
1	and they laughed and shrugged
1	a source of endless wonder that one flesh lusts after another ; it is indeed a phenomenon-yes , well , the perfectly exceptional phenomenon of love
1	per-mit me , please , to continue
1	my residence is in hamburg , but i am on the road a great deal
1	the topic of conversation continued to be the pietà , for hans castorp kept both one eye and his remarks fixed on it as he turned now to herr settembrini , trying to bring him into critical contact , as it were , with the work of art , even though the humanist ’ s aversion to this bit of decor could very easily be read from the expression on his face when he twisted around to look at it—he had taken a seat with his back to that particular corner
1	his illness is to blame for his not having gone further by now
1	for one associated the idea of the exclusively personal with that of a boundless subjectivity and a radical will to harmonic expression , as opposed to polyphonic objectivity ( and he asked us to fix that differentiation in our minds : harmonic subjectivity , polyphonic detachment ) ; and yet , as with the late masterpieces in general , that comparison , that antithesis did not work here
1	i have no other family than that , since i was orphaned very early
1	what are you thinking of asking , tom ?
1	so that ’ s what causes flushed cheeks , hans castorp said
1	being lifted like this into regions whose air he had never breathed before and whose sparse and meager conditions were , as he well knew , both unfamiliar and peculiar—it all began to excite him , to fill him with a certain anxiety
1	the hands pointed to ten after six
1	the theory of infinite space and time—that was definitely based on experience , was it ?
1	all the same , hans castorp ’ s praise was justified
1	nothing—although it was twenty-four hours
1	poor as a church mouse , he was having trouble at the time with his neglected and decaying teeth and talked of nothing but perfidious dentists who had pretended to treat him out of friendship , but then suddenly presented
1	it was the same with the word inspiration , which one definitely had to avoid in his company-if need be , by substituting a phrase like fresh idea
1	it may perhaps never be known , never recorded in any biography
1	the upshot was that she had come back up here in an overblown state , with constriction of the heart and shortness of breath—ha !
1	and here i crept to the back , because when you came in i thought you were an organ of the pedagogic body
1	this organ-grinder and his insinuations had definitely spoiled the mood for it
1	the nature and essence of this nearly thirty-minute orchestral portrait of the world is mockery-a mockery that confirms only too well the opinion i expressed in our conversation that the pursuit of what is immeasurably beyond man can provide piety no nourishment ; a luciferian travesty ; a sardonic lampoon apparently aimed not only at the dreadful clockwork of the universe , but also at the medium in which it is painted , indeed repeated : at music , at the cosmos of tones
1	as for von riedesel , he had fallen prey to utter confusion
1	do not speak to me of some spiritual redemption ’ that may result from illness—for god ’ s sake , do not speak of it
1	to hell with gaffky !
1	believe me , he said , everything depends on the development of a responsible industrial population , of an international industrial nation that can someday create a genuine and just european economic society
1	grünlich was supposed to give me my housekeeping money today or tomorrow
1	but one glance at his watch , and he gave up that plan
1	she goes to the wardrobe , takes out mother ’ s silk dresses , flings them over her arm , and starts to leave the room
1	but he was not cross , said nothing whatever about it
1	joachim did not ask him whether he had liked the lecture , and hans castorp said nothing about it , either
1	but settembrini replied , most certainly not
1	but it ’ s not the most important thing , not before god !
1	i hoped to send you off to your work , and now you will be fighting alongside your fellows
1	she herself had been repaid in the process by being able to cater to her relaxed , southern german lust for life , in the hope of making up what she had missed , all the while allowing the men she invited-knoterich , kranich , zink , and spengler , �hose young acting students , etc-to pay court to her declining beauty
1	they celebrated the evening of december at the senator ’ s home , but without the ladies buddenbrook from breite strasse and without the old krögers
1	and now deutschlin made the motion that leverkiihn be allowed to finish what he had to say
1	oh , ida , i ’ ve been thinking about the past so much of late , back when grünlich first appeared and the scenes he made—it was scandalous , ida
1	uncle justus , still a gallant man , strode toward her and almost bowed as he took her hand and spoke a few well-chosen words
1	there was one instrument , however-that was to say , one medium of musical realization-through which music was , to be sure , made audible , but in a way that was only semi-sensual , almost abstract , and thus strangely consistent with its intellectual nature : that was the piano
1	i ’ ve made my share of mistakes… but now i ’ m off to the club
1	i vaguely remember something about lemon buns with greasy sausage—some sort of truly ghastly morning snack
1	and you don ’ t say one word to me about it
1	elisabeth buddenbrook ’ s masterpiece , russian preserves , a spicy mixture of fruits conserved in spirits , was passed around
1	cuts were inevitable in any case
1	but the danger of being uncreative-what do you say ?
1	a few weeks before , he had received a letter from monsieur monteux , the director of the russian ballet in paris and formerly of the colonne orchestra ; in it the conductor , as a friend of experiment , had announced his intention to perform marvels of the universe along with some orchestral pieces in a straight concert version of love 's labour 's lost
1	behrens is quite an expert at it
1	but all i deserve now is some cold coffee
1	nor did he do any better when breisacher 's cultural-critical peroration moved on to matters
1	sometimes an officer would pass by in a greatcoat with an upturned collar , both hands in his pockets , hot on the heels of some sweet young shopgirl , but quite aware , too , of the admiring glances of the other young ladies from good families ; and then each sentry would stand in front of his guardhouse , inspect himself from top to bottom , and present arms
1	i will also be discreet about any matter that demands my discretion , and especially keep secret all things that must be kept secret
1	oh certainly , nurse mylendonk
1	it simply seemed worth mentioning that i called him adrian , whereas he , when not evading use of a name entirely , called me zeitblom
1	now and then , when he found no one at the club , christian would drop by as well for a glass of benedictine ; he talked about his intention to act as the agent for a firm that sold champagne and cognac—he knew something about that and it would be easy , pleasant work , you were your own boss , you occasionally jotted down a few orders in your notebook , and , quick as a wink , you had made thirty thalers ; he then immediately borrowed forty shillings from frau permaneder so that he could present a bouquet to the leading lady at the municipal theater , and by some association of ideas—god only knew what they were—found himself talking about maria and the depravities of london , moved on to the story about the mangy dog that had been shipped in a box from valparaiso to san francisco , and , now that he was rolling , went on to tell a wealth of stories with such verve and wit that he could have entertained a whole crowded auditorium
1	vivacious , you know , vim and vigor
1	and so he secretly scouted for an occasion to test himself-himself , but her as well , for he could not distrust himself without soft , indeed tender , though fearful suspicion being cast back on the girl on whom his soul hung
1	accompanied by frizzy-haired tamara and her tablemate with the concave chest , a bulgarian in evening dress , she crossed the room , moving toward the table where gänser and kleefeld were sitting—and brushing past hans castorp ’ s table in her new dress
1	life shuddered at such perfect precision , regarded it as something deadly , as the secret of death itself ; and hans castorp thought he understood why the architects of ancient temples had intentionally and covertly built little deviations from symmetry into their rows of columns
1	committi�g you herewith to god , that he may defend you and all innocent hearts-your very humble servant , as was said in halle-as for that jape and prank due to which there be something afoot twixt satan and myself , i have made you far too curious : 't was nothing more than that as night fell on that first day , said porter led me astray-a churl , a rope round his gut , with red cap and brass badge , in a rain mantle , speaking the same devilish tongue as every man here , with jutting bristled jaw , and by my lights looked somewhat like our schleppfuss by reason of his small beard , in truth looked right like him , when i think on it , or may have grown more like in my remembering
1	it was almost merely for form ’ s sake , a matter of convention , that the gathering presumed the ghosts of the departed would speak by means of a glass
1	and when the memory of it came back to him , its vivid clarity stayed within normal , healthy bounds ; and then hans castorp would pull from his breast pocket the glass memento that he kept in a heavy envelope he carried in his wallet—a little rectangle , which when held parallel to the ground was a black , opaque , reflective surface , but when held up to the sky , grew light and revealed very humanistic things : the transparent picture of a human body , with rib cage , the outline of the heart , the curve of the diaphragm , the bellows of the lungs , plus scapulae and humeri , all surrounded by a pale , hazy halo , the flesh—of which , against all reason , hans castorp had tasted on mardi gras
1	you were just completing your period of bed rest after having been accepted as a patient
1	the complex included forests and meadows , a half-dozen athletic fields , agricultural buildings , including stalls for hundreds of cows
1	then he stopped beside the table and , bending down toward his sister and lightly tapping the tabletop with a crooked index finger , said , let me tell you a little story , my dear tony , one that will show you how i feel about this entire matter
1	her veil blows back and her flushed face is visible ; but that is unimportant now
1	it was almost suffocating to have that hand so close to his eyes—you had to look at it , whether you wanted to or not , to study its inherent humanness and all its defects , as if you were holding a magnifying glass to it
1	but his hair had been trimmed just as he had always worn it in life , and herr wenzel had used a curling iron to set and curl his mustaches , so that they extended well beyond his white cheeks
1	the preachers in town likewise came and went as friends of the house
1	she looked her very best in a becoming olive winter suit trimmed with narrow bands of brown fur , and more or less obeying my emotionssimply because i knew what was coming-i delighted over and over in looking at her black eyes , at that merry sheen of pitch and coal beneath the shade of her lashes
1	tony , she then said in gentle reproach , and after carefully extracting the large pin that held tony ’ s hat in place and laying the hat on the window seat , she lovingly stroked her daughter ’ s ash-blond hair with both hands , calming her
1	now that the wind had picked up , the evening had turned noticeably cooler
1	yet even though hans castorp was prepared , as he had been all along , to lend him an ear , to consider his lectures worth listening to—quite noncommittally—and to let himself be pedagogically influenced , that in no way meant that , on the basis of a strictly educational point of view , he should desist from his enterprise , which still seemed to have an important impact , to be beneficial in some vague way—despite madame gerngross and her talk about a nice little fleert , despite the businesslike personality of poor young rotbein or the foolish trillings of lady overblown
1	then know this : we pledge to you the vital efficacy needed for what you will accomplish with our help
1	wasn ’ t he ever going to be able to calm down ?
1	they were expensive books , as scientific works always are
1	it is truly ridiculement exageree , especially when it comes to 'glory
1	they could hear the bowing , the tremolo in the fingers as they slid sweetly from one position to the next and found their melody , a waltz , ach , ich habe sie verloren
1	it ran in a determined zigzag from token to token , but pulling back slightly toward the middle with each move ; it ran to the h , to the o , to the l , after which it seemed to grow weary and confused , not to know what to do , but then it recovered , found the g , the e , and the r just as they thought !
1	a slight misunderstanding , pastor mathias said in confusion
1	in the same way , the body , and love of the body , too , are indecent and disagreeable ; the body ’ s surface blushes and turns pale because it is afraid and ashamed of itself
1	she stared at him with large , sad eyes that slowly began to glisten with tears , and said , no , morten , do you believe that of me ?
1	pretty marusya almost choked on her orange-scented handkerchief , and frau stöhr began to shriek , holding both hands to her left breast
1	too many troubles have rained down on me
1	his upper body swayed back and forth as he struggled for air in short , labored breaths through his half-open mouth , and kept rocking his head back and forth , as if he had been struck some incomprehensible blow
1	religious socialism , religiosity committed to social concerns , that was the thing , for it all depended on finding the right commitment , and the theonomous bond had to be joined to the social bond , to the task god had imposed on us to perfect society
1	although he had one of the best seats and could easily have read the passage from his book , he was too lazy even for that today
1	and it ’ s not just her—it ’ s the maids , too
1	consul johann buddenbrook ’ s younger son had recovered from his rheumatic fever in oeynhausen , but a certain stiffness lingered in his limbs , and he was certainly not free of the periodic ache in his left side—where all the nerves were too short—or of any other of the ailments to which he felt himself disposed : difficulties in breathing and swallowing , irregular pulse , and a tendency to paralysis , or at least the fear of it
1	i asked you to come up because—but , then , you know what this is about , and i know that you are in agreement with us
1	do you want to know just how stupid i used to be ?
1	here on the right are the kitchen and the pantry
1	at this point his uncle addressed him as my boy , and asked if he was crazy
1	its nordic classical façade , painted a dreary , weather-beaten color , was adorned by pilasters at both sides of the front door , which was set in the center of the first floor and had five stairs leading up to it ; the main level was topped off by two more stories , both with windows reaching to the floor and ornamented with wrought-iron grills
1	and had it been up to him , the city administration nowadays would look just as old-fashioned and idyllic as his office had looked when he was in his prime
1	but what concern is that of mine ?
1	well , then , you can fall in , two by two , tomorrow
1	and so arzt has chosen socialism and carl teutleben nationalism
1	no doubt of it , totally anemic , just as i said
1	and are you satisfied with ida ?
1	and although he did not spare herr settembrini , but let the italian worry that he found naphta ’ s malice worth listening to , he nevertheless had to admit that it was now out of control , indeed often went beyond the bounds of a sane , healthy mind
1	he had sat at all seven tables in the dining hall , spending approximately a year at each
1	the consul paged back and forth in the notebook
1	it was closed off at the far end by the portal , the summerhouse with its rococo façade
1	they , the schweigestills , she said , did not regularly let rooms out as a business , but only occasionally took in renters and boarders , on a case by case basis so to speak ; the gentlemen could have concluded that right off from what she had told them that day , and whether he , the caller , represented such an instance , such a case , she would have to leave him to be the judge of that
1	it was at that same period , immediately after his mother ’ s demise , that sixteen-year-old leo made the acquaintance of father unterpertinger
1	it was all in italian , but he understood more or less what they sang—not every word , but enough here and there , given his knowledge of the plot and his sympathy for its situations , a personal empathy that had increased each time he played the four or five records , until it now became a genuine infatuation
1	madame de tolna was a rich widow , whose husband , a dissipated nobleman-he had , however , not succumbed to his vices but had died in a horseracing accident-had left her childless and the owner of a palace in pest and a huge estate several hours south of the capital , near szekesfehervar , between the danube and lake balaton , as well as a castlelike villa overlooking that same lake
1	is it morbid contrition to ask oneself the
1	i still had , it seemed to me , one more painful message to deliver
1	they had no choice—ha !
1	it came as a great inspiration
1	the title , apocalipsis cum figuris , pays homage to diirer and is surely intended to emphasize the visual objectivization-including the graphically realized minutia and the density of a space filled with fantastically precise detail-shared by both works
1	and you … you won ’ t mock me if i tell you that …
1	they wanted their hands on these gentlemen ’ s throats , that was all
1	nepomuk 's bed was surrounded by several people , with whom i shook hands , all the while directing my eyes toward the dying child
1	and he laid a hand on the young girl ’ s head , the way everyone liked to do
1	this was a recently acquired habit of moving the eyes rapidly back and forth ( more or less equally to either side ) , to roll his eyes , as people say , at certain moments , when pondering something , for instance-which one could imagine might well alarm many people
1	and , raising her shoulders and directing her gaze heavenward , she added , grünlich !
1	and i am proud , you know , that you ’ ve taken me into your confidence first
1	he alternated between running one long finger inside his collar and letting both hands glide through his golden muttonchops
1	the role of the confidant is always simultaneously flattering and painful , since one plays it really only under the precondition that one is of no consequence oneself
1	there is no doubt she recalled her transient visitor from a year before
1	next to a metal-roofed arcade , open to the south and filled with lounge chairs , stood a flagpole , painted reddish brown and displaying a banner that fluttered full now and then—a fantasy flag , green and white , with a snake-entwined caduceus , the symbol of healing , at its center
1	ticipation in kridwiss 's gatherings and the taxing ideas to which i deliberately exposed myself there , would not of themselves have caused my weight loss , not fourteen pounds , not half that many
1	and yet he had undergone great changes since his mother ’ s arrival
1	and if the day should arrive when dye no longer sufficed , she would wear a wig of the same color as the hair of her youth
1	and what were they talking about ?
1	it ’ s always that way , really
1	and what else but music , i thought , was by its very nature called to be the guide that leads us out of the sphere of absurd artificiality into open air , into the world of nature and humanity ?
1	i went on , alone and misunderstood and with everyone calling me arrogant , but i said to myself , for better or for worse , till death do you part
1	fare thee well and much obliged !
1	they had barely grasped the fact that the age of localized war was past and that any campaign into which we saw ourselves forced had to end in a global conflagration
1	god knows , once he started running things , i simply threw up my hands
1	christian , however , had decided he needed a full vacation and complained of a vague pain in his left leg , which dr grabow had no idea how to treat , giving christian cause to describe his symptoms in that much greater detail
1	i ’ ve been mulling over the same thing in one form or another for the last few days
1	he did not choose words full of pathos , although it seemed to him at that moment as if an icy hand had gripped his heart , making it twitch and then hammer rapidly against his ribs , just as it had the day rhadamanthus first discovered the moist spot on his lung
1	vague , exaggerated rumors began to circulate about this unprofitable liquidation , and they were fed by reports that gerda buddenbrook was thinking of selling her grand home
1	and if you want to study them , you first learn classical languages as the basis , do you not ?
1	on the other hand , it is clear what got consul hagenström thinking about buying it
1	do you know that you are visibly growing in stature right before my eyes ?
1	i ’ ve noticed , of course , that you people up here never wear one
1	you did not ask me to wait , i waited quite on my own
1	he was permitted to woo her , gaze upon her , covet her-covet to make a christian wife of her , as we theologians say with justifiable pride at having smuggled the devil out of this union of the flesh by making a sacrament of it , the sacrament of christian marriage
1	it was obvious what had happened
1	will he wake up now ?
1	there was thaw in the air
1	i felt much the same way about adrian 's signature ; indeed , my questions , cares , fears went well beyond it and , in the silence of my heart , were directed at the very legitimacy of his activity , at his temporal claim to the sphere in which he had immersed himself and whose re-creation he pursued with most highly developed , the uttermost , means
1	it is being done at present with the greatest brazenness , and that is the chief cause of my living in seclusion
1	and there ’ s a son , too , who was one or two years ahead of me in school and is at university , i think
1	you can fetch it from there to go out and practice , and away you ’ ll glide
1	he had two sons , peter and james—the one in the navy and seldom at home , the other an employee in the family wine business and the designated heir of the firm
1	mud-dy and stud-dy , all of which the little lad accompanied with explanatory gestures unlike any i have ever seen a child make-a vaguely expressive use of arms and playful hands , which although utterly charming often tended to make his meaning seem obscure and emgmauc
1	he was annoyed with himself for being in such bad shape , and with the leery self-consciousness of youth he detected traces of an indulgent smirk in the assistant director ’ s reassuring smile
1	i still had a whole stack of latin tests to correct for monday
1	the death of her second child was neither the last nor the hardest blow that she would have to bear
1	if he thought the main point was that we heard it-why , then , we shared this opinion completely
1	but i have endured it all—the trouble with grünlich and with permaneder and with weinschenk—and i never lost heart , tom
1	prosecutor paravant went so far as to don a black swallowtail coat with a dotted vest , and the ladies ’ attire had a diaphanous and festive look
1	needless to say , in dealing in these pages with those two youthful years i spent in halle with my friend-their course interrupted by vacations in kaisersaschern and on his father 's farm-i can only offer the same sort of foreshortened image in which his school days were reflected
1	a german writer could not very well call himself 'germany , one christens a battleship with that at best
1	it even sticks its tactile apparatus out beyond itself—as hair , body hair , which is nothing but keratinized skin that can sense something approaching before the skin itself is touched
1	by itself , music is dangerous
1	he married into our family , he ’ s one of us now , after all
1	the cousins learned about it from alfreda schildknecht , or sister berta as she was known , who tended poor fritz rotbein and stopped them in the corridor to inform them of the discreet event
1	the tone of his cry seemed to say , well , who could object to that !
1	as far as the actual work goes , i ’ m not sure how much progress you ’ ve made in your knowledge of commercial matters
1	he advised me to contain my excitement
1	the good man would not hear of migraine , since the often extreme headache was not confined to one side , as is the case with migraine , but was felt as a gnawing torment in and above both the eyes-and in any case was regarded by the physician as only a secondary symptom
1	faces numbed with cold , heads bare , but feet in rubber galoshes , they moved along the sidewalk , its deep layer of snow strewn with ashes and crunching underfoot , or plowed through looser mounds of snow in the road—settembrini in his winter coat , its beaver collar and lapels worn so smooth and hard that it had a rather mangy look , though he wore it elegantly all the same ; naphta in a black , ankle-length coat that buttoned to the neck , fully lined with fur , but not so that anyone could see it
1	but this year the massive accumulation from so many snowfalls had seriously limited everyone ’ s movement in the open—except for skiers , of course
1	and it really is out of the question
1	i ’ ll ask some other time , when the opportunity presents itself ; there ’ s no hurry , it really is none of my business , i ’ m merely curious
1	marriage , but also because she maintains an equivocal loyalty to her missing brother
1	i was sitting there reading a book , a travel book about south america
1	he was seen in town once before he left : a foppishly dressed young fellow with an unwholesome look about him
1	and so today it is now my turn
1	he had set up a kind of heinrich heine museum at home , a collection of papers and memorabilia , all of it related in some way to that brash and frail poet
1	he had never vacationed in the south , taken so much as a sip of it , knew only his own rough , pallid sea and clung to it with clumsy , childish emotion , but he had never reached the mediterranean—naples , sicily , greece
1	and then you must take my place
1	i n its conservative form , holding tight to revelation and traditional exegesis , it has attempted to save whatever elements of biblical religion could be saved ; and on the other , liberal , side , theology has accepted the historical-critical methods of profane historical science and
1	the risks grow less and less—and so do the profits
1	you never expected , i hope , that i would bring home some young thing from the möllendorpf-langhals-kistenmaker-hagenström circle
1	as a six- or eight-year-old he did not call me serenus , or simply seren , just as i called him adri
1	they had to practice the sacred craft ; the fundamentals of harmony and the strict style , for years before he allowed them to sing a song , and his musical pedagogy had not the least connection with little sweethearts
1	he was not feeling well
1	for all the while i had warmed to my topic , she had been looking across more at him than at me , exactly as if she were listening to him and not to me-though , to be sure , his expression constantly mocked my excitement with an enigmatic smile that was certainly a long way from confirming me as his representative
1	he lay on his back in the deep silence of the slightly oppressive sultry night air , and stared up at the ceiling
1	the most important matters still lie ahead of us , my good wenzel
1	thomas asked in annoyance
1	it ’ s simply too absurd , too unthinkable , too— she could say no more and held both hands to her temples
1	let me tell you
1	simply that the hour-glass has been turned , that the sand has begun to run-about that would i come to an understanding with you , dear boy
1	space , like time , gives birth to forgetfulness , but does so by removing an individual from all relationships and placing him in a free and pristine state—indeed , in but a moment it can turn a pedant and philistine into something like a vagabond
1	in the meantime we have experienced the destruction of our venerable cities from the air-an act that would scream to the heavens were not we who suffer it ourselves laden with guilt
1	she found it as she was preparing for bed , read it , and marched with a firm stride downstairs to madame buddenbrook ’ s bedroom on the mezzanine , where , without the least embarrassment , she read the cleric ’ s epistle in a loud voice
1	certainly , hans castorp said , i ’ m certain i shall
1	two medallions were pinned at either side of the décolletage of her ball gown ; she had arms like sticks and a voice whose unique toneless quality sadly revealed the reason why she resided up here
1	mynheer peeperkorn could be seen moving about—one could not avoid seeing him , for that majestic head towered above its surroundings , overwhelming everything with royal vigor and import
1	at the time , kretzschmar was working on his own piece for the stage , the marble statue , and he also gave particella scores of one scene or another to his apprentice to orchestrate and then showed him how he himself had done it , or was intending to do it-resulting in numerous debates , during which , it goes without saying , the master 's considerably greater experience usually held the field , though on at least one occasion the novice 's intuition triumphed
1	when james möllendorpf ’ s death was discussed at the buddenbrook family dinner on thursday , frau permaneder first expressed her regrets several times , but then she began to let the tip of her tongue play along her upper lip and cast her brother a sly look—which caused the ladies buddenbrook to exchange indescribably knowing glances , and then , simultaneously , as if on command , they closed their eyes and mouths firmly for one long second
1	he performed these little services when he would drop by on his way to the dining hall or after a walk , telling joachim to go on ahead , that he was just going to check quickly on the case in room ; and each time he felt his whole being expand with a joy rooted in a sense of helpfulness and quiet importance , but intermingled with a certain jaunty delight in the spotless christian impression his good deeds made—an impression so devout , caring , and praiseworthy , in fact , that no serious objections whatever could be raised against it , either from a military or a humanistic-pedagogic standpoint
1	i ’ ll take it with me to amsterdam
1	then frau schwarzkopf bustled about and made coffee , and they had an evening snack on the porch just as in the old days—except that they were all a good ten years older now and that morten was not there , nor little meta , who had married the chief magistrate of the town of haffkrug ; except that the pilot , rather deaf and very white-haired now , had retired ; except that the hair in his wife ’ s hairnet was all gray , too ; except that madame grünlich was no longer a silly goose , but had learned something about life—which did not prevent her from helping herself to the honeycomb and remarking , that ’ s a pure product of nature
1	madame buddenbrook had been informed of this ; and that same evening , she joined herr permaneder , antonie , and thomas in the landscape room for a discussion in which all questions were resolved without difficulty—even those concerning little erika
1	oh , i want to show it all to you
1	but when his patient-who was not at all ill , his general health being in no way affected-returned for his appointment
1	the köppens walked beside consul kröger and his family in the direction of the river , while senator langhals , dr grabow , and jean jacques hoffstede moved off in the opposite direction
1	good god in heaven , do you know how that sounds ?
1	the thunder 's twofold cry of jehovah !
1	what happened is as follows
1	adrian himself would surely never-in , let us say , a symphony-have announced such a theme so prematurely , would at most have let it insinuate itself from afar in some subtly concealed and almost impalpable fashion
1	my cousin , whom i came here to visit , was a military man , an honest and good fellow , but that did not help him—he died here , leaving me behind , and here i am still
1	nothing , of course , ever became paralyzed
1	do you know the artist ’ s name ?
1	he had many obligations and urgent flirtations in the ballroom , but it would not have seemed very nice to him to completely neglect the ladies from ramberg strasse , with whom his relationship was more of the fraternal sort
1	but it ’ s not an intermittent fever
1	i still envy rudiger for having been the first to read this story to our
1	it had an especially well cured wrapper and was named oath of rütli ; somewhat stubbier than maria , mouse gray in color with a bluish band , it was very tractable and mild by nature ; it had a snow-white durable ash that still showed the veins of the wrapper
1	you ’ re the mayor ’ s right hand—my god , can ’ t the senate just pardon him on the spot ?
1	her chief and most constant annoyance , however , was the religiosity that pervaded her parents ’ spacious house—because with each added year and each new ailment the consul ’ s pious leanings grew increasingly more fervent , and his wife , too , was developing a taste for such things as she grew older
1	to his greater glory , he beshits his way into art
1	they said , the senator replied , patting her hand until the coughing fit was over , they said that our dear mother would be back on her feet again in a few days
1	you ’ re fond of your cousin , aren ’ t you , hans castorp ?
1	both here and on the way back downstairs , they began to talk about arrangements for the guest 's comfort and daily regimen , continuing and then settling the matter below in the abbot 's study , that patriarchal room so rich in character , of which adrian had long since taken emotional possession : a large jug of hot water in the morning , strong coffee
1	and at every step of the way along this hall connecting the two sets of stairs , there was a chance that one particular door might open at any moment—and so it did , on repeated occasions , slamming shut behind frau chauchat , who would emerge soundlessly and glide soundlessly toward the stairs
1	but the local custom of discretion had meant that he learned of karen ’ s demise too late and that she had already been placed in a permanent horizontal position , in the garden of the cupid whose snowy cap was cocked to one side
1	her flushed , downy spinster ’ s cheeks suggested a temperature above normal , and her titillating remarks stirred hans castorp ’ s blood
1	why , you might discover a jellyfish in it any second
1	the woman in the paper tricorn looked him up and down—and her smile betrayed neither pity nor concern for his ravaged condition
1	this is rosenheim from utrecht , he said , pointing to the test tube with his cigar
1	old-fashioned , ornate round-hand , a monkish hand one might say
1	i have spoken of adrian 's inner cosmopolitanism before
1	some people are rich , yes , he answered now , and some are not
1	play no infirmities with me , please !
1	slowly , with lowered head , he strode across the polished floor of the spacious room and sat down on one of the dark-red sofas by the window at the far end
1	in his deteriorated mental state , he rented a room , a chamber , little more than a hole on some disreputable street—on kleine gröpel grube , on engelswisch or an der mauer—and then slunk into his hideaway to eat his pastries
1	the work of the religious orders was not an end in itself , that is , a narcotic
1	that ’ s if your wife is agreed
1	we all have good reason to court herr permaneder a bit
1	no , when it came to the ultimate and highest questions , there was no help from outside—no mediation , no absolution , no soothing consolation
1	he commanded with a severity attributable to his own nervous tension
1	not in any way
1	and then we ’ ll have—six glasses of milk and one mug of beer , if i ’ m not mistaken , herr permaneder ?
1	according to dr langhals , who had completely taken over dr grabow ’ s practice and was now the buddenbrooks ’ family physician , there was a definite reason for hanno ’ s unsatisfactory health and pallor : the boy ’ s body unfortunately did not produce a sufficient quantity of red corpuscles , so essential for good health
1	but the sweet , exalted splendor of what he had heard lifted him up and away from all that
1	that is terribly relevant—pardon me , sir—i mean , you are so colossally right about that , because we are not dealing with two totally different viewpoints and relationships , but , more precisely , with the same one in both instances , with mere variations on a theme
1	i am , moreover , in possession of papers , of priceless manuscripts , which the deceased bequeathed to me , and 'to no one else , in a will written during a period of health or , if i may not put it that way , during a period of comparative and legal sanity , papers i shall use to document my presentation-indeed , i plan to select certain of them for
1	bonsoir , la lune ! '
1	but when he repeated and harmonized it high in the treble , in tone colors like frosted silver , its essence was revealed to be a simple resolution , a yearning , painful descent from one key to another—a short-winded , paltry invention , which gained its strange , mysterious , momentous quality from the pretentious , resolute solemnity of its definition and presentation
1	her brother the consul picked her up at the train station—she had come by way of büchen—and the moment they drove into town through the holsten gate he could not resist complimenting her by saying that she was still the fairest in the family , except for klothilde
1	and while herr settembrini hid his face in both hands—revealing very shabby leather gloves—naphta asked in a chill , statesmanlike voice how else intractable criminals should be handled if not with stocks and cudgels , which were very stylish furnishings for a prison in any case
1	still standing , dr mantelsack now crossed his ankles and paged through his notebook
1	might make him more suitable , make his task that much easier for him ?
1	he would not have let any of you talk him out of it
1	inez basically despised the lust for beauty felt by this city that reveled in the senses and to which her mother 's curiosity about greater freedom in matters of morality had transplanted her ; but for the sake of her bourgeois station she took part in the festivities of a society that was one grand art association-and that proved dangerous to the very peace she sought
1	and so began tony buddenbrook ’ s third marriage—and that was indeed the appropriate term for it
1	oh , what all haven ’ t i seen in these last few days
1	his playing was clean and cultivated-the tone was not large , but fell sweetly on the ear , and the technique more than a little brilliant
1	i hope that you clearly understand the matter now , dear bethsy ?
1	you women don ’ t usually moralize like that for no good reason
1	if they understood him correctly , the consumption of tobacco was , in his opinion , one of those over-refined pleasures , the cultivation of which meant robbing the simpler gifts of life of their majesty—gifts and claims to which our emotional vigor scarcely did justice as it was
1	when you lifted the gracefully beveled lid , a well-secured brass rod raised automatically to hold it in place at a protective angle , and inside you saw , set slightly lower , the turntable with its green cloth cover and nickel rim , plus the nickel spindle that fitted into the hole of the ebonite disks
1	herr modersohn turned ash-gray and dragged his professorial chair down from the platform , all the while dusting it with his handkerchief
1	but it is constantly being split up
1	the brokers sat down with the wholesalers
1	i am speaking of the second half of the eighteenth century , which settembrini would not hesitate to describe to you as a period of decline in his guild
1	eduard kistenmaker , who received the least number of votes , has been dropped from the next ballot
1	and your evaluation all depends on which side you view them from
1	when he came home on vacations—very neat , very well dressed , sporting a little reddish-blond moustache in the middle of his sleepy , young , patrician face , looking for all the world like a young man on his way to a respectable place in life—the people who concerned themselves with the affairs of the community , who kept themselves well informed about various families and the staffing of municipal offices ( and that means most people in a self-governing city-state ) , his fellow citizens , then , looked him over and asked themselves what public role young castorp might one day grow into
1	the insights he had gained over time into their lives and doings , their customs and opinions , were not very conducive to such good intentions
1	and what atmosphere is that ?
1	yes , just look at the world ’ s colorful variety
1	yes , good lord , christian !
1	future , lads will swear by your name , who thanks to your madness will no longer need to be mad
1	from behind some shrubs came the muted , heavy rhythms of a dirge
1	seen from this angle , he suggested , it was a stroke of fortune , a happy turn of fate , that he had chanced to come up here and had occasion to be examined ; because otherwise he would probably have remained unaware of his condition much longer and perhaps have learned of it in a much more distressing fashion
1	was hans castorp still one of life ’ s problem children in herr settembrini ’ s eyes ?
1	director stoientin , however , had used the goethe quote much more in the spirit of schiller , for whom everything was a matter of freedom , and who therefore made a moral distinction between talent and personal merit , sharply separating merit and good fortune , which goethe saw as inextricably interwoven
1	this becomes even clearer and is still more forcefully elaborated in the scene with the good old physician
1	what are you crying about ?
1	his teeth were not very good , were small and yellowish
1	she might have left the berghof , he thought—that is , if he gave any thought at all to her disappearance
1	we dare not , we can not , do the same
1	the undersigned makes bold , dearest demoiselle , deferentially to send you this little ring , enclosed as a pledge of his undying tenderness
1	for the sake of inner continuity , he said to himself , it would be better to bring a remnant of the project belonging to the old conditions along into the new and to cast his inner eye on some new project only when the new externals had become routine
1	don ’ t hold it against me , clavdia
1	the car was full , two gentlemen were even hanging on to straps and standing in the aisle by the rear door
1	the low level of musical interest that herr pfühl knew existed below him in the nave , among the families of senators , consuls , and other solid citizens , was a source of constant sorrow , and that was the real reason he liked to have his young pupil beside him—at least he could call his attention to the extraordinary difficulty of the piece he had just played
1	he ’ s been thinking about it all day and all night
1	then he said in an oddly faltering , equivocal voice , no , i did not know about that
1	and what should one say to such an attack on human reason ?
1	this past spring the league was called together in solemn convention in barcelona
1	you ’ ve kept the coffee warm for me , frau schwarzkopf
1	let ’ s hope your last week will be better
1	good god , rudolf , if only you would not put on that beaming face of the rescuer the moment you arrive !
1	but one thing more , my dear senator—we shan ’ t let certain symptoms unnerve us , shall we ?
1	his purposes , then , were purely emotional—or so said slanderous tongues , of which there is never a lack
1	above all the league endeavors to supply materials to progressive political parties everywhere
1	every word you ’ ve said is childish
1	he suddenly cried , throwing his hands behind his head and then shoving them forward , as if to ward off the whole world
1	with the death of johann buddenbrook , normal social life had also died on meng strasse , and apart from the visit of an occasional clergyman elisabeth entertained no guests other than the members of her family , who gathered on thursday evenings
1	it would be the same as if someone took the harebrained notion of holding a single note or chord for hours on end—and called it music
1	and why shouldn ’ t they , really ?
1	but in any case , it was high time , and then some , for him to come up here
1	he charmed and captivated them with stories that flowed in an effortless stream , spoken in a slightly plaintive , languid voice and delivered in the harmlessly risqué fashion of an english comedian
1	such a reading , played by the orchestre de ia suisse romande , was being held in geneva more or less concurrently with the concert in basel , and wendell kretzschmar had used his connections and succeeded in having adrian 's phosphorescence of the sea ( a work , by way of exception , of a young german ) included in the program
1	now there ’ s a real question for you !
1	which was why the model crematorium and its hall of urns , the hall of death as such , had been planned with an adjoining hall of life , where architecture , painting , sculpture , music , and poetry would be united , so that the mind of the survivor might be directed away from the experience of death , from dull mourning and idle laments , toward the good things of life
1	it is only a step from such a question , as well as from the locutions of wise solomon , to maimonides , the ostensibly greatest rabbi of the middle ages , but in truth an assimilator of aristotle , who manages to
1	did settembrini know what was going on with him ?
1	but firstly and lastly , and this justification has always carried the greatest validity , if not before man , then before god : i loved him-with terror and tenderness , with indulgence and doting admiration , seldom asking whether he in any way returned my feelings
1	she had loosened her hands from the back of her neck , and her arms—she spread them wide now , revealing the inner surface , especially the tender skin at the elbow with its blood vessels , two large bluish branching veins—her arms were of inexpressible sweetness
1	but they simply melt together for euphoria
1	we spoke about the neutrality and intellectual hesitancy of youth , of its freedom to choose , its tendency to experiment with all sorts of standpoints , and of how one need not regard such experiments as final , life-determining options
1	dusk glowed in the sky beyond the river—delicate , pure , pale , like something painted on fine china
1	i can admit to you now that i haven ’ t liked your looks from the start , not since the first time i had the undeserved honor of making your acquaintance—and was pretty sure of my guess that you were secretly one of the locals , and would finally come to appreciate the fact yourself , as has many a man before you , who came up here just for the fun of it , looked around with his nose in the air , and one fine day discovered he would do well—indeed , mark my words , would do more than well—to remain on here , for reasons having nothing to do with the seductions of mere curiosity , for a rather more extended stay
1	here once again there were scattered snorts of laughter , but there were also several people who clicked their tongues , and shook their heads , too , as if at some tactless indiscretion , and some eyes took on a darkly probing look
1	but why from a deep cellar ’ ?
1	hanno buddenbrook was almost the only student whom herr modersohn knew by name , and he used that knowledge against him—constantly calling him to order , assigning him extra homework as punishment , and tyrannizing him in general
1	his fur coat was splattered with muck and slush
1	yes , it ’ s in the rules
1	but he felt very dizzy from lying there so long , and the unrefreshing semisleep had left his face badly flushed again , although his body felt chilled all over—perhaps he had not been covered warmly enough
1	now , start again , please—the shepherd ’ s sunday song
1	but i can not join you in your radicalism-which as the license of students , by the way , wo not last long-in your kierkegaardian separation of church and christianity
1	it ’ s fat , the director said with finality as he closed a cupboard from which he had extracted the utensils for brewing coffee : a cylindrical turkish mill , a long-handled pot , a divided bowl for sugar and ground coffee—all of brass
1	he did not belong to the circle of rich merchants , did not dine at their tables or visit back and forth with them
1	herr settembrini was a humanitarian , and yet at the same time and bound up with it , he was , as he half admitted , a man of war
1	tossing his head back and forth on his pillow , he went on now in a soft , plaintive voice :
1	so how did you like him ?
1	the season was definitely over
1	hans castorp felt only disdain for the lad ’ s allowing himself to be repulsed , and he let his disdain be known with a shrug
1	i shall not ask , but shall calculate the possibilities , give frank consideration to them all , even the most extraordinary
1	it often happens with pneumonia
1	so distorted that they could inspire fear , his eyes listening and filled with mad abstraction , he had stared at them , looking as if he had just come from a life-and-death struggle with all the hostile spirits of counterpoint
1	you must be suffering a great deal
1	but with a kind of alarm at himself he saw that if he were to make this discipline his
1	no one can say that he broke his promise
1	and , as always when they were in travemünde , consul buddenbrook joined tony for a visit with the old schwarzkopfs on front row
1	on the fourth day he succeeded
1	of his faustthere remains , however , the human , the instinctive desire , if not for assistance , then at least for the company of one 's fellow human beings , the plea : forsake me not !
1	the fish course was passed , and as pastor wunderlich carefully served himself he said , a happy present is not something we can always take for granted
1	and although tony had told him the story of her marriage in some detail when she was visiting the niederpaurs in munich , he queried her once again about the whole affair , squinting in anxious sympathy and inquiring in particular about the specifics of the bankruptcy
1	don ’ t you see , ida ?
1	it had , in fact , as one could clearly see , impressed and occupied his young receptive mind more than anything else he heard
1	during each hour of his segmented day , he had thought of her mouth , her cheekbones , her eyes—whose color , shape , and placement cut deep into his soul—of her limp back , the way she carried her head , the neck bones above the collar line of her blouse , her arms a radiant illusion under flimsiest gossamer
1	and what else was there , or better , what wasn ’ t there ?
1	whom should i have asked ?
1	you shall tweak the nose of your prince of shades up there
1	as might have been expected , frau permaneder also had her objections to the sale of the house her brother had built
1	one must be fair
1	herr brecht quivered with the exertion , and thomas buddenbrook could feel the tremor pass through his whole body ; he was pulled up out of his chair a little and heard a soft squeak coming from somewhere deep in the dentist ’ s throat
1	but hugo was and remained a missing person
1	this soft , ghostly pantomime was extremely entertaining
1	i must return to camp , to quarters , for roll call , he cries in despair at an ingenuousness that only doubles the burden his heart already feels
1	settembrini looked at him wide-eyed
1	but it had to be warm , warm in his study , otherwise he would shiver and could weep tears of rage if anyone allowed him to freeze
1	granted , he could not help hanno with his lessons—given his untamed , free-ranging spirit , he felt the same loathing for multiplication tables as dreamy , distracted young buddenbrook did
1	but hans castorp replied that he wanted to own them himself—it was different reading a book that you owned
1	and bach himself , good lord , they accused him of being dissonant and muddy
1	he had been flabbergasted to hear that there really and truly was such a thing ; and he had diligently sounded the terrorist out on the beginnings and character of this curious institution , which in a few years would celebrate its two-hundredth anniversary
1	he limited himself to objecting to herr settembrini ’ s critique of hermine kleefeld , which seemed unjust to him—or which , for other reasons , he wanted to see as unjust
1	and here i feel constrained to mention the following : the framework of landscape and house where adrian later established his life as a mature man-that is , when he settled for good with the schweigestills in pfeiffering near waldshut in upper bavaria-very strangely resembled , even replicated , the framework of his childhood ; or put another way , the setting of his later years curiously imitated that of his youth
1	a few times hans castorp saw him climbing the stairs or standing in the corridor talking with krokowski , the head nurse , or another patient ; he would watch and wait to buttonhole him
1	hans castorp ’ s face showed his indifference as he reviewed them in his mind
1	my duties required that i return to kaisersaschern that same evening
1	for such a friend is now
1	old siegismund gosch the broker was sitting out on the glass veranda , drinking his rum grog
1	and pulling himself up straight and regaining his serene dignity , he spoke about modern , progressive forms of humanitarian nursing , the slow , steady victory over epidemic disease , and went on to contrast such horrors with the achievements of medical science , hygiene , and social reforms
1	a jurisprudence that wished to base itself in popular sentiment and not isolate itself from
1	adventures in the flesh and spirit , which enhanced and heightened your ordinariness , allowed you to survive in the spirit what you probably will not survive in the flesh
1	yes , yes , gentlemen , the damn libido , he said
1	can one use what tradition offers , can one sanctify old artifices with more genius ?
1	he would spot him standing among the other guests in the game room of an evening , gazing gloomily and forlornly at the charming , though flawed woman who was sitting on the sofa in the small salon and chatting with frizzy-haired tamara ( that was the droll-looking girl ’ s name ) , dr blumenkohl , the man with the concave chest , and the hunch-shouldered youths from her table
1	she had been giving serious attention to what her brother was saying
1	and he looked down at the inert figure that lay stretched out before him , so stern and solemn among all that white satin
1	small and near , or large and distant ?
1	it was yellow , ragged , deeply furrowed
1	yet , duty calls now
1	the restaurant was well lit , elegant , and comfortable
1	it entered soundlessly through the window , bounced soundlessly against the heavy padding of furs on lebrecht kröger ’ s chest , rolled just as soundlessly to the soft blanket on his knees , and finally came to rest on the floor
1	they are pains that one gladly and proudly takes in the bargain with pleasures so enormous , pains such as one knows from a fairy tale , pains like slashing knives , like those the little mermaid felt in the beautiful human legs she had acquired for a tail
1	i exchanged greetings with dr kranich , who was sitting on schwerdtfeger 's side , but much farther back by the rear door
1	the pregnancy of i appeared to increase her vitality rather than to impair it
1	do you find it entertaining ?
1	why did i feel persuaded to reproduce them at such length ?
1	no , echo , not especially cross
1	and he who will have the devil can not be frustrated , nor can he defend gainst him , and it was but a little step from the divine faculty over to leipzig and to music , such that i did devote myself solely and entirely to figuris , characteribus , formis coniurationum , and whatsoever other names such evocation and magic be named
1	well , there ’ s a certain difference all the same
1	it is a fact , taught me by the probing observation of
1	but there are plenty of others , the place is full of them , what with new arrivals every day
1	the gaze he directed to me as i approached had something vehement and distraught about it and then , to my sorrow , quickly veiled itself in gloomy animosity
1	which means that they make an incision here , somewhere along the side here—i don ’ t know precisely where they cut , but behrens has it down perfectly
1	there is no one else , far and wide
1	you have not the least understanding , you city folk , and there 's need of understanding here
1	to be sure , she recovered only slowly from the delivery , and those troublesome fevers that had led to a stay in the sanatorium ten years previous flared up again
1	and little antonie , a petite eight-year-old in a dress of softly shimmering silk , was thinking hard , her pretty blond head turned slightly toward her grandfather , but her gray-blue eyes directed into the room without seeing anything
1	and then the uncanny sixteen lines of poison tree , in which the poet waters his wrath with tears , suns it with smiles and deceitful wiles , until its tree bears a bright apple that poisons the friend who steals it-and whom the hater is glad to see lying dead beneath the tree the next morning
1	on her own , nature produces such a plethora of things that have a puzzling way of spilling
1	there were other young foreigners—portuguese south americans , who looked more jewish than he , and so the very term lost meaning
1	the only ornamentation was an embossed wreath of roses and serrated leaves around its rim
1	this , however , would have contradicted his nature as creator , and therefore he had created the world as it is , that is , interlarded with evil-that is , it had to be yielded up in part to demonic influences
1	what he could at best have without us in time 's old classic courses , only we can offer now-a-days
1	the eyes lay deep in their sockets , the brows had grown bushier , and from under them the specter directed
1	the merchant ’ s insignificant presence greatly reduced the worries he had about the possible appearance of natives of hamburg
1	that presence could not deny the inevitability of growth , but it found refuge in a conceptual sphere that is mythic and timeless , where all things are simultaneous and abide in parallel , where the male figure of the man is no contradiction to the babe in its mother 's arms-which he likewise is , always is , forever raising his little hand in the sign of the cross to adoring saints
1	you take off your hat and tiptoe past his presence , rocking your way forward
1	what frau stöhr in her ignorance did to the phrase dulci jubilo was quite extraordinary ; she pronounced the first word as dolce , borrowing it from the italian musical vocabulary of her spouse , but the second was more reminiscent of yippee-ay-oh or god only knew what—and at the sound of her latin , the two cousins simultaneously made a grab for the straws in their glasses
1	it ’ s hailing , someone said in a loud , clear voice
1	real time knows no turning points , there are no thunderstorms or trumpet fanfares at the start of a new month or year , and even when a new century commences only we human beings fire cannon and ring bells
1	herr modersohn blinked again , looked around , pulled a peevish face , and gazed back at his attendance book , running his little , clumsy hand down to the name he now decided to call
1	silence fell over the room
1	the throbbing infection felt like little red-hot hammers ; tears came to his eyes and his face was flushed with fever
1	in terrified delight , ida replied in polish
1	we noted that in coming to this decision , he had recalled his experience in the x-ray laboratory , and yet that association by no means suffices to describe his state of mind
1	oh , i beg you , my good engineer , do not lay that at my door
1	he knew that he would be let go
1	don ’ t give up , holger , just let it come , you ’ ll do it !
1	and so , just for the fun of it , she had made a little trip to zurich—for no other reason than to amuse herself
1	his tiny hands play with the gold braid on his nurse ’ s bodice , and his head , covered by a pale blue lace-trimmed bonnet , lies turned slightly to one side on the pillow ; his eyes pay no attention to the pastor , but peer instead out into the room full of relatives—blinking , inspecting , almost precocious eyes , with very long lashes and irises whose lustrous , vague golden brown hovers between the pale blue of his father ’ s and the brown of his mother ’ s , depending on the light
1	paris , antwerp , venice , copenhagen
1	but i am very pleased that she holds to the faith of her fathers and detests such unevangelical gimcrackery
1	i remember , however , that deutschlin now led a rather long and not at all uninteresting debate about creativity , a discussion of how it was subject to the limitations of all sorts of preconditions , to culture , tradition , imitation , convention , routine , although , in the end , not without human creativity 's having been regarded as coming from on high-as a distant reflection of the power of divine being , as an echo of the almighty summons into existence-and productive imagination 's having been given theological recognition after all
1	no , no , everything must be clean and out in the open
1	oh , it ’ s a conspiracy between stupidity and wickedness !
1	he now asked them to send the things he needed
1	it is only to his credit that he has not yet written any music , has not yet revealed a productive impulse by naively launching into youthful compositions
1	the former is intellectual monkishness , a iearned refinement that profoundly despises life and nature , which indeed sees barbarism in life and nature , in immediacy , humanity , feeling
1	there was nothing to be seen everywhere , absolutely nothing except a few very small snowflakes descending from the white above to the white below , and the silence all around took its power from what it did not say
1	tion room was decorated with charming chinese works in ink and watercolor ( from the sung dynasty !
1	as you ’ ve surely noticed , i barely speak french
1	opposite the windows , ranks of seats rose to form an amphitheater , at the bottom of which stood a table , covered by a green cloth and furnished with a large bell , documents , and writing utensils for the chairman , recording clerk , and whatever members of the senate delegation might be present
1	she even lost weight—and the glow in her cheeks
1	herr naphta would be pleased to receive the gentlemen , he reported , and asked them to follow ; he opened another door , two or three steps farther on the right , behind which was a heavy portiere that he also lifted aside for the young men to enter
1	edhin krokowski ’ s lectures had taken an unexpected turn after all these little years
1	from time to time he would return to the quartet and its third movement-that alien air , that lunar landscape-and the enormous difficulty of performing it
1	i think i can promise that he will sleep a lot toward the last and dream pleasant dreams , and if at the very end he is unable to sleep , his passing will nevertheless be swift , imperceptible—it won ’ t even matter much to him , you can be sure of that
1	it was not my impression that inez particularly cared about other people 's knowing
1	he fell silent , but as he chewed , he would glance now and then at tony and tom , checking them over
1	i prefer not to speak of a lack of naivete on his part , for ultimately naivete is the basis of being itself , of all being , of even the most self-aware and complicated
1	humanist—certainly i am that
1	she had turned to address joachim , despite the magazine he was holding up in front of his face—because he was a long-term resident , of course , and so she had known him longer , at least by sight
1	by now he was availing himself of every possible means of protection against the cold , the whole paraphernalia
1	the crowd , however , was not much larger than the group assembled in the hall and consisted of young workers from the docks and warehouses , porters , schoolchildren , a few sailors from merchant ships—men and boys who lived in the alleys , lanes , mews , and courts of the less prosperous parts of town
1	adieu , my agent for champagne and cognac , she said
1	the idea of death doesn ’ t frighten me
1	anton , lina , trina , and sophie said their goodbyes to madam grünlich
1	my first didn ’ t turn out all that well
1	what he had learned was that x noppe & co was a smallish but quite solid firm , which , in conjunction with the joint-stock brewery headed by herr niederpaur , turned a tidy profit , and that herr permaneder ’ s share , together with tony ’ s seventeen thousand thalers courant , would be sufficient for them to live a respectable life together , although it would be without luxury
1	we walk and walk—how long has it been now ?
1	those were the schneidewein progeny who had come into the world by then : rosa , ezechiel , and raimund
1	several guests were already seated in the room , tattered illustrated magazines spread over their knees
1	he even briefly considered whether he ought not to buy a sleeping bag , but backed off from that—indeed felt somewhat frightened by the idea
1	for included in his lessons was knowledge of the size of the register of each instrument in the orchestra ( information the foster-child of an instrument dealer scarcely needed , by the way ) ; and kretzschmar had begun giving him assignments to orchestrate short pieces from the classical period or a movement from a piano piece by schubert or beethoven and also to provide instrumentation for the piano accompaniment to songs-exercises whose weaknesses and errors he would then point out to adrian and correct
1	when , more out of love of truth than of self , one sets right the rudest misconceivings about oneself , one is a vapourer
1	tell us now , this very afternoon , director behrens
1	i ’ m talking nonsense , i know , but i would rather babble away and at least partially express something difficult than reproduce impeccable clichés
1	renowned scholars and experts from all over europe—medical doctors , economists , psychologists—will participate in drafting this encyclopedia , and the general editorial offices in lugano will act as the reservoir into which all articles will flow
1	if the director , who was nearing forty and whose hair was already flecked with gray , wished to establish a family , something quite appropriate to his position and means , the connection with erika grünlich would provide him an opening into one of the first families in town , securing him in his job and advancing his career
1	and then his uncle said , pardon me !
1	at one time , when the competition in that trade was still relatively small ( though in the meantime it has grown considerably ) , i also occupied myself with the same idea and , as time and opportunity permitted , made some experiments in that regard
1	democracy , my dear sir , has more to hope for from the kremlin than from the hofburg , and it is a disgrace that the land of luther and gutenberg—
1	he ate a red one , although it hurt his teeth something awful , and then half of a white , and had to sample at least a little of the brown one , filled with chocolate ice cream
1	but the really beautiful thing is how it proved not to be
1	only where there is no spirit are we respectable
1	the white smock emphasized the director ’ s height ; and if you took into account the arched neck and pictured him instead pulled up to full height , he seemed a man almost larger than life , topped by a small , colorful head with very peculiar features
1	and in certain respects , that is not good
1	she also led her guests upstairs , to the second floor , to show them a couple of the numerous
1	contrary to what you say , your system looks to me as if it 's more apt to resolve human reason into magic
1	it is a long trip , however , from hamburg to those elevations—too long , really , for so short a visit
1	the story came to him on various occasions , in fragments and as connected narratives , and not only did he himself consider it highly remarkable , but he encouraged ferge and wehsal to do so as well , which they did—the former , of course , with a qualifying reminder that all higher things were foreign to him ( for only the experience of pleural shock had ever lifted him above life ’ s most unpretentious levels ) ; the latter , however , with obvious pleasure in the happy course an oppressed man ’ s life had taken , even though—since all good things must come to an end—it was now at a standstill and appeared to be foundering in their common malady
1	the director loved imported cigars and would have most preferred to smoke heavy havanas
1	the hapless woman warned the man who desired her against herself-and that means an act of the soul freely elevating itself above her pitiful physical existence , a humane act of distancing herself from it , an act of compassion , an act , if i may be permitted the word , of love
1	he quoted : awake , psaltery and harp !
1	you will ask your cousin giacomo—herr settembrini had fallen into the habit of calling joachim giacomo—you will ask your cousin giacomo to step out in front of your silence
1	it was quiet , they could even hear naphta ’ s teeth gnashing
1	people had dressed for dinner , the gentlemen in evening clothes , the ladies in jewels , some of them probably sent up from the plains below by loving husbands
1	the holidays proved incapable of disturbing the daily schedule of the residents of the berghof
1	settembrini flung an arm in the air
1	behrens discharged me once in a fit of temper
1	faustus to the companions of his final hour that they should go to bed , sleep in peace , and be not troubled
1	there was the sad documentation of gotthold ’ s letters to his father , and finally , cheerfully capping it all , the latest festive poem by jean jacques hoffstede
1	the total deficit comes to ,
1	he said and , now rescued , took a sip of water and departed
1	moreover , love for such an object is itself equally significant
1	the beam of white light emitted by a few larger ones , in fact , was so intense that it blinded the eyes of their observers
1	a loose-fitting bodice of soft dark silk , with satin lapels and shoulders trimmed in lace , made her breast look enchantingly soft
1	christian is probably not going to amount to much , and i ’ m finished
1	an hour later , however , when he was presumed to be asleep , he escaped from the house without anyone 's noticing , and gereon and a farm hand caught up with him at klammer pool only after he had already removed his outer clothing and stood submerged up to his neck in
1	this is the sign for the other guests to say their goodbyes as well , because gerda buddenbrook needs her rest
1	and she took the thermometer out of his hand , thrusting it at the air several times and driving the mercury down even further , below ninety-five degrees
1	that much is rather clear to me
1	my child , he said , —fine
1	hanno and i can ’ t hold this much longer
1	dressed in a little frock so richly trimmed with satin bows that it obviously reflected frau permaneder ’ s taste , the child was sitting on her nurse ’ s lap , her thumbs tightly clenched in her tiny fists and her slightly bulging eyes fixed straight ahead ; she sucked on her tongue and occasionally let out a squeak , and then the nurse would rock her a bit
1	we can ’ t all be the same
1	the destiny that had brooded over europe for so long was unleashed , and , disguised as a disciplined implementation of all contingency plans and training , it raced through our cities , raging in all the minds and hearts of men as terror , exaltation , and frenzied urgency , as the thrill of fate , the sense of power , the readiness to sacrifice
1	you can ’ t imagine what a funny old man he is !
1	twice during the winter they were invited to the home of a patroness of art and artists , a lady of undetermined origins : madame de coniar , to whom rudiger schildknapp had a letter of introduction from friends in munich
1	before tony buddenbrook left her parents ’ house for good , they had no choice but to gather here , one and all , to extend their sympathetic respects—despite grünlich , despite permaneder , despite hugo weinschenk
1	i heard him speak those words , along with the next two lines , why then do i madly long
1	there was a babel of voices
1	i won ’ t stand for it !
1	oh , of course , he ’ ll buy it , the whole thing , she said—making use of the throaty voice again
1	it divides them up and gives some content to each , so that there ’ s something to them after all—whereas normally the hours and days and weeks hang so awfully heavy on one ’ s hands
1	but that in no way lessened the present , dynamic temptation , which claimed the prerogative of individuality , refusing to be relegated to the familiar and general or to be mirrored in such descriptions , and which declared itself unique and incomparably urgent—without , of course , being able to deny that it was a temptation whispered from one particular corner , the promptings of a creature in spanish black with a snow-white , pleated ruff ; and bound up with the idea and image were all sorts of gloomy , caustically jesuitical , and misanthropic notions , the torture and corporal punishment that were such abominations to herr settembrini , who with his barrel organ and ragione could only appear ridiculous in his opposition to them
1	at the time dr wulicke was called to the position , he had been a professor at a prussian secondary school
1	you enjoy watching a play , too , and you once told me , just between us , that you had your little affairs , and there was a time when you preferred reading novels and poems and such
1	is that too much metaphysics for you ?
1	no , it doesn ’ t matter what kind , la france is fine
1	he pulled up the blind , loosened the white-enameled hook , and opened the casement , watching the fly as it sped off across the gravel paths and rose beds of the garden
1	hans castorp gazed steadily at his profile
1	at the double desk beside the window sat dr krokowski , looking pale against his shiny black smock—elbows propped on the desktop , a pen in one hand , the other buried in his beard
1	one must deal a fatal blow to austria and crush her , first to avenge past wrongs and second to open the way for the rule of justice and happiness on earth
1	you will conduct the phosphorescence , selections from love 's labour 's lost , your symphonie cosmologique
1	but at the same time he was touched , indeed jolted , by a confused feeling born of his own confusion in hearing a sweet young thing , whose hand he was holding , whisper the word yes in his ear
1	at last you cast courtesies aside and turn familiar , as is only proper between people who strike a compact and find agreement for time and eternity
1	the lady as she lives and breathes , hans castorp lied , less out of cunning than out of an awareness that if everything had been as it should be , he ought not to have recognized the lady at all , any more than joachim had recognized her on his own—dear old outfoxed joachim , for whom a light now went on , the real light and not the false one hans castorp had lit for him
1	you are too great for that
1	and as settembrini released the word from his lips , he thrust his small yellow right hand into the air , as if proposing a toast
1	and now there followed a very few softly spoken words that constituted their engagement and gave herr permaneder permission to speak to elisabeth and thomas once they had returned home
1	and turning on his heels , he pulled hans castorp out of the lobby and into the social room nearest the main entrance , which was set up for reading and writing , but was empty at the moment
1	their conversation had proceeded rather slowly , because hans castorp ’ s french was clumsy and he spoke haltingly as he tried to express himself
1	into the depths , herr settembrini ?
1	the people , kai said fiercely
1	the heavy uneasiness of an overfilled stomach blended with the sweet excitement of the evening to create a sense of melancholy bliss
1	the menu was well chosen , ending with cheese pastry and bonbons , and they finished off with coffee and liqueurs
1	what does … what does those add a rare , ornamental touch ’ mean ?
1	but i also would not have it be forgotten that it all began with his hovering about the drop , a word that indeed does not fit badly , since the earth consists primarily of water , of the water of its seas , which did escape the almighty 's hand
1	but since time immemorial , the human striving for feeling has in fact had one means ready at hand , one drug , one intoxicant , that belongs to the classic gifts of life and bears the stamp of the simple and holy , and thus is no vice—one means of stature , if i may put it that way
1	her older sister , madame kethelsen , however , was called nelly
1	because i really believe that he and noppe have done very well for themselves with the niederpaurs ’ brewery
1	you can save me
1	then came a rotunda with a covered gallery where a little band was playing
1	then came the ferry , then israelsdorfer allee , then jerusalem hill , castle yard
1	but in his dark , narrow office there was a large bookcase filled with poetical works in all languages , and it was rumored that for the last twenty years he had been working on a translation of the complete plays of lope de vega
1	the family kept the gruesome details of his death secret as best they could ; but the story spread quickly through town and became the chief topic of conversation on the exchange , at the club , at the harmony , in offices , at town-council meetings , and at parties and balls
1	to which she replied , yes , herr permaneder , i believe you are
1	passing his hand across his brow , his eyes wandering about the room , he said , this is awful
1	under the senator ’ s supervision , the vault had been tidied up a bit and the remains of older buddenbrooks pushed aside
1	what are you trying to say ?
1	at first they convinced themselves that he was crying ; but that was not the case
1	he stopped and looked about him
1	he opened his eyes wide , confused by the depth of his trance
1	gerda asked , and yawned , releasing a dainty , casual sigh , but covering her mouth with her hand mirror
1	it is , in its own way , a marvelous melodic find , a swelling cantilena that numbs the mind as one is carried away on its wide sweeping arc and that has something decidedly showy , boastful about it , but also a melancholy that is not without its charm if the violinist is so inclined
1	was that why he had got himself tangled up in this brazen analysis of vice ?
1	a new connection like that between the baltic and north seas
1	i never loved him
1	he made a long , kind face , shook hands with everyone , regarded the patient , shook his head , and proceeded to do exactly what dr langhals had done
1	twenty-five years ago , we were wise enough to prevent it at the very last moment , but our increasingly tragically heroic state of mind apparently will no longer allow us to forsake a lost cause before the unthinkable becomes reality
1	well , that ’ s fine , ziemssen , he said
1	in tones now swelling , now fading away , he praised the qualities of the dear departed—her elegance and humility , her cheerfulness and piety , her charity and gentleness
1	but apparently , given his adaptations and permutations , he was not as loyal as joachim was to his—although , to be sure , whenever hans castorp , both as a civilian and child of peace , listened to this has-been or would-be jesuit he felt reinforced in his view that each of these two men would take pleasure in the occupation and status of the other , as something closely related to his own
1	the extreme polyphonic harshness of this work ( and not just this work ) has been the cause of much scorn and hatred
1	i would love to have some good person on my side
1	her passionate opposition was crushed beneath his desire for takin ’ things easy , and the upshot of all this was that herr permaneder withdrew the capital he had invested in the hops business and it was now herr noppe ’ s turn to draw a blue line through the & co on his calling card
1	but all i can do is describe my experience and admit the profound awkwardness that this boy 's gently floating existence always caused me
1	oh , certainly not , no children
1	were there but a war without , that something might be afoot
1	prince esterhazy , for example , had been a special friend of this masterly art , but in the m ass in c that beethoven had written for him , the composer had managed no more than unsuccessful stabs at a fugue , which , purely socially , had been a bit of bad manners and , artistically , an unforgivable failing ; and his oratorio , christ on the mount of olives , lacked any sort of fugal passage , although it would have most definitely been in order there
1	for germany , the opposite is true , and you would feel and know it , leverkiihn , if only you were not adrian leverkiihn-that is , too cool to be young and too clever to be religious
1	it can all turn out fine
1	the discussion was interrupted only by our visit to the church and was essentially a dispute between rudi schwerdtfeger and myself about ludwig 's so-called madness , his incompetence to govern , and his being removed from the throne and placed under a guardian-which to rudi 's great astonishment i declared an unjustified and brutal act of philistinism , as well as a political maneuver to secure the succession
1	you can be our referee
1	that is— , he said
1	what did the maid say ?
1	it was arranged for rudiger to graduate from high school and be sent off to university
1	plaster casts of classical statuary were set out on a shelf that went clear around the room , and there was a large cupboard with all sorts of wooden blocks and dollhouse furniture that likewise served as models
1	for some time now , clavdia had been sitting for her portrait , posing for someone right here in the house
1	but when he raised his eyes again , she was no longer there
1	i was outraged by this denial of the humane in favor of an unapproachable , absolute predestination-just as , in general , i acknowledge dante 's poetical greatness , but have always been put off by his penchant for cruelty and scenes of torture-and i recall that i scolded adrian for having decided to compose music for this almost unbearable episode
1	but in what a state ?
1	we were speaking of my mail
1	and now , while the nurse raises the baby ’ s bonnet , the pastor carefully dips his fingers in the silver basin—lined with gold—that has been set in front of him , and he sprinkles two or three drops of water on the sparse hair of this little buddenbrook , while slowly and expressively speaking the baptismal names : justus , johann , kaspar
1	are we doing the same thing here , or were hans castorp and clavdia chauchat doing the same thing with their russian kiss ?
1	she was trembling with excitement and exceptionally silent this evening
1	if he happened to meet any of his older students somewhere on the street at two or three in the morning , he would swell up , manage to blurt out good morning , and let things go at that , for all parties concerned
1	the exchange of greetings consisted of mute bows , so stiff they were practically indiscernible
1	joachim responded with silence from his side of the glass partition
1	hans castorp waved good-bye to the table as it drifted away—farewell !
1	play it for her , it is certain to please her , and the rest will take care of itself
1	settembrini said and raised his eyebrows
1	it was an hour when all the patients mingled , an hour of opportunities , and for precisely that reason an hour that young hans castorp loved and longed for
1	he paid no attention to his sister ’ s plaintive words or her conjectures as to what her friend armgard would now do with her life , nor did he notice that , without actually turning her head his way , gerda had fixed her eyes—those close-set brown eyes with bluish shadows at the corners—firmly on him , searching his face
1	he ’ ll understand that this is no routine sale , no ordinary house
1	and then it will take another two months , i suppose , for his ship to sail all that way
1	his son justus sported a goatee and a mustache turned up at the ends , but he strongly resembled his father in stature and demeanor and was equally a master of elegant , rounded gestures with his hand
1	i am getting on in years , already forty
1	just listen to the young man !
1	while his father attempts to do penance by joining a crusade to the promised land and dies there , the child drifts toward an uncertain fate
1	inflammation spread to adjacent blood vessels ; lured to the scene of the accident , white corpuscles now arrived ; death by congealing proceeded apace
1	they can only hope to god now that there will be an absolute majority when the electors cast their first secret ballot
1	what a way you have with stories , herr settembrini—every word is absolutely graphic !
1	mais c ’ est une folie !
1	i really see nothing standing in your way
1	a patriotism , however , that would boldly proclaim that the bloody state whose gasping agonies we are now experiencing , that saddled itself
1	herr albin let out a brief laugh—a fluttery , ragged laugh
1	those who envied and opposed the audacious innovator had always claimed in fact , so we were told , that beethoven could not write a fugue
1	the aunt could not give him definite hopes of an opportunity for another interview
1	and what does hard and cold mean ?
1	by which i don ’ t mean the soloist ’ s dependence on accompaniment , although that can be distressing on occasion
1	and having once established that point of view , it was only logical , then , to treat the body accordingly , to bestow upon it certain disciplinary methods , which , if one dared take another risk , might likewise be called mystically evil
1	i mean to say : what is medical science concerned with ?
1	how could people with no worries possibly judge his situation ?
1	here is the door , it is open , there are no bars , no barriers , nothing—just a threshold
1	it ’ s curious—do you know the feeling ?
1	for two men had flung themselves down there beside one another—they were friends
1	what i want to say is
1	well , and you slept well , did you , ziemssen ?
1	but these new charges leveled against illusion and games-that is , against form itself-seemed to imply that the expanding realm of the banal , of what was no longer permissible , threatened to swallow art whole
1	i call the piece a fugue , and it has a fugal feeling , although the theme is never faithfully repeated , but rather is itself developed along with the development of the whole , so that a style , to which the artist apparently wished to subject himself , is dismantled and carried , so speak , to absurdity-and all of this accomplished not without reference to the archaic fugue forms of certain canzoni and ricercari of the period before bach , in which the fugue 's theme is not always clearly defined and adhered to
1	there is no doubt that it would be appropriate to judge him as lost and confused and worthy of our gravest concern
1	at home , she was closest to her poor and equally pious cousin klothilde , whose father had died recently and who was toying with the idea of establishing herself—which meant taking the few pennies and sticks of furniture that she had inherited and finding lodgings somewhere
1	they pressed their arms to their sides , rocked forward on the balls of their feet , bowed their heads , and bit their tongues in a frenzy of servility
1	it was no small matter , definitely not
1	then he left with kai
1	was their teasing him with gaffky numbers driving him to despair ?
1	herr permaneder is an energetic climber
1	that ’ s all , he added , laying what remained of his cigar in the ashtray
1	a few people shushed him , and i , too , turned disapprovingly toward the speaker , even if secretly i was grateful to him for his words
1	was all in her telegram
1	young hans castorp found all this well worth listening to—not that he was obliged to , of course , it was more an experiment—but in any case , well worth listening to , and he said as much to joachim ziemssen , who had just stuck a thermometer in his mouth and so could only mumble a reply and then became too involved in reading the numbers and entering them on his chart to be able to comment on settembrini ’ s views
1	there ’ s no denying it
1	there were offices both to one side of the vestibule door and at the far end of the passage , whereas the doors to the cellar and the kitchen , still fragrant with tart shallot sauce , were to the left of the stairway
1	milky way-to say nothing of the millions of others-to which it belongs
1	for each was as much a military calling as the other , in every sense : in asceticism and hierarchy , in obedience and spanish sense of honor
1	their son was there , too—august , a blond young man who exuded prosperity ; with him was his wife , julie , née hagenström , who was sitting between her brothers , hermann and moritz—a short , energetic woman with large bright black eyes and equally large diamonds dangling from her earlobes
1	and suddenly there were only three or four paltry days left , a remnant hardly worth considering , though given some weight by the two upcoming periodical deviations in the daily routine , but already filled with thoughts of packing and farewell
1	that inner state was strong within him , too ; he was not the man—not he , either—to extricate himself from it
1	for which reason they asked nottebohm to paint very expensive , very similar and inexpressive likenesses , one of each individually , and one of them together-and later , once children arrived , the jester was commissioned to produce a life-size family portrait of the institorises , an insipid representation , over whose considerable expanse a great quantity of highly varnished oils was squandered , and which , set in a costly frame and provided with its own el�ctric illumination from above and below , adorned the reception room
1	oh , but worse was to come
1	not young kleefeld with her pneumothorax
1	unlike adrian , �ho always stuck to his eleven o'clock train home to pfeiffering after spending an evening in munich , i had rented a room in schwabing , on hohenzollern
1	then his mother sent him to bed
1	but if your heart starts pounding all by itself , for no earthly reason , of its own accord , so to speak , i find that downright bizarre , if you see what i mean ?
1	for the magisterulus had marked that i thought to marry my self , and great was his rage , for he saw in wedlock an apostasy from him and a stratagem for expiation
1	but it was about humanity that schleppfuss spoke , too-naturally in the sense of the classical centuries of faith , which provided the spiritual frame of reference for his psychological arguments
1	all the same , he had eagerly seconded the plan for a pilgrimage to this highly recommended site when it was suggested within his little circle of seven friends ( counting himself )
1	sesame weichbrodt appeared in her black dress , but on her bonnet were brand-new green ribbons draping the curls at her ears
1	for proof of which we need only read the scandalous speech that he gave upon the completion of the first temple , and in which he asked 'but will god indeed dwell on the earth among men ?
1	and hans castorp had no trouble following suit , because when he took his seat again at the end of the table , between the teacher and miss robinson , it seemed as if he had been gone for a day at most
1	and because they wanted so much to get a little closer to the heart of the matter , to learn and understand even something of what made her tick , their limited imaginations led them to assume—how could it be otherwise ? —that beautiful gerda was cheating on her aging husband
1	it ’ s enough to make a botanist of you , the young man said to his companion
1	do you want to do that ?
1	pieter peeperkorn often lay sick in bed—that he did so on the day after that first evening of cards and champagne should come as no surprise
1	man was the measure of all things , he added
1	the consul stood at the door , pale as death , the knob in his hand
1	and how is she ?
1	and just as the two negotiators entered , the serving boy , clad in shirtsleeves and a good-natured smile , was dragging in another round of bottles ; and although the evening was now well advanced and it was much too late to give any attention to the revision of the constitution , no one was inclined to interrupt the get-together and go home
1	those were no serious interruptions , no obstacles worth taking seriously
1	the old man understood and nodded and went on eating , sitting very erect between the high mahogany back of his chair and the table , barely bending forward to his plate ; and his grandson , seated opposite , would watch with silent , profound , and unconscious attention as his grandfather ’ s hands—beautiful , white , gaunt , aged hands , with rounded , sharply tapered fingernails and a green signet ring on the right forefinger—arranged a bite of meat , vegetable , and potato on the tip of the fork with a few practiced motions and guided it to the mouth with just the least forward tip of the head
1	i peek into the office every few days
1	not everyone who goes about in long clothing and cries , lord , lord !
1	you ’ ll have to ask him that yourself , but i fear you won ’ t find him very talkative , because even if it was all done in a more bourgeois fashion , he was nevertheless sworn to silence
1	he dismounted , confused and dazed by what had happened to him , although he had not felt anything at all during the penetration
1	i trifle not in the least , nor even at all , when i speak of time given and of an appointed end , but am speaking narrowly to our argument
1	these were manly amusements , for which a glass of beer stood on the floor beside each player , who probably had a cigar in his mouth as well , and which were frequently interrupted by comments-breaking into the language of tones with an especially dry and odd sound-or by the tapping of bows and the counting back of bars whenever things got out of sync , which was almost always the choral director 's fault
1	you see how skinny i am
1	time seemed so strangely far-fetched and yet immediately wakened certain premonitions-when adrian 's intentions slowly revealed themselves as a work that he mastered by letting it master him and for which his energies had been gathering even as they lay in torment ?
1	i am surely qualified to offer a picture of the niece , since a short while later i kept my eyes on her for some time , earnestly examining her for good reason
1	he paid no attention to it , or in his usual fashion he would shrug it off after a curiously anxious moment of thinking things over
1	he had been standing and when i finished quickly sat down in one of the wicker armchairs , but then demonstrated the composure of a man who had lived for a long time in an oppressively menacing atmosphere
1	naphta had been listening
1	hanno buddenbrook was among those who were given demerits
1	linderhof , ludwig ii 's little rococo castle , lies in a secluded mountain woodland of magnificent beauty
1	a man doesn ’ t really know whether he lives for his own sake or for life ’ s sake , and no one can tell him for sure which it is , either
1	that almost never happens to me , really only when i ’ m seriously ill and today it tastes like leather
1	herr permaneder said , sitting down in the armchair to which elisabeth had directed him with a polite gesture ; feeling at home now , he began to rub his short , fat thighs with both hands
1	it required no effort of imagination for hans castorp to share in the tenor ’ s ecstasy and gratitude , but as he sat there with folded hands , staring at the little black louvers , from between whose slats this all burst forth , ultimately what he felt , understood , and relished was the victorious ideality of music , of art , of human emotions , their sublime and incontrovertible ability to gloss over the crude horrors of reality
1	a walk along the beach to warm up , out to seagull rock or the temple of the sea , and then you sat in your wicker chair and had a snack—until the time came for you to go back to the room and take a little nap before dinner
1	and the air was full of notions such as the abolition of the difference between citizens and inhabitants , or the easing of qualifications for citizenship , even for non-christians
1	in brief , there is little cause for rejoicing
1	and at the same time she set a steaming cup in front of him and shoved the breadbasket , butter , salt , and eggcup his way
1	gotthold ’ s eyebrows wandered back up under the brim of his hat , and with some exertion he focused his eyes on his brother
1	he did not believe in it , he said , for every man was perfectly free to believe in it or not
1	i can feel the burning in my throat and gut , just thinking about it
1	so now you can say you ’ ve learned what it means to have your flesh creep
1	he courted her , but did so in some sense for another
1	lebrecht kröger said with cold disdain
1	tony , he repeated , behold me here
1	but when the consul ’ s wife touched glasses with the poet , a very delicate blush came to her fair face , for she had noticed the polite little nod he had directed her way at the words foam-born venus
1	i am not quite sure
1	the look he directed at me was the look , that familiar look that made me unhappy-and it mattered little whether it was aimed at me or someone else-mute , veiled , so coldly aloof as to be almost offensive , and it was followed by the smile , with lips closed , nostrils twitching in scorn , and by his turning away
1	suddenly they heard the noise of shouts and screams , some kind of insolent yowling , plus whistles and the stamping of a great many feet on pavement—coming closer now and growing
1	what a strange interweaving of relationships it was !
1	quite dead and buried ?
1	it was a real intermission—everyone was relaxed and mildly satisfied with the work thus far accomplished
1	but it ’ s good you ’ ve let it out
1	but about human skin in general , since you ’ re so good at painting it
1	as was his custom , james ate and drank heartily , his appetite having been whetted even more by the trip and the change of air
1	tickets for those few seats had to be so expensive that we were forced to give them all away
1	a rogue , that ’ s what he is
1	but she answered , yes , dear herr permaneder , i will be frank with you
1	he wanted to be an officer and was so inspired by esprit de corps that he couldn ’ t leave johann buddenbrook high and dry , even though he couldn ’ t stand him
1	his head fell so hard against his chest that his lower jaw clattered loudly against his upper teeth
1	hans castorp decided he would send her a potted plant , too , or bring her a dewy , fragrant bouquet , imported from the nurseries of nice or cannes
1	i am merely fulfilling a pleasant duty in stopping by to see how you are doing
1	christian was completely beside himself now
1	hans castorp wanted to leave and come back , go fetch something and then have them pick up their labors where they had left off ?
1	who is making this stink here ? —and he noticed too late , or perhaps not at all , that his wife was blushing terribly , that old madame buddenbrook , thomas , and gerda sat there like statues , that the ladies buddenbrook exchanged pointed glances , that even rieke severin , at the far end of the table , looked offended and simply gazed straight ahead , and that only old consul kröger managed to splutter softly
1	but then , in the middle of that battle , in the middle of all the dispatches , letters , and calculations , this had befallen him as well
1	kaisersaschern lies , to be sure , in the middle of the homeland of the reformation , in the heart of luther country , with which one associates names of towns like eisleben , wittenberg , quedlinburg , but also grimma , wolfenbiittel , and eisenach-which , in turn , helps explain the inner life of leverkiihn , the lutheran , and also ties into his original course of study , theology
1	but our little group most decidedly found enjoyment and profit in
1	they vested him with very important responsibilities and allowed him to move about the exchange with all the hallmarks of overwork , including rubbing his hand through his hair and assuring one and all that he was wearing out
1	he remained the victor
1	even dr hagenström , the prosecutor , who was a man of taste and wit , let it be known in private that breslauer ’ s speech had been an absolute pleasure to listen to
1	yes , my dear friend , he said ( and i shall omit the episodes of impasse that
1	anemic—he , tienappel , was anemic ?
1	by itself , music can not draw the world forward
1	i ’ m late already , i was delayed in the office
1	the seat on his right was occupied , though only temporarily , for just a few days , by a visitor , just as he himself had once been , by a guest , a relative from the flatlands , an envoy from those regions , one might say—in a word , by hans ’ s uncle james tienappel
1	at rorschach , a town in swiss territory , you reboard a train that takes you only as far as landquart , a small station in the alps , where you must change trains again
1	sometimes i ’ ve asked myself if i shouldn ’ t have become a doctor
1	but i have never denied his keen sensitivity for the intellectual commotion of the time , his nose for each new expression of its will , and i was confronted with some of all that for the very first time in his person and soiree conversations
1	not that people held that against him—they were much too plodding and skeptical to show any signs of serious moral outrage
1	and so now , with hands clasped behind his head , deutschlin put the existential question about the genetic origin of arzt 's economic society
1	in moscow—the voice pronounced it muoscow , drawing the word out in the same indolent way it did humane—in baku , in german spas , in spain
1	of the ears-but not always and so probably not intentionally
1	and finally there was the way _he would take his leave for the evening-always showing his ready contrition and desire to improve
1	nothing very intelligible , and even less so the more he drank
1	lymph is the most refined , intimate , and delicate mechanism in the human body
1	hans castorp spied a bench on the far side of the brook
1	but one thing was certain , and they both felt it , that at that moment , as their eyes met and held , the estrangement and coldness , the constraint and misunderstanding between them fell away ; and thomas buddenbrook knew that he could depend on his son ’ s trust and devotion whenever , as now , it was a matter of fear and suffering , and not , as usual , a matter of energy , competence , and bright-eyed vigor
1	freedom had been given to thought in order to justify force , just as seven hundred years ago reason had been free to discuss faith and prove dogma ; that had been its purpose , and that was the purpose of thought today , or would be tomorrow
1	the learned conductor of these experiments was put in the happy situation of supplying a greek name , replete with scientific decorum , to these feats
1	’ m lookin ’ for ’ ard to that , he reiterated absent-mindedly , while examining the wallpaper , the furniture , and the large inkwell of sèvres porcelain on the secretary
1	hans castorp was taken aback by the old noblewoman ’ s manner of speech
1	but since it is quite an exertion to both climb and sing , he soon found he was short of breath—and it kept getting shorter
1	granted , there was no sufficient reason for this sympathy—particularly if one disregarded such things as his heathen name , his status as a model pupil ( which , indeed , could have played no role whatever ) , or those kirghiz eyes , which from time to time , in certain sidelong glances , when gazing at nothing in particular , could darken , almost melt , to a veiled dusky look—but whatever the reason , hans castorp did not worry about the intellectual or emotional basis of his reaction , or even what name he would give it if he had to
1	he wanted one last taste of this insistent , urgent longing , of this craving that filled his whole being , of this cramped and strained exertion of will , which at the same time refused all fulfillment and release—he knew that happiness lasts only a moment
1	consul kröger had long since dispensed with such precautionary measures
1	i affirm , i respect , i love the body , just as i affirm , respect , and love form , beauty , freedom , mirth , and pleasure—just as i champion the world , the interests of life against sentimental flight from the world , classicismo against romanticismo
1	it was true : demoralization , lethargy , and stupor were rampant
1	as if pulled by some magnetic force , the conversation turned personal
1	he was delighted to see it , for he now realized that his relationship to the femur , and to organic nature in general , was threefold : lyric , medical , and technical
1	was he not ashamed of himself , he asked , to come peddling such vile , unacceptable proposals when it was nothing but a purely abstract duel , based on no real injury whatever ?
1	one could go further and say that just as undigested food does not strengthen a man , time spent in waiting does not age him
1	there was considerable discussion during the meal and afterward in the abbot 's study about political and moral matters , about the mythic emergence of national character that occurs at such historical junctures and concerning which i spoke with some emotion in order to provide a little counterbalance to the drastically empirical view of war that schildknapp saw as the only permissible one ; we talked , that is , about germany 's role , about the violation of belgium , so very reminiscent of frederick the great 's incursion into formally neutral saxony , about the world 's shrill cry of outrage and about our philosophical chancellor 's speech , with its brooding admission of guilt , its proverbial , and untranslatable , assertion that necessity knows no law , and its disregardanswerable solely before god-of an old legal document in face of our present life-threatening exigency
1	i heard those old spots myself , and now behrens has evidently found a fresh minor problem
1	you have to lay out money for drinks , toiletries , cigars , an occasional excursion , a carriage ride if you like , and now and then a bill for the cobbler or tailor
1	well , it was not a term they would have come up with on their own , but once the glass had spelled it out , they found it probable and nicely put
1	i do not understand why i shouldn ’ t mention aline ’ s name !
1	then let us proceed , the senator said , closing his eyelids tighter still
1	perchance god sees , too , that i sought out what was hard and gave myself to drudgery , perchance , perchance it will be reckoned to me and put to my account that i have been so diligent andcomplished all with pertinacity- !
1	he might have been mistaken—but at least he did not think such frequent repetition did the word any good , either
1	and yet , if one included his inheritance from his mother and his share from the sale of the house and lot on meng strasse , he was worth more than six hundred thousand marks courant
1	he spoke very softly , hesitantly , almost stuttered as he considered each word for a second ; and he had a habit of extending the first two fingers of his left hand and slowly , cautiously stroking the unkempt , reddish brown mustache that hid his mouth ; or sometimes he would carefully rub his hands together while his round , brown eyes wandered off discreetly to one side , lending him a confused and distracted look—whereas in fact he was always studiously analyzing the matter at hand
1	it would mean that the buddenbrooks are finished , over and done with—they ’ re pulling up stakes , and the hagenströms are taking their place , with trumpets and drums
1	once outside , they walked back and forth across the wet red bricks of the courtyard , which was crowded with boys of various ages milling noisily about
1	what would you have me do about such a cold , herr settembrini ?
1	how extraordinary , hans castorp said
1	what good did it do to uncover the components of dead muscle ?
1	for when the dutchman was not confined to bed , he seldom failed to gather about him a small , constantly changing assortment of berghof guests for after-dinner games with wine and other regalements , either in the social rooms as on that first occasion , or in the restaurant ; and hans castorp would take his customary seat between the great man and the careless woman
1	they took their main meal , paid for by the month , in a nearby trattoria
1	had schwerdtfeger really initiated things , or had adrian merely attributed that to him out of embarrassment at playing the role of a lover suddenly devising outings and sleigh rides-something quite counter to his own nature and mood ?
1	gerda buddenbrook and the young , eccentric officer had become acquainted , naturally , by way of music
1	and you ’ re sure to become famous , because you ’ re so clever
1	although i should not forget , either , that i am writing not for the moment , nor for readers who as yet know nothing at all about leverkiihn and so could have no desire to learn more about him , but that i am preparing this account for a time when conditions for public response will be quite different-and with certainty one can say much more favorable-when the demand for details of this disturbing life , however adeptly or unadeptly presented , will be both less selective and more urgent
1	carries on about his fifteen months as if they were eons he had to kill
1	and his guardian , herr stephan kistenmaker , who was sitting in the next box , had muttered something about how this sort of thing distracted boys from their duties
1	so , then , that ’ s agreed
1	yes , indeed ; and in the artillery the oath was sworn , symbolically , to a cannon
1	his father , who manufactured dolls in coburg , had sent him to england for commercial training , he whispered , and it was there that he had taken ill his fever had been diagnosed as typhoid in nature and treated accordingly , which meant a diet of broths that had caused him to lose far too much weight
1	she looked out across the leuchtenfeld flats and the lighthouse to the ruffled sea , bordered on the right by the curving coast of mecklenburg and then extending out in bands of green and blue until it merged with the hazy horizon
1	he had come directly from supper and , as was his habit , had a wooden toothpick between his lips
1	the phrase was repeated in such a terrified and almost terrifying tone that kiirbis asked himself if he might not have gone a bit too far
1	the remarkable thing was that in that moment not only the teacher but timm himself and all his classmates , too , were honestly convinced that timm was truly a fine , hardworking student who had indeed earned a good grade
1	that of a tutelary goddess , an egeria , a phantom lover ?
1	the condition that she be absent was already met , since she was presently staying-invisibly-in vienna
1	it could just as easily have been whiling haste , it was a bit of poetic ventriloquism from the beyond ; hans castorp thought it splendid
1	and now he , schoolmaster michelsen , was the very first to declare loudly and with a certain fervor that for god 's sake the lad must go on to high school and university , for he , michelsen , had never before come across such a clever and agile mind , and it would be a shame not to do everything to clear the path to the heights of learning for such a pupil
1	and your dear father ’ s letter awakened within me a hope , which you will now make a happy certainty , will you not ?
1	music most faithful , in its modern , mechanical form
1	after drinking his beer that evening , hans castorp felt more exhausted , chilled , and torpid than on any day thus far ; he said good night to his cousin a little before nine , quickly slipped in under his comforter , pulling it up over his chin , and fell dead asleep
1	but although she was invisibly absent , at the same time she was also invisibly present in hans castorp ’ s mind—as the genius and guardian angel of the place , whom he had known and possessed for one wicked , riotously sweet hour , an hour quite incongruous with some delicate little song from the flatlands , and whose interior silhouette he now bore next to a heart that had been sorely overtaxed for the last nine months
1	the bright gilt trim of the plasterwork , the luster of the chandelier , the gleam of the brass instruments below would vanish one moment , only to flash brilliantly the next
1	he sidled down into it and put on a face as if he had been there all along
1	he was told to please be patient for a few days—since , man alive , the director was busy ; christian principles demanded that operations , checkups , and suffering humankind take precedence
1	and in saying this she confirmed the fact that the farm had once been a cloister
1	one day at dinner , he asked about the local theater , whether the company was any good and what was playing
1	frau permaneder , for example , had not the slightest idea what the whole show was about
1	but why should i ?
1	they also surrounded consul buddenbrook , who was sure to know how mayor oeverdieck felt about the matter , because the previous year senator dr oeverdieck , a brother-in-law of consul justus kröger , had become president of the senate and mayor—and that meant that the buddenbrooks were now related to the mayor , which greatly enhanced the esteem in which they were held
1	he had a friend , and so did i , in the farm 's dog suso-that indeed was his somewhat peculiar name-a rather scruffy spaniel , whose face broke into a wide grin when he was brought his meal , but who could prove more than a little dangerous to strangers and led an unconventional life , for he was chained to his house next to his bowls during the day and set free to range the courtyard only in the still of the night
1	and the rest of it can wait , too
1	they met at the middle of the main door , looked at one another , exchanged a verbal salute , and marched off again in opposite directions
1	poor reuter , the fellow in room twenty-seven—i caught a glimpse of him through his door one of my first days here—he surely joined his ancestors long ago , after which they sneaked him out
1	what homage for a seasoned instrumental magician to pay to the piano and its music !
1	at me an unutterably earnest , almost menacingly probing glance that made me shudder , but that within a second seemed to collapse , the eyeballs turning upward and vanishing half under the lids , to wander there restlessly back and forth
1	presumably it also had something to do with his intellectual scruples about the fate of the autonomous work , about the historical situation of art per se
1	might i offer you one ?
1	but i doubt if they are equally poetic
1	the tones emanating from the chorus had imitated delicate instrumental music , evoking a sense of heavenly sweetness and gentleness in those who heard it
1	yes , yes , she is , tony said
1	even if one granted that his relationship to the slant-eyed patient had by its very nature exceeded the bounds of western reason and behavior , what had to be maintained now was very civilized formality , even , for the present , a feigned forgetfulness
1	hans castorp remained with those up here for seven years—no round number for devotees of the decimal system , and yet a good , handy number in its way , a mythic , romantic bundle of time , one might say , more satisfying to the soul than a plain half-dozen
1	i still don ’ t understand it—the telegram arrived about ten minutes ago
1	the steamers passed like phantoms and ghost ships and vanished toward the murky horizon
1	enough for now about all this , i beg you
1	casually lifting his elbows , his long index fingers pointed down the backs of knife and fork , he circumspectly cut away one juicy slice after another
1	they ’ ve formed a group—something like pneumothorax brings people together , naturally—and call themselves the half-lung club , that ’ s the name everyone knows them by
1	i must say , however , that i treated the sisters somewhat unequally and in small ways fitted out my opinion of institoris the suitor according to the person who asked it
1	hanno had laid his head down on his crossed arms again
1	stay alert and awake !
1	and to thomas buddenbrook ’ s relief , the gold beaker he gave the child was not inordinately massive
1	it was called the monkey , a childish bit of hokum that they demanded be memorized by young men whose main interest was to get on with the serious things in life , whether on the high seas or in the office
1	no , really , herr buddenbrook , just because you think something is lovely ’ !
1	well , he said a great many things about money , the soul of the state , as he put it , and spoke out against property , because it ’ s thievery , and against capitalist wealth in general , which he said , i believe , was fuel for the fires of hell—at least if i ’ m not mistaken that ’ s how he put it—and sang the praises of the medieval injunction against interest
1	she set up a dreadful ruckus , and the bed had to be changed around at once , even though her pillow then faced the light , which was very disruptive to sleep
1	they were now walking on a city sidewalk—it was immediately apparent that this was the main street of an international resort
1	i definitely must ask settembrini later who it is he means by we
1	and home they go
1	it was regrettable that he had little use for all these old records and papers
1	hans castorp enjoyed listening to the dialect , and also enjoyed fiete ’ s answers , likewise in plattdeutsch , delivered while serving from the left and bending around behind his master to speak into his right ear , out of which the senator heard considerably better than the left
1	i ’ ll be damned , hans castorp muttered
1	but he is certainly more than presentable , and there ’ s no use demanding a sheep with five legs , if you ’ ll permit me a businessman ’ s turn of phrase
1	what is wrong with you , wehsal ?
1	and they flood out over the scourged , rain-soaked land , the road , the country lane , the muddy fields ; we shadows at the roadside watch from their midst
1	a young man with a sparse moustache and an expression on his face as if he had something foul-tasting in his mouth sat down next to her and ate his breakfast in total silence
1	erkiihn t h e p
1	but the local does not go deep , gentlemen , it numbs only the outermost layer of muscle , you feel them make the incision , although only as a bruising pressure
1	i am leaving the sanatorium
1	herr brecht adjusted some screws on the chair and then set about examining the tooth with a little steel rod and a tiny mirror
1	but who was this woman , this lady overblown , and how was he supposed to take the name ?
1	the fortune his father had left him , apart from the business which he still ran after a fashion , had been quite considerable
1	he looked down at the paths and flowerbeds of the level gardens , the grotto , the silver fir , listened to whispers drifting up from the lounging area , where people were taking their rest cure—and turned back into the room , where he tried to correct the way the instrument sat in his mouth
1	hans castorp cast them dark glances , and kept to himself the fact that he did not think them the worst of the lot
1	but obviously he did behave like a real democrat when it came to the church , which , as one proudly had to confess , represented the most noble force in human history—noble in the final and highest meaning of the word , nobility of the spirit
1	they walked through the bare garden , which lay under a blanket of melting snow , took a quick look at the portal , then turned back to the front courtyard ; taking the narrow , flagstone path to the left of the scullery ; passing between walls on either side , they entered the back courtyard , where the oak tree stood , and approached the back building
1	although i must admit that i used to be bored now and then , fräulein tony ; but that was several weeks ago
1	how long have you lived here ?
1	he spoke of hidden suffering , of shame and affliction , of the redemptive effects of analysis ; he praised the effects of light piercing the dark unconscious , explained that illness could be transformed again into conscious emotion , admonished them to trust , promised recovery
1	joachim was likewise in a lively mood , and after the humming , drumming lady suddenly stood up and departed , their conversation turned even more candid and high-spirited
1	but there was no way to differentiate it precisely , to keep the kinds of fever apart
1	( and i was annoyed at the way he put it , which shoved music off on me , as if it were more my concern than his )
1	i ’ ve already explained to you that the moment my hopes of being able to return to the world of work in the foreseeable future should prove untenable , i was determined to fold my tents here and set myself up for the duration somewhere else in the valley
1	on the other hand they had concurrently seen service in the church as tabernacles for the host and as reliquaries , even as communion chalices
1	the worst pan—or , in hans castorp ’ s eyes , the best—was that she did not find any real compensation , either , in her relationship to leo naphta , in whom she had set some hope
1	i understand completely that it is a matter of importance to you—
1	settembrini claimed that one of these fellows , a medical student well advanced in his studies , had turned out to be totally ignorant of latin and did not know , for example , what a vacuum was ; and from daily first-hand knowledge , hans castorp was fairly sure that frau stöhr was not lying when she told her tablemates that the couple in room were always still in bed together when the bath attendant came to give them their morning massage
1	a europe that knew how to preserve its eternal treasures would coolly , calmly proceed with the agenda of classical reason and ignore any proletarian apocalypses that might be envisioned here or there
1	the deceptive perceptions of space and time , and thus of history , his preoccupation with finding honorable historical continuity in his own descendants , the fear of some sort of ultimate , historical dissolution and disintegration—his mind let go of them all , and he was no longer hindered from understanding the constant flow of eternity
1	mais oui , certainement , do let us sit down , merci , mille fois merci !
1	the coffin is brought in early in the morning while you ’ re still sleeping , and then the party in question is removed only at another more suitable time—during meals , for instance
1	externally , my good lad , externally you are sleek and dapper , true , but internally , my good lad , you are black
1	the carriage followed the puddled ruts of the country road , and birds were chirping everywhere
1	the consul grabbed the paper just as it fluttered past his knees and with bewildered , sad eyes watched his father start pacing again
1	not that i could hear , but probably to himself
1	twenty-eight is vacant , as far as i know
1	there is no doubt that he wrote it with an eye to beethoven 's ninth , as its counterpart in the most melancholy sense of the word
1	but his wife was only too pleased with the present state of affairs , or so frau permaneder claimed , and was in league with that doctor
1	and to think of the things i could do when i was young
1	you said it , behrens replied with a dismissive gesture , and then added , top to bottom
1	what are you doing , jean ?
1	you are hardly up to dealing with the problem of tolerance , my good engineer
1	did hans castorp sleep more lightly , more fitfully that night because of some inner alertness of which his soul knew nothing ?
1	courtesy—so that interest in a given topic becomes something almost chivalrous
1	senator buddenbrook takes up a position , now at the top of the stairs , now at the bay window , to receive all their good wishes—some murmured in serious and formal tones , some blurted cordially and heartily
1	you ’ re a clever fellow , and although i was a silly goose not so very long ago , it ’ s been my experience , you know , that things do not always turn out fairly and squarely in life
1	i am not saying— hans castorp responded , i am not saying that she ever shared them
1	spoke the whole sentence all the way to the end so that you could understand it ?
1	later that evening there was supper , followed by a game of chess with his mother , ending in a draw
1	and what was the medical finding ?
1	for not only was kunigunde , like almost all jews , very musical , but she also maintained , without having read widely , a much purer and more fastidious relationship to the german language than the average citizen , indeed than most men of letters , and had initiated her acquaintance with adrian , which for her part she always called a friendship ( and did it not over time truly become that ?
1	and stephan kistenmaker replied , yes , you ’ re absolutely right
1	you clench your hand , and it flows , a thin , colorless stream , to form a delicate mound beside you
1	fond of children … fond of children
1	doesn ’ t even have a cavity
1	or , let us say , it makes one aware of and sensitive to its cynicism
1	it was clear that under a , to be sure , well-chosen pretext , the contadino was here giving vent to a certain animosity toward the educated member of the family , even though-or perhaps because-in his heart of hearts sor alfo shared the admiration all manardis felt for the lawyer , whom they regarded as a kind of statesman
1	oh , we must , as i ’ ve said , be concerned to localize the illness , to ease her cough and grapple with the fever
1	one could at least lie down on the chaise longue the other guests had given him , although it was covered with just a cloth , since it still lacked both cushions and upholstery
1	spring of to
1	but i was most definitely not of that opinion
1	i am deeply moved as i write this in its defense-and am seized with yet another emotion : the recollection of the pandemonium of laughter , of infernal laughter , that forms the brief , but ghastly conclusion of the first part of the apocalypse
1	he asked with resonance of the nose , as schooled
1	the social problem , the problem of human coexistence is politics , is politics through and through , nothing but politics
1	she said softly , but that ’ s the only time i ’ ve ever refused you anything
1	it would take twelve months until they would return anew , the circle complete—and after all , that was only seven months more than hans castorp had already spent here
1	having grown up between two languages , her private idiom was charmingly flawed , but she wrote ladylike and original novels of manners that were not lacking in psychological and musical charm and were most definitely serious literature
1	i would not yet call it a focus for softening tissue , but it is certainly a moist spot
1	it was in greece that settembrini ’ s father had first seen the light of the world—which probably explained why he was such a great humanist and lover of classical antiquity—born , by the way , of a mother with german blood , a girl whom giuseppe had married in switzerland and taken along with him throughout the course of his adventures
1	either it comes from an earlier period of the summer when we spent three weeks with the two friends , or it dates from the previous summer , when they first were guests of the manardis
1	grünlich is very busy , leaves for town in our little yellow buggy early every morning and doesn ’ t get back till late
1	think of it , that ’ s something worth learning
1	he played the double role , as it were , of the hypocritical villain : herr buddenbrook , my youthful patron , let us agree , then—eighty-four thousand marks courant
1	if i were to render expert opinion as a businessman , i regret that i would have to say these are the ledgers of an unfortunate man , true , but of a very guilty man as well
1	sake-if you acknowledge one another at all
1	sometimes the lessons took place in herr pfühl ’ s house , a roomy old gabled affair with all sorts of cool hallways and nooks , where the organist lived all by himself except for an ancient housekeeper
1	tony broke into a nervous giggle
1	that is , i heard the word mentioned so often , that i started thinking about it
1	they had arrived not merely simultaneously , they had arrived together ; and it was this companionship , which continued , for example , in seating arrangements that placed mynheer beside the returnee at the good russian table , opposite the doctor ’ s chair , the seat from which popóv the teacher had once put on his wild and dubious performances—it was this companionship that upset our good hans castorp , because he had failed to see anything of the sort coming
1	they both knew this about themselves and each other , and they also knew that each of them knew this about themselves and one another—and that it was all tangled and squalid
1	one trunk—a small one
1	that was going too far
1	what a skull , what cheekbones , what a strange set to the eyes
1	he joked about the figure cut by a widower bent low with grief and making his daily pilgrimage to the graveside of his dear departed wife to converse with her there
1	having been examined in his godly skills by the rabbi , who then authorized him to slaughter acceptable animals according to the law of moses and the regulations of the talmud , elia naphta was himself filled with a quiet religiosity ; there had been something priestly about him and his blue eyes , which , as his son described them , had glittered like stars and radiated a solemnity recalling ancient times when the slaughtering of animals had indeed been the duty of priests
1	klothilde was by far the happiest person in the house that night
1	events had taken their course without him
1	she asked a second time , nodding disconsolately , her eyes wide and filled with tears
1	mountains , trees , and lakes , the beauty of a landscape ?
1	are you surprised that in comparison to the latter , the ideal leads even more directly and inexorably to truly radical situations , to the question of you or me , to the duel , to physical struggle ?
1	he first exhaled and let the smoke drift across the table , then continued , first of all , i ’ m very happy to be married and to have set up a household of my own
1	adrian 's and rudiger 's visit to the spot was pure improvisation and very fleeting that first time
1	they did it all over the world , just to arouse our ardent desires
1	she would not hear of her guest apologizing for his infirmity and that he had smuggled himself into her house as a patient with a recurrent fever , so to speak , and simply replied : oh go on with you !
1	it becomes static , monotone --
1	the composition of the secretion called sweat was poorly understood
1	diederich has had a good education ; harbor pilot is a very responsible and rather well-paid position
1	thomas ’ s private fortune was tentatively set at , , and an equal sum was put aside for christian , should he at some point establish himself independently
1	but i was even more deeply impressed , on the very first hearing , by a song based on words by blake : the dream of a chapel all of gold before which people stand , weeping , mourning , worshiping , but not daring to enter in
1	well , let them—come on , they ’ re just thickheaded rhinoceroses
1	long banks of fog lay motionless along the hills to both sides , while masses of clouds , white and gray , were draped on the more distant mountains
1	i am not going too far when i declare it to be politically suspect
1	and may i expect any justice from you ?
1	but they are all like that down there , and that ’ s what i wanted to say , ida , that ’ s the main thing
1	in brief , soldiers fought for the spanish counter-reformation , for napoleon , for garibaldi—and now we have prussian soldiers
1	they in no way felt the war to be the deep and severing rift in history that it appeared to be to us , and instead saw in it a disruption that had now come to a happy conclusion , after which life would be returned to the track out of which it had been shunted
1	he could bear it no longer ; he shoved his armchair back , left the office , and climbed the stairs
1	that would assure what i call the neutrality of harmony and melody
1	an hour later , hanno lay in his bed , which had recently been placed in a little room off the third-floor corridor , just to the left of the senator ’ s dressing room
1	shame , shame , herr permaneder !
1	do have a seat , herr kasten , herr carsten , or whatever your name was
1	the largest room in a prince 's castle is usually the throne room
1	do you see those adhesions ?
1	tall , broad-shouldered , with small hips and long legs , he wore-day in , day out-the same rather shabby plaid breeches , long woolen socks , sturdy ocher shoes , a shirt of coarse linen with an open collar , and over that a kind of jacket of by now indeterminate color and with sleeves that were too short
1	did he feel liberated , was his mind easier—or did his spirit suffer great privation when he saw one whole side of the table empty ?
1	yes , tony , this would interest you especially
1	with a quick sidelong glance of his own , he discovered that frau chauchat was paying him no attention , and so he stood in his usual pose beside the bed—weight on one leg , hands clasped before the abdomen , head tilted to one side—gazing down in thoughtful reverence
1	call it , or because her personality quite spontaneously called up in him certain nervous , embarrassed inhibitions
1	and so one might very well conclude that , as a goal for an excursion , it was more morally fitting than many others—the movie theater or the start of the bobsled run , for instance—particularly since paying a visit to those people up there was nothing more than an act of comradely respect , assuming , of course , that one did not regard the cemetery simply as one of the town ’ s sights , a standard goal for a standard walk
1	by the way , that brings me to another thought
1	their faces were not exactly radiant with joy , and their conversation was not exactly spirited
1	well , yes , but that ’ s not quite how she meant it
1	herr behrens , i simply must speak to you for a moment
1	what were they thinking ?
1	he was not all that strict about demanding great dexterity in practicing scales , or at least he did not see it as the purpose of practice
1	but father leverkiihn would reprimand us with a hush !
1	the senator laid his newspaper on the table beside him , slipped his pince-nez into his vest pocket , and rubbed his hand across his brow and eyes
1	dr gieseke , she said , crossing her arms , laying her head back , and staring at the ceiling , you are a man who knows life well , both in a personal and a professional sense
1	the visitor in august had long ago become a comrade—dr
1	before you lie to me again , just see for yourself if it isn ’ t lukewarm dishwater no respectable human being could possibly drink !
1	whereas with highly differentiated beings like you and me , the skin ’ s sole aspiration is to be tickled
1	do you think you can simply sweep it under the rug ?
1	he ’ ll climb back up , wander right up the column , old mercury will , she said
1	you are small—but what is that to me ?
1	he jotted a satisfactory in his notebook , and hanno buddenbrook sat down
1	and i did hear your name mentioned once or twice
1	schildknapp , who was also well-versed in music , was an adaptation of the text ; but he would hear nothing of it , in part because he had his own work to do and also probably in part because adrian could hardly have compensated him at the time
1	because you fill up your days with the theater and strolling about and buffooneries , creating a whole series of feelings and sensitivities and conditions to keep yourself occupied , to observe and nurse them , so that you can shamelessly babble on about them
1	it ’ s twenty hours from hamburg to davos—true , by train
1	do you have anything in particular , anyone special in mind when you say we do not live for life but for enrichment ?
1	you have constructed a theological theory that ascribes to man an eminently honorable , if perhaps somewhat one-sided religious function
1	people of herr settembrini ’ s sort , the doubters and critics , had observed this fact and seen to it that the old naive form of justice was replaced by the inquisition , which no longer depended on god ’ s intervening on behalf of truth , but was aimed at obtaining the truth through the confession of the accused
1	the consul pressed his lips together again ; he was thoroughly satisfied
1	what have i done to deserve such doubt and hesitation ?
1	it wasn ’ t boredom that bothered him ; on the contrary , he began to fear that the end of his stay was winging its way toward him
1	he returned to the institution where he had been a pupil and was given a position as prefect , a supervisor of the students , a teacher of philosophy and humanities
1	entering through a parlor that separated frau chauchat ’ s room from the dutchman ’ s
1	so they would stay until he was better
1	even this theme failed to rouse anyone
1	or the other one , it doesn ’ t matter
1	and after all , this isn ’ t a siberian salt mine
1	i did not seduce her , she seduced me , and little lnstitoris 's horns , to use a stupid expression , are purely her work , not mine
1	compared with lnstitoris , who merely instructed about beauty , rudolf had on his side the advantage of art-which nourishes passion and transfigures all things human
1	ending in her ecstatic cry , this torch , and though it be my life 's own light , laughing now , i do not quail to quench ( whereby the singer emphasized the dramatic action with an energetic downward thrust of her arm ) , it would not have taken much for me to have knelt with tears in my eyes before this triumphantly smiling woman now showered with applause
1	but he paid no attention
1	and that dreamy way he had about him—did it not sometimes border on simple-mindedness ?
1	his dramatic sensitivities overcame him and he gave a performance
1	we walked back together to the schweigestill house , where we were strangely touched by the truly scarcely remarkable fact that as before , despite the old man 's departure , the atmosphere was heavy with the pungent aroma of pipe smoke issuing from the open living room , although it was surely also deeply impregnated in the walls of the hallway
1	yes , even he , to whom all pettiness had once been so alien , had developed his own kind of pedantry , although it grew out of a different personality structure and emotional makeup
1	he would bury his hands in his coat pockets and roll his shoulders pointlessly or clear his throat noisily while pounding his chest with his fist—all to proclaim his indifference
1	i chose you for this mission of love because you are far more in your element there than , let us say , serenus zeitblom
1	he listens to the voice of duty—and what he hears is the license of passion
1	i am , to be frank , not a passionate man , but i do have my passions , detached passions
1	and at that a flabbergasted hans castorp could not help banging his hand on the table
1	you are a rich man
1	there were twelve in all , in two different formats , twelve records to each ; and since many of the circular disks were minutely etched on both sides—not simply because many pieces required two sides , but also because a good number of them offered two different selections—it was difficult at first to get an overview of this confusing world of beautiful possibilities waiting to be conquered
1	no one said anything
1	he had fallen face-down , and a puddle of blood immediately began to form around his head
1	christian—or krischan , as he usually was called , for good or ill—knew them all as friends or acquaintances from the old days—most of them had been students of the late marcellus stengel—and he was received with open arms , for , although neither the merchants nor the professionals considered him a great intellect , they recognized his amusing social gifts
1	and beneath that is the layer of fat , the upholstery , you know—the foundation of fat cells that creates the gorgeous female form
1	it goes without saying that by this date i mean the point marking my present activity-not the one to which my narrative has advanced , for that is the autumn of , twenty-two months prior to the outbreak of the previous war , when adrian returned to munich from palestrina with rudiger schildknapp and for his part took temporary lodging in a small hotel ( the pension gisella ) in schwabing
1	we ’ ll swelter if we have to march off in this heat—it ’ s quite unnatural
1	they all talked at once in loud , jocular voices , gave one another encouraging pokes in the ribs , and made a point of showing just how at ease they were
1	her tired , watery-blue eyes—herr grünlich ’ s eyes—said that she had learned to submit to life ’ s disappointments , and her composed , sometimes slightly whiny voice said as much as well
1	as far as possible the ladies and gentlemen were seated in pairs , the long chain of the family broken here and there by friends
1	his uniform jacket was unbuttoned , revealing the full curve of his white vest
1	so then tell me , what do you think of me ?
1	do you like it ?
1	the drudgeries that do on occasion precede death can hardly be credited to him , since they just prove that someone is alive and kicking and may lead back to life and health
1	i don ’ t like to see him smoking , either , it makes me uneasy somehow , because i know it ’ s not good for him and makes him melancholy
1	and now everyone was standing stiffly beside our table : hans castorp and the two opponents , and facing them ferge and wehsal
1	have you measured your temperature ?
1	it was pure , unadulterated religious egoism
1	people stared in bewilderment at the face of this charming specter , who seemed to see them and yet did not , who was not at all affected by their gaze , and whose laughter and waves were not meant for the present , but belonged to the then and there of home—it would have been pointless to respond
1	i should not , by the way , have let myself be so aggrieved by all kinds of irregularities in how he expressed himself , since to some extent , just as he had always liked to do when writing , he used a kind of antiquated german , which , given its defects and incomplete sentences , had always had something dubious and careless about it-and indeed , how long has it been since our tongue outgrew its barbaric stage and has to some extent obeyed both grammatical and orthographical rules
1	she crossed the cool , flagstone-paved hallway , which was decorated with reliefs in the style of thorvaldsen and from which a door led to offices on the right ; she rang the vestibule door , which could be opened from the kitchen simply by pressing a little rubber ball , and as she stood admiring the roomy entrance hall , where the tiburtiuses ’ bear now stood at the foot of the main staircase , she was informed by anton the butler that the senator was still at work
1	i ’ ll just go sit back there on those stones
1	anything you ’ d like , consul buddenbrook—crabs , shrimp , all kinds of cold cuts , cheeses , smoked eel , smoked salmon , smoked sturgeon
1	hans castorp himself had felt a dry flush , day in , day out , without having a fever—at least as far as he could judge without a thermometer
1	you lost your sense of poetry , although you were brave to love and marry against your father ’ s wishes
1	these were books on anatomy , physiology , and biology , written in various languages—german , french , and english—and sent him one day by the local bookdealer ; evidently he had ordered them , on his own and without a word to anyone , while taking a walk down in platz alone
1	they responded to his greetings with poignant courtesy and warmth , addressing him as herr lieutenant
1	in her panic , frau stöhr was not ashamed of breaking into prayer
1	at the start ; and at first that is what they were
1	but gerda and thomas had already agreed on a trip across northern italy to florence
1	he was very depressed , and even his blasphemies had no real joy in them
1	i remember as if it were yesterday
1	classicism-yes ; nothing sophisticated about any of it , but it is great
1	and no harm meant !
1	they spoke of his splendid house in the hague and his villa in scheveningen
1	he had arrived on a tuesday and so it was his fifth day , an almost springlike day after the bizarre turn in the weather that had thrown them back into winter—mild , yet fresh , with tidy clouds in a bright blue sky and a sun shining gently on the slopes and valley , which now had returned to their proper summer green , because the recent snowfall had been doomed to melt quickly
1	in paris , the road to fame leads through notoriety
1	i heard that you were in here , he said gruffly
1	it was a little after nine-thirty when she left her room
1	i can ’ t tell you what satisfaction it gives me to see that they ’ ve finally begun work on the gas lanterns and are getting rid of those ghastly oil lamps hanging from chains
1	the only person who gets upset and angry …
1	where comparison was lacking , he said , any standard of measurement was lacking , and one could not speak even of heavy or light , of large or small
1	what kind of gloomy talk is that ?
1	but as your fellow resident , i now take my leave of you
1	autumn came , and the old gray walls collapsed into heaps of rubbish
1	someone at the harmony told me about a remark you made yesterday evening at the club—a remark so out of place , so indescribably tactless that i can not find words for it
1	he beheld the image of life , its voluptuous limbs , its flesh-borne beauty
1	there was bishop ’ s punch in undrinkable quantities , and sesame ’ s plain gingerbread cake was terribly tasty
1	and , given these circumstances , turned to the lord of heaven , begging him to protect the life of his dearest sister in the meantime
1	as he passed , various people noticed that tears would suddenly well up in his eyes and that his lips were set tight , but in an odd , cautious , skewed sort of way
1	and herr pfühl declared himself willing to give hanno lessons
1	inez negotiated it all much more easily , for the simple reason that she was passionately in love-and he was all the more prepared to call it that , because her love was based on her false imaginings
1	far be it from me to deny the seriousness of art ; but when things get serious one scorns art and is no longer capable of it
1	his suit was still an indeterminate color , with a button missing here and there , and the seat of his pants consisted of a large patch
1	the city , that ghastly scene in the landscape room , her parents ’ and pastor kölling ’ s reprimands—that all lay far behind her
1	he is a true patriot , as you know , a democratic patriot
1	with the exception of pianos , which adrian 's foster-father left to the industry specializing in them , there lay spread out before one everything that chimes and sings , that twangs , brays , rumbles , rattles , and booms-even the keyboard instruments were always represented , too , by a celesta with its charming bell-like tones
1	he dreamed that he saw director behrens wandering along the paths of the garden , his knees slightly bent , his arms hanging stiffly at an angle in front of him , matching his slow and yet somehow bleak strides to the rhythm of march music in the distance
1	well , then , at least give me a papyrosa , my lost young man , she said , sitting down opposite him next to the stove , on a bench cushioned with a linen pillow
1	to spurn , to forgo , to disparage-that was not incompetence or ignorance , not proof of intellectual poverty
1	well , say what y ’ want , hagenström ’ s a lot richer
1	everyone in the dining hall looked up
1	but it really belongs more to astrology
1	how could it have been otherwise ?
1	so you don ’ t notice the difference in height that much
1	a clever artifice , as if pilfered from your opera
1	and so , in short , i shall marry again
1	the realm of the subconscious , the occult realm in the etymological sense of the word , very quickly turns out to be occult in the narrower sense as well and forms one of the sources for phenomena that emerge from it and to which we apply that same makeshift term
1	and speak of my opera , too , no less
1	everyone laughs and stands on tiptoe to see who the wag is
1	they were drinking their mocha now , served in little earthen-brown jugs , and some had liqueurs as well—frau stöhr for example , who simply loved to sip sweet spirits
1	and then aghast at his own social blunder , at the drunken dreaminess of his words , he assured them that was not what he had meant to say
1	time is a gift of the gods to humankind , that we may use it—use it , my good engineer , in the service of human progress
1	it was josephus , who was sitting at the back of his shiny cage , head tilted , staring at him with little , nasty , spiteful eyes
1	upon admission and after her first checkup , she had been considered only a mild case ; but whether she had not been conscientious in her rest cure , whether this was a case in which the air at first was not just good for fighting off illness , but for illness , or whether the young lady had become involved in intrigues or excitements that had not done her any good—in any case , four weeks after her arrival , she entered the dining hall upon returning from a new checkup , tossed her purse in the air , and cried in a clear voice , hurrah , i have to stay a whole year !
1	the salon on the other side of the hallway on the ground floor has new yellow blinds and looks very elegant
1	dynamics , hans castorp finished the sentence for him
1	in this case , the door was divided into little glass panes , which only heightened the shock : it was a bang and a rattle
1	he was , after all , quite unaware that there was such a thing as immoralism , and one can not very well say someone is right if he has no understanding of the counterthesis-at least not before one has explained it to him
1	except , the end is ours , in the end he is ours , that demands agreement , and not merely of the silent sort , however silent things may else proceed , but from man to man and expressly
1	he was a very fine man
1	the corridor floor with its coconut runners undulated gently under his feet , but he found it was not all that unpleasant a sensation
1	or less the first words adrian spoke to me when we met again concerned this almost perfectly flawless copy and what joy it gave him
1	there the body stood , leaning charmingly , turning to smile at him , its radiant elbows spread wide in the dual symmetry of its limbs , of its corporeality
1	yes , that ’ s how it looked to them , he knew it
1	it ’ s really absurd—if you were at home , you would send for heidekind
1	but it ’ s a bit of vanity that gotthold should have respected
1	the first , his neighbor on the left , was a k ferge , the good-natured martyr from saint petersburg , from under whose bushy reddish-brown moustache came anecdotes about the manufacture of galoshes and tales of distant regions , the arctic circle , and the perpetual winter at north cape
1	for to her knowing , melancholy eyes , did not rudolf represent the dearness of life itself ?
1	actually i had only one : why in fact , if adrian wished to let marie know that he was interested in seeing her , did he not approach her directly , call her up , even travel to munich , pay the ladies a visit , present his suggestion to them ?
1	at the same time he opened his mouth as if to sing , but from between his lips there emerged only a wail that still rings in my ears
1	who are those people ’ ?
1	it was impossible for the effect hanno ’ s playing had had on him to be transferred to his audience
1	he was certainly a whole man , though in manikin form , and through him inez learned about desire-a luckless desire , on whose meager soil her passion could grow wild
1	where did you get that idea ?
1	the gentlemen will just have to make do with me
1	you have come to an agreement with my stepsister and her husband in frankfurt , and i have no intention of interfering in the matter
1	hans castorp , however , was not wearing seven fur coats but only a woolen vest , which would normally have been quite enough for him—he even found it annoying at the first hint of sunshine
1	do you follow me , my good engineer ?
1	hans castorp drank thirstily from the tall pint glass
1	fine , hubmeyer , deutschlin said , what you say is all quite correct , and in any case i will grant you that your critique has brought us closer to the problem
1	although i don ’ t suppose there ’ s any reason i ’ d ever need to know it
1	a great uneasiness came over him , a need for movement , space , and light
1	a neutral middle point
1	the confusion of the move would not be pleasant , but she was enthralled with the prospect of a large music room with good acoustics
1	that was a logical suggestion
1	settembrini begged for moderation here , although his voice was filled with passion , because he found it intolerable that herr naphta kept talking about the bourgeoisiosity of life in such a—god only knew why—disdainful , aristocratic tone , as if the opposite—and everyone knew what the opposite of life was—was somehow more noble
1	what had monday meant then ?
1	you think it necessary , then ?
1	there was reason enough for him to turn pale
1	after all the awful things i ’ ve had to experience in life
1	the others did not respond
1	but i simply can not bring myself to reject grünlich out of hand
1	and his wife could not resist extending their guest her hand , her gold bracelet tinkling as she turned the palm upward as far as possible to heighten the gesture ’ s warmth
1	there was something even more feverish now about the way madame buddenbrook ’ s hand kept moving in a gesture peculiarly her own , from one corner of her mouth up to her coiffure , as if she were tucking back a stray hair
1	of course he fully intended to get up at half past five and do his most pressing homework
1	she did not look at him , did not change her stiff upright position , did not stop her knitting—on the contrary , there was a marked increase in the speed at which the needles whirred in her hands
1	she suddenly cried and sank back onto her pillows
1	he felt an enervating urge to remain there in his mother ’ s arms , at her breast , where the gentle scent of perfume lingered on the soft silk of her dress , to close his eyes and never to have to see or say anything more
1	when the dwarf reported that his baggage was strapped to the carriage , he hastily jumped to his feet to bid farewell to his tablemates
1	do you imagine this will stop your father—old as he is ?
1	he stood there and watched her smile and talk , just as pribislav hippe had smiled and talked in the schoolyard years before , her mouth open rather wide and her slanting gray-green eyes above her strong cheekbones narrowing to little slits
1	my friend , that is asia
1	by no means , tony
1	grabow had managed it all quite casually , almost without his noticing
1	it may well have been , by the way , that all these natives of the deep regarded the beaconed guest that had descended to them as an oversize subspecies of themselves , for most of them could do what it could do-that is , shed light all on their own
1	but she is a child , bethsy ; she enjoys her fun , dancing at balls , being courted by young men , relishes it all , because she knows she ’ s pretty and comes from a good family
1	dressed in shimmering silk , which was all the rage , tony was sitting on the sofa beside her mother , who was wearing a gown of heavy gray ribbed silk , trimmed with black lace
1	everyone should be treated equally as a child of the state , and just as there are no longer any middlemen between the layman and his god , so each citizen should stand in direct relation to the state
1	how does he like it in wismar ?
1	no , he had not actually settled in yet , neither in terms of his intimacy with life here in all its peculiarities—an intimacy it would be impossible to gain in so few days , or as he told himself ( and admitted quite candidly to joachim ) , in three weeks , sad to say—nor as regarded the adaptation of his organism to the very peculiar atmospheric conditions found among the people up here , because it seemed to him that his physical adjustment was proceeding only painfully , very painfully , if indeed at all
1	jonathan leverkiihn did not send his children to the village common school
1	at the same time he is overcome by physical lassitude , which affects not only his muscles and tendons , but also the function of all internal organs , and most especially the stomach , which rebels and refuses to accept any food
1	it has been pronounced by director behrens , in that special cheerful way of his
1	herr permaneder did not just stand there
1	for a good two and a half weeks a splendid sky reigned above mountains and valley , each new day outdoing the last for sheer blue purity ; and the sun burned with such intensity that everyone found good reason to dig out his or her lightest summer clothes , the cast-aside muslin dresses and linen trousers ; and even the large white canvas sunshade , which had no handle but was ingeniously fixed with a peg and several holes to the arm of the lounge chair , offered only inadequate protection from the midday glare
1	i don ’ t know whether it was mine or yours
1	we ’ re here for a christenin ’ , and you ’ re already at the rottin ’
1	and the senator slipped a coin into the hand holding the brush , then strode across the entrance hall and through the reception room opening off it
1	hans castorp had not seen it happen , but then he saw it
1	did not let it bother me that a familiar difficulty was augmented a bit by the terror outside
1	and on the wound the serpent
1	darkest night reigned—the curtains at the high windows had been pulled tight
1	he ’ s a regular fountain of information
1	her hatred of this particular upstart family was nursed by the mere thought that the hagenströms might now feel justified in thinking they could look down on her , but no less by the family ’ s flourishing prosperity
1	shadows now reached halfway up it ; but the upper portion was bathed in softest pink
1	in the second cellar , on the right , the second bin , behind the red bordeaux , two bottles , you hear ?
1	so it may well be that it runs in the family a little—behrens at least dropped a hint to that effect
1	this more or less occupied the time until frau grünlich appeared
1	madame buddenbrook gazed at her lap and smiled a half-embarrassed smile full of memories
1	i think i shall stay , gerda said and sank with a sigh of relief into an easy chair beside one of the beds
1	i : if you could but keep silence , you jackanapes
1	no , you can count on me
1	well , i can ’ t speak as to the hat
1	he had been there only a half hour before to give an injection of camphor , had just missed the moment of swift passing
1	it was an excursion just like this
1	on the other hand : you simply give frankfurt , , which means the firm comes out , to the good
1	a preference for indeed was also evident , in phrases like it was pretty indeed , and other such oddities
1	lower your voice , kesselmeyer
1	you ’ re impressed , aren ’ t you ?
1	hans castorp was listening to this narrative with edgy bemusement
1	and indeed mercury had stretched himself , very robustly
1	from the standpoint of beauty , institoris said , will was not to be praised , but only talent and it alone was to be pronounced meritorious
1	what is it i should know , my dear wenzel ?
1	i can well believe that he knows your body not merely as a doctor , but also as an initiate in another humanistic discipline
1	his dream was already beginning to fade
1	upon their return , rudolf enjoyed the prerogative that until then had been exclusively mine because of a shared childhood-he and adrian addressed each other by the familiar you
1	and as for dr salzmann , he claimed that professor kafka did not keep his syringes sterile and infected his patients with other diseases
1	that accorded with my own feelings
1	and correcting himself , he added , to be with my regiment inside of three weeks
1	were it not better for one to learn all that-suspension , passing tones , modulation , preparations , and resolutions-in praxi , from hearing , from experience and self-discovery , rather than from some book ?
1	ultimately there is only one problem in the world , and its name is : how does one break through ?
1	after an initial c , it takes on a c-sharp before the d , so that it now no longer scans as
1	herr modersohn was supposed to demonstrate his teaching style , present a model lesson , and show what his sophomores had learned in six or seven hours under his instruction
1	your settings of verlaine 's poems are the best proof of it
1	the decision has been made
1	but she kept her eyes lowered , directing them no higher than his chest ; and playing at the corners of her mouth was the mocking and totally merciless smile with which a young lady measures a man and finds him wanting
1	her upper lip—the same slightly protruding , arched upper lip that had always helped to make her face so pretty—was quivering now , and she was so overwrought that her eyes , although large with fear , kept blinking as they stared straight ahead , almost as if they , too , were in a hurry
1	but when one is deeply moved , one has the courage to say things that may sound crass and irreverent , but are more solemn than authorized words of piety
1	he calculated displacements—with full cargo and empty—stabilities , shifts in trim , and metacenters , though it was drudgery at times
1	right , you want to be something different every day , tom said
1	at first he had left tracks in the snow with his poles , planting them deep , but very soon he quite intentionally freed himself of their tutelage , because it reminded him of the man blowing his little horn and seemed inconsistent with his own innermost feelings for this vast winter wilderness
1	upon hearing what i had to say , herr grünlich became quite desperate , crying that he loved you so much and the pain of losing you would be so great that he was prepared to take his own life if you were to persist in your decision
1	thomas , who was destined from birth to be a merchant and the future owner of the firm , attended modern , scientific classes beneath the gothic arches of the old school
1	and he walked on , wearing those everlasting pastel checked trousers , leaving hans castorp behind , presumably cut to the quick by so much trenchant significance—and to some extent he was , although he was also vexed and amused by the notion that he was supposed to be
1	you may set your mind at ease—our procedures are quite aesthetic
1	what i am saying is : our level is that of civilized behavior-a very praiseworthy state , no doubt , but neither can there be any doubt that we would have to become much more barbaric to be capable of culture once again
1	to deny it would be a sin
1	we certainly have nothing to be ashamed of
1	halfway down the stairs , joachim stopped in his tracks when he saw hans castorp suddenly emerge from the consulting room where he had just been given his injection
1	as always , his hands were none too clean , but they were still narrow and exceptionally well formed , with long , slender fingers and tapering fingernails
1	i don ’ t see a wedding ring
1	what i have in mind is leverkiihn 's ( and since of course one ought not call it a preference for , then let us say ) extraordinarily frequent use of the sliding tone , at least in this work , in the apocalypse , whose images of terror certainly supply the most enticing and , at the same , legitimate reasons for employing this wild device
1	one needed only to say to this era i have ' a specific sense of life , and it immediately bowed deeply before it
1	the cross-bearer and the altar boy were stuck there at the door and couldn ’ t get in
1	in brief , everything as befits our family name
1	someone ran to get him , and he came : he broke into a rugged , pithy smile once he had the picture , his very presence demanding their cheerful trust
1	several trembling voices asked with foreboding
1	actually , only the surface of the little table and its immediate environs were illumined in soft red light
1	his face was all yellow , you say ?
1	why , they must have cost you a fortune
1	the pinions had deceived us
1	i don ’ t have an answer for them
1	ready arrived at the matter-a matter in which you would be doing me much good
1	i propose subdividing rows into segments that would be related to one another and yet compress and combine the tonal relationships
1	they talked about events in town : the recent flooding , which had spilled into a great many cellars and required people to use boats to get around in the low-lying streets ; a major fire in the sheds down by the harbor ; a senate election
1	and you , tom , have you worked up some rough figures ?
1	it has always struck me that way , although i ’ ve only noticed it just now , after the fact
1	i know he ’ s in the best of hands , she said , and departed for hamburg only eight days after she had arrived , since there was no serious need for her to offer special care , and besides , joachim had a relative for company
1	thomas , i need to speak with you at once
1	the first couples began to spin inside a little circle of spectators seated in chairs and on stools
1	one sunday evening in early july—senator buddenbrook had moved into his new home about four weeks before—frau permaneder paid her brother a call
1	moreover , leo ’ s restive mind and sophistry soon showed a rebellious streak ; he made the acquaintance of the son of a social-democratic member of the reichsrat , and following the lead of this hero of the masses , had directed his mind along political paths , turning his passion for logic to the field of social criticism
1	he found the first theme in the d minor concerto to be quite good , but was convinced that brahms never came close to finding one equal to it
1	settembrini says his merriment is forced , and settembrini has a critical eye , is a man who forms his own opinions , one must grant him that much
1	she was forty-one years old , but , having never set much store by external appearances , she dressed like a woman in her sixties
1	you and the bank are not the only ones
1	the prophecy of the end , entitled apocalipsis cum figuris , resounded fiercely and grandly at frankfurt am main in february , approximately a year after the terrible events i have had to report , and it may be due to the depressed state in which they left him that adrian could not bring himself to break through his customary reserve and attend the event , which despite a lot of angry shouts and insipid laughter , was a great sensation
1	very tasteful , i must say—pious and money-hungry
1	you couldn ’ t pop in just anywhere wearing a uniform
1	'neath the banner of a maiden 's shift marked by a wondrous cross
1	what may ensue and progress there will render you capable of quite other things , will pull down quite other obstacles and soar with you high above your lameness and hindrance
1	yes , it ’ s quite outrageous , wenzel
1	no one knows where jakob is at present , except his weak-willed mother , née oeverdieck , who is secretly selling off the family silver in order to send money to her disinherited son
1	hanno walked over to his desk , more or less in the middle of the room , shoved his satchel in the drawer , and sank down on the hard seat ; stretching his arms out over the slanted top , he laid his head down
1	his trained voice rang out clear , supple , and pious in the cool , hushed autumn air and drifted across the open grave and the mourners ’ heads , some bowed , some tilted wistfully to one side
1	they are people devoid of all manners , and although i am going to have to live next door to them for three weeks because there was no other way to arrange things , i do not wish to know them
1	it involves a great deal of insubordination within strict obedience , much self-reliance , much courage
1	here and there in the course of our discussion , you have made mention of human dignity
1	that juridical scoundrel , to whom she had given herself in a weak moment , blackmailed her with his one and only victory
1	whicknen or quicknen had once been just as common as quicken
1	everyone laughed at all this facetious erudition and looked now at hans castorp , who was also laughing and lifted his glass of vermouth to toast his virgil
1	he was blond , and his hair was kept trimmed close to his round head
1	indeed , one could not have been treated to music played more captivatingly , forcefully , instructively
1	but , you know , when you ’ re along , they ’ re not stones at all
1	permit me to say—but not one word more
1	he remained seated on his revolving stool , turned toward us , hands between his knees , in a position the same as ours , and with a few words concluded his lecture on the question of why beethoven had not written a third movement to opus i i i
1	moreover , since , despite our best desperate attempts , we can not imagine an end to time or a finite border around space , we have decided to think of them as eternal and infinite—in the apparent belief that even if we are not totally successful , this marks some improvement
1	i can not get well , that is settled
1	let us always hope for the best
1	herr grünlich cried , leaping to his feet
1	but tom wants me to
1	come here , my child , and look at this , madame buddenbrook said , opening the lid
1	i recognize today ’ s mood ; it is the same mood that reigns when the holidays of terra firma are religiously observed on those great arks—as reminders of a world outside , nostalgia as per calendar
1	hans castorp asked in response
1	herr settembrini ’ s voice sounded gentle , resigned , but it had a slight quiver in it as well
1	it ’ s much better than a scoundrel
1	but even if he laid it on a little thick , he was still low on the ladder , as it were , and so patience and reticence were certainly appropriate behavior
1	remarkably enough , the violin concerto was dedicated to him , but ultimately it had been the means by which the composer had first laid eyes on her
1	and there was one more reason , mynheer peeperkorn , hans castorp continued , one more reason why i wanted to make a clean breast of things—and that is that i know from personal experience how annoying uncertainty can be in this area , when one is at the mercy of surmises and guesses
1	and then he extended a hand to each relative and added a little nod
1	but , then , you don ’ t like to talk about such things , i can see it from your face—and it ’ s all over now , in any case
1	he pointed with his chin first to some free chairs he had spotted in the little salon , and then to a sheltered corner just to the right of the portieres
1	you need around six hundred fifty francs a month for room and board , and that ’ s with medical treatment included
1	in his bedroom , the hours for meals-adrian was not to take them with the family , that had not been expected , they took them too early for him , besides ; a place would be set just for him at half-past one and at eight , and the best spot , frau schweigestill suggested , would be the large room at the front ( the rustic drawing room with its winged victory and square piano ) , which was always at his disposal in any case
1	needless to say , entire lessons ( extended , of course , without a second thought ) were spent with kretzschmar playing it all for his pupil on the piano-losing himself ever deeper in details , moving from one thing to a thousand others , interjecting ( as we know from his
1	but did you see , joachim went on , and his joy at having fought the good fight rose visibly , making him catch his breath , did you see how he backed off and capitulated when he realized that i was serious ?
1	he was no longer an interval or hiatus , he was a patient ; he , too , was questioned , instead of being left lying there to his own devices , as he had been every day until now—much to his slight and secret annoyance
1	a man who has a gooey mixture of malt and hops in his veins instead of blood—yes , i truly believe he does
1	when gelatinous cells began to produce glutens in place of mucin , the fetal fluid solidified into fibrous connective tissue , to cartilage ; and he watched as calcium salts and fats were extracted from the surrounding liquid to form bone
1	a highly commendable institution , your hamburg
1	heavens , do you remember how we used to walk to school together ?
1	the sun shone in the buddenbrook house ; and down in the offices , business was excellent
1	the ceiling lamp went out , and only ruby light illuminated the scene
1	what a pretty thing it was , nonetheless , with its crook of a mouthpiece , its flashing mechanism of keys and levers
1	there was a long pause
1	it is not for us to judge , my child , the consul replied
1	personal , in his middle period than toward the end ; at that earlier stage he had been much more intent on letting all conventions , formulas , and flourishes ( of which music was full after all ) be consumed by personal expression , on fusing all that with the subjective dynamic
1	he once told me about dynamic drugs and poisonous asian trees , and it was so interesting it was almost eerie—interesting things are always a little eerie—and yet it was interesting not in and of itself , but actually only in connection with the effect of his personality
1	but what ’ s wrong with me—this doesn ’ t taste good , he said , looking at his cigar
1	in reality , he was simply allowing hans castorp to lose his train of thought completely , before he answered
1	a few hours of practice will limber up my wrist again
1	it was a hoarse , jittery sound , more a clatter than a ring , for it was old and battered from years of service
1	the cord of her pince-nez tucked behind her ear , she spoke with an affectation that was absolutely excruciating , and from up close , one had the impression of a woman whose reason had long suffered the tortures of boredom
1	if you bring me back just enough to say that she does not find the idea of sharing my life with me totally repulsive , something monstrous-then my hour will come , then i will speak with her and her aunt myself
1	for by its very nature , theology , once it is linked with the spirit of life philosophy , with irrationalism , runs the risk of becoming demonology
1	and you even spoke to us about carducci that first day
1	with the start of the next year , then , wendell kretzschmar left kaisersaschern to assume his new position , and so from that point on their correspondence passed between halle and leipzig : kretzschmar 's pages covered on just one side in scratches and splatters of large , stiff print ; and adrian 's messages written on rough , yellowish paper in his regular , slightly old-fashioned , and somewhat ornate handwriting , obviously executed with a round-hand pen
1	we insert that sort of thing into the mainstream of our lives as a kind of interruption or interlude , for the purpose of recreation , which is to say : a refreshing , revitalizing exercise of the organism , because it was in immediate danger of overindulging itself in the uninterrupted monotony of daily life , of languishing and growing indifferent
1	both of which you apparently fear
1	the critics remarked on a certain lack of unity in its style , indeed in its niveau of composition , and the audiences likewise responded with somewhat more reserve than in vienna , but nonetheless not only gave the performers lively ovations , but also , on both evenings , insisted on the appearance
1	then he introduced him to them
1	—no , that ’ s not what happened to him
1	for the next few days , he was in a splendid mood—there was freedom and a bounce in his step , kindness in his expression
1	was it written for me ?
1	he would carefully stroke his mustache with two fingers , compulsively rearrange his writing utensils and the glass of water that always stood on his desk , examine each issue from several sides , always with a wool-gathering look on his face ; and he also had the habit of crossing the courtyard to the scullery , five or six times a day during office hours—where he would hold his head under the tap to refresh himself
1	he knew what was what and made a point of my special relation to this fine art-the most christian of arts , he deems it-posited in the negative , to be sure , employed and developed by christendom , true , but repudiated and excluded as a demonic realm-and there you have it
1	he offered no reply whatever
1	but it was always one of the extremes , the sheen of pitch or the flash of blue between the lashes , that captivated him
1	as hans castorp learned from his cousin , this was one of a series of popular-scientific talks presented under the general title love as a force conducive to illness
1	the heat had increased and become even more oppressive ; but rain was no longer out of the question , because , to judge from the shadows drifting across the skylight , the skies were clouding over
1	this was typical of herr ballerstedt ’ s classroom method
1	won ’ t you be ashamed , too , when you stand up again ?
1	hans castorp could well imagine that was the case , without ever speaking to joachim
1	hans castorp had no sooner returned from his morning constitutional on friday than there was a knock at his door , and he was given the opportunity of making the acquaintance of fräulein von mylendonk , or head nurse mylendonk , as she was titled
1	having grown up in the atmosphere of a bellicose , triumphant , and rejuvenated fatherland , they had embraced the habits of crude virility
1	this was followed by a grieg sonata—salon music of a nordic nature , which met with polite applause , even from the costumed and uncostumed patients seated now , bottles in ice-buckets at their sides , at the two bridge tables that had been set up
1	in the mixture of revolution and conspiracy that naphta had served up to his hearers , herr settembrini responded , the obscurantist element had predominated in a most unsavory fashion
1	che cosa fai per l ’ amor di dio !
1	probably met him on the trip back from the pyrenees , i suppose
1	the letters exchanged during the period of preparation for and composition of the apocalyptic work were informed by the general european and solid musical education she had received in her native land , lending her words a quite objective backbone
1	and then it was the turn of another boy , who was poorly prepared and did not even know what patula jovis arbore , glandes meant , and buddenbrook was called upon to tell him
1	afflicted creature that i am , had lain in the dark all the day with tedious head ache , having often to retch and vomit , as comes with severe visitations , but toward evening came bettering , all unhoped and of a sudden
1	one felt as if he were avoiding saying anything definite
1	he does not stop and does not notice her
1	they hurried to get back to their coach , because the sky had clouded over and the first drops of rain were falling
1	have i hated life—this pure , fierce , and vital thing called life ?
1	the music died away
1	the people , of the german people enough , to bring about the new , the purified faith
1	in most energetic words , kant has demonstrated that this proof can not stand up against reason any better than its fellows
1	frau permaneder was wearing a fur-trimmed shawl and a long , narrow felt hat with a veil
1	and so they treated him with a respect tinged with venom
1	then he stood up and closed the keyboard
1	what a sight : joachim recklessly indulging in conversation with high-breasted marusya , a person with whom he had never exchanged a single word during the whole time they had sat at the same table and at the mention of whose name he had always lowered his eyes and assumed a stern , reasonable , honor-loving expression , though his face had turned blotchy and pale
1	oh , he could find no peace in that , either
1	the consul slammed the door behind him
1	robust and spare—at least that ’ s the impression i got from him this morning at breakfast
1	do you mean by your who am : how am i called ?
1	the pain was sometimes almost more than hanno could bear , and there were nights when he did not sleep at all , but lay in his bed crying , groaning softly , limp with a fever whose only cause was the pain itself
1	but this much is certain : rudolf , once driven into a corner , quite instinctively replied , what can i do ? -and obeyed the proud command
1	( i also remember verbatim this baroque turn of phrase in the letter )
1	his head buzzed with a gentle fever , and under the disquieting pressure of his upset stomach , his heartbeat was slow , strong , and irregular
1	just between us , by the way , hans castorp was relieved , in one regard at least , to see the bonds of the clique loosened somewhat , for he was having difficulty with the toast of brotherhood he had drunk with frau chauchat ’ s traveling companion
1	may your future be untarnished ,
1	'-is that still madding health , common madness , or are the meninges infected ?
1	oh , my case is a little more complicated , you see—it ’ s not that simple
1	what is your name ?
1	and so they left together
1	who knows what sort of cutthroat will get his clutches on poor herr von maiboom
1	but in fact , it all sounded most decidedly confused to hans castorp , though for reasons not quite apparent to him and despite herr settembrini ’ s having put it in clear and taut words
1	it was the unconditional curiosity of the tourist thirsty for knowledge ; a curiosity that , in having tasted the mystery of personality , had perhaps not been all that far from the realms emerging here ; a curiosity that displayed something of a military character by not trying to evade something forbidden if it might offer itself
1	he loves me , she said , and his love makes me proud and grateful and devoted to him
1	it was a purely ascetic exercise , a part of the discipline of penitence , a means of salvation
1	and suddenly he shrugged and said , ridiculous !
1	the return to monteverdi and the style of his era is precisely what i call€d the reconstruction of expression-of expression in its first and primal manifestation , the expression of lament
1	did you know that my great teacher once wrote a hymn to him ?
1	the hot liquid made one molar hurt terribly , the one that herr brecht had been working on
1	in one case he added with some liberties ,
1	we have them to thank that germany , france , and italy aren ’ t covered with primeval forests and swamps , but provide us with grain , fruit , and wine
1	the despot was dispatched by a knife , his mouth opened for a bellow that no one heard
1	what have i done to deserve such misfortune !
1	gradually , ineluctably , it had turned to the one dreadful theme that had been on everyone ’ s mind all evening , but about which they had all been silent until now , out of respect for the festivities—herr weinschenk ’ s trial
1	the consul gravely shook his head
1	yes , but his honored friend and patron had no need of such knowledge
1	naphta ’ s crude end , that terrorist deed committed by a caustically desperate antagonist , had been a terrible blow to his sensitive nature ; he had been unable to get over it , had been frail and subject to fainting spells ever since
1	for wolf , brahms was le dernier ennui
1	she lay propped up on her pillows , her head turned toward the door , and she searched the senator ’ s face with her pale blue eyes
1	so there i had it-and there kaisersaschern had it , too
1	everyone was waiting for someone else to say something
1	when thomas came across the hall , tea was steaming in dresden-china cups
1	i ’ ll take this one , he said , without giving the other so much as a glance
1	he is a man who unites reason with courage , but he ’ s a little indisposed this evening
1	funny , is not it , how for a long time music saw itself as a means of redemption , and all the while , like all art , it needed redemption , that is , needed to be redeemed from a solemn isolation that was the fruit of culture 's emoncipation , of the elevation of culture to ersatz religion-needed to be redeemed from being left alone with a cultured elite , known as the 'audience , which will soon no longer exist , which already no longer exists , so that art will soon be all alone , alone to fade away and die , unless , that is , it should find a way to the volk , or to put it un-romantically , to human beings ?
1	what sort of nonsense is that ?
1	may also to excess
1	and so by the time the assistant stepped back out onto the balcony , it was four o ’ clock—which meant late , late afternoon
1	then class was over
1	it ’ s just a stone ’ s throw to rostock , and no distance at all after that
1	but i don ’ t want to forget !
1	he said out loud , and tears came to his eyes even as he smiled
1	but that scoundrel of a director forbade me , threatened me with death
1	you are mistaken first in the assumption that intellectual matters can not become personal
1	may i offer you one ?
1	since culture has fallen off from the cult and has made a cult of itself , it is no longer anything but offal , and after a mere five hundred years all the world is so weary and surfeited , as if , salva venia , it were force-fed with iron cauldrons
1	a foolish extravagant spirit , full of forms , figures , shapes , objects , ideas , apprehensions , motions , revolutions
1	but since he was now prepared for it , he maintained his demeanor and afterward found he was quite satisfied with his behavior
1	the living tissue did not permit chemical analysis ; the very changes that brought about rigor mortis were enough to make all such experimentation futile
1	why , settembrini laughed his head off at the notion
1	well , their best wishes for herr rotbein
1	to speak-which is perhaps even truer of bad situations than happy ones
1	the pyramids are great , mont blanc and the interior of st peter 's are great-that is , if one prefers not to reserve that attribute for the moral and intellectual world , for the grandeur of the human heart and mind
1	as far as his own office staff goes , i don ’ t think that they are especially devoted to him
1	it showed hans lorenz castorp in his official dress as a town councillor—the sober , even godly attire of citizens from a vanished century , a costume that later citizens , whether staid or dashing , had carried with them through the years , continuing to wear it on pompous occasions in order ceremoniously to make the past present , and the present past , and to proclaim the permanent continuity of all things and the venerable trustworthiness of their official signatures
1	because to be a living entity was by definition to be built out of smaller , subordinate entities , or better , out of entities organized to serve the higher form of life
1	but hans castorp was preoccupied with something that looked like a sack , or maybe a deformed animal , visible behind the middle column , or mostly to the right of it from the viewer ’ s perspective
1	this was just too horrible for poor hans castorp ; in his dismay , he pressed his hand to his brow and simply forgot that he had a bite of pumpernickel and cheddar in his mouth , ready to be chewed and swallowed
1	he walked around like a man under enormous pressures , and i think one can understand what they were
1	but the other guests showed no discernible inclination to follow this example
1	they were all feverish , with accelerated metabolisms , the whole physical organism working at a faster , augmented pace—which may well have had something to do with the way they drove time like a herd before them
1	one does not understand it , as a cultivated person one simply accepts it with objective respect for the law of nature
1	as such he had to pass on to him childish beginner 's basics ; but , with strange incongruity and on the side , so to speak , he had at the same time brought adrian into first contact with the greatest things , opening for him the realm of world literature , awakening his curiosity with presentations that lured him into the vast expanses of the russian , english , and french novel , encouraging him to study the lyric poetry of shelley and keats , holderlin and novalis , giving him manzoni and goethe , schopenhauer and meister eckehart to read
1	instead of gradually he said a little and a little ; instead of i hope , it was i have good hope ; and he never said anything but holy writ when referring to the bible
1	and here he ’ s written a third
1	and if you respond to these injections at all , you will be in the pink of health within six weeks
1	they stood side by side on the platform , next to the miniature train , right in front of the little gray-upholstered compartment where
1	top hat in hand , he ran down the staircase on soft soles , and in a piercing whisper he called out across the entrance hall filled to overflowing with uniformed civil servants from the tax office and grain haulers in blouses , knee breeches , and top hats : the rooms are full , but there ’ s still a little space left along the corridor
1	at that moment—the carriage was rattling along breite strasse—matthiesen the grain hauler passed them and doffed his homely top hat with a deep sweep of his hand , and his gruff face was so full of respect it seemed to say , i swear i ’ m at the bottom of the ladder
1	what sort of science is that , which has such a precarious , coerced relationship with reason and is threatened with ruin by the very compromises it makes with it ?
1	he was pals with only one of them , had been from the very first day of school—and the bond held firm
1	now and then he would ask his cousin to tell him , but he , too , was not always certain about the matter
1	well , then—after having been buried for centuries , all these economic principles and standards have been resurrected in the modern movement of communism
1	dr krokowski called out his name again , this time in a stern voice of warning
1	herr wenzel—a small sturdy man with an intelligent face , a black mustache , and red hands—had shaved the consul that very morning , but here he was his equal
1	unfortunate , but true , my lads
1	over the years her looks had grown a bit more common , but her narrow black eyes and those malaysian cheekbones were still attractive , and it was quite apparent that she must have been extraordinarily pretty at one time
1	all these things were much too high for herr ferge , however , and wehsal proved less interested once the subject was no longer flogging or torture
1	its concern is the parochial cosmology of kaisersaschern , which leads to astrology , to observation of the positions of the planets , of their constellation and auspicious or ruinous forecasts-which is only natural and right , for what is patently clear is the intimate interdependence of bodies , their mutual neighborly bearing upon one another , within such a closely knit group in one little corncr of the cosmos , like our solar system
1	she has been taken from us and is with god now , and from her deathbed she wrote , in pencil , with a trembling hand
1	life was based on conditions and principles that belonged in part to epistemology and in part to ethics—the former being time , space , and causality ; the latter , morality and reason
1	i spent only the one winter yet , after his return from italy , apart from him ; at easter i i i obtained my position at the high school in freising-the catholic heritage of my family working to my advantage
1	she picked it up , started paging through , and soon found herself absorbed in reading
1	the primary symbol of alchemistic transmutation , naphta went on , was the crypt
1	herr settembrini thanked him for jogging his memory
1	settembrini pretended he was going to vomit
1	he wanted to begin anew , do things better , produce a kind of music more suited to the simplicity of their souls , music that would enable them when performing it to achieve their own , simple kind of perfection
1	thomas paced back and forth for a while , saying nothing , his hands in his pockets
1	in short , both in the city and in their secluded mountain town , the two lived the life of men who avoided the world and its people and were concerned solely with the claims of their work
1	hans castorp helped himself and smoked the unusually large , wide cigarette , imprinted with a golden sphinx—and it was indeed wonderful
1	there were moments when , as you played king , you saw the intimation of a dream of love rising up out of death and this carnal body
1	he broke off , and we three sat silent and shaken
1	well , hanno , come to snitch a little music ?
1	as a kind of comforting substitute , however , there had formed around her a little band of women , some of whom also attended the funeral , though more for her sake than in clarissa 's honor
1	he will arrange for the oral cavity to be cleansed frequently with moistened linen cloths ; as for medication , he will prescribe a mixture of iodine , iodide of potassium , quinine , and an antipyretic ; and above all , since the stomach and intestines are seriously affected , he will prescribe a light but very nourishing diet
1	no one else did so in the castello house on the street of stairs
1	and when he did awaken and was asked how he felt , he would always answer , though somewhat indistinctly , that he felt fine and happy—although he had hardly any pulse left and ultimately did not even notice the prick of the hypodermic
1	without doubt he was grateful to his teacher for a style of instruction that took into account that his student , given his general state of intellectual development , did not belong on the childish level of study at which his having taken up the piano so late put him
1	but in fact there existed music that did not reckon at all with ever being heard
1	he doubtlessly liked being extolled in front of marie , but his joy in the fact that the praise came
1	was he so quickly weary of communing with his creator and redeemer ?
1	oh , you don ’ t know anything , tom , tony sobbed
1	he thought briefly of his homework , too , and dismissed it with contempt
1	and even persuaded adrian , despite his being so ill that he was close to collapse , to play several longer sections from the manuscript for him there in the winged-victory room-and on the spot edelmann acquired the work for his edition
1	we can all only envy you for that—it ’ s very interesting information
1	i howled , let me tell you , howled like a mournful hound
1	thrilled by her touch—on both knees now , head thrown back , eyes closed—he went on , ah , love , you know
1	but , to judge by your comments , you want to remember mother by displaying a soup tureen on your dresser—that is how it looks , isn ’ t it ?
1	but one day , in this same pavilion , he sat in his little yellow cane rocking chair , and with growing interest he read for four hours from a book that had come his way more or less by chance
1	thomas shouted and pushed his way out the door
1	the dog at the farm in pfeiffering could grin as well , even though it was not called suso , but bore the name kaschperl , or at least had borne it originally
1	after summer vacation—even to think such a thing !
1	the malayan watched this little scene , rolling his brown animal eyes to one side until the whites showed
1	stay and be our place of rest this hour
1	no , joachim replied in composed surprise
1	of a blood clot , sir
1	he had barely begun to scan the newspapers laid out for him and to open his mail when there was a knock at the door leading to the front hallway—and the first well-wishers arrived
1	not that i can tell you how she manages it , she can ’ t explain it clearly herself
1	but gotthold thinks that as his stepmother i care only for my own children ’ s interests and am deliberately estranging his father from him
1	and if i don ’ t arrive just yet , it will be a good while before they even notice , you can be sure of that
1	hans castorp even showed a certain regard and consideration for joachim—not so much because he was an old-timer here and had served as his guide and cicerone in this world , but more particularly because there was no doubt that he was seriously ill but since this was how things were , it was only understandable if someone made as much of his case as possible , even exaggerated a little to be part of the aristocracy or at least get closer to it
1	they spoke in a jargon that was both slipshod and dashing and was replete with terms from technology
1	elisabeth had now stood up , and she walked toward him with her hands outstretched , her head tilted to one side
1	i have my vices , too
1	for there is one thing we must keep in mind : if philosophers and poets have finally put aside or dismissed some idea , some point of view , some principle , a king is sure to come along who has just discovered it , who believes it to be the latest and best idea , something he has to believe and act on
1	his pale eyes had faltered as those words spoken from the throes of lonely death crossed his ragged lips
1	i would often call upon that same name when the problematic nature of
1	sporadic nosebleeds occur , for no apparent reason
1	i ’ ve tried something along that line myself on occasion in the past , hans castorp declared
1	the thunderstorm burst behind him , hissing , crackling , popping—and fell quiet again
1	there is nothing in my book , dr mantelsack
1	the songs were meant to be sung , but lacked notes
1	he had been the first humanist and was identical with satana , whom carducci had apostrophized in his hymn
1	there could not be a moment ’ s doubt as to the nature of this noise
1	swollen from tears , received me at the gate and urgently suggested i go at once to adrian
1	when her eyes began to roll back , the physician passed his hand in a casual upward sweep in front of her face , declared everything perfectly in order , and sent the entire excited party off to evening rest cure—except for elly brand , with whom he said he wanted to chat a little
1	i beg you—a patient with your worthy mother ’ s relatively good powers of resistance
1	dressing with special care , the ladies were subject to little fits of laughter and temper , and their conversations were about encounters with knut in the garden , in the woods , or down in the resort
1	well … uncle justus is sure to come out on sundays and pay a visit to the roulette tables
1	have mercy , gentlemen , give me something so i can sleep
1	he could no longer lie still ; hans castorp heard him pacing his room four times a day , during those hours when the rest of the berghof assumed the horizontal position
1	true , i make no use of medical treatment , he said , but that ’ s my business
1	and all the while she pressed her face deeper into her mother ’ s lap , even clenched her fist against the chair
1	the letter b—it was the bs ’ turn
1	one brief hour until the start of school
1	but now , as he gazed into the piercing eye of approaching death , it was apparent that such a view fell away to nothing , was incapable of providing him even an hour of calm or anything like readiness for death
1	pastor wunderlich arrived , a portly old gentleman in a long , black coat
1	that shows how he allowed no one to get very close to him and how certain impassable limits were set to any intimacy with him
1	then he had set his alarm and fallen asleep—the deep , dead sleep of someone who never wants to wake up again
1	you ’ re a man without sympathy , love , or humility
1	the lab is behind schedule
1	the answers , accompanied by enchanting gestures , that he provided to questions about his mother , his trip , his stopover in the big city of munich , had , as noted , a decided swiss lilt , and a good many dialect words were wrapped in the silvery timbre of his voice : cot instead of
1	bending over the instrument , he spread his arms wide as if to embrace it and suddenly , as if pushed , fell sideways from his chair to the floor
1	that won ’ t work , dear little anna
1	but whoever shaped the harmony could hardly be called free
1	calm down , tom , she said
1	and if there was something uncanny about the enormity of the snowing , deadly silence—and as a child of civilization he most certainly felt there was—both his intellect and senses had long ago tasted of the uncanniness up here
1	her penchant for the whimsical and macabre amused the circle of gentlemen who paid her court
1	isn ’ t it grand , isn ’ t it good , that language has only one word for everything we associate with love—from utter sanctity to the most fleshly lust ?
1	bernard of clairvaux , for instance , taught about a ladder of perfection unlike anything herr lodovico has ever conceived in his wildest dreams
1	it was a fairy-tale world , childlike and funny
1	so be it , the broker responded in a flat voice
1	people fled before this tortured thinker , for whoever he managed to buttonhole was subjected to a passionate torrent of words intended to awaken a deeper sensitivity to the hopeless irrationality of this mystical ratio and to its shameful defilement of the human spirit
1	time , although the subjective experience of it may be weakened or even abrogated , is an objective reality to the extent that it is active and brings forth
1	hans castorp asked anew
1	he fetched his ocean steamships and his traveling blanket , a lovely plaid of dark reds and greens , and noticed that his room had been nicely tidied up
1	one day , in much the same mood , he stood leaning over the third-floor gallery , peering down into the bright , open stairwell , where everything was silent , and little johann came out of his room , down the steps of his balcony , and along the corridor , on his way to see ida jungmann about something
1	leaning back against it , he pulled his jacket tighter , shivered , and yawned
1	then h e abruptly turned away from me
1	and what is the status of rhythm in our most recent music ?
1	and your dear mother is enjoying life , i hope ?
1	perhaps it ’ s you whose nerves are all too short on the left side
1	those are my impressions from this morning
1	he had been sure yesterday that it would be his turn to be called on today in latin and chemistry , but was that really so certain ?
1	with such an awful headache that he asked his guest to share the proven comfort of darkness with him for at least a little while
1	but if herr marcus asked some honest laborer , catch my drift ? , it sounded so preposterous that his partner , who sat across the desk from him , would simply start laughing—a sign for the whole office to join in the mirth
1	a pity about the feast of roses , too
1	this habit was presumably a token of some physical distress , but also expressed an airy indifference , much as when someone dismisses-or tries to dismiss-a problem with a pooh !
1	he at least let his eyes pass over it all , since he was incapable of helping himself to any of it
1	he walked across into the salon with her
1	it would have been quite pointless to use another word from the freethinker 's vocabulary and to speak here of gloomy superstition
1	who has a wish at the ready ?
1	giornali and two games of billiards , a round of marsala , and the doughty fellows hauled the governo over the coals
1	slowly , slowly , and hiding his tears , little johann learned to miss the sea again , learned to be both afraid and unbearably bored , all the while keeping a lookout for the hagenströms and finding solace in kai , herr pfühl , and his music
1	not quite two-thirty , perhaps ; to be precise , it was more like a quarter past
1	our high and august principal commands the day and deems it not abduction to drive the people to their prayers
1	elly was in her deep trance , her face resting in her tightly held hands , and herr wenzel was about to change records or turn one over , when our friend began to say , with some determination , that he had a suggestion to make—insignificant , really , but then it might be useful , in his opinion
1	the question , the great question , could not be put off any longer
1	now , that ’ s something new , said someone he had not seen coming , just as he reached the corner of mühlen strasse
1	i would not want to hear a humanly inspired work of yours
1	a secret—insubstantial and omnipotent
1	there are three more rooms on the mezzanine , he explained , a breakfast room , my parents ’ bedroom , and another room , open to the garden , though it ’ s not used much
1	ask i g h t
1	there was an aura of nordic coolness about her , a glasslike chasteness , a virginal , childish quality that was quite attractive , as were both the full , pure look in her blue , childlike eyes and her pointed , refined way of speaking , in a slightly broken german with the typical mispronunciations of danes—like fleck for flesh
1	she first repeated , what does this mean , then slowly said , i believe that god made me , and quickly added , her face brightening , —and all creatures , and , suddenly finding the track smooth—she was unstoppable now and her face beamed with happiness—she rattled off the whole article , as prescribed by her catechism , newly revised and published under the auspices of an august and wise senate in this year of our lord ,
1	the convivial mood continued , more music followed , but nothing that demanded their particular attention ; people gathered with their drinks for dominoes and bridge , amused themselves with the optical gadgets , and stood chatting in little groups here and there
1	his opposition to jews was a cheerful obsession—this acquired hostility was the pride and content of his life
1	they let their voices sweep in unison to the blessed sustained note of the octave , secure in the belief that heaven was opening before them , that their longings were bathed in the light of eternity
1	and at the same time that christian is lying ill in hamburg
1	you can see that with my cousin here , who was supposed to be finished by the first of the month—finished in the sense of cured—but at his last checkup behrens said it would take another four months for him to heal completely
1	on , especially in summertime , he often spent weekends with him in pfeiffering
1	it is not for nothing that the place teems with mongolian muscovites—people like these
1	he no longer had any reason to fear the fluctuations of the market—his ship had arrived safely in harbor , even if with only a shilling or two
1	this was the first moribundus that hans castorp had ever seen in his life , inasmuch as both his parents and his grandfather had died behind his back , so to speak
1	could enjoy themselves splendidly , in their childish sort of way
1	no judgment , no will , no capacity to reject what was vile
1	his wife had been dead for years
1	it wasn ’ t that foolishness on the staircase at all
1	well , isn ’ t it cozy ?
1	there is not a trace of traditional forms
1	schwerdtfeger was happy to agree , and his only regret was that he did not have much time , since he would have to be back at the station for the six o'clock train if he was not to miss the concert
1	she should have told them she was not suited for such games , because everything was whispered to her
1	he shuddered , but he played
1	he said , turning now to hans castorp
1	my loss of fluids today was considerable
1	sleep must be counted among the—how did you put it , young man ? —among the classic gifts of life , among its first , its primal , i beg you , ladies and gentlemen , its highest gifts
1	do you know what ?
1	so it ’ s jist a matter of which of them three ’ s gon na git the most votes , that it ?
1	because if i stay behind up here alone—and that is what i ’ ll do if he leaves , it ’ s totally out of the question for me to go with him—then it will be—my heart ’ s standing absolutely still now—it will be for good and all , because i ’ ll never , ever find my way back to the flatlands alone
1	you take a bath , but that doesn ’ t help , your whole body feels sticky and grubby
1	placet experiri , hans castorp had the impudence to reply , and herr settembrini departed—and then , to be sure , once left to his own devices , the young man did not lay out his cards again , but sat for a long time at the table in his white room , his head propped in his hand , brooding , gripped by the horror of the eerie and skewed state in which he saw the world entrapped , by the fear of the grinning demon and monkey-god in whose crazed and unrestrained power he now found himself—and whose name was the great stupor
1	and now that a beginning had been made , he arranged an appointment that very day with sister alfreda to visit her patient , fritz rotbein , who like his nurse was terribly bored , even though , to judge by all the evidence , he had only a short time left
1	with a fanfare of trumpets and screechy clarinets the fortnightly sunday concert began , for which joachim had joined his cousin in his room , taking a seat out on the balcony to listen
1	she had raised one generation , and when they had outgrown her care , she had nursed and tended little johann , read him grimm ’ s fairy tales , and told him the story of her uncle who had died of the hiccups
1	he stood beside the middle row of desks , propping the palm of one hand on the first desktop and assuming his customary skewed stance
1	yes , well , he was bedridden for now , primarily because of the liquid diet he was on , which of course could not help affecting his energies
1	you do understand me , don ’ t you ?
1	joachim raised seven fingers
1	the suit was filed—tony ’ s second suit of divorce—and in the early phases she followed it with high seriousness , great eagerness , and considerable knowledge of the law
1	a man of splendid poses …
1	hmm , hmm , isn ’ t that a pretty twist , a nasty twist , a hard fact to contradict all ideals
1	she received the two doctors , however , with lively interest and warmth and conferred with them at length
1	but to avoid annoying either man , he did not say this , and watched , wrapped in reservations , as they went at it , spitefully helping one another to get lost in a thousand trivialities , all because settembrini had made a little joke about virgil the latin poet
1	i have a graphic way of speaking , is what you want to say
1	the familiar blend of languor and excitement—which was the constant condition of a berghof guest whose acclimatization consisted of his getting used to not getting used to things—had grown so strong in both component parts that it was no longer even a question of his taking prudent action against such attacks
1	i am speaking here of a more or less secret and interior immobility , which could be perceived only by a very careful observer
1	because his dreams and fantasies had twice taken a turn to bring him back to life : once in horror , the second time out of joy
1	it was obvious that papa had been busy with them this morning , after second breakfast , and had left them there to work on them later
1	he had thought of music as his foe—but was music really such a serious problem ?
1	you see , i am spreading my magic cloak
1	although there ’ s really no reason for you to be that way
1	it was long ago , we were taking a walk around the cattle trough , and the conversation was about music
1	a moment of your time , thomas
1	ah yes , our carnival festivities are over
1	he was in his fifteenth year when i discovered it
1	the music profession was represented not only by the opera singers , but also by ferdinand edschmidt , the conductor of the zapfenstosser orchestra
1	after tony had repeated several times her conviction that she would return home for a visit very soon and that her parents would not be long in making a trip to hamburg , either , she climbed blithely into the coach and let her mother carefully tuck the warm fur blanket around her
1	this was the manor house , the residence of kai ’ s father , count eberhard mölln
1	but it looks as if it ’ s not to be
1	herr brecht did as he was asked , and then responded , it would be perfectly fine with me , senator buddenbrook , if you came by any time tomorrow or the day after
1	doctor mantelsack said , staring at him with bulging , sapphire-blue eyes that sparkled behind his thick glasses
1	he returned home and was received with open arms by his family—not just uncles , but a mother and a wife
1	oh , go ahead and smoke
1	how long it has been since the undersigned was last permitted a glimpse of that most enchanting of faces
1	i salute reason , settembrini replied
1	and in that same gruff , reverberating voice he was now telling dubious anecdotes , spiced with dialect idioms
1	what do you do if a woman clings to you as if she were drowning and is determined to make you her lover ?
1	and i truly was
1	for i felt as if a relieved ah , yes !
1	he : ah , ah , sweet innocence !
1	the lobby lay in semidarkness
1	he ’ s just arrived from hamburg
1	all right—i ’ ll give you an answer
1	these people may have poured a great deal of water into wine that was once quite heady , but the concept of brotherhood is itself strong enough to tolerate a lot of water
1	when i wake up i look forward to being able to smoke all day , and when i eat , i look forward to it again , in fact i can honestly say that i actually only eat so that i can smoke , although that ’ s an exaggeration , of course
1	as you see , his chair is empty
1	julie , a girl with big bright black eyes and shoulders that she carried a little high , lived in the next villa , which was entirely overgrown with grapevines
1	a man of just barely average height strode between them in some haste ; he tipped his hat slightly and raised one pale eyebrow—the tips of his long mustache extended out beyond his pallid cheeks
1	you had me all confused this morning
1	after a while he took the thermometer out of his mouth , looked at it , and said , yes , when you pay close attention to it—time , i mean—it goes very slowly
1	at dinner herr arnoldsen gave one of his very witty toasts in honor of the two engaged couples , and later , as they drank coffee , he played the violin like a gypsy , with savage passion and dexterity
1	the head nurse asked now , trying to fix her eyes in a piercing stare—but did not succeed , since they began to wander
1	these , then , were adrian 's first guests in pfeiffering
1	will it stop before then , stop in time to keep me from passing on even more ?
1	the medium , dr krokowski noted , continuing an introduction evidently addressed in particular to hans castorp , no longer needed to be put into a trance by the attending physician
1	for example : as he is about to enter the dining hall , hans castorp realizes that the object of his dreams is behind him
1	do give me a timbre-poste
1	none of his trembling underlings knew how to behave in his presence
1	his fixation , though calamitous , resulted in his leaving that locale after his voluntary second visit the same man he was after his involuntary first one , but not without his having determined the address of the female who had touched him
1	melancholy hung like a cloud over them , because both were steadily losing vital products of metabolism—herr magnus , sugar ; frau magnus , protein
1	herr ferge said , and took the freedom of recalling the laughter that had burst from him as he had blacked out
1	but it had not been old castorp ’ s fault , god knows , that the modern spirit had enjoyed its celebrated , brilliant victories
1	i shall sit in my room with my daughter and my granddaughter , and i shall turn the key and forbid him to enter—i swear i shall
1	degrees , he was seriously ill but he led such a reckless life that he deserved to have his ears boxed
1	he says that he ’ s less healthy than i what ?
1	but his permutations would probably have prevented it as well , and to that extent his permutations and his moist spot go together , so to speak
1	if i understood correctly , he referred frequently to hell and to a most indelicate pain
1	right here on the spot , if you ’ d like
1	who knows still today , who knew even in classic times , what inspiration , what genuine , ancient , primal enthusiasm is , enthusiasm ne'er sicklied o'er with criticism , lame prudence , and the deadly reins of reason-what holy rapture is ?
1	it was madame chauchat , he realized with something like indignation
1	yes , for you and your wines , köppen !
1	my sentence , my final sentence has been spoken—and it is life
1	the simple fact that they do fight , naphta retorted , remains an obvious characteristic of the profession , on that much we can agree
1	it was thursday , the day on which the family regularly gathered every other week ; but today , along with relatives who lived in the city , a few good friends of the family had been invited to share a simple dinner , and so they sat in the waning light of evening—the clock was approaching four—awaiting their guests
1	but wait , hans castorp said , holding up a forefinger next to one bloodshot eye
1	a belief in absolute values , however illusionary , remains for me a prerequisite of life
1	gentlemen , with which of you might i discuss this matter ?
1	his had been an exceptionally dangerous pleural shock , a total collapse , an alarming swoon—in a word , so severe that the operation had to be broken off and postponed for now
1	aristotle shifted the reality of universal ideas to the individual
1	very simple and understandable , herr leverkiihn , i saw it right off
1	he frequently called frau schweigestill on the telephone to inquire about how he was doing and offered to pay a visit as soon as adrian could tolerate it as a welcome diversion
1	asked james , who was shivering despite the inch-thick fabric of his coat ; and if there was something both hurried and halting about the way he put his question , it was because his teeth were very close to chattering
1	it doesn ’ t matter to the bodies
1	at the same moment , however , christian opened the door and entered
1	i can recall as if it were yesterday leaving the lecture and walking home with adrian
1	can that ever be honorable ?
1	i ’ m on my way to see brecht
1	and so time passed—weeks , three or four probably , that at least is our guess , since we can not possibly depend on hans castorp ’ s judgment and ability to gauge such matters
1	which is why our venerable head nurse has taken charge of his supply and allows him only a small daily ration
1	so this was how things had been destined to turn out for hanno
1	the bare skin had obviously been painted with feeling , and despite a certain aura of sweetness , the artist had been able to endow it with scientific reality and lifelike accuracy
1	the necessity of saving her soul from eternal damnation , of snatching her from the claws of the devil by sacrificing her body , was perfectly obvious
1	with remarkable ease and clarity i can still recall today the picture of a gaunt french woman standing on a hill around which our battery was moving and beneath which a bombarded village still smoldered
1	it was ages now since he first began to practice here—on his own at first , quickly making a name for himself as both a specialist with a fine ear for auscultation and a surehanded lung surgeon
1	behrens knows how to deal with them , he can strike just the right tone for such cases
1	why shouldn ’ t he enjoy spending some time with our visitors ?
1	you ’ re not trying to tell me that it ’ s going to snow now ?
1	i do not see myself in a position to alter that
1	apparently he was concerned above all with the case 's progressing clearly through each of its distinctive stages
1	then i said that i wanted to visit our patient
1	i suppose that could apply as well to your sham game of bridge
1	can ’ t tell you where she picked him up , he declared
1	you should go there , senator , and sit on the beach for a while
1	someone lifted the glass bell from a soft swiss cheese and cut off a piece ; what was more , a bowl of fruit , both fresh and dried , stood in the middle of the table
1	i ’ m lying there with my face covered so i can ’ t see anything , and the assistant is holding me on the right and the head nurse on the left
1	but a hit , a hit indeed
1	it is the directness , the courage , and the depth of one 's personal life , the will and ability to experience and live out in its full vitality that natural and demonic element of existence of which kierkegaard has again made us aware
1	my conviction that the intellect can be certain that in doing what most disconcerts the crowd , in pursuing the most daring , unconventional advances and explorations , it will in some highly indirect fashion serve man-and in the long run , all men
1	settembrini was about to reply , when he was interrupted by the racket of loud laughter coming from the lobby
1	no , no , he said , you ’ re mistaken , my case is the most harmless imaginable
1	it fills a few hours up so nice and properly , i think
1	you are right , she replied , a delicate blush suffusing her face
1	it was italy on which he decided and for which he set out toward the end of june , just as summer had begun-an unusual time of year for a tourist
1	it isn ’ t your husband at all
1	he came down brämenbühl , following along the edge of the forest , and was in dorf by half past five ; he stored his equipment at the grocer ’ s , rested a bit in herr settembrini ’ s garret , and gave him a full report of how he had been overtaken by the snowstorm
1	do you remember , tony , he went on , slipping his arm under his sister ’ s and lowering his voice even more , when hanno was christened , how you said to me , it ’ s as if a whole new era is beginning ’ ?
1	a wave of misery swept over him—it seemed as if he had never felt this miserable in all his life
1	any change in these shameful conditions , to which custom and ignorance had rendered these people insensible-the indescribable filth of the village street , for instance , or the total lack of hygiene in their hovels-would surely have been a revolutionary act that no single person , least of all a woman , would dare undertake
1	slick as a whistle , even without a mirror
1	and what was a week , when you stopped to consider ?
1	it had been devoured by the resort spreading relentlessly toward the entrance to the valley , and that part of the settlement called davos-dorf merged imperceptibly , without transition , into what was called davos-platz
1	and there was that name—if only i knew what the name was that he called her
1	he shouted amid well-deserved laughter
1	and it happened that two friends , both musicians , came to visit him one afternoon , and no sooner had they entered the house than they heard shocking news
1	no , tom , it won ’ t turn out all right—i don ’ t believe that
1	they were very busy in there—you could hear the director ’ s voice giving orders
1	and with a sob of helpless rage , frau permaneder sank down onto an armchair that was covered in oilcloth and stood right next to her
1	after the death of her husband ( an earnest portrait of whom , dressed in official robes , likewise decorated the salon ) , with her circumstances sharply reduced and no longer permitting her to maintain quite the same position in her accustomed milieu , she had felt free to follow the wishes of an as yet barely tapped and presumably insatiable lust for life and had directed them toward an interesting postlude in warmer , more humane surroundings
1	she wept and shook her head
1	is the recording here ?
1	and so they came to an understanding ; and as chance would have it , upon their arrival at the sanatorium they ran into director behrens himself and took the opportunity to present their request on the spot
1	the atmosphere is so international
1	the consul remarked , turning from one to the other
1	the invisible person sang :
1	and then , in a fit of defiance , he gave himself another five—he just wanted to close his eyes a little
1	fine , simply longer , then
1	petersen translated , casting a glance now and then at the right-hand page in his book , which had nothing to do with the passage
1	and judging from that , it appears that under confusing conditions , man in his helplessness tends to experience time in a greatly diminished form rather than to overestimate it
1	custom myself to your impudence that you use the familiar pronoun and call me
1	the lady in front of him did turn her head as he sat down , studying him with her narrow eyes
1	he had no reply
1	give me the book , the professor repeated and stamped one foot
1	and they heard him say : ah , yes , yes , yes—agreed
1	he asked as they left the building
1	until behrens discharged him as cured—in earnest , not like today
1	she is hurrying through the rain without a hat , has barely managed to toss a shawl over her shoulders , stumbling more than walking , her coiffure in total dishevelment
1	she went down to the ground floor and demanded to see thomas in his private office
1	so there ’ ll be two of you tomorrow , right after you ’ ve put on the feed bag
1	standing right in front of her !
1	and you haven ’ t eaten at mine , my friend ?
1	perhaps it ’ s you who has to endure torments , indescribable torments , all over your body after every little distraction
1	with herr settembrini looking on and playing the critical expert , although he knew absolutely nothing about sports , hans castorp purchased a pair of spiffing skis in a specialty shop on the main street—good solid ash , shellacked a light brown , with first-rate leather straps and pointed tips turned up slightly ; he also bought poles with iron tips and snow rings , and could not be talked out of carrying it all on his shoulder to settembrini ’ s quarters , where he quickly came to an agreement with the grocer about storage for his equipment
1	on the whole he was more in the mood for laughter and foolishness than for metaphysical conversations
1	the longer , the less will you be able and willing to condescend to contritio , inasmuch as the extravagant existence that you will lead is a great pampering , from which willy-nilly one does not find a way back to wholesome mediocrity
1	and of all things—hans castorp didn ’ t know !
1	would l u d
1	your mother and i did , however , take a trip to hamburg in the middle of june to visit your sister tony
1	but since then , gentlemen , absolutely no other type of educator has ever emerged
1	but although the sound of the instruments , the confusion of voices , and the sight of all these people jangled on his nerves and merged with memories of the past and his father , calling up a faint wave of emotion , the predominant feeling was a sense that the whole affair was absurd and embarrassing—second-rate music distorted by bad acoustics , banal people engaging in banal conversation about stock prices and banquets
1	and that was what made one sad
1	clavdia raised her head this time as the young man approached the bed again
1	what joachim had said about his cheeks proved to be the absolute truth—they were purple , making his head look that much more colorful against his belted , white surgical smock , which fell just below the knees , revealing striped trousers and colossal feet in a pair of yellow , rather worn , laced boots
1	in this case it might have been a music box that he longed to see
1	the harmonies of the orchestra picked up the easy strains and bore them on—and it was simply ravishing the way the whole ensemble repeated it now in a sweeping tutti
1	at the appropriate time , the gong rang out
1	just recently , for example
1	as to his career at school , he did indeed have to repeat a class or two
1	i even saw one once—he had iron-gray whiskers and such a red face
1	adrian , however , presented the singular phenomenon of a poor student as head of the class
1	only one lady preferred to faint quietly
1	but i will not kill , you may be assured of that
1	because she ’ s definitely not named katyenka or ninotchka
1	but you should know that i don ’ t rank very high on the fever chart—which is to say , i had almost none , really , until recently
1	the director said , pressing him again
1	mesdames et messieurs , i hope you have enjoyed your meal
1	he could no longer control it
1	and then across from me sits a poor creature with graveyard blossoms on her cheeks , an old maid from transylvania , who goes on endlessly about her brother-in-law , a gentleman whom no one knows , nor wishes to know
1	there are quite enough solid though financially straitened firms in hamburg , or wherever , that could use a new flow of capital and would take you on as a partner
1	the human race had come out of darkness , fear , and hate , but now it was moving forward and upward along a shining road toward a final state of understanding , inner illumination , goodness , and happiness—and technology was the most useful vehicle for traveling that road
1	well , it was rather hard , clavdia , even for a man with detached passions—hard on me and hard-hearted of you to come back with him , because of course you knew from behrens that i was still here , waiting for you
1	then , while gerda was searching for some music , her violin under her arm , the most startling thing happened : herr pfühl , edmund pfühl , the organist of st mary ’ s , who had been playing a casual interlude , gradually drifted into a very strange style , while a kind of embarrassed joy lit his faraway gaze
1	don ’ t go too far , now , tony
1	no , we must sell , sell !
1	her hair was black , smooth , and freshly put up in a large-meshed net
1	settembrini sat off to one side for a while , but he also vanished , after first making a few graphic , taut comments about the local ’ s tedious bel canto and adding a satirical remark about how delightful it was that they were all so cozy and snug here together this evening
1	all the same , he could definitely see that he had a gentleman before him—the refined expression on the stranger ’ s face , his easy , even handsome pose left no doubt of that
1	there is much that we might say about dignity or the lack thereof , naphta replied
1	the fact is , as we know—permit me to say—fine !
1	likewise playing a role was his own spiritual need to take suffering and death seriously , to pay attention to them , a need he hoped would be nourished and satisfied by his getting closer to the seriously ill and dying , as a way of counteracting the numerous rebuffs such a need received daily , even hourly , wherever he turned—including some of settembrini ’ s insulting pronouncements , which only reinforced his own craving
1	life was hard , and business , as it took its ruthless , unsentimental course , was the epitome of life in general
1	my god , little schwerdtfeger !
1	it is a piercing pain that has something degrading about it , as does all pain , and is such a shock to the nervous system that it takes one ’ s breath away and can make a grown man weep bitter tears
1	a rather pointless story , really , now that i think of it
1	yes , it ’ s been known to happen
1	but , as was noted earlier , gerda buddenbrook had no sooner appeared in town than she was spotted by the gloomy broker , whose roving eye was ever on the lookout for something extraordinary
1	the honor of the scholastics will be vindicated in this regard as well , if i am not mistaken
1	and yet what befuddlement compelled him to make preparations of such monstrous significance ?
1	before separating , they stood for a while in the fenced-in area out front , forming their own little group , while a few patients loitering at the main entrance watched them as they talked
1	perhaps he can be no quicker , given his wretched means
1	surely you ’ re in error there , aren ’ t you ?
1	it was herr settembrini , who lived one floor up and just happened to drop by to keep these gentlemen company
1	first tell me what freedom is , he went on in normal tones
1	then he sat down again—and it was true , buddenbrook had laughed at kai ’ s joke , was seized by a fit of stifled , violent laughter that he could not control
1	all the same , schleppfuss said , this opened up the problem of the absolutely good and beautiful , of the good and beautiful with no
1	i am well aware that there are those who enjoy pointing to the apolitical origins of masonic thought
1	they lie with their faces in the mire and do not stir
1	it was certainly no enthusiastic portrait that he provided me ; on the contrary , his voice was low and casual , his expression impassive , his glance directed elsewhere in the room
1	he thought about kai and seeing him again , and about herr pfühl and his music lessons , about his grand piano and harmonium
1	so director behrens is also an expert on cigars , i see
1	the flesh-to retain the christian term-is normally repulsed by everything except itself
1	he was manifestly , indiscriminately in love with each and every female in sight—without respect of person
1	all alone and very busy , hans castorp sorted and arranged , surrendering a small number of the disks to the instrument , which awakened them to sonorous life
1	taking the upper end of tiirken strasse , i quickly reached ludwig strasse and followed that quite monumental highway ( to be sure , it has been paved with asphalt for years now ) on the left side , in the direction of the victory gate
1	as if at ease !
1	i previously noted of my own accord that there was a lively sense that the war had disrupted and destroyed what had seemed to be life 's fixed values-particularly in the defeated nations , which in that sense had something like an intellectual head start over the others
1	and hanno was thrilled , just as he was every year , and managed with only one or two almost involuntary , nervous sobs to say the lord ’ s prayer , and was permitted to reach into the sack for good children—which , as always , the old man once again forgot to take with him as he left
1	binding them all under his spell and calling them back to his service , he lowered the tip of his forefinger to the tip of his thumb and let the other long nails stand erect at one side
1	i certainly wasn ’ t thinking at the time of a moist spot , my intentions were quite different , more general , more philosophical
1	cheap construction , naturally , shamefully cheap !
1	oh , so you ’ re leaving us in the lurch , are you , edgar ?
1	but what did he do ?
1	it seems to me , however , that despite the logical , moral rigor music may appear to display , it belongs to a world of spirits , for whose absolute reliability in matters of human reason and dignity i would not exactly want to put my hand in the fire
1	time is active , by nature it is much like a verb , it both ripens and brings forth
1	i find it absolutely impossible to describe the tone of ardor and melancholy , but also of uneasy satisfaction that this mixing of the concepts of worth and desire took on when coming from her mouth , or to describe the way desire formed the essential element inside worth 's envelope of lovableness , which had to be taken away , ripped away , so that worth might be had all alone , utterly alone , alone in the ultimate sense of the word
1	for the sake of the family , they were required under all circumstances to preserve this life as long as possible , and a narcotic would have meant the immediate loss of all resistance , the surrender of life
1	and then the endmg goes : a puppy dog and no one else ,
1	half-drowned by the music , the talk would break off and start up again , its life sustained artificially
1	from i r s t
1	as infatuated as you undeniably are , you must surely know her first name
1	you only have to just touch the blade , and it goes right into the flesh as if it were butter
1	her tears had stopped , and compassion and pity welled up within her
1	( the contract arrived the very next day from the hotel bayerischer hof in munich )
1	and she ’ s the second maid already
1	and recently , if the gentlemen could believe it , when she returned from having gone out for just a moment , merely to purchase some tooth powder , she found her patient sitting up in bed , with a glass of dark , heavy beer , a salami , a piece of coarse rye bread , and a pickle , all spread out before him
1	he pulled the thermometer from his mouth , more violently than he had ever done before , except for that first time , the day the head nurse had sold him this dainty gadget , and he gazed down at it with the same eagerness as he had then
1	rudiger of the same-colored eyes did not in the least share my apprehension-which i kept very much to myself , by the way , and which did not prevent my joining sincerely in these merry moods whenever they happened to occur
1	i had a long talk with herr grünlich yesterday morning—he is indeed a most insistent suitor—and i saw his books , he spread them out for me himself
1	and now in point of fact it was i who shouted and in my outrage forbade such talk
1	naphta , who had taken his tea here , had ordered wine and cake , apparently a reminiscence of his student days ; joachim frequently moistened his sore throat with real lemonade , which he drank very strong and sour , for its astringent , soothing effect ; and settembrini was enjoying simple sugared water , but drank it through a straw in a very charming , appetizing way , as if sipping the most costly of beverages
1	granted , his punctuality in such matters left much to be desired
1	and his assurances did turn out , for the most part , as predicted
1	he let go and walked on
1	but was he over it now ?
1	this bestial sinner first abase ,
1	she was resting against her silk pillows , an elbow on one knee , her chin in her hand , her head sunk low—but she let her eyes drift up , dreamily scanning the room
1	good god , well , gentlemen ?
1	yes , his spirit , his zealous theory violated life itself , and whoever wanted to destroy passions wanted nothingness , pure nothingness—pure indeed , since pure was the only attribute that could still be attached to nothingness
1	but , feeling guilty , he immediately corrected himself : i certainly would not force you to do so , my dear tony
1	the regular schedule , with its weekly and fortnightly deviations , took its course
1	praeterit figura huius mundi , he said to himself in a latin that was not humanist in spirit , but a phrase he had picked up from naphta
1	hans castorp turned away to watch the preparations for taking joachim ’ s interior portrait
1	herr permaneder refrained from any comment that might have confirmed an imminent departure and instead devoted himself to the vast array of delicacies on the table—certainly not the daily fare below the danube
1	in the winged-victory room , rosa schneidewein was served coffee , the lad milk and cake
1	i have more serious things to think about than your ailments
1	music drama had taken its stuff from romantic sagas , from the world of medieval myth , and had insinuated that only such subjects were worthy of music , compatible
1	good afternoon , he said
1	but the thing was , as he told joachim one day , you began with annoyance and distaste , and suddenly something quite different comes up that has nothing whatever to do with forming opinions and then it was all over with such rigor—and suddenly you were no longer receptive to pedagogic influences of the republican and eloquent sort
1	and now as he dreamed on , it seemed to him that he was in the same schoolyard where he had spent his recesses for so many years , and he was just about to borrow a drawing pencil from madame chauchat , who also happened to be present
1	rotbein whispered all this in a very businesslike voice , viewing even the operation itself as a matter of business—as long as he lived he would regard things from that point of view
1	but although he had a fever that sunday and was feeling very weak , he insisted , in spite of his doctor 's warnings , on attending his landlord 's funeral service , which was held in the village church at pfeiffering and drew a crowd of people from all over the district
1	by which i mean that it ’ s all too new yet
1	i really can ’ t imagine it
1	but it had just come to him , insinuating itself all on its own
1	it was indeed rather odd to hear a lecture about love , since the lectures he usually attended were about things like gear transmissions in ships
1	i do not quite understand , my dear fellow
1	his morbid fantasies and fixations had grown worse , and more frequent , and at the urging of his wife and a physician he had entered a sanatorium
1	the senator donned his mackintosh and galoshes and took long walks with gosch the broker ; christian sat in the pastry shop with the girl who tended the counter and served him brandy smashes
1	that ’ s an open question
1	frau chauchat and the five gentlemen clustered behind mynheer peeperkorn , and together they all stared at the surging waters
1	hans castorp looked up through his tears
1	sitting up straight , thrown back against the cabriolet ’ s hard cushions , they crossed the brook and then the narrow tracks , following the street running alongside them and faced by an irregular pattern of buildings , and halted now on the gravel apron in front of the dorf railroad station , which was not much more than a shed
1	but in that stretched and bent position and still holding the napkin by one corner , she scowls , evidently annoyed at her unreasonable little burst of panic , for which she apparently blames him
1	he also showed me a letter that the man had written while still engaged in his punctilious task and in which he disclosed , in a most intelligent fashion , a kind of worried enthusiasm for the object of his painful endeavor
1	i even find it quite appropriate for us to gather together beforehand , in silent prayer , as it were
1	and so ever forth , that i engaged in villainous rivalry with the goodness on high as to which were more inexhaustible , it or my speculating-there you see that i am damned , and there is no mercy for me , because i destroy any such aforehand through speculation
1	silver-white , rounded clouds drifted in the deep blue sky above the delicate symmetry of the garden
1	the things that hanno and kai talked about were strangely out of place here , but were drowned out in the babble of voices that filled the cold , damp air
1	dr mantelsack prompted him , prompted him a second time in a sharper tone ; the third time he was downright indignant ; and when mumme got stuck for good , the professor erupted in fierce anger
1	but he did explore all the feelings that intoxication and passion can explore once they catch a glimpse of themselves in the world outside , feelings that are the strangest mixture of disgust and shared emotions
1	lebrecht kröger , the cavalier à la mode , had joined his fathers
1	he nodded again when hans castorp finished his critical remarks for now and fell silent
1	how long , to set joachim aside for now , had frau chauchat not been present ?
1	heard had so totally excluded
1	alarmed , i went to him
1	there must be an end to it
1	he eased off the bellows , pulled his hands from the manuals , and laughed with a blush
1	you need to get involved in the matter yourself , herr buddenbrook
1	his thoughts were few ; he merely looked back steadily , with a gentle shake of his head , at his life and at life in general , which suddenly seemed so distant and strange—all that unnecessary , noisy hustle and bustle , in whose midst he had stood , and which now was imperceptibly drawing away from him , a distant echo to which he turned an amazed ear
1	in its very boundlessness , dr krokowski ’ s theme recalled an enterprise to which settembrini was devoting his labor , the encyclopedia of suffering ; and like that project , it proved equally rich in its applications—as witnessed by the lecturer ’ s recent digression into botany , or more precisely , fungi
1	he ’ s certainly different from your pastors
1	thus one finds the deeply drawn sigh at such words as , ah , faustus , thou desperate and unworthy heart , ah , ah , reason , mischief , presumption , and free will
1	but permaneder ’ s not like that , you see
1	you ’ re here so late ?
1	there ’ ll just be a quick downpour—not even a strong wind
1	herr grünlich went on blinking with increasing suspicion
1	but when he saw the calm , uncomprehending smile with which his nephew responded to his jokes , the way it perfectly mirrored this whole community ’ s intact self-assurance , he took alarm ; and fearing the loss of his business energies , he quickly concluded that he would have that decisive conversation with the director about his nephew at once—that very afternoon if at all possible—while he still had a spirit of his own and energies from the world below with which to attack , for he could feel those energies vanishing and the spirit of the place joining forces with his own good breeding in a dangerous alliance against them
1	what are we up to here ? -but even as i put on such airs , i found myself utterly ridiculous ; and the thing was that he noticed as much , obviously shared the feeling flooding through me , and in his embarrassment for me lowered his little head and pulled down the corners of his mouth like someone trying to suppress a laugh , which so completely undid me that for a long while i said absolutely nothing more
1	indeed it seemed to me that everything he had said bore the stamp of pain , stood under its sign , however brilliant and worthy of consideration it might be
1	they moved along the flagstone-paved hallway toward the rear , passing the kitchen on their right , went through a glass door , and stepped down two steps into the pretty and fragrant flower garden
1	her cheeks were flushed , she kept up a constant flow of chatter—in russian , presumably—while someone tucked a fur blanket around her legs
1	and according to one branch of science , whose notions of reality were equally unflattering and lurid , the embryo ’ s development seemed to be a hasty recapitulation of zoological genealogy
1	maitre , he said , i understand perfectly how attached you must be to the stylish seclusion of the place you have chosen to reside-oh , i have seen it all , the hill , the pond , the village with its little church , et puis , cette maison pleine de dignite avec son htesse maternelle et vigoureuse
1	but although he carried on most dreadfully—slowly , inch by inch , she won him over by practice and persuasion
1	i ’ m sure you have no objection
1	thomas buddenbrook had joined stephan kistenmaker , senator gieseke , and voigt the architect at the back of the stairwell , between the door opening onto the smoking room and the flight of stairs to the third floor
1	he got off at the railroad crossing , offered some money without bothering to look if it was too much or too little , and lurched headlong up the loop of the drive
1	it was three o ’ clock in the afternoon
1	that may be strong language , but that ’ s how it was
1	in the last few days the bai : tle for odessa raged with heavy losses , but in the end that famous city on the black sea fell into the hands of the russiansthough , to be sure , without the enemy 's having been able to disrupt our tactical regrouping
1	it had been a prank , a rather brash one , and in joachim ’ s eyes there was probably a trace of treachery and malice about it—hans castorp was well aware of that
1	we ’ ll speak of herr grünlich later , all right ?
1	where previously , by yielding just slightly , he had not found it easy to separate the now of today from that of yesterday , or the day before yesterday , or the day before that , when all were alike as peas in a pod , of late that same now was apt , even likely , to muddle its present with a present that had prevailed a month or a year before , and to fuse into an always
1	it was a strong , warm baritone , and its song was in three parts , consisting of a frame of two closely related stanzas , quite religious in nature , almost in the style of a protestant chorale , and a middle stanza that had a gallant , chivalresque spirit , warlike , lighthearted , but equally devout—which was what gave it such a french military feel
1	to be brief : the traditional cash dowry for a young woman from our family is seventy thousand marks
1	it must have brought deep confusion to his soul for him to watch his qvalier 's conservatism be trumped with the dreadfully clever card of atavism , with a radicalism of preservation that had about it nothing of the cavalier , but something more revolutionary and that sounded more destructive than any sort of liberalism , but all the same had , as if in mockery , a laudable conservative appeal- could imagine the sleepless night it would probably give him , although that may have been taking my sympathy too far
1	/ : i came upon them in the street directory
1	was simply gossamer skirts , dancers tripping past on pointe , arms arched gracefully above their heads-before the eyes of court society in their loges , maintaining the ideal and tabooing anything ugly and problematical , while a bridled bourgeoisie sat in orchestra seats below
1	he could speak quite naturally with them in their plattdeutsch , and still maintain an unapproachable distance
1	and then the engagement and our house in eimsbüttel—it was elegant , ida
1	he begged her to understand that this same sense of responsibility had strongly contributed to his willingness to carry out adrian 's wish
1	we ’ ll be having bratwurst
1	the fact was that christian was now master of his own time more than ever ; because of his precarious health , he had felt it necessary to give up his last commercial venture as an agent for champagne and cognac
1	such were her prospects , and no others would ever open before her
1	and to what , i ask you , would mere experimentation with harmony have led ?
1	he denied by the way that he felt embarrassed by the comparison
1	that ’ s why i keep it locked up , you know
1	good god , chance could work wonders
1	christian is terribly indiscreet—it ’ s hard to put it in words
1	and the second godparent ?
1	it was partly for the sake of that feeling that he had contrived to have this abiding , mutable heirloom shown to him
1	and you do love him very much , don ’ t you ?
1	and she sailed away with her shoulders held high , her head tossed back , and her chin pressed lightly to her chest
1	i would often find him pursuing such studies or writing out instrumentations
1	it would have pained and embarrassed them , would have shaken their belief in human perfectibility , to have met with silence from adolf todtenhaupt
1	his chin dropped in a straight line to join his narrow white necktie—the goiterous neck could never have endured a stiff high collar
1	herr settembrini was forced to limit his contribution to the organization of progress to oral reports , and he would have had to have forgone even those had it not been for the opportunity offered by hans castorp ’ s friendly visits
1	what ’ s got into you ?
1	oh , heaven forbid , tony cried , and there was sudden outrage even in the oh
1	you mean the strapping deutschlin , i said , and a fellow whose name was dungersheim
1	what i mean is , whenever you as a homo humanus were explaining things to me—because i didn ’ t have all that much to contribute , of course , given my previous inexperience , and could only feel that everything you said was well worth listening to
1	but the strong odor of alcohol pervading the room now only whipped her frenzy to a peak
1	you do understand that , don ’ t you ?
1	which was why he was sent to investigate each factory on some pretext or other , and report back to his bank , so that they could have time to prevent serious losses by reinsuring or spreading the risk
1	the audience obeyed fairly promptly
1	it is the end of all morality in the arts
1	my name is permaneder , alois permaneder , from munich
1	let ’ s turn off a little
1	even frau chauchat laughed very hard at this performance , so that her mouth stood open and her eyes drew close together , exactly like pribislav hippe ’ s whenever he laughed—or so it seemed to hans castorp
1	well , and how about you ?
1	she ’ s so healthy … so healthy
1	and hans tumbled with them
1	two or three weeks can set a great many things to rights
1	if your cousin leaves now , and you can tell him this for me , it may very well happen that you ’ ll still be here to witness his solemn return
1	things would remain the way they were now—with no real worries , but limited and far from elegant—and they would never change for the rest of her life
1	and he had determined that his cousin , or rather , anyone just in general would need , all things considered , twelve thousand francs a year here
1	he was delicate and nervous , suffering from weakness in the sympathetic nerves of the solar plexus , which is the source of so many anxieties and forebodings of early death , and he was a regular at a sanatorium for the wealthy in meran
1	it comes from a different intellectual direction—from the other one
1	the composer had provided these elusively scandalous verses with very simple harmonies , which in comparison to the musical language of the whole seemed more ragged , more eerie and false than the most audacious dissonances , and which in fact ·allowed the triad to come to monstrous fruition
1	his pillows stuffed behind his back , he wrote on sanatorium stationery about how his scheduled departure had been delayed
1	do you understand me , tony ?
1	and in the next moment she bent forward and began to count the prune pits on her brother ’ s dessert plate
1	but , then , you have none
1	five times a day , the diners at all seven tables expressed unanimous dissatisfaction with this year ’ s winter
1	not one of life ’ s insults or compliments had ever left her at a loss for words
1	in his case , of course , it surely wasn ’ t anything like that—just the usual fever that went with the sniffles , people would have said down below
1	you have there the spinal sac , a pulsing column of liquor within , reaching to cerebral regions , to the meninx , in whose tissue the furtive venereal meningitis goes about its soft , silent work
1	a nature like adrian 's does not have much soul
1	i shall make a note of it
1	they said nothing further about their visit with lauro , and even in the quiet of their own rooms , they refrained from judging his behavior
1	ah yes , life is dying—there ’ s no sense in trying to sugarcoat it—une destruction organique , as some frenchman once called it in that flippant way the frenchies have
1	the women circumspectly crowded forward to shake the hands of frau permaneder and her daughter , and with downcast eyes they mumbled what must be mumbled on such occasions ; meanwhile the gentlemen moved toward the stairs and their waiting carriages
1	the hair and the nails keep on growing , and for that matter , in terms of the chemistry and physics , or so i ’ ve heard , it ’ s a regular hustle and bustle there inside
1	oh , tom , i ’ m afraid she ’ s adamant
1	the consul had at first paid no particular attention to a certain frau redisch , the polish industrialist ’ s wife , who sat at the same table as the gluttonous student with the circular glasses and the temporarily absent frau salomon ; and indeed she was only one of many ladies who took their rest cure in the common lounging area—a rather plump and buxom brunette , no longer all that young , graying already , but with a dainty double chin and lively brown eyes
1	but , after all , life is like that , you know
1	and as far as greeting goes , you weren ’ t all that much more accommodating , my dear
1	sebastian bach , dear madam !
1	all day a horse led by a man at its halter pulled a heavy stone snow-roller through the streets of the resort below ; and what looked like an old-fashioned postal carriage on runners , with a plow mounted up front to push great masses of white to each side , commuted between the resort and davos-dorf , as the settlement to the north was known
1	ah , that clarissa had to do him the favor !
1	from the first moment , it was armgard who made the greatest impression on tony , and that was because armgard was the first girl she had ever actually known from a noble family
1	at the worst , twenty-eight
1	and i ’ m supposed to picture our clearheaded herr settembrini mixed up with all that ?
1	it came to the middle section with the bouncing rhythm , the passage about battle and danger—gallant , devout , and french
1	sometimes he would swallow hard , as if his mouth were full of liquid , and they could tell from the muscles of his cheeks and temples that he was holding his jaw clenched tight
1	his was a counterforce that they all could feel , but of which he was surely not even aware , or aware to god only knew what extent ; but its weight was of no use to either argument , so that the issue itself seemed to pale , to lose its critical importance , indeed—though we hesitate to say it—to take on the stamp of frivolity
1	he later took up composing
1	i ’ m sorry i can ’ t spend more time with you , but i really must look after lunch
1	things up here , he said with a forced smile , are different from what is usual elsewhere
1	in his dream he saw the turntable whirling around its spindle , so fast it became invisible , inaudible , not simply rotating wildly in place , but moving in a strange lateral undulation so that the arm beneath which it turned began to oscillate supplely , as if it were breathing—very useful , one might suppose , for the vibrato and portamento of strings and human voices
1	the man had an obvious limp , and so the first thing that hans castorp asked joachim ziemssen was , is he a war veteran ?
1	he was still wearing the same gray , petersham coat and pastel checked trousers
1	she dismissed the young men with her thanks , and her mood was now imposingly serene , given her anguished situation—in particular the stiff bill for oxygen her spouse had left her
1	she certainly did not want to be unfair to city folk , though , either ; there were always exceptions , hidden exceptions maybe , and director stiglmayer , to take him again , had shown a lot of understanding , and she did not mean just the artistic sort , when he bought that gloomy painting
1	but i am not insulting you , herr grünlich , tony said , now regretting that she had lost her temper
1	marie would then nod amiably back at her , evidently glad that her aunt was amusing herself so well , and her eyes rested with a certain grateful acknowledgement on the man dispensing this mirth , who apparently was making it his business to tickle the old woman 's urge to pass on one joke after another
1	any symptom of illness was a masked form of love in action , and illness was merely transformed love
1	he must have acted under the pressure of implacable necessity
1	and you still have your family—gerda and me and the buddenbrooks from breite strasse and the krögers , even mademoiselle weichbrodt , not to speak of klothilde , although i ’ m not sure whether she still enjoys our company
1	no sooner had the director departed than people sat down at the card tables
1	standing side by side , they gazed down the wet green slope and across the narrow , rocky band of beach to the troubled , tossing sea
1	the man has but one thought in his head , and it is a filthy one
1	settembrini came over in person now , coffee cup in hand , a toothpick between his lips , and made himself at home between hans castorp and the teacher
1	ah , where is there such a god as thou art , lord of sabaoth , thou who helpest in all dangers and afflictions , and who teachest us to know thy will aright , that we may fear thee and be found faithful to thy will and commandments !
1	consul buddenbrook strode hurriedly across his extensive property
1	eighty thousand went to frankfurt as a dowry , and , was spent setting up gotthold in business : which leaves ,
1	and yet my heart quailed at the naivete of that belief , which i was inclined to see as an expression of the loneliness and detachment that formed the aura around him and that led me reluctantly to doubt whether this man was made to attract
1	and so the director scoped , mirrored , and gazed deep and long down joachim ’ s throat ; immediately afterward , the patient appeared on hans castorp ’ s balcony , as explicitly requested , to give a report
1	when he would stop—not moving a muscle , so that he could not hear even himself—the silence was absolute , perfect , a padded soundlessness , like none ever known or perceived anywhere else in the world
1	he had not even smiled when she first entered the room ; and that immobility , that immutability in his expression said everything
1	this but in passing
1	she gave him a reddish one , about half the normal length , in a silver holder , but at the same time she warned hans castorp in a pleasantly husky voice that he definitely had to give it back to her after class , and looked at him with her narrow , bluish-gray-green eyes set above broad cheekbones , and he tore himself out of his dream—because he had it now and wanted to hold on to it : the person and situation that she had so vividly reminded him of
1	that is to say : adrian gave him two simultaneous parts to read , each of which could be either the upper or the lower voice and so were interchangeable
1	and the sooner the better…
1	there is now some cleyer and sweet dandling with the little tune for a while ; it is taken apart , each of its segments observed and transformed , and one charming figure in the middle voices is lifted to most magical heights , to the spheres of the violins and flutes , is cradled there for a while yet , until , at its most flattering moment , the gentle brass again announces the chorale from before , steps into the foreground , avoiding the long preparation of its first statement and entering not at the beginning , but as if the melody had already been there for a while , and now moves solemnly toward that
1	you poisoned life and living
1	the glass turned angry and frantic
1	death was a blessing , so great , so deep that we can fathom it only at those moments , like this one now , when we are reprieved from it
1	that was very kind of you
1	let things take their course , he concluded and moved wearily toward the glass door , where he stopped
1	in the repetition of the last verse , however , where the line reads , you could have found rest here , he sang could have the first time in full , yearning chest voice and only the second time in the gentlest of flute tones
1	what i mean is , he has a point d ’ honneur , honor is his cup of tea , and that is a matter of feeling , of life
1	it 's the root-canal work i have learned to do , he told me
1	it certainly does , the lady thinks
1	joachim , who attached definite importance to such tokens , had of course seen to it that a few flowers adorned the returnee ’ s place setting ; but hans castorp ’ s tablemates greeted him with little ceremony , with essentially no more interest than usual , as if he had been gone for three hours and not three weeks—not so much out of indifference to this ordinary , sympathetic fellow or out of self-absorption and preoccupation with their own interesting bodies , but because they were oblivious to the intervening time
1	but good god , he could carry it himself , preferred to carry it himself , and had handed it over to the poor wretch now and then just to be friendly
1	you should ask behrens to put you temporarily out of commission
1	how does it happen , then , that rosaline applies to berowne , who in the play is sharp-tongued and downright merry , this bit of wisdom :
1	-it carried a sigh that removed the thorn of ignominy
1	there were also other themes : alpine dairy sheds , dewlapped cows standing or lying in sun-drenched pastures , a plucked hen among vegetables with its twisted neck dangling over one side of a table , floral arrangements , local mountain folk , and so on—all of them painted in a kind of brisk , dilettante style , with brash clumps of color that often looked as if they had been squeezed onto the canvas directly from the tube and must have taken a long time to dry
1	a difference having to do with the heat of one ’ s blood , one ’ s sense of chivalry
1	at last he clasped his hands behind his head and looked out the window at the tumbling , silent snow
1	russian troops , a million-man army free to force the oder line once it had taken konigsberg and vienna , advanced against the reich 's capital city ( lying in rubble , abandoned by all government officials ) , and having completed with heavy artillery a judgment long since executed from the air , they are presently nearing the core of the city
1	he was a human being and an artist , and he cared not a whit-or a whistle , either , for that matter-about a cavalier 's discretion , not when the man he was talking to surely knew as well as every-
1	yes , i ’ ve got a headache , and as far as i can see , it won ’ t be going away all that quickly , because today is going to be something of a drain on me
1	a waterfall is always an inviting goal for an excursion , and we hardly know how to justify hans castorp ’ s never having visited the picturesque cascade in the forests of the flüela valley , particularly since he had a special fondness for falling water
1	herr settembrini said , to repeat myself , my young friends , i am warning you
1	the tip of his nose froze , of course , and he had to hold his book ( it was still ocean steamships ) in terribly numbed , chapped hands , but he could gaze out through the arches of the balcony to the valley , which was adorned with scattered lights that clustered brightly here and there and from which almost every evening , for at least an hour , music came drifting his way , pleasantly muted , familiar melodic airs : fragments of operas , selections from carmen , il trovatore , or der freischütz ; well-constructed , smooth waltzes as well as marches to which you could jauntily rock your head back and forth ; and cheerful mazurkas , too
1	the rest of them—ferge , wehsal , herr albin , the prosecutor , herr and frau magnus , the ladies stöhr , levi , and kleefeld—loudly and happily expressed their approval , and even dr krokowski himself nodded with satisfaction , although his relations with joachim had always been cool , since the latter had proved less than obliging in the matter of analysis
1	i sit here like a pious wretch in his tub , a wood fire crackling merrily beneath him , while a fine conscientious lad fans the flame with a hand-bellows ; and before the eyes of his imperial majesty , who has come for a first-hand look ( it is nero , you should know , a splendid sultan with italian brocade on his back ) , the hangman 's assistant , dressed in a flowing cloak and codpiece , dips a long-handled ladle into the simmering oil in which i am devoutly sitting and pours some down the back of my neck
1	genuinely pleased to see him after what had been a rather long separation , they stopped and shook his hand , asked how he was doing and glanced at his companion , expecting to be introduced
1	and he carefully and elegantly grasped the neck of his bottle of white wine—a small silver stag decorated the cork—and laid it slightly on its side for a closer examination of the label
1	i bear my song of love
1	fate did not permit the necessary installations to be completed in time for these flying missiles to disrupt and forestall the invasion
1	’ tis to you it ’ s dedicated ,
1	very good , very good
1	what had chiefly impressed him , as he revealed on the way home and the following day in the schoolyard , was the distinction kretzschmar had made between cultic and cultural epochs and his observation that the secularization of art , its separation from worship , was of only a superficial and episodic nature
1	oh , the young man would eat again soon enough
1	she made her move , and , in order to hide just how afraid of him she was , she turned loud and angry
1	ambition and vanity burrow in silence
1	the second spontaneous generation , the birth of the organic from the inorganic , was only the sad progression of corporeality into consciousness , just as disease in an organism was the intoxicating enhancement and crude accentuation of its own corporeality
1	well , good lord , it ’ s the tenth of september
1	'the rest'-presumably everything possible , both in love and in art
1	you ’ ve been busy almost exclusively with aquavit , i see
1	and for the rest , he proved his independence to himself and others by fundamentally refusing to be accommodating-which meant that when you needed him , he was definitely not to be had
1	well , that will certainly make for festive times on meng strasse—even more festive than any of you might expect , because you have no idea what special reasons i have for being so delightfully surprised by news of mademoiselle clara ’ s engagement and for looking forward to what will be a very happy gathering
1	each summer—in june , or maybe even in may—tony buddenbrook would join her maternal grandparents in their house beyond the burg gate , and for her that was pure joy
1	an immense number of elegantly printed death announcements needed to be mailed right away
1	the trip home was rather quiet , if only out of consideration for the old aunt , who had dozed off
1	this was , of course , no way to fall asleep , and hans castorp now felt no inclination to do so , either
1	that was what made it both eerie and interesting at the same time
1	thy lips are too pure and austere for these things
1	and now you must see to it all alone that we buddenbrooks hold our ground
1	o dio , three weeks !
1	and then there he sat cheerfully finishing his meal and pretending as if he had never carried on like a crazy drunkard gone berserk—presumably did not even recall what had happened
1	since the death of my beloved parents , we ’ ve kept all three girls working for us in the house , quite apart from mamselle jungmann , and it seems to me …
1	i can hardly expect you to understand what it means to be obsessed with independence
1	and scientific accuracy likewise prohibited even thinking of engaging in any such arbitrary departure and return
1	the conversation stirred hans castorp ’ s blood—his brow was flushed , his eyes had an eager glint ; he had so much to say that he did not know how he should begin to reply
1	and he comes to a decision
1	get ready to leave , my child , he said when tony appeared
1	his little red hands rowed in the air , the down on his skull fluttered ; and , framed by his white , close-cropped beard , his whole face , twisted and deformed by this excess of mirth , turned vermilion
1	he tried a little marmalade , too
1	the reversal of the general pervasion could be left to itself , in order that the upward progression might continue at its pretty
1	let ’ s just watch the others
1	he stands there in the gentle breeze as she brushes past him , wild with the happiness of having encountered her and of knowing that the word her mouth has spoken , that little merci , was intended personally and solely for him
1	this was indeed the case
1	you ’ ve said that once already , tony , and it only shows just what a helpless child you are
1	but frau permaneder was not listening
1	he descended the servants ’ stairs to the ground floor , crossed the entrance hall and the cold vestibule , and stepped out into the garden ; he went back to the entrance hall with its stuffed bear and stood fidgeting on the main staircase landing with its basin of goldfish—but he could find no rest anywhere , just stood there listening , lurking in the shadows , full of shame and sadness , crushed and driven by his fear of both the secret and the public scandal
1	each read the other ’ s eyes—the grand old man and the insignificant young man , the former still with a grasp on the latter ’ s wrist
1	joachim got up from the bench somewhat flustered and introduced him , castorp , my cousin—herr settembrini
1	we were passing the university , and the conductor in his felt boots was standing right in front of me to take my ten pfennigs and had thrust a ticket into my hand , when something incredible and at first , like anything totally unexpected , quite incomprehensible happened
1	then with several jovial phrases of encouragement , he admitted his guests through one of the doors on the right
1	things were not in full gear yet at this time of day , she said
1	and when asked his opinion , settembrini recommended a lexicographic work currently in preparation , entitled sociology of suffering ; but the only person to second this suggestion was a bookdealer who had recently joined fräulein kleefeld ’ s table
1	but , my god , she must have had a lot of strength left to fight back like that
1	adrian was far too fond of the accustomed sphere of existence he had so explicitly chosen , too fond of house and farm , steeple , pond , and hill , of his oldfashioned study , his velvet chair , ever to have consented to the idea of exchanging it all for even four weeks of the horrors of spa life , with its table d'hote , promenade , and band concerts
1	/ : and out of the fire back into the ice
1	ida jungmann let her darning fall to her lap
1	no one should expect , by the way , that the city he had chosen for his residence actually took him into its atmosphere , ever made him one of its own
1	i used to think constantly of what it must be like to be backstage
1	what the—ah , so holger had been a poet , was that it ?
1	joachim stared down at his plate
1	and in that moment of quiet bliss , hanno buddenbrook took another deep breath of the spicy air sent by the sea , and he greeted the sea tenderly with his eyes—a silent , grateful greeting full of love
1	but that did not detract from the effect
1	he drank another glass of liqueur , which restored his spirits a little ; he tried telling another story , but then , looking rather depressed , he got up to leave
1	but tony and morten spent their afternoons in the remote spot where the yellow clay cliffs began and the waves flung their spray high against seagull rock
1	it read fifty-two degrees fahrenheit
1	the deep sea 's grotesquely alien life-forms , which did not seem to belong to our planet , provided one connection
1	the neighborhood spoke in its favor : all solid middle-class houses with gables , the most modest of which was directly across the street , a little place with a flower shop on the ground floor
1	and they finished their meal in silent rancor
1	his skin was stretched tight across his skull , his large , fleshless nose with its distinct hump protruded sharply between his cheekbones , and his hair had thinned quite noticeably
1	a lady dabbed her eye with an embroidered fancy handkerchief
1	he sat back down , then stood up again , muttered a request to use the blanket from joachim ’ s bed , spread it over his legs , and went back to sitting—flushed , chilled , and tormenting himself with the disgusting taste of his cigar
1	but you ’ re right—what can one say ?
1	community lectures ) shouted comments and characterizations
1	vous m 'avez assiste trop peu , mais je ne vous en veux pas
1	one group of guests had already moved on to the social rooms , while another stayed where they were in order to apply themselves to more burgundy and champagne
1	suddenly thomas buddenbrook tossed his pince-nez on the table , sending it sliding some distance across his newspaper , and turned now with a jerk to face his sister head on
1	it was his delicate , humanist smile , the one with which he had first greeted the newcomer on the bench beside the water trough—and just as on that day , hans castorp now felt ashamed of himself
1	and then we ’ ll see if i ’ m not a new man when i get back
1	yes , he managed to say , his wide eyes fixed on the doctor
1	i beg you , please—not at all
1	if we are to get on with our story , however , it will be impossible to fathom and analyze all of that
1	the three berghof residents turned homeward , and the two pedagogic rivals were forced to enter their little house , the one climbing to his silken cell , the other to his humanist ’ s garret with its lectern and water carafe
1	he realized that their climb was coming to an end , that they had taken the crest
1	if weinschenk has done something wrong , it is most probably nothing more dreadful than what many of his colleagues have done—and got away with
1	the onlookers watched the eyelids of each contestant , making sure there was no peeking , which several were tempted to try in their helplessness ; they giggled and snorted while each candidate blundered blindly at the task , then crowed with laughter when he finally opened his eyes and gazed down at his absurd botched job
1	but he had given them thought- !
1	'whoso slaughtereth praise , it now says , 'glorifieth me
1	one would have to proceed from here and build longer words from the twelve
1	moritz still had his shallow chest and yellow complexion , and his pointed gap-teeth showed whenever he spoke in his lively way
1	it came to the point where people literally gathered to watch the infatuated young man—on the terrace after dinner or on sunday afternoon when all the guests thronged the concierge ’ s desk to pick up their mail , which on that one day was not delivered to their rooms
1	as you can see : my eyes are watery , my chest is congested , i coughed half the night away—that ’ s quite unpleasant enough
1	well , tom , the consul said , taking his cigar from his mouth , it looks as if that sale of rye to van henkdom & co that i told you about is going to go through
1	that may be as may be
1	he felt secure in paradise and simply replied , i had a headache yesterday and couldn ’ t memorize
1	so b grünlich had known how to create the illusion that johann buddenbrook stood behind him , had he ?
1	adrian spoke of the prickling sensation that came with realizing one was exposing to sight what had never been seen , was not to be seen , had never expected to be seen
1	tony asked julie hagenström
1	meister , do you know , -indeed , i think he said : does the meister know-madame de tolna ?
1	the sun brooded over the grass , sending up the hot , spicy odor of clover and weeds , while buzzing blue flies sped through the air or simply hovered there
1	and then , gazing at them all , he fell silent and turned his back on them with a final curious
1	the bitter thing is that it must be the empirical phenomenon of war that appropriates what in truth is our yearning , our thirst for unification
1	je le sais , madame , hans castorp replied in a muted voice
1	was not every human being a mistake , a blunder ?
1	this was primarily due to her use of language
1	it is true that i repeatedly lived apart from him for extended periods : during my year in the military , for example , although after its completion i resumed my studies at the university of leipzig and gained thorough knowledge of the scope of his life there ; likewise for the period of my educational tour of the classical world , which took place in the years and
1	what name best suited her-in her relationship with adrian leverkiihn ?
1	it can not be because of his broad captain ’ s shoulders , or any raw brute force , or because he could lay any one of us flat with his fist—it would never occur to him that he could , and if it did , why , a few civilized words would calm him down
1	hanno looked pale and very serious ; he kept casting kai enigmatic , sidelong glances
1	the good and the noble , he replied , what people call human , even though it is good and noble
1	but he shall not have the better of us , the archvillain , with his sly , fiery darts !
1	but listen to me now
1	my dear child , believe me when i say that i would find it very painful to see you exposed to all the hardships and insults that would result from your husband ’ s misfortune , which would mean immediately dissolving both his business and your household
1	they all reveled in pictures of people caught in the flash of magnesium , with vacant eyes staring dully from faces frozen in cramped expressions , as if the corpses of murder victims had been set up in chairs , eyes wide open
1	they ’ re full of blood , which of course does not rule out that there may be too little blood in my head
1	antiquity was not always classic
1	but one thing must be said nonetheless , and i would be surprised if life has not taught it to you as well
1	things only go well if the master nevertheless surmises and understands these hidden tendencies-sees them ironically , if need be-but is careful not to stand in the way of their development
1	a young lady , ammy nölting was her name , had first been admitted in the fall two years previous and then discharged as fully cured in august , nine months later—but was back before september was even out , claiming that she did not feel well at home
1	elisabeth had brought along a collapsible silver cup , and they dipped it in a small stone basin just below the source , refreshing themselves with cool water that tasted of iron
1	i see , i see , i see
1	they ’ re not about to do it
1	out hoofing it , i see ?
1	he could have spared himself that , by the way , because no one in the dining hall cared about either frau chauchat ’ s vice or hans castorp ’ s embarrassment for her—except , perhaps , fräulein engelhart , the schoolteacher on his right
1	didn ’ t you know that one can be a great man in a small town ?
1	it doesn ’ t mean anything
1	for there on a round , mossy stone , a young mother , dressed in a brown garment that fell away from one shoulder , sat nursing her child
1	and therefore i beg you—in your own best interest , as well as in the interest of your own country and of europe itself—to imprint on your mind the secondly ’ that i am about to offer
1	he had spread his music out before him , and fräulein engelhart now sat down next to him to turn pages
1	in short , there were inconsistencies here
1	he had his way , his heaven on earth for nine months
1	and it is the educator ’ s task explicitly to foster the true—and by appropriate practical persuasion forever to eradicate the false when it tries to emerge
1	they shall devour their tongues at so great a pain , yet form no fellowship against it , but rather are full of scorn and mockery for one another , and midst trills and groans call out filthiest curses each to each , whereby those most refined and proud , who never let a foul word pass their lips , are forced to employ the filthiest
1	he gave an interrogatory lift to these last words , as if to say , can what these ears have heard really be possible ?
1	at last the professor sighed and said , oh , buddenbrook , si tacuisses
1	you ’ d be doing him a great injustice
1	eh bien , what then ?
1	hans castorp should , however , concentrate on keeping the medium ’ s extremities under flawless control
1	by all means—fine , lovely
1	what am i laughing about ?
1	patches and streaks of blue sky were visible here and there , and when a ray of sun broke through , the village in the valley below glistened white against the dark forests of pine on the slopes
1	and one must admit , you behaved quite en philosophe
1	german-american parents and had received his musical education in the country of his birth
1	i ’ ll go swimming later , tony thought , but first a good breakfast , so that my metabolism doesn ’ t make me waste away
1	what was he talking about ?
1	it was the fanatical cult of nothing , of a fragment of melody , a brief bar and a half of childish , harmonic invention—and there was something brutal and doltish about it , and something ascetic and religious at the same time , something like faith and self-renunciation ; but there was also something insatiable and depraved beyond measure in the way it was savored and exploited
1	it seemed that life meant well by its highly confused problem child
1	he did not have time for this
1	naphta , too , had sworn an oath to a flag ; he , too , had been received beneath a banner , as he himself put it when explaining the nature of his order to hans castorp
1	in his son 's case , the physical cause was probably based more in the fact that it was only with reluctance and under constraint that had he taken part in this feast of the sacrifice of a maidenheadthat of his own sister , no less
1	her life appeared less exciting and daring , more normal , more secure-when viewed superficially , and frau rodde evidently wished to view it superficially , which is to say , she describe would inez 's marriage as happy , and indeed that required a strong dose of cozy superficiality
1	reason enough for a precise description , i suppose , the senator said
1	and he added a postscript : this letter has been quite an effort
1	but then she told her story , and although not every word was intelligible , because she spoke into the soft folds of her mother ’ s skirt and would erupt now and then in furious cries of pure outrage , it was clear nevertheless that the facts in the case were as follows :
1	kiirbis examined the child 's eyes , whose pupils had become very small and displayed a tendency to squint
1	and that was how they played it on april
1	i do not choose to speculate to what damnable influences i owe the treatment i have thus far received and borne so patiently ; but i do protest said treatment with all the sense of justice i can muster as a christian and a man of business , and i assure you for the last time that , should you not choose to respect my just claims , i will no longer be able to respect you either as a christian or as my father or as a man of business
1	he answered without realizing it
1	the veins at consul tienappel ’ s temples , just below his thinning blond hair , were swollen
1	they all heard the distant sound now that the carriages had stopped : a soft hiss , that at times slipped below the threshold of hearing , a trembling surge , to which each called the other ’ s attention as they stood there rooted in place
1	it may very well be that it does you good and you ’ ll make the grade
1	it looked handsome and manly on him , they all said
1	she assumes an air that displays cold surprise at his presence here , at his very presence in the world , refuses to offer him a hand , a glance , a word-and hurries on her way
1	the effects of this act lasted through many generations , which could then multiply all on their own in constant repetition , until the moment came when these asexually produced offspring once again found they required renewal by means of copulation , and the circle was closed
1	she had known there was something rotten about the whole affair from the first and could only hope that ziemssen ’ s obstinacy had not turned it putrid—putrid , she said , in her infinite vulgarity
1	it puts his personality in a whole new light , makes a lot of things clearer
1	but , then , why did the body not compensate , as usual , by releasing that heat ?
1	one best acquits love of the charge of sensuality by reversing things and proving there is an element of love in sensuality
1	but he was no longer a child
1	the cousins met her at the front door as they stepped out after early breakfast for their morning constitutional
1	that was not the last time we heard the stutterer lecture on beethoven
1	voltaire himself affirmed wars that spread civilization , even advised frederick the second to go to war against the turks
1	morten asked in his ponderous voice
1	we needed to talk about the adaptation of love 's labour 's lost , which i had taken on and which had already occasioned much discussion and correspondence between us
1	dear father , he continued , you know , i ’ m sure , the deep respect in which i hold time-honored traditions and principles
1	the most frequent phrase to pass his lips were the two words , one ought
1	you spoke of hubris , used that very word
1	you can ’ t possibly know what it is
1	it really doesn ’ t matter to us—to us up here , the contorted joachim said , and now it was he , and not the horseman , who was coughing in that ghastly , slimy way
1	i don ’ t understand you , thomas , not in the least
1	surely that charge has more to do with a decided trace of what feels like the icy touch of mass modernity in a work of religious vision , a work that perceives the theological element almost exclusively in terms of judgment and terror-a trace of something streamlined , to risk an insulting term
1	no—no , agreed , extraordinary , that is , it just goes to show— they took their revenge by exchanging glances—their eyes would meet and then turn heavenward in despair—and even attempted to draw hans castorp into the game ; he , however , refused
1	that ’ s what mother thinks , that ’ s what tom thinks
1	for behrens to demand that i ought to take mine , too—now listen , that was surely just meant as a joke
1	she owned a sulfurous yellow tomcat named isaak , which she dressed in mourning for the dead pope by tying a black satin bow to its tail
1	the verbal sparring was downright offensive , and yet it served no dramatic purpose
1	and two weeks ago , now , her second son arrived up here , because he wanted to see his brother one last time—handsome young fellow , by the way , but then so is the other—both of them pretty as pictures , with those glowing eyes that drive the ladies crazy
1	you speak so lightly of it—it was of no importance to you , you married me for love
1	then he stood there , too , and wept , let the tears flow down his cheeks , like those that had stung the cheeks of the english naval officer—the colorless liquid that flows at every hour everywhere in the world , so richly and bitterly that earth ’ s vale has poetically been named after it : an alkaline , salty liquid that our body secretes from glands when our nerves are subjected to the shock of pain , whether physical or psychological
1	the senator felt himself go weak in her embrace
1	the scholar wanted to know
1	i was pleased by his admiration , his love for the material , although the choice itself did not suit me at all and i was always somewhat displeased by its mockery of humanism 's excesses , which , after all , ends up making humanism itself an object of ridicule as well
1	but frau iltis was sitting beside the road , a roguish pucker on her face , and she was holding something in her hand that was supposed to be her stirletto , but was really nothing more than a safety razor
1	you would not be here if it were not for that face
1	then he would go lie down again
1	it was young schneermann , anton schneermann , who sat up there at the same table with mademoiselle kleefeld
1	and so i smoke
1	such information would make adrian laugh till he literally shook and tears came to his eyes , arid his amusement was catching , so that i , too , had to laugh heartily
1	the doughty knight of the t-square !
1	but his actual decision to become a theologian came as something of a shock for me , and i think i probably did blanch when he revealed it to me
1	the will to take expression to its very extremes was always a dominant element in his music , alongside the intellectual passion for austere order , for the linear style of the netherlands
1	he worked hard , and success was his
1	his glazed , half-open eyes were rolled back , and his lips moved in a silent babble under his mustache
1	he was bent over the table , rapping it steadily with the tip of his crooked index finger , and stared up with red-rimmed eyes and a bristling mustache at his brother , thomas—who sat pale and erect , gazing down at him with half-lowered eyelids
1	that is base nature ’ s way—but a very human , loving mercy swelled up in hans castorp ’ s breast when he saw that dark , instinctive shame in poor joachim ’ s eyes
1	people do that down south , ida , it happens , even among educated people when they ’ re feeling at their ease—and it doesn ’ t hurt anyone , doesn ’ t bother anyone , it just happens and no one ’ s surprised
1	of course , except for people getting a bit drunk , it ’ s all quite respectable , not nearly as rough as things get in cadet taverns or—
1	nothing was turning out the way he wanted
1	first you differentiate the two cases , then equate them
1	his second week was passing quickly now ; two-thirds of his time would soon be gone , and once the last third began , he would have to start thinking of packing
1	the schweigestills had settled here three generations before
1	but an idea had been born back then , which had continued to triumph down to the present , and that idea was the dignity of every individual soul , and the equality of all—in a word , individualistic democracy—and in honor of it , he would now empty the glass someone had passed to him
1	there were also milk , tea , coffee , hot chocolate , even bouillon ; and guests on all sides , who had spent the last two hours resting after their heavy dinner , were busy spreading butter on large slices of raisin cake
1	i truly hope you are not mazed that old clootie speaks of things religious ?
1	but you have to use jakobs , the upholster on fisch strasse
1	and in any case , my own health is …
1	the visitors were sincere in their praise of the abbot 's study
1	it has little or nothing to do with training someone on an instrument , but , rather , with his understanding music
1	you have dragged beauty through the dust , you have behaved like a vandal , a barbarian—you , a creature whom the muses have deserted , buddenbrook , it ’ s written on your face
1	dr mantelsack , however , went on with the lesson
1	i am certain that as far as schwerdtfeger himself knew , he had gone to marie godeau with the best , the most correct intentions
1	might i request of you , consul buddenbrook …
1	how now , genuine and false !
1	i would gladly accompany you into the mountains , moving alongside you with wings on my heels , like mercury himself—but i dare not
1	why was i more than surprised , indeed moved and not a little shocked ?
1	course-how could it have ?
1	you see , you ’ re stuck
1	to see the world divided into hostile camps , that is spirit
1	but once it is fixed on a given human being with a face , why then our mouths speak of love
1	i ’ ve seen him serve at dinner , he ’ s very reliable
1	which he did not , oh no
1	no , to be quite honest , i don ’ t recall anything about sweets
1	but i assure you that i ’ ve never been more awake and alert than i am now , coming here by stealth of night to present armgard ’ s—and so , indirectly , ralf von maiboom ’ s—proposal to you
1	and now everything was ready
1	zink and spengler dropped by on their bikes , for while shopping in town adrian had paid a call on ramberg strasse and the two painter friends had learned from the rodde girls of his return and new residence
1	she kept shaking her head—a little cap of black lace sat prettily atop it—and then , under the burden of thoughts , she slowly let it sink farther and farther down onto one shoulder
1	the very blond , gaunt young woman took her seat and spooned down her yogurt again , as if this were the only thing she ever ate
1	the ashes as the immortal part of man
1	please hear me out
1	naphta was smoking a cigarette , and hans castorp asked himself whether he would like to do the same and , finding that he had not the least desire , decided this had to be an affectation on naphta ’ s part
1	advance , sir , and shoot , he called across to his opponent and began to advance himself as well , his pistol held out chest-high at arm ’ s length and directed at settembrini—an incredible sight
1	he has donned a black coat—one of the consul ’ s old ones—but still has on his greasy high-top boots and has wound a blue woolen scarf around his neck
1	and that , or at least the possibility of it , would have to be shared with his family
1	but he was too perceptive and honest not to admit the truth—he was a mixture of both
1	he said with a despondent shake of his head
1	his hand trembled as he did it ; he was definitely nervous
1	fumigated , that ’ s spiffing , he said glibly and somewhat incongruously while he washed and dried his hands
1	viewpoint includes a recognition of a certain natural won�er-working power of the mind and its ability to regulate and alter the organic and corporeal-and this , if you will , magic side of the matter was what schleppfuss deliberately emphasized , of course , in his commentary on the klopfgeissel case
1	are we buddenbrooks the kind of people who want to be tip-top ’ on the outside , as they say here , while choking down our humiliation within our four walls ?
1	the gloomy and cold weather that had reigned in the valley outside when hans castorp had first taken to his bed had given way to splendid bright summer days , a whole series of such days , which seemed to have no end
1	they clawed faces , pinched noses , clutched throats , all the while punching away at one another , grappling , rolling about on the floor in terribly dead earnest ; they spat , kicked , grabbed , trounced , whacked , and frothed at the mouth
1	not just frau chauchat ’ s countrymen and tablemates were present , but countless other guests were on hand as well
1	the girl with the face of a tapir was busy sewing on a button at the knee of the knickerbockers worn by the boy with the monocle
1	with red ink , yes indeed
1	a glass of grog after your trip ?
1	gereon and waltpurgis set his bags down on it
1	and then the only sound to break the silence was thomas buddenbrook ’ s agonized gurgling
1	oh , my dear , you ’ re talking utter nonsense !
1	i think being up here with us is getting to you
1	it ’ s nothing , ida said , just pavor nocturnus
1	you do find it a good likeness , i hope ?
1	hans castorp was deeply moved
1	our name means something even without the senator
1	his uncle asked , having decided to let whicknco pass as some kind of baby talk
1	she whistled at him , but not with her mouth ; her lips weren ’ t puckered at all , were tightly closed in fact
1	his cheeks flushed , he would take a deep breath-and then there was a long wait until the next breath
1	the connection , however , between adrian 's first journey to switzerland and his earlier one to sylt was as follows
1	the day after old madame buddenbrook had wrestled with death , the senator had been sitting at the table with his wife , and he had made some harsh comments—quite deliberately in the presence of his son , it seemed—about the way uncle christian had behaved , slinking away to bed just when his mother ’ s suffering had been at its worst
1	what you do , you do in all honesty—but i ask you , what is honesty , if the body and soul are in cahoots ?
1	miss robinson once again drank her bloody-red rosehip tea , and the grandniece was back to spooning yogurt
1	only in his last week , at the end of november , after the weakness in his heart had become noticeable , were there times when his mind would wander and he would suddenly grow confused about his condition and speak hopefully and happily of a speedy return to his regiment and of taking part in the grand maneuvers that he obviously thought were still under way
1	what is truth , he said finally
1	the music they offered was silly , and they offered it lamely and badly besides , so that after finishing his roast chicken , rudi schwerdtfeger could no longer stand it and decided to let his star shine in first-class form
1	there sat death , a humanistic rhetorician clad in a blue coat ; and when you focused on this philanthropic and pedagogic god of literature , what you saw crouching there had a monkey face , with the symbols of night and sorcery on its brow
1	and now this present section must employ asterisks to nudge the reader to accept its uniting a backlog of data about leverkiihn 's stay in leipzig with a digression on the almost impossible circumstances under which i write my little book
1	it might happen that for no special reason she would reach for the old guitar decorating the living-room wall and strum a few cords or even hum a tag of a verse from a song ; but she did not go in for actual singing , although i would bet that the most splendid material lay waiting to be developed
1	in my replies i sought to console him by suggesting how difficult it is for someone to think his way beyond his present condition , which , though against all reason , he emotionally always tends to see as his permanent fate , since he is incapable of peeking around the next corner , so
1	the bare-armed patient replied , in response to the familiar pronoun in his question
1	he absolutely had to take part in the next session , now that everything was going so splendidly
1	don ’ t try to tell me anything about tom
1	ah , it was probably all true at once , and in equal measure
1	he looked about—next to him sat the pianist with thinning hair , arms crossed , head thrown back , mouth hanging open as he listened
1	nor did it help for the director to remind them that even under such circumstances life at the berghof bore little resemblance to a stay on a prison ship or in a siberian salt mine , or for him to praise the advantages of the local air , so thin and light , which like the pure ether of the spheres lacked all earthly admixtures , good or bad , and protected them from the fumes and vapors of the plains even without the sun ; gloom and protest spread , threats of wild departures were the order of the day , and some were even carried out , despite sad examples like frau salomon , recently returned from her willful stay in windy , wet amsterdam , whose case had once been stubborn but not serious , but now looked very much like a life sentence
1	in any case his participation in the next zapfenstosser concert ( that is , the first after the one when he had returned from pfeiffering at the very last moment ) was regarded as a kind of farewell performance
1	newspapers , already half-unshackled , record the truth ; rumor , fed by the enemy 's radio broadcasts and by the stories of those who have fled , knows no censorship and has carried the particulars of this rapidly expanding catastrophe to regions of the reich that have nqt yet been swallowed up in it , not yet liberated by iteven to my refuge here
1	his love would presumably have been much more passionate had she had the fish tail she was born with , rather than those painful human legs
1	her marriage was a most happy one , and as for her health , she had recovered nicely from a weakness in the lung , a slight upper-lobe catarrh , that had followed the birth of three children in rapid succession , in , , and
1	it was a very colorful gathering , and the three patients—the two cousins and their protégée—looked about , taking it all in
1	frau permaneder cried in considerable amazement
1	they had first taken a street that was faced by an irregular pattern of buildings and ran along the railroad tracks , following the valley ’ s axis , but then turned left and crossed the narrow tracks and a brook ; and they were now trotting up a gently rising road in the direction of wooded slopes and a low , outcropping meadow where an elongated building stood , its façade turned to the southwest , topped by a copper cupola , and arrayed with so many balconies that , from a distance as the first lights of evening were being lit , it looked as pockmarked and porous as a sponge
1	i really am surprised to learn that i ’ m a little ill , but i ’ ll just have to get used to being a patient here , to actually being one of you , instead of merely the visitor i ’ ve been until now
1	and then she folded her arms and gazed at the smiling faces like someone sure of her success
1	i don ’ t presume you ’ ve come here to tell me that ?
1	a great deal of schadenfreude in your comments , it seems to me , and yet when it comes to peeperkorn , we ’ re companions in misery , so to speak )
1	well , we ’ ll soon see … by god , we ’ ll just see about that
1	i can dispose of my own property as i choose
1	be quiet , naphta shouted piercingly
1	he literally no longer had the least notion of how to compose , not the vaguest memory of how one went about it , and confidently believed that he would never set another note to paper
1	both out of idealism , and for practical reasons , humankind was about to provide the remedy
1	you could even call it a nice mess
1	but the lymph , now that ’ s the juice of juices , the essence , you see , the blood ’ s own milk , a very rarefied liquid—a fatty diet will make it look just like milk , in fact
1	to think that father never lived to see it—it simply makes me want to weep , you know
1	there is something peculiar about the piece
1	and i find nothing more tactless and brutal than constantly trying to nail talented youth down to its 'immaturity , with every other sentence a 'that 's nothing for you yet
1	instead of proceeding to the good russian table , the ill-mannered woman walked soundlessly up to hans castorp and silently extended her hand for him to kiss—not the back , but the palm
1	she ’ s getting the director of a brewery
1	the consul had briefly explained the situation to his own wife , though sparing her the worst details , and in a cold , noncommittal letter he informed herr grünlich that he would meet with him , together with his banker , herr kesselmeyer , at the former ’ s home—and left for hamburg
1	it was clear he wanted to hide from them—he would bend down over his plate , turn his head away , even interrupt her in a low , tormented voice , saying over and over , good god , tony ! —and his large nose would screw up into a thousand wrinkles
1	erika was not to be separated from her mother
1	as if stunned or paralyzed , she lay there on her pillows for one long , ghastly minute ; but then , when the scandalous noise did not stop , she picked up her lamp in her trembling hands , left her bed in horrified , grim desperation , put on her slippers , flung open the door , and , still carrying her lamp , hurried to the top of the stairs—the familiar jacob ’ s ladder that led straight up from the front door to the second floor
1	castorp , dear castorp , let me whimper a little—you don ’ t know the nights i have
1	in your position as the brother of the owner , you will of course have a privileged place among the other employees
1	our sanatorium lies at a higher altitude than the village , as you can see , joachim continued
1	at the rear a flight of stairs flanked by two low obelisks led up to a raised gravel terrace with an open wooden pavilion , its awnings lowered to shade a few garden chairs
1	i ’ d place her in sesame weichbrodt ’ s boarding school
1	the buddenbrooks must have dragged the old man in by the hair
1	you can regard the pietà from the sofa
1	but it may be it ’ s simply because everything is so festive
1	her upper lip always quivered when she cried , and the effect was unutterably touching
1	it was guarded by fierce defenses , but he forced his way in and , with the help of the ring , was able to perform the most astounding feats and release the castle from its spell
1	while she had been talking , she had picked up the paper and opened it again , letting her eyes glide disparagingly across its columns
1	and so it will be again , so it will always be
1	it is not so much the physical and mental exhaustion and abrasion that come with the challenges of life ( for these , in fact , simple rest would be the best medicine ) ; the cause is , rather , something psychological , our very sense of time itself—which , if it flows with uninterrupted regularity , threatens to elude us and which is so closely related to and bound up with our sense of life that the one sense can not be weakened without the second ’ s experiencing pain and injury
1	and now this has fallen apart , too
1	time is money—let us not waste it by hesitating
1	if so , it ’ s hardly necessary , he hasn ’ t given it a thought , i don ’ t suppose , and when i do remind him , he says , yes , yes , child , your father has other things to do
1	but , like the other pleasure-loving bons vivants , he understood how to put on the right face , to avoid public offense , and to maintain a reputation for absolute reliability in matters political and professional
1	as noted , the composer for his hymn , my friend adrian , expatiated on them ; but it would be unfair of me to leave the impression that he did so with any sort of deep feeling or emphasis
1	it was a faith like any other , only worse and more obtuse than all the rest ; and the word science itself was the expression of the most stupid sort of realism , which did not blush at taking at face value the dubious reflections that objects left on the human mind and seeing them as the basis for the most dismal and vapid dogma anyone ever foisted on humanity
1	it did not bother him that she had turned to joachim ; she had taken the circumstances into account in doing so , thereby making it clear that she was aware of those circumstances
1	you never get the joke
1	and some to ask
1	the schweigestill farm was fully able to satisfy his simple habits of diet
1	i sent mrs whatever my photograph and she had to dispense with my services—i was too pretty
1	i can ’ t understand how you didn ’ t bring it up yesterday evening
1	the man was slightly built and had gray , hollow cheeks
1	yes , i won ’ t deny it—you keep yourself busy with more practical matters , with your russian grammar
1	he was not a humane person
1	but she had relatively long legs and was not at all broad in the hips
1	when we do go out in society—to see kesselmeyer , or consul goudstikker on the alster damm , or senator bock on rathaus strasse—we have to hire a carriage
1	but they will hear or would hear the order itself , and the perception of it would provide an unknown aesthetic satisfaction
1	the milky glow of a slowly brightening window , the pale rectangle of the fluorescent screen , emerged out of the darkness
1	in any case , he was of the opinion that one should find it sufficient and saw it as such himself
1	that ’ s very true , about sculpture , hans castorp said as they moved away ; and forgetting to rehang the painting or even to set it aside , he carried it with him , trailing it behind him into the adjoining area
1	we ’ re going to be sensible , aren ’ t we ?
1	as for christian , mr richardson had written that , although the young man had shown a true talent for making the english language his own , he had not shown sufficient interest in business and evidenced all too great a weakness for the amusements of the metropolis—the theater , for example
1	after a half-hour in which there was no audible sound except the scratching of pens and the prudent coughs of herr marcus , the consul looked across the green windowsill and spotted christian walking toward the office
1	but don ’ t overdo it—that ’ s my advice
1	illusive winter woods in silence , broken by the snap of heavy wings , an owl in flight
1	she left us in agony and despair , deaf to her parents ’ words of comfort
1	as she continued to speak , only occasionally listening with half an ear to my interjection� , her words-and i shall be frank-were drenched in a sensual bliss that makes me hesitate to repeat them verbatim
1	has the linen come from lentföhr , mama ?
1	but what becomes of the reval program , lodovico , if your progressives meet with success ?
1	it made his whole answer seem abrupt and tentative
1	it ’ s a good thing—certainly doesn ’ t hurt—if a man knows something about what ’ s what under the epidermis and can paint what can not be seen
1	when he stood up from one communal meal , hans castorp was already delighting in the next—insofar as delighting was the right word , and not too cheery , simple , light , or common a word for the anticipation bound up with being together again with a lady as ill as frau clavdia chauchat
1	as the conversation between hans castorp and clavdia chauchat died away , the pianist stopped playing altogether , laying the hand with which he had been doodling back in his lap
1	or ain ’ t that somethin ’
1	the old woman showed him into the combination living room and studio-with a smile whose slyness betrayed disbelief in his talk of a third party
1	he performed his rinsing and painting , and the senator got up to leave
1	during a pogrom , a panic of rage unleashed by the unexplained deaths of two christian children , elia had met a terrible end : he had been found hanging on the door of his own burning house , crucified to it with nails ; and his wife , although bedridden with consumption , had fled the region with her children , little leib and four others—all of them with arms raised , crying in loud lamentation
1	the concierge had done a good business in paper hats , rattles , and sacks of favors , and prosecutor paravant made a start at keeping the buffoonery going by appearing in a kimono and wearing a false pigtail that belonged , or so someone shouted , to frau wurmbrandt , the general consul ’ s wife ; he had also used a curling iron to turn his moustaches down , making him look every inch chinese
1	at this point herr grünlich lost his head
1	a bourgeois court of arbitration that decides questions of life and death , ascertains god ’ s will , and ordains the course of history
1	the fact was that his breakfast beer , which normally had only a slightly befuddling effect on the young man , had completely stupefied and lamed him—it was as if he had been struck a blow across his brow
1	what were the terms you used—detached and
1	suddenly he said , you know , it ’ s strange—sometimes i feel like i can ’ t swallow
1	the pedagogue , for example , knew that even today the tendency in elementary education was to move away from the initial learning of letters by sounding them out and to turn instead to the whole-word method , to link writing to the concrete look of things
1	it isn ’ t a pain , you can ’ t really call it that , he struggled to explain , rubbing his hand up and down his leg , wrinkling his nose , and letting his eyes roam about
1	and you won ’ t have much success as a patient if you go to behrens with a cold
1	frau antonie pushed back the sleeves of her blouse with a graceful though impatient gesture , stared up at the ceiling , and cried , grünlich—ha !
1	simultaneity , he claimed , was in fact the primary factor , for each note , with its closer and more distant overtones , was itself a chord , and the scale was merely sound spread out analytically in horizontal sequence
1	and accept it as a gift he did-with the look of someone who had indeed said he would not spend money on it
1	she looked at him
1	these remarks are inserted here only because young hans castorp had something similar in mind when , after a few days , he said to his cousin ( while gazing at him with bloodshot eyes ) , i ’ ve always found it odd , still do , how time seems to go slowly in a strange place at first
1	indeed , although his vanity—which had become almost comical by now—kept him propped up , tumbledown was the only word for him
1	but when they were finished at last , they put their books away and sat down on the window seat to listen to ida read
1	with only a conditional , after-the-fact threat still lingering there
1	before the last course of butter and cheese was served , old madame buddenbrook used the opportunity for another little speech
1	no matter what she had received , every joy and every sorrow , she had given it back in a flood of banal and childishly self-important words , which she found perfectly adequate for what she needed to express
1	but he did not look back
1	for some mysterious reason , he was vain about his pudgy , red hands , which he constantly rubbed together or held clasped in front of him so that he could admire them
1	i would not think of asserting that , in terms of the courtesy a cavalier owes a lady , he would ever—agreed , dear friend , absolutely unobjectionable
1	he interrupted in a melancholy voice
1	no , papa , he concluded with an energetic wave of a hand and stood up taller still , i must advise against your giving in
1	behrens captured your skin perfectly , oh , truly quite lifelike
1	for thomas buddenbrook himself , this piece of the world here on the harbor—among the ships , sheds , and warehouses , where things smelled of butter , fish , water , tar , and well-oiled iron—had been a favorite spot since he was a boy , the most interesting place he knew ; and since hanno did not express joy and approval on his own , the senator felt compelled to awaken those feelings in his son
1	the clock of st mary ’ s struck half past four
1	actually , he should have left for his private mathematics lesson , but he realized that this was an event before which the men in worsted suits would have to fall silent
1	as in zurich , he often made her laugh-and marie smile-but in no way hampered a sober discussion that concerned artistic developments in paris and munich and even touched on european politics and german-french relations-a discussion in which , at the very end as he stood to take his leave , adrian joined for a few moments
1	the late-afternoon sun enhanced the color of the garden ’ s tidy symmetry of paths and flower beds
1	if it were merely a trip , a visit to amsterdam—but to leave us forever !
1	and yet that hardened heart softened at once the first time the literary man spoke to him again—after weeks , as noted—though it was only in passing and in the form of a mythological allusion , which to be understood required an education in the traditions of the west
1	your sympathies are with the nobility , he said , and do you want me to tell you why ?
1	with hugo ’ s consent—indeed , at his express wish—it was decided that frau antonie , at least for the time being , would live with the weinschenks , assisting the inexperienced erika in managing a household—and it was this arrangement that produced in tony the most exquisite feeling , as if there had never been a bendix grünlich or an alois permaneder , as if all the failures , disappointments , and sufferings of life were melting away , and as if she could begin anew with fresh hope
1	he could not possibly have excluded himself , have lain in bed waiting for the news , first because—but he did not even spell out his first reason , but went immediately to his second , which was that one could not simply let things take their own course
1	bullinger let the heavy lid down
1	it ’ s only natural for a mother to want that
1	i found no sympathy on his part for these apprehensions , for although he truly loved to debate with me the theological
1	senator buddenbrook shouted in a thundering voice
1	the timetable had a word to say as well ; our driver was fetched and under a sky now brilliantly strewn with stars , the sleigh brought us back to the little station , where we waited on the platform for the train to munich
1	before the death of the consul had shrouded the entire family in mourning , she had participated with unapproachable dignity in the social life of her parents ’ home and attended parties in the homes of those of equal rank
1	but i need not tell you , need i , that you will impress them much more by behaving as an equal and energetically doing your duty , than by making use of your prerogatives and taking liberties
1	this disk , however , was merely like the circular section of an orange that had been sliced through the middle , for it was surrounded in all directions by a multi-stellared , vaporous mantle , which , once again , one could not term immeasurable but
1	i don ’ t have the feeling that i ’ ve quite got used to it all yet and acclimatized myself , although that would be a precondition for any real recuperation
1	he sang a showpiece aria in his own language—eh , il barbiere
1	if only the soil can provide a living , then it alone can provide freedom
1	how now , diseased and healthy !
1	and , sensing around him the irresistible shadows of sleep and numbness , he swore an oath never to let go of that immense joy , to gather all his energies , and to learn , to read , and to study , until he had made that view of the world—the source of all that he had felt—firmly and inalienably his own
1	i am alone with my old helene , who tends to my bodily needs , and to whom i sometimes read certain sections , which she in her simplicity can deal with , of what i have written here , toward whose completion all my thoughts are directed amidst the destruction
1	richard wagner-who , upon hearing the hammerklavier sonata once again in old age and losing himself in it , had burst into raptures for these pure spectra of existence ( that had been his locution ) , exclaiming in his saxon accent : that sort of thing is conceivable only on the piano !
1	i read somewhere that goethe said something in his bedroom one night to his valet—
1	her digestion had certainly been in a bad state of late
1	but he was thrilled not so much because she looked so charming , but because her looking that way only enhanced the sweet fog in his head , increased the intoxication that desired itself , that wanted only nourishment and self-justification
1	that is how it ’ s done under such circumstances
1	what is going on here , huh ?
1	and yet he was really the servant of many masters-and was something of a sponge
1	i feel as if something is slipping away , as if i no longer hold it as firmly in my grasp as before
1	he had crossed his hands over his breast and scant beard , his head tilted to one side
1	on sunday , like a good many other gentlemen who were kept in town on business during the week , the senator joined his family and stayed until monday morning
1	it was not so much that the parasite deprived the surrounding tissue of its nourishment , but rather , in exchanging materials with its host cell , it formed organic compounds that proved amazingly toxic , indeed ultimately destructive , to the cells of the host organism
1	it 's beauty is not intellectual , but exemplarily sensual
1	then by way of reply , he said , yes , the latest is that i have a little temperature
1	i have no great love of formalities
1	already in the course of their forced march , many a man has severed himself , has proved too young and too weak—turned pale and staggered , doggedly forced himself to be a man , only to fall back all the same in the end ; he drags himself alongside the marching column for a while longer , as company after company passes by , and then he vanishes , lying down where it was not wise to lie down
1	it was : hastening while
1	well , there is no point in waiting around here any longer
1	and just as he was about to turn his head to look in that direction , he suddenly found that it was simply too much trouble and not worth the effort
1	it is but a poor , bourgeois , nineteenth-century thing !
1	and if this butterfly could become invisible to defend itself , you needed only to page ahead in the book to make the acquaintance of those that achieved the same results by being as conspicuously , indeed gaudily , sweepingly visible as possible
1	they all stood up , pushed back their chairs , and began slowly to move toward the same door through which the doctor had left the dining hall
1	do you think i ’ m blind , that i don ’ t know what kind of life you lead , in the theater and at the circus and in your clubs , you and your trashy women ?
1	only a keenly observant friendship like mine could have felt or suspected such a shift in what these things meant , and god forbid that those perceptions might have detracted from my joy in being near adrian !
1	he would never have believed that the essence of music could be so totally alien to his family as it increasingly appeared to be
1	for it was , of course , quite ridiculous to try to tie the concept of revolution exclusively to progress and a victoriously onrushing enlightenment
1	i ’ ve always enjoyed looking at one now and then
1	and i didn ’ t even know , never even thought that there still actually was such a thing
1	i would nonetheless have been infinitely grateful- !
1	it ’ s almost nine o ’ clock—well , not quite nine yet , sad to say
1	on the contrary—you will prejudice our dignity if you don ’ t do it , because that would turn a mere bagatelle into a true scandal
1	this was rudolf schwerdtfeger , a talented young violinist , who sat among the first violins of the zapfenstosser orchestra , which played a significant role in the city 's musical life , second only to that of the hofkapelle
1	this music has nothing whatever in common with the spirit of the festival of spring-which , however , in a certain sense did prepare the way for it-that is , with its spirit of humble glorification ; and were it not for certain personal hallmarks of the musical signature pointing to the same author , one might scarcely believe the same soul had produced them both
1	but she did have to admit that it would be impractical to continue to keep up the spacious and noble house , which had proved to be thomas buddenbrook ’ s most expensive hobby , and that there was some justification in gerda ’ s desire to have a comfortable little villa with a pleasant yard somewhere beyond the town gates
1	but what brings you down here ?
1	couldn ’ t hanno grow up to be like that ?
1	and where will the likes of you find the simpleness , the naive candour of despair that were the presumption for this hope-
1	an open book , a skull , and in its light constructed frame , the double hollow of frail glass , and inside it , sand extracted from eternity , to tumble here as time in holy , terrifying stealth
1	are you afraid that a certain matter … ?
1	do you know hoffmann ?
1	because that ’ s all she knows how to say , and there ’ s no one here who understands spanish
1	and i did not deny it to her , thomas
1	consul johann buddenbrook arrived at the villa at two in the afternoon ; dressed in a gray overcoat , he entered the grünlichs ’ salon and embraced his daughter with a certain painful fervor
1	the diminished seventh , an impossibility ; certain chromatic passing notes , an impossibility
1	and yet i felt a gentle prod of disapproval when schildknapp , pointing at this wonderful display , shouted his , view yonder sight !
1	it was the smile that revealed his strong resemblance to his mother , but there was a strain to it that i knew well , for it was the best he could manage under the pressure of a migraine
1	to be sure , the beard made a great difference , and i said that , too , to those who could not get over the fact that it was he
1	but it was rumored that he was already living off the capital
1	but hanno showed no signs of waking , although his eyes were staring wide and his lips went on moving
1	everything went just as before ; hans castorp asked to be relieved of his post as primary monitor , but was refused this request by their leader
1	and so before second breakfast , they went down to the management office to take care of the bill
1	he had recently finished a piece , a fairy tale , a mad , fantastic tale of adventure , in which everything was bathed in an eerie light ; it was set deep within the earth ’ s most sacred workshops , where ores and mysterious embers glowed , but at the same time within the human soul , so that in some strange way the primal forces of nature and of man ’ s soul were blended , altered , transformed , and refined—and all of it in a fervent , suggestive , and slightly extravagant language filled with delicate , passionate yearning
1	farm tell it , there was no denying a certain murkiness or fantastic ambiguity about this entire curious segment of life
1	and with that he left
1	the christian middle ages clearly saw that the secular state was inherently capitalist
1	hans castorp would be able to verify that for himself on the x-ray plate , a copy of which he would soon be given as promised
1	still unspoken , it plays a role in the jest about the great city of ninevah and the quotation with the prophet 's skeptical exoneration of it
1	i suppose that on the whole it ’ s the same with love
1	frau magnus—the woman who was losing protein—supported her unconditionally
1	you can tell them all by heart and take your pick thereof- !
1	it was translated almost word for word from the french , with even the original syntax perfectly preserved , lending a certain demeanor and titillating elegance to its exposition of a philosophy of physical love and debauchery , all in a spirit of worldly , life-affirming paganism
1	fräulein levi screeched that someone had pulled her hair
1	but one thing was certain—siegismund gosch was a learned and remarkable man
1	it had all been sung falsetto , the singers barely opening their mouths or moving their lips-a most marvelous acoustic effect
1	what absurd ignominy to be one of them !
1	i know death , i ’ m one of his old employees
1	my ideas tumble topsy-turvy and go astray because of the excitement that comes with recalling the period i am describing , the period after the collapse of the german authoritarian state , which brought with it that radical loosening of discourse that also dragged my thoughts into its vortex and stormed my staid worldview with new ideas it did not find easy to digest
1	no , i ’ m simply going to have to toss it away , he said after trying once more
1	it ’ s not possible , he said
1	no doubt of it
1	she drank and drank something wonderful , madame antoinette remarked
1	and they never spoke another word—but just that one time , it really did happen , thanks to hans castorp ’ s enterprising spirit
1	i ’ m not going to let him be proved right about influences
1	in short , it had been produced with a sympathetic understanding of its international audience and catered to that civilization ’ s secret wishes
1	the coachman tipped his hat and madame buddenbrook gave a nod of excessive kindness and said , good morning , my good man , with the sort of patronizing benevolence that thomas found embarrassing on occasion
1	for military drill , maybe , i can ’ t say as to that , but none for being ill he constantly wants to leave , can you believe it ?
1	it ’ s all so wonderful ! —my child , he continued now in an earnest , almost stern voice , that exceeds my every expectation
1	a titillating little mystery , but not all that worthy ; by light of day , the epicanthic fold turns out to be an atavistic abnormality
1	a group of sailors passed by arm in arm , singing and smoking , on their way back from some dubious harbor tavern and looking for one even more dubious for further celebration
1	no , that was a benighted voice , in herr settembrini ’ s opinion—which he delivered with much emotion
1	a love of quarrels
1	i have not asked you what you might do in such-and-such a case , but , rather , what you will do , here and now
1	but should i grant the support of my soul to sarmatian despotism , when it is about to put the torch to our most noble continent ?
1	he had always been susceptible to bronchitis and fevers , and then one day he actually coughed up red , and joachim was shipped off posthaste to davos—much to his great regret and dismay , because he was very close to seeing his ambition fulfilled
1	as little as the term i have in mind seems applicable to a farce , i will use it : it is a religious atmosphere
1	when , for example , he ’ s a part-time physician , physiologist , and anatomist with some intimate knowledge of life ’ s undergarments
1	that little bit of hail … that little bit of hail , he kept repeating pointlessly
1	once earthly forms have dissolved , the reestablishment of the city of god will take place where earth and heaven , the natural and the supernatural , meet—salvation is transcendent
1	all of which gave freemasonry a new fascination and luster , which explains the increased popularity it enjoyed at the time
1	no , i already knew it on my own
1	we have to wait for our pupils to get nice and big , like a cat ’ s , in order for us to see what we want to see
1	he was a pale , bald man ; from beneath an oversize , drooping nose , a black moustache hung down morosely on both sides of his mouth
1	he said nothing , spoke openly to no one—and to whom could he speak ?
1	the gigantic wall , almost ten thousand feet high , was wrapped in clouds
1	he would go down to the office at about the same time as thomas and take his seat beside herr marcus and catercorner from his brother—in the same kind of adjustable armchair the two partners used
1	no , father , i could not bear it
1	he loved his snuff ; he had a longish tortoiseshell box inlaid with gold , and snuff was also the reason he carried red handkerchiefs , the tip of one usually visible dangling from the back pocket of his frock coat
1	the consul could not comprehend that
1	the schoolyard—paved with red bricks and cut off from the street by a high shingled wall with two entrance gates—was filled with pupils , some walking back and forth in little rows , some standing in groups , some leaning or half sitting against the tiled abutments of the school building
1	this often alarmed me-not on account of his future career , which given his aptitude was never in peril , but because i asked myself what , then , was not immaterial , not secondary to him
1	well , now i have to attend to my moribundus , he said , in room twenty-seven here
1	that ’ s exactly what i want , tom
1	that more or less describes , in round figures , apart from all sorts of minor fluctuations , the state of our finances
1	it was another shock to his faith in his own good fortune , his authority , his future
1	nevertheless , there were a few things that could sap his courage for hours on end , dulling the sharpness of his mind and casting him into gloom
1	who would have thought that evening when i first had the pleasure of greeting you , and you responded to my mistaken view—it was a mistake at the time—by declaring that you were perfectly healthy
1	signora peronella and her brothers disregarded , did not even hear what to them was everyday behavior , and if a guest seemed taken aback , they merely gave him a smile of apology-but of touching tenderness , too , indeed almost of happiness , as if it were all rather charming
1	pastor tiburtius and his wife have not let the long trip from riga discourage them from being present at the ceremony : sievert tiburtius , who has laid the two strands of his long , scraggly beard over both shoulders and whose little gray eyes now and then unexpectedly grow larger and larger , sticking out until they almost pop ; and clara , who stares straight ahead , with dark , solemn , severe eyes , occasionally putting her hand to her brow , because there is pain in there
1	where have they all gone ?
1	i would have broken every window in the house
1	even director behrens took up the phrase , although his very first move was to saddle joachim with four weeks of bed rest : it was necessary just to repair the worst damage , to reacclimatize him , and to stabilize his body temperature for now
1	beneath it , somewhat more blurred , was an engraved vignette-like emblem , which one could make out ( though best under a magnifying glass ) as a winged , serpentlike monster whose darting tongue was in the shape of an arrow
1	above all , the faust cantata differs from the apocalypse in its large orchestral interludes , which at times merely hint generally at the relation of the work to its subject by uttering a so be it !
1	my , my , tony—fever , you say ?
1	i have spoken of those two needy female souls who by selfless adoration have gained modest mention in the biography of a man who will surely prove immortal
1	do your best , dieckmann , the consul added
1	he arrived in his carriage and climbed the stairs supported by his cane and thomas buddenbrook ’ s arm
1	but there will be good times now , don ’ t you think , senator buddenbrook ?
1	it was probably produced according to his own specifications
1	contrary to all expectation-and to my silent , touched ,
1	they ’ re dreadfully afraid of an economic boom in kiel
1	settembrini , meanwhile , had become the advocate of nature and its nobility of health , ignoring any previous notions of emancipation
1	ominous sounds rose from the orchestra , a gloomy , threatening theme , which as hans castorp knew , moved through the whole opera until the catastrophic end , but here also served as the introduction to the little soldier ’ s aria—the next record
1	the clock hand jerked
1	and then i have a little stand on my chest of drawers where i put it at night and—
1	wait , stay here ! —the consul strode rapidly across the room
1	he was much too much a man of the semper idem and of self-assertion against circumstance to view as desirable a change in life 's scenery that would be simultaneous with the completion of a project pursued in the previous setting
1	then , with a laugh , he shook the senator ’ s hand and said , we can leave him to attend to his business
1	well , the boss would come into the office , and there we were , all eight of us , lying around like flies and smoking cigarettes to keep the mosquitoes away at least
1	but perhaps it is not yet too late for you to hear
1	he won ’ t take any chances
1	one could use other terms for his kindheartedness—an insipid phrase like purity of soul , for instance , or a more serious and beautiful word like modesty , or disparaging words such as avoidance of the truth and hypocrisy , or even a phrase about the mystic piety of shyness—and hans castorp ’ s reaction to the sounds from the adjoining room combined something of them all and was visible now as a shadow of respectability that darkened his face , as if he should not know and did not want to know anything about what he heard there
1	it was a very inadequate insight , based on vulgar intuition and lacking real moral profundity , and so perfectly worthy of frau stöhr—which was why hans castorp replied only with a tired , disdainful glance when she expressed it in her coarse , bantering way
1	did you hear , mama ?
1	herr tietge ’ s constant severe coughing spells meant that the floor around his lectern was covered with the mucus he coughed up
1	i could not even compare the change now taking place with the period when i was already a university student and he was still in high school
1	that nobility , however , is contained within the mind , within reason , and therefore you will level the charge of christian obscurantism against me quite in vain
1	it was an outburst of temper
1	there was music here , too
1	does a woman feel she owes boundless subservience to a man who would confer the favor of his love on such a lowly creature , or does she see in the man ’ s love for her an unerring token of his superiority ?
1	down in town , street level had shifted oddly until shops had become cellars you entered by descending stairways of snow
1	when the director came to a halt in front of hans castorp , he was wearing glasses with thick , circular lenses and was babbling nonsense
1	frau grünlich now rang the bell ; and thinka , the housemaid , entered from the hallway and was told to lift the child from her tower and take her to the nursery
1	the hall was decorated with flowers , and an altar had been set up on the right side
1	and we were children-but i am moved to look back not out of nostalgia , but for his sake and at the thought of his fate , which ordained that he ascend from that valley of innocence to inhospitable , indeed terrifying heights
1	it was quite a different matter whether he would ever be able to bury his chin in such a necktie , tied so that it filled the wide opening created by his grandfather ’ s peculiarly shaped collar , whose pointed tips brushed the old man ’ s cheeks
1	the grotesque part was the vast machinery of scientific witnesses brought in to prove the humbug to be a humbug , a scandalous insult to truth-yet from that angle there was in fact no arguing with a dynamically and historically productive fiction , with a so-called fraud , with , that is , a community-building belief ; and the look on its advocates ' faces grew all the more sardonically arrogant the more diligently one attempted to refute them on a basis that for them was totally alien and irrelevant , on the basis of science , of respectable , objective truth
1	approval for that , however , could no longer be obtained that night
1	goes right to the bone
1	a little bracing coming from a warm bed
1	there are people with whom it is not easy to live , but whom it is impossible to leave
1	sister alfreda had already packed her bag and departed from the berghof , having received an urgent call to report to another moribund patient at a different sanatorium
1	what did you think it was ?
1	well , my lad , he said , patting him a few times on the back of his head as he sat down beside him at the dining table , across from his wife , how are things going ?
1	herr grünlich had finished his breakfast , and the odor of two cigars blended with the warm air from the stove
1	the conversation was a true sacrifice on my part
1	at last , something different , you see , something out of the ordinary , powerful—a savage storm , a tempest
1	but in his present irritable mood , it seemed to him as if that hostile force was making him a stranger in his own house
1	what suspense , what subterranean activity
1	suits us just fine that you ’ re willing to put up with us for a time
1	there was the red façade with its bay and the white caryatides ; and as they walked out of the noon warmth of the street into the cool of the paved entrance , the senator came out to greet them from his office , his pen still in his hand
1	i don ’ t know what you ’ re talking about , and i don ’ t want to know
1	under normal circumstances , the population , the streets , even the warehouses were matters of complete indifference to him , but the moment they were raised to the status of questions on a test , they filled him with reluctant despair
1	good god , i ’ m speaking in banalities , but when one is young , everything is , of course , new—new and astounding
1	what profession had he chosen ?
1	shut up and try to make some progress here , he said
1	and there ’ s the last child , little gisela…
1	later , after ten years of exile , he was able to return to his native land and work as a lawyer in milan , but that in no way prevented him from continuing to call—with voice and pen , in verse and prose—for the freedom and unity of his country , to draft revolutionary programs with passionate autocratic élan and to proclaim in a lucid style that liberated peoples must unite and forge their universal happiness
1	now and then little drops pricked at the windowpane
1	they spoke of gerda ’ s trip , about the train she was planning to take , and about the sale of the villa , along with the furniture , which herr gosch the broker was managing
1	you will call me when it ’ s time to eat ?
1	today we can see clearly enough that it was the mistake of our civilization to have been all too generous in exe'rcising such forbearance and respect-since on the opposing side we were indeed dealing with naked insolence and the most determined intolerance
1	now for-get the pain !
1	yes , it ’ s true , sad to say
1	not without a certain petulance in his voice , joachim remarked that they could probably go take their rest cure now
1	don ’ t deserve it at all , inasmuch as you are my patients—both of you now
1	less path to salvation ?
1	returning to the stairway now , still absorbed in that fleeting glimpse , hans castorp instinctively tried to make the same large , meaningful , and deliberate eyes as those : -of the dying man ; and it was with that look that he greeted a lady who had emerged from a door behind him and caught up with him now at the head of the stairs
1	all the same , after a long , looping flight , the fly came to rest again on grandfather ’ s fingers , sitting up pertly very close to the ivory cross
1	even hanno had to help—time was short , and his handwriting was neat and legible
1	he knocked at the door of a k ferge , who then roused ferdinand wehsal and herr albin from their chairs in the lower lounging area
1	under the handsome upward sweep of his moustache , the corners of his mouth were drawn into the familiar , delicate , dry , critical smile
1	i was absent the day this was assigned , he said with a rough edge to his voice
1	for one brief moment everything was completely still
1	the responsibility is definitely yours and not mine from the moment you do take over
1	by the way , conjuring nothing more than a little rain , in the dialect of fulda
1	but johann buddenbrook was already dead
1	did you sleep well , consul buddenbrook ?
1	without disease life would never have fared well its whole life long
1	damnation , hans castorp thought , both bewildered and abashed , that was a regular aria !
1	a young chinese fellow , however , at the other end of the table , whose knowledge of german was scant , had not understood , but had both heard and seen , and announced his own happy satisfaction by calling out très bien ! —and even applauded
1	god knows how much he understood
1	the consul would sit down in a large armchair and lay his head back , herr wenzel would begin to lather his soap—and then there almost always ensued a conversation that started with the weather and how each had slept , but soon turned to events in the great , wide world , moved on to the town ’ s domestic affairs , and generally concluded with very personal matters of business and family
1	i ’ m not itching for another excursion
1	she asked , wringing her hands—but not so that anyone could see
1	he praised the fact that it had been held in broad daylight , that the old pastor 's wedding homily had been short and plain , and that there had been no unseemly speeches at the meal-no speeches at all , just to be on the safe side
1	grünlich has been very cross the last few days , absolutely insufferable , i must say !
1	around us is rolling farmland , gouged and battered to sludge
1	but you don ’ t blame me , do you ?
1	his indifference was so vast that he hardly ever noticed what was happening around him , in whose company he might be , and the fact that he very rarely addressed by name the person with whom he was speaking leads me to believe that he did not know it , though the addressee had every right to assume so
1	no , it 's only proper
1	he appeared to be excessively sensitive to the noise of wagons pulling into the farmyard , to the sound of voices
1	i will not ! —and the reaction in the hall was the usual
1	but there ’ s gon na be a revolution , sure as rain
1	does he like school ?
1	one finds oneself among strangers , shows oneself from one ’ s best side , chooses one ’ s words , and tries to please—that ’ s quite normal
1	he kept climbing along the serpentine path
1	their signs were now directed to the matter of teatime refreshments
1	no longer a resident of the international sanatorium berghof , settembrini had been living with lukaček , the ladies ’ tailor , for several weeks
1	and out of this worldwide festival of death , this ugly rutting fever that inflames the rainy evening sky all round—will love someday rise up out of this , too ? i used the stimulus that your presence obviously provided to provoke him to speak his last word on certain matters
1	they always want it to be both/and ; they want it all
1	joachim asked as they climbed the looping road to the berghof
1	good god , you don ’ t say ?
1	is that not a generalization ?
1	how ’ s your cabbage-roll doing , castorp ?
1	because lea gerhardt was deaf , it was customary for her to read aloud on jerusalem evenings—the ladies thought she read most beautifully and touchingly
1	moreover , concurrent with the uprising and subsequent executions in munich , fever and chills announced an attack of influenza that kept me in bed for ten days and continued to sap the intellectual and physical powers of my sixty-year-old body for some time ; and so it is no wonder that since i put the first lines of this account to paper , spring and summer have now become late autumn
1	no , good lord , he was not a nice-looking customer , the poet said , lifting his brows and shoving a nicely arranged forkful of ham , brussels sprouts , and potatoes into his mouth
1	herr settembrini did not doubt that the honorable gentleman had means and methods by which to reconcile his office as a teacher of latin with his disdain for the glories of roman civilization
1	it is his topic , after all
1	it is easy to see that the book did not bear its menacing title in vain , for it dealt with violence as the triumphant counterpart of truth
1	what i ’ ve eaten is clear at the back of my mouth , but these muscles here , along the neck—they just won ’ t work
1	you are now at an age , my son , when you are beginning to harvest the fruits of the upbringing your parents have been pleased to give you
1	yes , wenzel , i can not imagine the whole enterprise without you
1	it is rather embarrassing to hear , with the bridal pair right there in front of you
1	never mind , old fellow , don ’ t worry
1	and so he plunged ahead in his long , wooden slippers , gliding down the slope and pushing his way up the next hill , atop which , a little farther off , stood a wooden hut—a hayshed or little barn , with its roof weighted down with stones
1	will my brother live until tomorrow or not ?
1	it simply interested me very much
1	the russians , deutschlin said sententiously , have depth , but no form
1	she heard her brother and sister-in-law enter the breakfast room , heard them stop in the middle of the room , instinctively waiting for her to end her devotions—but she did not let that hurry her
1	as he said it , frau permaneder laid a hand on his arm and whispered imploringly , thomas , mother is lying in the next room !
1	it was said that he changed his shirt every day , sometimes twice a day , and that he perfumed his handkerchief and even his mustache , trimmed à la napoleon iii
1	he added that never had he more regretted not being a physician but a mere numismatist , and at that moment the study of coins truly seemed to me the most futile of sciences , even more useless than philology-an utterly unsustainable position
1	i have no great desire to throw a ball and have young people leaping around in here—there ’ s not room enough , anyway
1	what did the maid scream when she burst in on you ?
1	god was - great in us
1	this woman or none , he had said , and it must have been more or less the same for gerda , too , because , until she was twenty-seven , she had rebuffed every suitor in amsterdam—and then suddenly had accepted this one
1	but those are matters from a later period , though they all belong in a chapter dealing with leverkuhn 's years in leipzig
1	and now the matter lay in the hands of the prosecutor , and the prosecutor was dr moritz hagenström
1	hans castorp was not so dull that he had not noticed that much quite accurately , but he also sensed an inhibiting , restraining effect on his own civilian sentiments—indeed it may have been this proximity , the example he took from it and its supervisory aspect , that kept him from overt actions and blind adventures
1	tony laid the wreath over the golden letters of her father ’ s name , which had only recently been added to the stone , and despite the snow she knelt down on the grave to pray softly ; her black veil fluttered about her , and her broad skirt lay spread out beside her in soft , picturesque folds
1	and that was all
1	my age and the composure that age should , proverbially , bring do not suffice for me to master it with a firmer and steadier hand
1	the sharp , precise , intense shadows of houses , trees , and telegraph poles cast on the sparkling surface looked more real and significant than the objects themselves
1	truth and justice are the crown jewels of individual morality ; and should a conflict arise with the interests of the state , they may very well appear to be hostile to it , but in fact are directed toward the state ’ s higher—one may even say , transcendent—good
1	at that time , may , the first austrian performance of salome was to take place in graz , the capital of styria , with the composer himself conducting-the same opera whose world premiere a few months earlier adrian had traveled with kretzschmar to dresden to see ; and he now told his teacher and the friends he had made by then in leipzig that he wanted to participate in the gala occasion and hear once more this successfully revolutionary work-to whose aesthetic sphere he was not in the least drawn , but which of course interested him in its technical musical aspects , particularly the way prose dialogue had been set to music
1	dr krokowski , who made his rounds at this hour without the director , was speaking in russian with the rude married couple , inquiring , so it seemed , about the husband ’ s state of health and checking his fever chart
1	for with that i have dreamed my dream to its end , to its goal
1	yes , herr kistenmaker was saying the same thing just this morning
1	in naphta ’ s organic interior , the illness that had been the physical cause—or , must we say , pretext—for the premature end to his career in the order was making rapid strides , and the elevated and spare conditions under which he lived could not arrest its spread
1	the fat lady , or in the exceedingly vulgar remarks and horrible obscenities that the devil secretly urged them to blurt out during the sacrifice of the mass and that dr schleppfuss supplied verbatim , with interlaced fingertips
1	tous les dé vous savez
1	no one with any common sense could call that a narrative
1	no , wait , herr settembrini , all i mean is that he has a moist spot , and that prevents him from becoming a priest
1	it was a miracle of the soul—the ultimate miracle , perhaps , in the eyes of unscrupulous beauty , who gave it her blessing ; yet it was regarded with mistrust , and for valid reasons , by the responsible eye of someone playing king , who affirmed life and loved its organic wholeness
1	only miss robinson , closed off to the world as always , appeared indifferent
1	six weeks had indeed passed since that evening when hans castorp had made clavdia chauchat ’ s acquaintance and returned to his room considerably later than conscientious joachim to his ; six weeks since the morning after , the day of frau chauchat ’ s departure—her departure for now , her temporary departure for daghestan , far to the east , beyond the caucasus
1	he looked pale—even though his whole body was perspiring , his hands and feet were cold
1	he took his seat and mechanically poured some porter in the tall , heavy glass
1	it ’ s all growing splendidly , i can tell you that
1	i am forty-three years old
1	and ida jungmann had her self-respect , too
1	in the corridor they ran into the nurse again , who squinted with nearsighted curiosity as she watched them pass
1	her hand still in his , he turned toward his parents and lowered his face to the baby girl , who was breathing in rapid , noisy gasps , and for a whole minute he took in the warm , benign , touching fragrance she emitted
1	look here : the most dynamic , thrilling sequence of variations , of events , of movement , but all within time , consisting solely of time divided , filled up , organized-and only once given a vague push toward the concrete action of the plot by the trumpet 's repeated distant signal
1	hans castorp said nothing , and in doing so only revealed the gloom within
1	how could i not have been reminded later , then , of this comparison-which at the
1	but do i dare risk it ?
1	to be sure , there were not only incubi , but succubi as well , and indeed there had been a depraved young man in that classical age who had lived with an idol whose devilish jealousy he would come to know in the end
1	the large gardens stretching down to the trave , and the house set back from the road , and the driveway bordered with chestnuts
1	she calls it a stirletto—isn ’ t that capital !
1	i have work to do now ; and you might spend a few days taking care of the english correspondence
1	james tienappel , whom hans castorp addressed by turns as uncle james or simply james , was a long-legged gentleman nearing forty , who wore english suits and linens white as cherry blossoms ; he had thinning , canary-yellow hair , very close-set blue eyes , a straw-colored moustache trimmed so close that it was almost not there , and perfectly manicured hands
1	the consul had to admit that
1	but as far as the senator ’ s mood goes , if i may say so—the senator ’ s looking a bit pale again this morning
1	with stubborn slowness , her energies continued to wane
1	he told me that he had written you , that you ’ d be coming
1	these men can not be thanked enough , and they are proof that the democracy of the west-however outdated its institutions may prove over time , however obstinately its notion of freedom resists what is new and necessary-is nonetheless essentially on the side of human progress , of the goodwill to perfect society , and is by its very nature capable of renewal , improvement , rejuvenation , of proceeding toward conditions that provide greater justice in life
1	i ’ ve had it for now , at any rate
1	she came to him
1	but all the same , hans castorp decided to stay here for now , since the overhanging roof provided the illusion of some hospitality , and the side of the hut facing the mountains , which hans castorp now sought out , actually did offer a little protection against the storm , if you leaned back so that one shoulder touched its rough-hewn logs—since long skis made it inconvenient to press your back to it
1	the room , chilled by winter , lay in total darkness
1	as if quite by chance , he directed a remark to the young lady , and introducing both himself and joachim to her by name , he pulled over a third enameled chair for her—the better for him to put on his show
1	rubble of our cities , the thunder of russian cannons rolls on toward berlin , for the anglo-saxons the crossing of the rhine was child 's play and was made that , it seems , by the uniting of our own will with tha�
1	upon returning to his mother ’ s home , he moved into his old room off the corridor on the second floor , but spent more time at the club than on meng strasse , because life was not made easy for him there
1	i could have become a clergyman , too
1	no one understands where all these rumors are coming from , how they get started ; but somehow they find their way from behind the doors and spread out into the street
1	you love order more than liberty , all europe knows that
1	however matters stood , he was firmer than ever in his resolve not to lift a finger to help
1	it cost me a pretty penny to puff it a bit , too
1	i said with a laugh as well
1	tut , tut , tut , he clicked his tongue
1	this , then , is how beauty happens : the cellos intone all by themselves a somber , pensive theme that questions the world 's folly in a forthright and highly expressive philosophical 'why ' addressed to our hustle and bustle , our hounding and harrying
1	but they were both bareheaded , even hans castorp , and so they merely walked on ahead reverently , in single file behind karen karstedt , who led the way , placing their weight on the balls of their feet and making what looked like a series of little bows to the right and left
1	and your good father ?
1	well then , help yourself to the wineglass
1	in it will be found the impulses-indeed their seeds are already found-for shaping not just the technical realization of a new economic organization , not just for a thoroughgoing cleansing of the natural interrelations of life , but also for the founding of new political orders
1	i find myself in a highly peculiar and extremely ticklish position
1	happy-always a questionable adjective , by the way-it is because i was drawn much more strongly into the sphere of his studies than he into mine , and because theological air did not suit me , seemed uncanny , made it difficult for me to breathe easily , and presented me with a dilemma of conscience
1	she would wake up every morning here without a care in the world
1	it earns its livelihood from various industries ( machine tools , leather , textiles , armatures , chemicals , and assorted mills ) ; and the historical museum , which features a chamber with crude instruments of torture , contains a very excellent library of twenty-five thousand volumes and five thousand manuscripts , among them two alliterative magic charms that scholars consider older than those of merseburg-and of quite harmless import
1	hans castorp continued to hold back
1	his laugh came a little late now and he said , he called it home , did he ?
1	what good are fine manners if i ’ m being cheated up one side and down the other ?
1	old hinrich played underhanded tricks on grandfather and father , and if hermann hasn ’ t been able to do you any serious harm , if he hasn ’ t been able to put a spoke in your wheels , it ’ s because you haven ’ t given him a chance
1	he had some chocolate in his breeches pocket and had slipped a little bottle of port into his vest
1	i leave it to you whether one should praise barbarism for it or not
1	who was the woman in black out in the garden ?
1	i felt that in some way i had always loved him , and i must admit that my compassion for him was far more intense than for the unfortunate woman who , though pitiable in her sunken state , had been brought to this heinous act by suffering and the demoralizing vice that numbs it
1	he , naphta , asserted this to counter the impudence with which materialistic science passed off as absolute knowledge all its astronomical bunkum and windy palaver about the universe
1	thank god , people smoke all over the world , there ’ s nowhere you could possibly end up , as far as i know , where tobacco ’ s unknown
1	i mean their placement , their shape
1	the audience almost died laughing at his parlando falsetto , at the contrast between this bear of a voice and his talent for tongue twisters
1	he apparently used music paper because nothing else was available at the moment , or because the little shop down below on st agapitus square could supply him with no acceptable stationery
1	he was sitting at his desk and as i entered looked up with only a fleeting and , as it were , disparaging glance
1	an example of this was that married woman who , in the trusting , slumbering presence of her husband , had carried on with an incubus , for years
1	oh , i haven ’ t slept a wink yet
1	it was nine or ten days later before it happened again , and there was no need to comment on it
1	and she was out of the room
1	a man climbs jauntily up into the wonderful variety of jagged , towering , fissured forms to test his vital energies , because he has never had to spend them
1	an absurd statement , if you like
1	the house is going to be as crowded as a chicken coop soon enough
1	i would like to know with what eyes those epochs would have regarded the man from wittenberg who , as we learned from jonathan , some hundred and more years previously had conceived an experiment for making music visible , which we indeed saw demonstrated on occasion
1	the cock crowed , the pig grunted , peas flew
1	for he had been unaware of my approach
1	i would like to provide a vivid illustration of the jauntiness that so depressed me
1	you had no ambition , uncle gotthold
1	the most characteristic feature of her face , with its rather long nose and small mouth , was the lack of any indentation between lower lip and chin
1	it ’ s never used , or at least hardly ever , for what ’ s been happening to me
1	yes , joachim said , it looks bad
1	laden with snow , the greenish-black pine forest marched up the slopes , and between the trees every inch of ground was cushioned soft with snow
1	it all had to do with the next generation , the propagation of the human species , yes indeed
1	it is not easy to describe even th� simplest things without resorting to musical notation , which would give this little work an all too scholarly , technical appearance
1	he stood with both feet in the present and worried little about the family ’ s past , although at one time he had contributed a few entries to the heavy gilt-edged notebook in his own somewhat ornate hand , most of them , however , concerning his first marriage
1	o lord , i find it simply sublime
1	well , consul , sir , corl smolt said , somewhat intimidated now
1	you may speak frankly
1	in that case , the consul decided , he would have to make the best of it and hand over whatever sum was necessary
1	it was true , after all , that for hans castorp the relationship with poor karen was a kind of substitute , a vaguely useful device—but that was true of all his other charitable enterprises as well
1	for a person like myself , when dealing with a subject as dear to the heart , as searingly urgent as this , it is very difficult , indeed it verges on impudence , to assume the standpoint of the composer and to treat the matter with an artist 's playful equanimity
1	it was merely because we just happened to stumble on the subject
1	she was even ready to assert that on two or three occasions her friend and sister-in-law , tony , had managed y ’ all take care now !
1	forgive me , mynheer peeperkorn , hans castorp replied , but my sentiments toward you , sentiments of the greatest respect and admiration , would make it unseemly for me to say anything to you about my sentiments toward your traveling companion
1	by retarding or heavily accenting some very simple harmonic maneuver , he gave it a higher , mysterious , precious meaning
1	a solicitous , bespectacled young man and i lifted poor rudolf out of the car , behind which two or three other streetcars were now backed up
1	it was pfahl , a farmer from the ritzerau district , deputy for the village of klein schretstaken
1	i haven ’ t been able to catch it any time it ’ s been mentioned … and it ’ s making me downright nervous
1	he saw himself walking with his brother , christian , in the garden of the house on meng strasse , caught up in a quarrel , in one of their deeply regrettable , heated disputes
1	have amost only such , amost only nicknames , with which the people give my chin a chuck , so to speak-the
1	for no plans had been made for bringing people from the station to the farm-and frau schweigestill , whom helene and i looked for in the kitchen and found along with clementina very hastily fixing a snack of coffee , finger sandwiches , and cooled cider for all these people , explained with no little dismay that adrian had not said a word to prepare her for this mvaswn
1	i keep it at the ready for the day when all this malarkey here gets too boring and i shall have the honor of paying my final regards
1	what does high society matter to you ?
1	a regular hustle and bustle !
1	and only now came the shimmering chorus of brass instruments-from the dapper trumpet , whose bright alarms , jaunty tunes , and melting cantabiles can be seen in its very form , via that darling of the romantic period , the convoluted french horn ; via the slender , powerful slide trombone and the valve cornet ; to the fundamental gravity of the great bass tuba
1	do you see the diaphragm ?
1	but the two must be compatible , damn it
1	and only five days ago , i paid a morning visit to herr arnoldsen to ask permission to sue for his daughter ’ s hand
1	quite a distance out of town—not far from the first village , in fact—was a little farmstead , a tiny , almost worthless piece of property that didn ’ t even have a name
1	composure up and down the line
1	the suggestion had been hans castorp ’ s , and although joachim had some doubts at first because of poor karen , he had yielded , admitting that it would have been pointless to play hide-and-seek with her , shielding her out of anxiety , à la cowardly frau stöhr , from anything that might remind her of her mortality
1	grieskramer zeile , a crooked narrow way with no sidewalk , and among its houses nikolaus leverkiihn 's was the most imposing
1	i am kindly disposed to the discretion you show in leaving the german rendering to me
1	you mustn ’ t take that all too seriously , she said
1	could i have done anything else ?
1	the consul was busy with his cigar and the advertiser
1	the candles on the tall tree had burned down and gone out , leaving the manger in darkness ; but a few candles were still burning on the trees on the table ; now and then a sprig would crackle as it was singed by a nearby flame , adding to the fragrance that filled the room
1	h e repeated triumphantly
1	finally he gave up and left it all to god
1	rather than construe from my informed state that i am not present in the flesh , you would do better to conclude that i am not merely in the flesh , but am also he for whom you have taken me all this time
1	who knows whether anything worth mentioning will even show up , or whether i won ’ t have rid myself of my fever by then and can bid you all adieu
1	and hans castorp ’ s heart hardened against herr settembrini ; he scowled and pursed his lips whenever their paths crossed—and herr settembrini ’ s flashing black eyes would rest on him in silent reproach
1	the plot was years in the planning , and one could not deny it a certain sad success-over time , solitude 's defenselessness against such wooing became evident , although it proved the ruin of the wooer
1	how are your admirable constitutions doing ?
1	it is truly remarkable : an esoteric early renown such as had begun to be associated with leverkiihn 's name , although totally hidden from the broad masses , has its focus in certain initiated spheres , in a response among leading experts , of which the invitation to paris had been a token ; but at the same time that renown may also be reflected in humbler , more modest realms , in the needy emotions of poor souls whose lonely and passionate sensibilities ( cloaked as higher aspirations ) remove them from the masses and who find happiness in a veneration they cherish all the more for its very rarity
1	neither can there be any doubt that the young man could not help responding to an emotion pressed upon him out of such torment and intellectual superiority
1	he might put his finger on a transition that held together only on the surface , but had no organization and jeopardized the natural flow of the composition
1	his white , close-cropped beard stood out against his red face , but his upper lip was clean-shaven , revealing a small , comical , and mobile mouth , with only two teeth left in his lower jaw
1	the cure regimen—the exalted and inviolable rules
1	her untutored sister , madame kethelsen , however , had recently begun to go rapidly deaf and so had understood almost nothing at all of tony ’ s misfortune
1	but then it was learned that mademoiselle tony was retrieving notes from a poorly plastered-over hollow in the old tree just outside the burg gate , and was leaving a few notes there herself , all of them either from or addressed to that same high-school student
1	you ’ re asking if i ’ m feeling better after these few days , is that it ?
1	having arrived in pfeiffering before us , this vehicle was now put to good use traveling back and forth between the little station and the schweigestill farm , transporting small groups of those guests who preferred not to walk-and the weather held , although there was a thunderstorm growling softly on the horizon
1	i read that question somewhere , i am not sure where , certainly in some prominent place
1	can it be possible ?
1	the valley ’ s famous for its wildflowers
1	you kept toasting glasses with me
1	he loved to pace about his classroom with long strides and grew astoundingly animated as he laid out for each student the future course of his life , always with the manifest purpose of stimulating his imagination
1	hans castorp watched as sasha and his mother were ushered in , and at the same moment the door to the corridor opened and the next scheduled patient arrived—a little early , since the lab was running late
1	i did happen to hear a little of a recent conversation between kesselmeyer and grünlich
1	relatives had come for the funeral from frankfurt and hamburg , and for the last time they partook of the hospitality of the house on meng strasse
1	but for a still-undetermined period , which , no matter what , was sure to last into some of winter , indeed , given assumptions and circumstances up here , would very probably include the whole season
1	my human powers of intuition tell me : it had happened when dr helmut had approached her , man to woman , and begun to court her
1	lieutenant ziemssen died , not to mention a good many less honorable folks who have joined the dance of death
1	i did not know , though i should have realized , that all this was driving toward a new work-that is , toward cosmic music , with which he had become preoccupied , once the episode of new songs was over
1	they were now almost at the door of the austere yellow building where the council held its meetings in the ground-floor assembly room
1	she had paid close attention , but it had not been mentioned once during dinner , and it hadn ’ t seemed quite proper to ask at that point
1	was the ironic question hans castorp posed to his cousin on his third day
1	know very well that is what people mean when they attach the word barbarism to adrian 's creation
1	take him as the example of how subjectivity transforms itself into objectivity !
1	did you get here late , too ?
1	when it comes to notes , what is ever absolutely new !
1	twenty-two years have now passed since clarissa 's pitiable destiny was fulfilled , and i shall report it in its chronological place
1	all the better , if that is so
1	but , dear boy , this is not the manner of your malady 's eruption
1	it ’ s all these crazy things you ’ ve been telling me
1	it holds its own against all impressions that might suppress it , does not tolerate them out of self-preservation
1	the master had worked all evening , well into the night , on the credo , the credo with its fugue , never giving a thought to his evening meal , which still stood on the stove , whereupon the serving girls , having waited long in vain , at last yielded to nature and went to bed
1	hans castorp kept his tobacco away from the deleterious effects of the house ’ s steam heat by storing it in the cellar , and every morning he would descend to provide his cigar case with its daily ration
1	i said almost nothing on the stairs
1	the young people agreed with them both , first the one and then the other
1	rigor ’ —you used the word in regard to certain views i expressed just now
1	have a good time
1	that is the middle ages
1	she cried , close to fury
1	the one for five francs
1	she was a prosaic soul , this protestant nurse
1	it goes without saying that the choice of the thirteen songs was totally his own ; i had not the slightest influence on it
1	she lived a peaceful life with her daughter and granddaughter there on linden platz ; she was in constant contact with the house on fischer grube and with her former boarding-school friend armgard von maiboom , née schilling , who had moved to town after her husband ’ s death
1	another one of your jokes
1	his deep affection for a girl named barbel , the only daughter of a widowed sexton , was returned , and he wanted to marry her ; but the couple 's wish met with resistance from the father , for klopfgeissel was a poor fellow , and the sexton demanded that he first achieve a worthy position in life , become a master in his trade , before he would give him his daughter
1	because i felt that i simply had to comply with this last request of my dying daughter
1	a number of the representatives from the countryside had decided to stay at home , given current circumstances
1	which brings me right back to the ceterum censeo of my late father : the customs union
1	an impresario is a kind of nurse , une espece d'infirmier , voila !
1	all the rest is elaboration , the grindstone
1	he was consumed by his own restless energy , which for him had always been something different from his father ’ s natural and solid joy in work , something artificial , more like a nervous itch , practically a drug—like the pungent little russian cigarettes he constantly smoked
1	simply went right over my head ?
1	fräulein arnoldsen , tony ’ s roommate from boarding school , whose father , a notable merchant and an almost even more notable virtuoso on the violin , was likewise present , as were his married daughter and her husband
1	but that was not the only problem
1	what do you drink for breakfast , julie ?
1	and i protest yet a third time , against the harrowing alternative you have presented us with : prussianism or gothic reaction
1	good eyes , he said , good stock , an honest , sound , tidy gentleman
1	these the remarks of an old man who has seen something of life
1	one might say that the figure of this kirghiz emerged imperceptibly out of the fog and into his life , slowly taking on clarity and palpability , until the moment when he was most near , most physically present , there in the schoolyard , stood there in the foreground for a while , and then gradually receded and vanished again into the fog , without even the pain of farewell
1	finally he stood up , tossed joachim ’ s blanket back on the bed , and with wrenched lips he muttered something that sounded like : good night
1	there was something on her mind , one great , inescapable question that occupied all her anxious thoughts and that would have to be dealt with before many hours had passed
1	the same prodigious meals were also served at the so-called bad russian table ; moving in rotation , even rhadamanthus folded his gigantic hands before his plate there ; and the people of several nations who dined at it were honorable members of humanity , even if they did not understand latin and were not excessively dainty about their table manners
1	the renaissance , the enlightenment , and the teachings of nineteenth-century science and economics have omitted nothing , absolutely nothing , that seemed even vaguely useful for furthering such degradation , beginning with modern astronomy—which turned the focal point of the universe , that sublime arena where god and satan struggled to possess the creature whom they both ardently coveted , into an unimportant little planet , and , for now at least , has put an end to man ’ s grand position in the cosmos , upon which astrology was likewise based
1	two other members were even more remarkable—a pair of twins , two quaint old maids dressed in very faded frocks and shepherdess hats from the last century , who wandered about town , hand in hand , doing good deeds
1	that afternoon adrian and i took a walk around the cattle trough and up mount zion
1	there are ways—and i shall go to dr gieseke , who is a friend of christian ’ s , and he will stand by me
1	what followed was likewise received as a droll introduction of humorous intent , and although the immobility of his face , the weariness of his glance , and his pallor spoke against this , the response that greeted him around the room was first one of laughter-soft snorts through the nose or titters from the ladies
1	but that was a mishap that revealed itself only later
1	and since ancient times how many things of that sort had not been said , and with deep emotion , about the female !
1	the room glistened with white from all the milk—a large glass at every place , a good pint of it at least
1	i don ’ t understand… i don ’ t understand… tony sobbed in bewilderment , rubbing her head like a kitten against his caressing hand
1	from then on he had lessons twice a week with wendell kretzschmar
1	the few paths still passable were like tunnels , with snow piled man-high on both sides , forming walls like slabs of alabaster , grainy with beautiful sparkling crystals , a surface guests found useful for drawing pictures or writing messages—news , jokes , ribaldries
1	on certain days of the year—on palm sunday , when there were confirmations , or on new year ’ s day—senator buddenbrook would take the carriage for a round of obligatory social calls ; and since his wife preferred to excuse herself on such occasions with a migraine or a simple case of nerves , he would invite hanno to join him
1	it is amusing to note , by the way , how very much your humanism , and probably all humanism , tends toward medieval geocentrism-by necessity , evidently
1	they all want to get married at the first opportunity
1	the advance of the muscovites into our prospective granary , the ukraine , and the elastic withdrawal of our troops to a line along the dnieper has accompanied my work-or rather , the work has accompanied those events
1	a rooster crowed very loudly , and wasservogel , at the back of the room , made sounds like a grunting pig , although you couldn ’ t tell that the noise was coming from somewhere inside him
1	and if little johann buddenbrook was ever to accomplish what life had called him to do and the senator expected of him , they must above all give attention to strengthening and enhancing his less-than-robust constitution , first by taking necessary precautions , and second by a program for systematically toughening his mettle
1	one could hardly even call it a coiffure
1	she said , and it was unbelievable how she could draw out those three brief syllables
1	then he admitted that it was a matter that one should look into and earnestly commissioned her to find out what could be found out about the comings and goings of this fellow countryman
1	that ’ s a maxim that would be accepted in any court of honor , i can assure you of that , by god
1	they laughed so hard they almost burst
1	he saw what i saw and snatched the note away , saying , good sir and brother , what vain pertness is this !
1	i thought you wanted to join the military someday , a healthy man
1	would you like tea ?
1	i just want to fondle her !
1	thought it could do without the word , because it regarded itself as ranking higher than the word , whereas it ranked lower
1	like all of us , you have your good points and your bad
1	as if dazed , people would say , why , look at that !
1	every man had to untangle the riddle on his own , had to work diligently at it , at hot speed , all by himself ; before it was too late , he must either achieve some clear readiness for death , or die in despair
1	so much , then , for today about an instrument that was not one , at least not in the sense others were , for it lacked any special quality
1	amateur photography had always played an important role in the world of the berghof ; but twice now—and we have lingered up here long enough to experience periodic reoccurrences of such epidemics—it had become a passion that made fools of everyone for weeks and months
1	nevertheless , he blurted out a monotone cry of furious amazement at what he now heard
1	but life has robbed me of my trust in my fellow man
1	he is sly , always wanting to speculate the elements
1	little johann sat on the laundry basket hour after hour , watching it all , listening to each gurgling sound
1	he spoke , as always , extraordinarily distinctly , firmly , with clear , reasonable articulation , even though his voice whistled with asthma all the while
1	and one more thing , dear gerda
1	a hand slapped the back of his chair
1	that is—those are—gentlemen , let me call your attention to—cerebrum , cerebral , you understand
1	and yet there was something here-and that elfin mockery seemed to express an awareness of it-that made one incapable of believing in time , in its vulgar work and its power over this gracious presence ; and that something was that presence 's strange selfcontainment , its authority as the very presence of the child on earth , the sense that it instilled of its having come down to us , of its beingto repeat myself-an adorable envoy , a sense that cradled reason in dreams beyond logic and with a tinge of our christian heritage
1	ism is friendly to science ; but that can not be , for one can not regard the subjects of science as the devil 's work without regarding science in the same light
1	that 's what you say , teutleben
1	and gregory himself said : cursed be the man who holds back his sword from shedding blood
1	he ’ s already shown his liberal tendencies , wilhelm has , and doesn ’ t share his brother ’ s secret disgust for the constitution
1	my heart is beating strong and knows why
1	she arrived only three days after this humane alert had been sent off , and hans castorp fetched her by sleigh from the station in dorf—stood there in a snow flurry on the platform before the little train arrived and composed his face , so that joachim ’ s mother would not be too alarmed at first glance , but would not read any false message of good cheer in it , either
1	i ’ m independent , have enough to live
1	his wife interrupted him
1	even friedrich wilhelm marcus is on hand
1	then the freemason sank down hard onto his chair and pressed his hands to his heart
1	and here silence is but natural , yet not twixt us nor over time-not when the hour-glass has been turned , not when the red sand has begun to run through that subtly subtle bottle neck
1	seven and four , hans castorp said
1	but was our friend hit , too ?
1	god and evil , the holy and the criminal all jumbled together
1	those were three of his worries
1	thanks heaps , neighbor , herr permaneder said , chewing away , not even noticing the shocked look on mamselle jungmann ’ s face
1	to engage in such idyllic practices , a man had to have an amazing surplus of one of life ’ s most precious commodities : time
1	and then we start heading toward winter
1	we recognized him a good distance off from that little beard he grew when he moved to the bad russian table
1	hold my - memory dear
1	the band shell , hidden behind evergreens , stood silent beside the pump room , and across the way was the pastry shop and the two swiss-style lodges separated by a long central building
1	i wish you every happiness , my dear , good little anna
1	and that outlandish name did not fit badly with his looks , which were not ordinary at all , indeed were decidedly foreign
1	he looked exactly the way tony had described him in her letter to her mother
1	for there were certain psychological preconditions , he said , that he could not fulfill : the desire for a love affair with the crowd , for wreaths , for groveling bows and kisses thrown amid crashing applause
1	he objected to the morphine because it could simulate a coma , which had not ensued as yet , and permitted only codeine
1	whatever your name may be , young man—fine , i knew it , but have since forgotten—depravity lies not in cocaine , not in opium , not in vice as such
1	do we have to do without necessities ?
1	i should have patterned my behavior-and i did try to do so-on that of adrian , who was not a schoolmaster , but an artist , and accepted things as they were , giving evidently no thought to their transience
1	frau permaneder suddenly blushed
1	he will insist on absolute cleanliness and attempt to prevent bedsores as long as possible—though in some cases it is not possible for long—by ordering that the patient ’ s position be constantly shifted
1	the album of light favorites lay on a stool next to it
1	his comments to joachim were limited to an expression of satisfaction that the annoyance was under control now that the director had taken a hand in the matter
1	at half past nine ’ —did you hear , cousin ?
1	he stood in front of her now , and she took his head between her hands and kissed him on the forehead
1	yes , it was all very different in the old days
1	mynheer peeperkorn arrived at the station in dorf on the evening train with madame chauchat and rode in the same sleigh with her to the berghof , where he also took his evening meal with her in the restaurant
1	what little breakfast he had eaten rebelled in his stomach , he felt nauseated , and his heart was just a quivering , wildly fluttering mass that took his breath away
1	take up your wineglass , young man , while i reach yet again for my water tumbler—it will do this modest vintage no further harm—
1	for i was apprehensive about the frivolity of that title and suggested the name symphonica cosmologica
1	reason and magic , he said , surely meet and become one in what is called wisdom , initiation , in a belief in the stars , in numbers
1	you have to hold it up to the other half , to its opposite
1	i am more or less quoting him , although his words , of course , were much more graphic and literary than mine , but that ’ s obvious
1	and what about you ?
1	so , i ’ ll be off now , and i ’ ll give orders for one of the warehouse lads to bring those bags here
1	i would like to know what sense of self-worth such a female answer represents
1	you smile , he went on , you blink and turn your head back and forth , endeavoring , it appears , to cogitate , but to no avail
1	he looks as if he ’ s sleeping , he said to be kind , although the considerable differences were obvious
1	echo , as everyone at once took to calling him , following his own example-or as much a description as clumsily approximate words can provide someone who was not present
1	the spot lay at the northwest edge of the level , fenced-in area on which the berghof was set , about feet above the valley floor
1	not prone to dangers ?
1	at the appointed hour , then , they met at the portal of the berghof
1	it was said , moreover , that he planned to break his contract with the zapfenstosser orchestra , to marry in paris , and to offer his services to the orchestre symphonique , a new musical organization that was only just forming
1	together , shakespeare and beethoven formed a binary star that outshone all else in his intellectual heavens , and he loved to show his student the remarkable affinities and correspondences in the creative principles and methods of those two giants-only one example of how far the stutterer 's pedagogic influence on my friend extended beyond that of a mere piano teacher
1	look closer now , my lad !
1	and the entire dining hall had burst into homeric laughter
1	but it was just such unbounded , nonchalant , peaceable subordination that annoyed thomas , because on any given occasion christian was so blithely docile that it appeared as if he set no value whatever in superiority , competence , seriousness , or respectability
1	they lie , arched over their knapsacks , the backs of their heads buried in the soft ground , their hands clutching at the air like talons
1	hermine kleefeld leaned her back against herr albin ’ s shoulder and held out her goblet for more champagne
1	a difficult text , the work of a great roman orator
1	one presumes that you will seek to break out of your isolation with deeds
1	well , i know her more internally , subcutaneously , if you get my drift
1	he watched the single cell of the fertilized egg transform itself into a multicelled organism that grew by cleavage and division , saw the cellular ball nestle up against the lamellae of the mucous membrane , saw the blastula fold in on itself to form a basin or cavity , which then assumed the task of receiving and digesting nourishment
1	and that nose is jewish , too—take a good look at him
1	she would turn her back on him
1	it ’ s really sad , isn ’ t it ?
1	peeperkorn did not reply
1	therese weichbrodt had read the christmas story from the bible , so impressively that all her vowels were out of place , and then she stepped back from her guests to stand in the doorway and deliver her little speech
1	and , staring out hopelessly from between the bars of his individuality , a man sees only the surrounding walls of external circumstance , until death comes and calls him home to freedom
1	apart from stiff armchairs distributed evenly along the walls , there was only a small sewing table at the window and , opposite the sofa , a fragile and expensive secretary loaded with knickknacks
1	be that as it may , he is no doubt an eloquent speaker , indeed loves to recite beautiful verses—but does that make the man a poet ?
1	they are all merely shades of one and the same important , primary interest : that is , the interest in human beings
1	hardly daring to risk it , he felt himself compelled to circle behind the figures and move on through the next double row of columns
1	well , he had pulled himself erect , had taken stock of the situation , confronted it calmly , and begun to set things in order
1	certain odd words come from her mouth , for which we know no reply , which cut off any retreat , as it were , which are themselves a covenant with death
1	and for its part , what was life ?
1	we boys , adrian and i , probably looked at each other with a dumbfounded , half-suppressed smile at a paternal remark like this about the vanity of the visible
1	you do know our head nurse , do you not ?
1	was it any wonder , then , that joachim ’ s excitement consisted not just of joy but also of fear , that the anguish of saying farewell to everything familiar kept him pacing his room ? —and that is without even mentioning marusya
1	is there anything more heartfelt , more glorious , he had cried , than such a sequence of basic triads ?
1	but it was all part of the same thing , tom
1	weak rattling , top right
1	madame buddenbrook said and with a customary swift motion took hold of her son ’ s arm
1	she simply could not get enough
1	the ambulance arrived surprisingly quickly
1	do not ape the words you hear floating in the air around you , young man , but speak a language appropriate to your civilized european life
1	yes , hard on you—and that ’ s not up your alley
1	music was struck up
1	in my eyes , phosphorescence of the sea , though sparkling with sound , was a very remarkable example of how an artist can put his best efforts into a task in
1	life makes it so dreadfully difficult , you know , to believe in anyone ’ s innocence
1	as matters now stood , hans castorp had almost totally renounced such feelings , and instead it was the italian who annoyed him with that conceited talk about parthians and scythians—without even specifying the bad russian table , where those students sat with heads of thick hair and not a trace of collar or cuff , arguing in their alien tongue , apparently unable to express themselves in any other , a boneless language that reminded hans castorp of a thorax without ribs , like the one director behrens had described recently
1	can anyone understand the hushed thrill with which the news , at first only a whispered hint , was borne from breite to meng strasse ?
1	unfortunately for the sexton 's daughter , the old woman alleged that the dragon had given her the task of making numerous proselytes , since for every person she brought to him with enticements to use his gifts , he would make her
1	in its fraternity jargon and cadence , medical authority had announced the true cause for the waywardness of hans castorp ’ s body temperature and offered its scientific opinion that the cause would not be difficult to overcome and that a cure and authorized release back to the flatlands suddenly loomed ahead in the near future
1	but it must be damn expensive , too , and the old consul would definitely never have allowed himself such extravagances
1	they are sitting at the dinner table ; the fruit has been served and is being enjoyed amid genial conversation
1	the fire crackled behind the shiny wrought-iron grate
1	a pure masterpiece , born out of the profoundest , most sacred depths of a whole nation ’ s emotions—its most precious possession , the archetype of genuine feeling , the very soul of human kindness ?
1	in our case the sinners were likewise bound together by a definite philosophy or maxim that had originated with inez institoris , and to which all five or six friends subscribed as their justification
1	without our subcutaneous cell structure we ’ d all end up looking like some sort of wrinkly fungus
1	i ’ ve always loved you
1	clavdia chauchat—listless , worm-eaten , kirghiz-eyed ; and whenever hans castorp thought of her ( although thought is an all-too-inhibited word for describing how he turned inwardly toward her ) , it seemed to him that he was sitting again in that boat on the lake in holstein and gazing with dazzled and bewildered eyes out of glassy daylight across to the eastern sky and the moonlit night draped in a web of mist
1	i will have to look for it
1	she carefully turned the handle of the door directly ahead of her and entered
1	how amusing and kind of you , ha ha , ha ha
1	he set his sights on adrian at once , wooed him , to the point of practically neglecting the ladies , asked for his opinion , for his company ( which adrian always refused in those days ) , was eager to engage him in musical and extra-musical conversation , and was not to be daunted , disillusioned , or disposed of by coolness , reserve , distance-a sign of an uncommon lack of guile , but also of a happy-golucky sensibility and natural good manners
1	did thomas buddenbrook stand with both feet firmly planted in that hard , practical life—as had his father before him ?
1	only a few handbreadths separated his face from hers , its features so extraordinary and yet familiar to him for so long now—and that face spoke to him like nothing in the world
1	and this whole sunny region—these easily scaled coastal heights , these laughing rock-bound pools , and the sea itself , as far as the islands where boats sailed past now and then—was populated in all directions : people , children of the sea and sun , were stirring and resting everywhere , intelligent , cheerful , beautiful , young humanity , so fair to gaze upon
1	your wanting to study botany—picked that up from krokowski , did you ?
1	something higher and that he would be the first educated man in his family
1	or nine , right off ?
1	maybe i ’ ll start on it later , during drawing class
1	two ds , three ds , one after the other-the chords do that-dimdada !
1	he seemed in a constant state of embarrassment
1	all of this meant a constant strain on his will , and it brought him neither success nor a sense of satisfaction—only gnawed away at his self-respect and left him feeling desperate
1	i did not find it difficult to identify these lines as the opening words of a hymn to apollo by callimachus
1	you dare not hand your works over to me for performance in absentia !
1	you could go for a walk , into the village , along front row ; and from there you could take a boat across to priwall , where you could find amber on the beach ; or you could join in a game of croquet on the playground or sit on a bench under the trees up on the hill just behind the hotel—that was where the large dinner bell was—and have ida jungmann read aloud to you
1	i am thinking here of a sentimentality , a trancelike self-hypnosis that is not european , that is foreign and hostile to our active hemisphere ’ s law of life
1	if it seems long to you , then it is long , and if it seems to pass quickly , then it ’ s short
1	even the most manly men succumb to credulous , oblivious self-deception ; the phenomenon is as natural as it is melancholy when the process of deterioration approaches its fatal end—natural and impersonal and beyond all individual conscious effort , much as the temptation to wander in circles overcomes someone who is lost or sleep ensnares someone freezing to death
1	frau permaneder responded to this with violent emotion
1	one could not even imagine his ever laughing heartily ; he managed little more than a dry , delicate tightness at one corner of his mouth
1	we don ’ t have that much time in life !
1	he added a jest about the episode of martial life awaiting me , and went his way
1	when he emerged from the woods , he was astonished by the splendid view opening up before him—an intimate , closed landscape , like some magnificent , peaceful painting
1	beethoven 's response to his famulus 's question , you see , had been that he had no time and had therefore decided to make the second a little longer instead
1	i ’ m merely an employee
1	elisabeth buddenbrook unobtrusively got up and withdrew , for she had noticed that at the far end of the table the chairs of mamselle jungmann , dr grabow , and christian were vacant and that from the columned hallway there came the sound of something like suppressed wails
1	as for me , i stood on much more cordial terms with those gentlemen-no wonder , since i was soon to join them professionally and had already seriously declared my intention to do so
1	he began to speak of his parents , who had died much too soon , and talked about his father , who was a preacher , a pastor , a man whose christian principles and urbanity were on the same high plane
1	but how could he !
1	conformation , mimicry , you know it well , the mumchance and conjuring of mother nature , who always keeps her tongue in her cheek
1	as for frau stöhr , she danced with her broom , pressing it to her heart and caressing its bristles as if they were the hair on a man ’ s head
1	it was a telegram
1	you will walk on all fours , you are tipping down onto your front limbs already , and will soon begin to grunt—beware !
1	and so it ’ s not physical , either
1	she could picture her future children prattling in french
1	she was somewhat disappointed when her papa would not hear of hiring a separate maid for them ; and she spent a half-hour in pensive reflection the day he gently explained to her that her only proper course of action for now was to live a private life apart from the social whirl of the town , for , although by all ordinary standards she was an innocent victim of the fate that god had sent to test her , her position as a divorced woman demanded the greatest discretion at present
1	like something out of a delirious fever ?
1	he only knew buddenbrook ’ s name because hanno was so quiet that he stood out from the rest of the class ; and he took advantage of hanno ’ s gentleness by exercising his authority over him , because he would not have dared do it with the loud , impudent boys
1	and then gone on to say that was what he called being reasonable and that he had seen right off hans castorp had more talent for being a patient than that trace-kicking swashbuckler
1	good heavens , you poor thing , said pfiffi , the youngest , who was short and plump and who with each word would give a funny little jiggle , while drops of moisture collected at the corners of her mouth
1	rather let each day be garnished
1	on sunday mornings , the doorbell on meng strasse was rung only by little grammar-school girls—by stina voss , who lived near the wall ; or mika stuht , from glockengiesser strasse ; and fika snut , from down by the river , or on kleine gröpel grube , or on engelswisch—it all depended
1	and again i say , rajoice !
1	on mysterious empathy , kinship of soul-this could result in her showing up at surprising places
1	because human progress was always gathering up new nations in the course of its brilliant advance , conquering new continents—indeed all of europe itself—and had even started to press on into asia
1	whereas in my heart i had to admit that his behavior , the whole arrangement-with rudolf , of all people , as the intercessor and wooer-
1	according to him , decline , stultification , and the loss of all feeling for what was old and genuine had begun early on and in a place so respectable that no one would ever have dreamt it
1	one would think that in such an agonizing situation time would have had to have seemed longer to them
1	frau chauchat complied with the demands of western civilization and introduced the gentlemen to one another
1	he was holding his top hat upside down in front of him , clutching it in one hand , which was covered with thick , white hair
1	the words spoke of heaven , but the very music was heavenly , was sung in heavenly voices
1	when a meal was over , his first requirement was a finger bowl of perfumed water , his second a russian cigarette , on which he paid no customs duties , since he had found a way to obtain them with a few well-placed , casual bribes
1	art advances , kretzschmar wrote , and does so by means of the personality , which is the product and tool of its times and in which objective and subjective motives are joined beyond differentiation , each assuming the form of the other
1	a bourgeois , a humanist , and a poet—behold , germany all rolled into one , just as it should be !
1	seemed worthy of german troops , so that after conscientiously destroying the library and depositing a time bomb in the main post office , we abandoned the place with heads held high
1	but with my three weeks , what do i need variety for ?
1	a stranger , come to have a look at the town ’ s medieval sights and the charming environs , notices nothing—but what bustle , what agitation beneath the surface
1	the conversation coalesced again when jean jacques hoffstede began to speak on a favorite topic , the trip to italy he had taken with a rich hamburg relative some fifteen years before
1	we stayed longer than planned and were finally quite alone as we sat over coffee and gentian schnapps , and
1	we live here right next door to dying people , next to awful tribulation and misery , and it ’ s not just that we all act as if it were no concern of ours , but we ’ re even protected , spared any possibility of coming into contact with it , or seeing it
1	schwerdtfeger was silent as he took a few more steps
1	and you with your crude visions of a new morning will likewise have to be taught by those whom—so at least you would like to persuade yourselves , and others—you despise
1	it seemed hardly advisable to leave further opportunities for meeting the lady of his choice to simple luck
1	they stood there bending toward one another
1	a grand day dawned for herr siegismund gosch the broker
1	it is like a word , a key word that leaves its signature everywhere in the song and would like to etermine it entirely
1	it slid to the edge of the table , moved along it a short distance , and then headed straight back to more or less the middle of the table
1	for s e c
1	we shall play and eat and drink
1	freedom was in fact probably more an idea of romanticism than of the enlightenment , for as a concept it shared with romanticism the same complex , never-to-be-disentangled interlocking of the human instinct to expand and the passionate , constricting thrust of the individual ego
1	and he hastily searched his memory for vocabulary and syntax
1	became t h e triumph
1	no , i think i can set your mind at ease there
1	the days get longer during winter , and when we get to the longest one , the twenty-first of june , the beginning of summer , they start getting shorter again and it all heads right back downhill toward winter
1	it ’ s really quite human , quite humane of us
1	but surely one can still point out the tragic antinomies of which life is full
1	he made no secret of his delight at having acquired this intimate knowledge , and from now on he spoke only of clavdia when he meant frau chauchat
1	hanno had a calming effect on kai , he tamed him , almost ennobled him ; and kai dearly loved his friend
1	and for the last five months he had been sitting in the international sanatorium berghof ( dr behrens , supervising physician ) , and was bored half to death , as he wrote in a postcard
1	just look at me—here i sit before you , an incurable case
1	and do you have it with you ?
1	she was pale , and even in her soft fall jacket she shivered from the cold , from exhaustion , the excitement of the journey , and a sadness that from time to time would suddenly rise up and expand painfully inside her chest
1	he said congflick and from here on threw caution to the winds in matters of pronunciation
1	he didn ’ t say such things when his father was present , by the way ; his mother was allowed to hear them , though
1	what a shame you ’ re not a member , joachim , because then they could include me as an honorary guest—or associate member
1	but , then , how could you be ?
1	hans castorp rebelled against the notion or at least tried to do so—only to find to his horror that he could not
1	they are sounding the retreat , he says operatically
1	as for the inscriptions , the names came from every corner of the earth , were written in english , russian or other slavic languages , in german , portuguese , and many more tongues
1	but would that detract from the services rendered , diminish the honor secretly due him ?
1	besides , the conversation in the landscape room was becoming less and less interesting
1	to be brief—there ’ s a letter from gotthold , he said quickly in a low voice and , gazing into her dark , questioning eyes , he pulled the folded and sealed paper from his pocket
1	jonathan leverkiihn was a man of finest german stamp , the kind one scarcely ever sees now in our cities and certainly not one of those who , with what is often overbearing bluster , represent our version of the human race nowadays-a physiognomy somehow marked by the past , preserved out in the country , so to speak , and brought in from a germany predating the thirty years ' war
1	and now she peers anxiously between the shoulders of the two workers to catch a glimpse of the town hall
1	he had been a businessman , he was one no more , he was nothing in this world , but he had remained an anti-semite
1	he finds the boy , baptizes him with his own name , gregory , and provides him with an education that , given the boy 's exceptional physical and mental gifts , yields happiest results
1	i could easily have become a doctor
1	i heard that up in the forest , i ’ ll never forget it as long as i live
1	the boy ’ s a monkey !
1	and just before those maneuvers that the good man was so hot for
1	well , is he going to march to the pipe and drum like you ?
1	they supported their right elbows now with their left hands
1	several games were in progress on the tennis courts
1	are you waiting for an official invitation from grünlich , maybe ?
1	and now what did you plan to do with those roses ?
1	and some years , when the consul had business to attend to , they made longer journeys
1	eternal snow , hans castorp said
1	the moment he took his seat beside the coachman and crossed his arms , the horses were given the sign and the carriages moved off down the loop of the driveway , brakes set
1	and your husband in daghestan consents to—your liberty ?
1	and they resumed their visits to settembrini and naphta , as well as walks with those two antagonistic allies ; when they were joined by a k ferge and ferdinand wehsal , which frequently happened , that made a party of four before which the two intellectual adversaries could engage in constant duels—and we could not hope to present them in their entirety without fear of likewise losing ourselves in the same desperate infinitude into which they daily threw themselves for their large audience , although hans castorp chose to see his own poor soul as the chief object of their dialectic rivalry
1	but dictated no results
1	and , like hanno , he had grown considerably
1	it is both artistically moving and nothing less than a cultural paradox to behold how the natural developmental process , by which what is intellectual and refined grows out of what is elemental , is here reversed , so that the former now plays the role of the primal element , out of which simplicity seeks to wrest itself :
1	or , more to the point and somewhat closer to an admission , yes , holy horrors are abrewing
1	carrying their books under their arms , hanno and kai walked in the same direction as far as the little , red-brick suburban villa
1	but he was forced to watch as her passion for music—which he had always found rather odd—took possession of the child at such an early age
1	all i want to say is that your objections-if they are meant as objections-would count for nothing against the fulfillment of the ancient desire to impose order on every sound and to resolve music 's magical essence into human reason
1	for in dialectic fashion , if i may put it that way , he assimilated the offensively blasphemous into the divine , hell into the empyrean , and declared wickedness a necessary correlative born together with the holy , and the holy an enduring satanic temptation , an almost irresistible provocation to sacrilege
1	not when it has a pharmaceutical odor and is prescribed from on high for reasons of health
1	helene and i likewise quickly became accustomed to amelia 's muffled commentary at meals
1	you should just let yourself go the way i do
1	or course , erika couldn ’ t come along
1	but the work and the bold venture of its presentation also found intelligent , eloquent defenders ; and already during the first half of the decade , that same good courage-so open to the world , so at ease with freedom-which reached its height around
1	no sooner had they put the first elementary exercises behind them than he began to teach music theory and made it easily understood by demonstrating the basics of harmony as his pupil watched
1	that would hardly be tolerant
1	and now he listened attentively for the next name to be announced
1	krischan , don ’ t stuff y ’ self so much , the older buddenbrook suddenly shouted
1	lord , how very much he must love her to take this so far , when all it aroused in her was a queer feeling of indifference
1	on his eighth birthday , april , , hanno joined his mother to play a duet for the assembled family—a little fantasia of his own , a simple motif , which , when it came to him , had seemed so curious that he developed it further
1	he did not really have a headache
1	he asked , screwing up his face and laying a hand to his ear as he leaned forward
1	how elegant , tony said , tilting her head to inspect it
1	and may i reply , my dear mother , that i have never forgotten the respect i owe you , but that in matters touching the firm and the family i assume the position of my father as the head of that family and am not to be regarded in my capacity as a son
1	but if both those goals were excluded-of soloist and conductor-what remained ?
1	chalice-which , to be sure , put him in a most painfully awkward position as a result of the gruesome punishments that his superior , archbishop albrecht , placed upon partaking holy co�munion under both kinds , as was the practice in halle
1	the poor man , she said
1	the pastor walked over to her and the other two stepped inside as well , and then the door was closed
1	you ’ ve given your word !
1	gerda had finished with her hair and was now brushing her broad , white teeth , holding her small ivory mirror in the other hand
1	and hans castorp caught a fleeting glance of her broad cheekbones and narrow eyes—and at the sight , a vague memory of something or somebody brushed over him
1	no , it is bootless to speak of it , for it lies apart from and outside of language , which has nothing to do with it , has no relation to it , and that is also why language never rightly knows which tense to apply to it and makes shift perforce with the future , for as it is said : 'there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth
1	and , having exchanged a few polite and sober words with his sister-in-law and having given the children a pat on the head , gotthold departed and was not seen again until the next children ’ s day at the krögers ’ country villa
1	lordy , neighbor , herr permaneder replied , turning now to the consul with the awkwardness of a man who has a thick , stiff neck and dangling his other arm over the back of his chair , ’ tain ’ t much to write home ’ bout , jist a lotta hard work
1	his muscles relaxed ; overwhelmed , he let his weary head sink back on his shoulders
1	bicolor flags floated from every building beneath the deep blue summer sky—all the way down fischer grube , from breite strasse to the docks , where the wullenwever and the friederike oeverdieck lay under full flag in honor of their owner
1	two rows of jeweled buttons sparkled on his black velvet vest
1	but the word elegant was firmly fixed in tony ’ s little head , and she was most emphatic about applying it to gerda arnoldsen
1	schleppfuss was a scrawny man of less than average height who wore no coat , but wrapped himself in a black cape fastened with a metal chain at the neck
1	this chapter was entitled : concerning death and its relation to the indestructibility of our essential nature
1	but discussion was a habit now , thanks to his democratic mentors—both were basically democratic , although the one struggled not to be—and he got caught up in one of his own ingenuous commentaries
1	she kissed little meta , squeezed frau schwarzkopf ’ s hand , and nodded to herr schwarzkopf who said , now , don ’ t go forgetting us , mamselle
1	this one costs three francs fifty , and this one five francs
1	and when his mother took the occasion one day to thank him for sacrificing his time , he dryly remarked , yes , mother , the things one must do
1	and meanwhile the flute does these fiorituras !
1	it ’ s best not to say such things out loud , she thought , fixing her eyes firmly on the distance in order not to meet his gaze
1	they noticed that she was busy doing something rather curious , an activity with which the others seemed familiar , but that caught hans castorp ’ s attention , and he watched in amazement : for several minutes she reached out her cupped hand until it was at about her hip , then pulled it back—stretched it out and with a ladling or raking motion , pulled it back , as if she were collecting or gathering something
1	he ’ s sure to notice
1	yes , yes , adrian said with a laugh and a nod , walked into the house , into the pungent , tobacco-laden air , and went upstairs , where his landlady led him down the whitewashed , musty corridor to the bedroom assigned to him , with its brightly painted wardrobe and its bed piled high with fresh featherbeds
1	that , he cried , was all you needed
1	his cousin tried to calm him
1	so that from that side , everything is in order
1	no , there ’ s none left , tom
1	one should speak of monotony , of an abiding now , of eternalness
1	but , whoops , gentlemen , do get on with your promenade !
1	it was at about the same late hour as on that first night of revels with pieter peeperkorn of majestic , brotherly memory when he finally went to bed , his head hot and flushed ; and from two to seven o ’ clock he dreamed of his magic box
1	and if you ’ re not having the great success you had before , the reason is that you ’ ve been so cautious and conscientious and anxious that you let every chance for a coup slip through you fingers
1	you ’ d never take her for someone with a weak chest
1	a knight who defends fear and reproach is not a coward , but simply a knight
1	has everyone gone mad this evening ?
1	the relationship between frau chauchat as a person and this piece of canvas was enough for him
1	judge for yourself—why couldn ’ t he be reasonable !
1	for by his courtship and the train of thought it awakened , this bland man could indeed arouse the woman in her-that he could manage
1	i beg your pardon , but i grant the term classic ’ its place where it is applicable , that is , whenever an idea has achieved its apogee
1	this was doubtless the spot assigned to him , and he would have to get used to it for now , although he was free to vary his position by leaning against his left shoulder and bracing himself with his right leg , while shaking his left to bring it back to life
1	sometimes he would unconsciously cramp his hands a little , and at that moment they expressed something indescribable—a dismissive sensibility , an almost anxious reticence , that was somehow ill-suited to him and quite untypical of the effect broad , stolid buddenbrook hands had always made , even given their long , delicate fingers
1	on sunny days in march , it got so hot out on the balcony that it was almost impossible to lie in a lounge chair , even with light clothes and a sunshade ; and there were ladies who pretended it was already summer and appeared at first breakfast in muslin dresses
1	i ’ ve been hearing the most curious things about your behavior
1	but the pride of the club is hermine kleefeld , because she can whistle with her pneumothorax—it ’ s her special talent , it ’ s certainly not something everyone can do
1	you christians studied them , settembrini exclaimed , studied the classical poets and philosophers until you broke out in a sweat , attempted to make their precious heritage your own , just as you used the stones of their ancient edifices for your meeting houses
1	shall we work our way through the provisions now , children ?
1	a gust of wind carried the scent of flowers across the curious crowd , ruffled the black plumes atop the hearse , tossed the manes of all the horses in the long line stretching down to the river , and tugged at the black ribbons fixed to the hats of the coachman and his grooms
1	it does me more good just to live each day as it comes , without much variety
1	it really was true
1	there were seven tables in the dining hall , five placed lengthwise , only two crosswise
1	besides , i ’ m a little weary from the trip , i suppose
1	the other day herr brecht told me that my teeth look horrible , that they ’ re all deteriorating and wearing down , not to mention the ones he ’ s already pulled
1	the blood of youth burns not with such excess as gravity 's revolt to wantonness ?
1	herr grünlich poured red wine into his glass , lifted the crystal bell , and began on the cheese
1	for in the salon is a table decorated with flowers to serve as an altar and , behind it , a young clergyman in black vestments with a starched snow-white ruff like a millstone around his neck ; and he speaks , while a tall , strapping , well-nourished female , dressed in rich reds and golds , holds in her muscular arms a tiny something almost lost under all the lace and satin bows—an heir
1	had been tendered sufficient formal observation , and the period of testing seemed by its very length to demand a positive solution at last , added to which there was a certain urgency for union stemming from the war itself-which had indeed already brought to swift maturity many an unsettled relationship
1	he : mum , mum 's the word
1	i am a man to the nth degree , i swear it
1	yes , i ’ ll grant , it ’ s a particularly sharp knife
1	the shoveled piles of snow along the streets and the pallid carpets on the meadows disappeared , although the masses of white had been far too thick to vanish quickly
1	humanism , both old and new , calls that slandering the wellspring of life
1	it was exactly the same as that day in the landscape room
1	the nervous pedantry that had taken control of him over the years devoured each new day
1	the only thing special in his case was that he did not like germans either , was steeped in their sense of national inferiority , and so explained it all by saying that he would rather , or might just as well , associate with jews
1	that may well be , herr behrens
1	what i am saying is this : it is not by way of cleverness that he puts us in his pocket , not through intellectual prowess
1	well , i ’ m not going to lie out on my balcony at night in any case , hans castorp declared
1	twenty-three years have now passed since the actress clarissa rodde , whose sister inez was obviously just as imperiled as she , perished almost before my eyes
1	they ordered a bottle of gruaud larose , which hans castorp sent back to be brought to room temperature
1	hans castorp was trapped between them ; turning his head back and forth , he would agree first with one , then with the other , or he would come to a stop , bending his body backward and gesticulating with a hand inside its fur-lined goatskin glove , and offer some opinion of his own—some highly unsatisfactory comment , of course ; meanwhile ferge and wehsal circled the three of them , now walking in front , now behind , now forming a single row , until oncoming traffic broke the group up again
1	he went into the adjoining room , stretched out on the chaise longue , and lay there for a long time without stirring a muscle
1	is there not a threat that production will cease ?
1	reg ’ lar pain in th ’ ol ’ , rubbing his knee and sighing heavily for no apparent reason
1	that ’ s what i call straight talk , spoken with dignity
1	but on the whole and per aversionem , it is a foolishness , this mechanical separation of counterpoint and harmony , inasmuch as they are insolubly intermingled , until one can not teach each of itself , but only the whole , to wit : music-an it be instructible
1	three weeks have passed since james möllendorpf ’ s demise , and now election day is here
1	helene , nee olhafen , my splendid wife , who even now in my declining years still looks after me , was the daughter of an older classicist colleague in zwickau in the kingdom of saxony , and at the risk of bringing a smile to the reader 's face , i will admit that the glowing young lady 's first name , helene-such precious syllables , -played a not insignificant role in my choice as well
1	in reality , however—that is , apart from any theoretical system—in terms of snow and cold , it had been winter now for god knew how long ; winter had been interrupted , as always , only very briefly by scorching summer days with a sky whose blue was so inordinately deep that it verged on black—by summer days , then , that could occur in the midst of winter , too , if you ignored the snow , which , by the by , could also fall at any time during summer
1	all right , kesselmeyer , i ’ ll write
1	he loved his pipe , a half-length porcelain affair with a lid and a distinctive tobacco odor that hung in the air of the downstairs rooms and was far more pleasant than stale cigar or cigarette smoke
1	heaven , earth , and sea melted into one another , while gusts of wind picked up the rain and drove it against the windows until drops became streams that ran down the panes , making it impossible to see out
1	they knew that the church and the state needed ecclesiastical civil servants , and that was why they were preparing for this career
1	gentlemen should at least be punctual and dependable
1	the very first day , he said , mercy me , madame buddenbrook , what a treasure , what a blessing from god you have in your daughter clara
1	you are a decent , simple fellow from a good family , with handsome manners , a docile pupil to his teachers , who will soon return to the flatlands in order to forget completely that he ever spoke in a dream here and to help repay his great and powerful fatherland with honest labor on the wharves
1	because you exude something that he lacks and that i regard as propitious for my wishes and hopes
1	you ’ ll find it a little namby-pamby of me to insist on it , i suppose—now that you ’ ve taken to kicking over the traces
1	yes , yes , he suddenly said in a slightly mocking tone , a good night ’ s sleep is a fine thing
1	there was a basket of keys in front of her
1	even his vanity , his much-derided vanity , proceeded largely from this same worry
1	on another occasion he said , for an age of culture , our own age talks a bit too much about culture , do not you think ?
1	but there was not a strand of white to be seen in her smoothly parted , reddish blonde hair
1	she did not go to pieces at the sight of her fine son
1	schools based on humanistic education—you may call me backward if you like , sir , but on principle and in abstracto , do understand me correctly , i beg you—i remain their firm supporter
1	surely not , mynheer peeperkorn
1	and then there ’ s the july monarchy and practical ideals
1	do you know what tom thinks ?
1	i love you , he babbled , i have always loved you , for you are the intimate you ’ of my life , my dream , my destiny , my need , my eternal desire
1	it was so small , in fact , such a tiny , initial , ephemeral concentration of something immaterial—of something not yet matter , but related to matter—of energy , that one could not yet , or perhaps no longer , think of it as matter , but rather as both the medium and boundary between the material and immaterial
1	oh , please sit here on the edge of my bed for a while , my good old ida
1	but when the sun enters libra , about three months from now , then the length of the days will have decreased until day and night are equal , and will continue to decrease until around christmas—you know all that
1	as to the reasons , i can only say that they lie in darkness , lie there together with the origins of my sentiments toward your traveling companion—and i expressly call her that to make clear that it would never occur to me to try to alter a legitimate state of affairs—with the origins of my sentiments toward clavdia chauchat and of my addressing her with only informal pronouns , a relationship that i never denied from the moment her eyes first met mine and fascinated me—fascinated me in the most irrational sense of the word , you understand
1	i ’ m driving you to ruin ?
1	it was a gift from my parents at my confirmation
1	and how is dear jürgen doing ?
1	she asked , turning to hans castorp
1	and then there ’ s the republic of the world
1	did the gentlemen know , by the way , that behrens had been the inventor of the summer season ?
1	sesame weichbrodt , however , was much too kind and tactful ever to mention the matter
1	but one needed only to imagine what sort of a storm would have erupted had anyone seriously attempted to disturb him in his drinking , to realize just how unfair and unreasonable such an objection was
1	and that word was—civilization !
1	hans castorp turned the puzzling object between his fingers
1	what blasphemous nonsense , ultimately , to measure the distance of some star or other from the earth in trillions of miles or even light-years and to imagine that by the ruse of numbers you had given the human spirit an insight into the nature of infinity and eternity—when infinity had absolutely nothing to do with size , nor eternity with duration and distances in time , had nothing in common with the notions of natural science , were the abrogation of what we meant by the word nature
1	kretzschmar admits as much , too , and says himself that one must , from
1	when he laughs , he draws air in between his clenched teeth in a series of jerking hisses
1	or was he simply feeling his oats ?
1	the weather had taken a terrible turn for the worse
1	thomas was sixteen years old when he left school
1	beg your pardon , you were going to teach me more
1	having f o u r
1	the way you got from f to a major was very ingenious
1	like a plant , to use a metaphor , like a flower that has been transplanted to some foreign soil—though you may think the comparison inappropriate , because i ’ m an ugly old woman
1	he set to work with total devotion , imitating the quiet style and dogged industry of his father , who would often grind his teeth as he worked—and enter prayers for help in his diary
1	the signet ring with a green gemstone was even older , had presumably been worn by the very well-situated merchant tailor from rostock , and the consul had inherited it along with the large bible
1	pietism , true to its own enthusiasms , wanted , of course , to draw a sharp line between piety and science and claimed that no movement , no change in the realm of science can have any influence whatever on faith
1	it will be an honor
1	she hurried to the window
1	johann buddenbrook was greatly grieved by these less than admirable developments in his wife ’ s family and was therefore all the more anxious about his own children
1	they had apparently believed , moreover , that they were actually helping the malefactor
1	it was a good joke , the humor of the unfortunately sent him into convulsions
1	i was amazed and enchanted by the rendering of the sparks in the fire , by those entwining voices
1	even upstairs here , where there were only bedrooms , tony could smell coffee—that seemed to be the little house ’ s characteristic odor , and it grew stronger as she came down the staircase with its simple , unbroken wooden railing and followed the hallway that led past the parlor , the dining room , and the harbor pilot ’ s private office
1	to anyone they met he would-and she made no attempt to restrain him-extend a hand , while the person thus greeted and frau leverkiihn exchanged indulgent nods
1	oh , dear girl , that ’ s mere foolishness
1	it was wet snow , but it stuck , and the valley now lay under a thin , damp , tattered garment of white that made the rugged evergreen slopes stand out black in contrast
1	over her shoulder she said softly , don ’ t forget to return my pencil
1	but then you don ’ t need your rest cure as badly as i need mine
1	it was count strelitz , whose estate was gross-poggendorf—you ’ ve heard of him before , i ’ m sure
1	this outfit set the human grandeur of that head in strong relief against the pillow , in part lending it a less bourgeois , more working-class look , in part suggesting a sculptured , immortalized bust
1	and instead—clarity , serenity , a dry , austere charm
1	it seems to me you ’ re getting tangled up in contradictions
1	and i ’ ll have first rights over what assets are left
1	no , look , there in the foamy gray-green expanse as it loses itself , diminishing vastly against the horizon , there is a sail
1	since then , demand had grown considerably for second-floor apartments , from where , after climbing over the railing , one could avoid the little doors and move from room to room by way of the projecting glass roof of the veranda below
1	i am afraid of her bewilderment and of the-perhaps overhasty-rebuff that could result from it
1	beside the doctor sat herr and then frau magnus , who joined hands with a k ferge , who , if hans castorp was not mistaken , was linked to fräulein levi of the ivory complexion on his right—and so on
1	did we not , at the very moment of birth , stumble into agonizing captivity ?
1	he merely told his pupil what adrian 's own artistic sense could have or already had told him
1	as she walked she kept one hand in the pocket of her close-fitting wool jacket , while the other was busy at the back of her head , tucking and arranging her hair
1	as they gathered in concentric circles from all sides , it was as if they were thronging after him—hesitant , without a will of their own , and yet in dazed unanimity , like a swarm of rats behind the pied piper
1	we shall indeed strike them up for you , but only when you are ripe for the hearing
1	for instance , the eating of the book , which albrecht diirer boldly uses as the subject of one of his woodcuts , is taken almost verbatim from ezekiel , except for the one detail that in ezekiel 's case the roll wherein was written lamentation and mourning and woe , tastes as sweet as honey in the mouth of him who obediently eats it
1	rhadamanthus had been a member of a dueling fraternity , but they could not possibly approach the head of the sanatorium and ask him to abet them in an illegal act , particularly since patients were involved
1	but to what end ?
1	no objection to the status quo
1	, which with incredible artistic empathy conjures up the most cozily frightening and terrifying domains of the german folk song
1	that was schwerdtfeger ; he could tell about it
1	old schwarzkopf had entertained them with sea yarns , and the younger one had told them about göttingen , where he was studying
1	his field of study had always been concerned with those dark , vast regions of the human soul that are called the subconscious , although one would perhaps do better to speak of the superconscious , since there are occasions when the knowledge that rises up from those regions far exceeds an individual ’ s conscious knowledge , suggesting that there may be connections and associations between the bottommost unlighted tracts of the individual soul and an omniscient universal soul
1	but i did walk rather far
1	but it soon turned out that this was not a temporary phenomenon , and it quickly become known around town that the consul ’ s wife , who as she had grown older had shown some sympathy for her late husband ’ s spiritual inclinations in the last years of his life , now intended to honor his memory by making his religious views totally her own
1	as i said , i have all kinds of deals in the making
1	but it didn ’ t help , she had to be given the sacrament of the dying
1	was he dealing with winter athletes , he asked , or patients , people who were ill ?
1	what a strange feeling to watch this ambiguity coming from a king when the disputants began to speak of marriage and sin , the sacrament of indulgence , the guilt and innocence of lust
1	that made things hard for everyone involved , as she was sure the gentlemen could well understand , particularly hard if one came from an academic household and possessed the sensitivities of the upper classes
1	how inept of him , she thought
1	you must realize that it was not all that easy for him to be admitted to the site where the temple of humanity is being built , because he ’ s as poor as a church mouse , and they not only demand higher education , humanistic education , but , beg your pardon , one must also be well-to-do just to afford the hefty initiation fees and annual dues
1	please , don ’ t speak about it at least
1	oh , good lord , it ’ s the same everywhere
1	was that a wise thing to do ?
1	i can ’ t go on , christian repeated , shaking his head back and forth with dreadful seriousness and letting his little , round , deep-set eyes wander about the room
1	it was close to noon when consul thomas buddenbrook entered the breakfast room and found his mother bent over a piece of paper , her spectacles set firmly on her nose
1	now , now , that ’ s enough , lad , go to sleep
1	and you didn ’ t even ask me ?
1	that had been assigned to us and for which we ( and we alone ) marched off enthusiastically-filled with the certainty that the hour of germany 's era had come , that history was holding its hand over us , that after spain , france , and england it was now our turn to put our stamp upon the world and lead it , that the twentieth century belonged to us , and that now that a bourgeois epoch had run its hundred-and-twenty-year course , the world was to be renewed under the emblem of germany , under the emblem of a militaristic socialism yet to be completely defined
1	sitting upright , her eyes wide open for battle , madame buddenbrook flailed her arms , as if grasping for support or hands that were reaching out to her , and constantly answered calls that came from all directions , which only she could hear , but which seemed to be growing ever more numerous and urgent
1	yes , monsignor hinterpfortner is right : we are lost
1	unable to make out the angle of decline , he let the slope pull him downward
1	amounted to formal goodbye
1	: rhough it pains me , i must add that he often misspoke himself and in the attempt to correct one such lapse ( at which in my torment i dug my fingernails into my palms ) made yet another , until in time he no longer paid any attention to such mistakes and simply passed over them
1	his trousers were an indefinite grayish green—and too short ; they were apparently made of some strange stiff fabric , because the cuffs fell in unpleated circles around the short shafts of his broad boots
1	if my father ever learned about this , it would be a disaster
1	red wine and coffee were within reach as usual ; the coffee things , splattered brown from recent use , stood on the chair beside the bed—mynheer had taken his usual afternoon cup , strong and hot , with sugar and cream , and he was still in a sweat from it
1	he was seven years old before he began to try arranging his hands on the keyboard in order to imitate certain combinations of sound that had impressed him
1	hanno hugged his grandmother , who pressed him gently to her ; then she let him go and began to receive the thanks of everyone else
1	we shall have to arrange the details
1	dreadful indeed , herr grünlich responded , the fire was a terrible calamity , a heartbreaking ordeal
1	first came a work for an ensemble of three strings , three woodwinds , and piano-a rambling piece , if i may put it that way , with very long , extempore themes that undergo development and resolution in manifold ways , and yet never recur openly
1	since i am here , i replied , i will come along with you
1	and if i hesitate to pronounce those years as
1	what you just said came from the very depths of your personality , and even the present state of your personality found poetic expression
1	well , what about you , buddenbrook—you doing anything these days ?
1	of course , papa , tony repeated in the reassuring tone that she almost always used if someone spoke to her about serious things
1	nice bunch of folks they have there
1	at the time she had been approached by a certain dr helmut institoris , an aesthetician and art historian , an instructor at the technical institute , where he would have photographs passed around the class while he lectured on the theory of the beautiful and the architecture of the renaissance , but a man with good prospects of one day being called to the university , to a professorial chair , to membership in the academy , etc , particularly if , being a bachelor from a well-to-do wiirzburg family and with expectations of a significant inheritance , he were to enhance the worthiness of his existence by establishing a household as a gathering place for society
1	who told you all this ?
1	she went on , quite beside herself
1	neither of us has said a word , of course
1	in the spring of , he went to vienna , where at ehrbar hall , as part of one of the so-called anbruch evenings , rudi schwerdtfeger at last gave his first performance of the violin concerto written for him-and with great success , in particular for him
1	he knew that it also contains traces of mucin and protein
1	again , just a brief hour
1	i dropped a few hints , and it turned out he would be happy to have the lass stay with them a while
1	he had been awake for a good while when there was a knock at his door ; it was shortly after two
1	against the shadowy moonshine of the romanticismo , which he had compared to luna , that pallid nun of heaven
1	oh , right , when the body goes stiff after death , hans castorp said cheerfully
1	for herr settembrini belonged to the francophile party in his homeland , which was in no way astonishing when one recalls that his grandfather had equated the days of the july revolution with the days of creation ; but a pact between that enlightened republic and scythian byzantium was a moral embarrassment to him—his chest felt constricted , but then , at the thought of the strategic significance of those railroads , it would try to expand and take in rapid breaths of hope and joy
1	the situation was much less obvious as regarded the cousins ; but despite her stupidity and ignorance , feminine intuition allowed her a certain insight , if only a partial and vulgar one
1	and yet absolute symmetry and icy regularity characterized each item of cold inventory
1	the shriveled old maid smiled in sympathy
1	and you will see people gather around peeperkorn , down to the last man , and naphta will be left sitting there alone with his cleverness and his city of god , although he can express himself so clearly that it makes your blood and spit run cold , to use one of behrens ’ s phrases
1	i forbid you to play so fast and loose with time !
1	they had returned to the adjoining room , and as they took their seats at the round table , the senator picked up the papers with the lists of things to be divided among the closest heirs
1	for weeks , my groping inquiries were countered with a half-playful silence , an annoyed , half-timid defensiveness that guarded some uncanny secret , with a smile and raised brows , with phrases like : mind your business and keep your soul clean !
1	her nose had something of a bump ; the glance of her pale eyes , almost fully veiled by the lids , was subdued , soft , and mistrustful ; a knowing and mournful glance , though not without sallies at roguishness
1	and when clavdia departed , i waited for her , just went on waiting up here , so that the flatlands is entirely lost to me now , and in its eyes i am as good as dead
1	i presume , by the way , that she ’ s wasting nitrogen by doing it , because she has to get a refill every week
1	both at the roddes ' and in the schlaginhaufens ' columned salon , people enjoyed listening to me play the viola d'amore , which to be sure was the chief social contribution that i , a simple scholar and schoolmaster and never a dashing conversationalist , could offer
1	she walked around with those good-natured blue eyes , that heavy braid , that broad mecklenburg accent—and never gave it a thought
1	we bought a couple of blankets for my cousin , joachim replied casually
1	that takes a little imagination , i ’ ll grant , a little idealism—and that ’ s what you lacked , whatever you may have believed about yourself
1	and yet , on the other hand , it ’ s as if i had been here not for just a day , but considerably longer—almost as if i had grown older and wiser , it seems to me
1	oh , there are times , friederike , when that is no comfort
1	it ’ s the first summer sign of the zodiac , you see
1	and yet life seemed to have actuated itself
1	that ’ s oxygen that you scent in the air
1	it was his way of honoring the stroll by the shore , the abiding ever-and-always , the hermetic magic , to which , once withdrawn from the world , he had proved so susceptible—the magic that had been his soul ’ s fundamental adventure , in which all the alchemistic adventures of that simple stuff had been played out
1	i had to laugh , for although the cold continued to press me , i was forced to admit that since his alteration i had grown more at ease in his company
1	for ( and naphta was particularly fond of that conjunction—in his mouth it gained something triumphantly inexorable , and his eyes would flash behind his glasses whenever he could insert it ) , for politics and catholicism , as concepts , were psychologically related ; they formed a single category embracing all objective , actual , active , actualizing reality , and as such stood in contradiction to pietist protestantism , which had emerged out of mysticism
1	at the time adrian particularly enjoyed the company of this elegantly rustic woman and in fact benefited from her calming presence , her protective energy as it were ; and i have in fact seen him sit hand in hand with her in a corner of the abbot 's study , gazing at her , saying nothing , as if safe and secure
1	years ago now—indeed , perhaps on the very day he was first voted into the senate—he had accomplished whatever could be accomplished
1	it is not without good reason that the faustus cantata is stylistically linked so strongly and unmistakably to monteverdi and the seventeenth century , whose music-again not without good reason-favored echo effects , at times to the point of mannerism
1	hans castorp quickly interrupted yet again
1	it was not exactly the same as asking a total stranger for a pencil—indeed , it would have been almost rude to pass stiffly by a lady with whom one had been living for months under the same roof and not salute her
1	but , as we have noted , when it came to the rest of the day ’ s sights and events , he had joachim provide him a report ; he asked him about the festive outfits that had been brought out for sunday , the lace peignoirs and such ( although it had turned too cold for lace peignoirs ) ; about whether there had been any afternoon carriage rides ( there had indeed—the entire half-lung club had left on an excursion to clavadel )
1	once it became clear that the doctors had left , word quickly spread that there would be dancing
1	the days passed—but then , suddenly , it looked as if there might be some happiness in store for her after all , the very same happiness for which they waited in vain on breite strasse and meng strasse
1	if i might make a suggestion , consul buddenbrook , this would be an excellent opportunity to prove the strength of the firm of johann buddenbrook
1	thilda is already busy in the kitchen , the consul continued , giving weight to each word , and i would be at work myself if it weren ’ t for an important matter that your mother and i would like to discuss with our daughter
1	they were all eating scrambled eggs and ham
1	all of these people , some thirty of them as i said , are now standing in the rustic salon , waiting expectantly , introducing themselves , sharing their curiosity with one another
1	what i do ’ is what counts—and you will please take note of that
1	wenzel the czech was about to nod off
1	when he sat down to meals in the bright dining hall , young hans castorp found to his embarrassment that he was still subject to the grandfatherly tremor he had first noticed on his long , solitary walk
1	he noticed how he blushed and did not look up , and then did look up when the glass door slammed and frau chauchat glided to her seat
1	why , of course—for a couple of centuries , naphta affirmed coldly
1	the matter should be seen as follows
1	because over these last weeks such changes were much more visible than when he had first returned from the flatlands , and his tanned face was turning more yellow and leathery from day to day
1	don ’ t beat around the bush
1	i don ’ t mean being drunk , but what it ’ s like the next day
1	it was quieter here ; he shared his retreat with only a few others
1	assist me , my child
1	and i ’ ve had a bellyful of it
1	for i did consider well that you must set pins if you would bowl , and now-a-days you must pay your addresses to the devil , in that you can use and have no one but him for great enterprises and work
1	but tell me one thing : if he ’ s so well taken care of by those people , why in the world would he live
1	don ’ t you mean , when he was painting your portrait ?
1	there he must have made the discovery that music offered possibilities for expanding and fulfilling his spiritual kingdom of which young herr ludwig could scarcely have dreamt
1	narrative , however , has two kinds of time : first , its own real time , which like musical time defines its movement and presentation ; and second , the time of its contents , which has a perspective quality that can vary widely , from a story in which the narrative ’ s imaginary time is almost , or indeed totally coincident with its musical time , to one in which it stretches out over light-years
1	the fact that he could have had all the amorous adventures he wished seemed to suffice for him , and it was as if he shied away from every tie to reality becau�e he saw it as robbing him of the potential
1	just watch , i ’ ll write as soon as i get there
1	i don ’ t know if i ’ m the only one to blame for that
1	and i know very well just what there was to me : i have been an intimate of sickness and death for a very long time , and even as a boy i borrowed a pencil from you , in the same irrational way i did again on that mardi gras night
1	the road they took , a small unrailed ledge between cliff and abyss , rose steeply into the evergreen wilderness
1	of course , i recognized you at once
1	it was now unbelievably warm , the heat was turned off , people left balcony doors open at night and it would still be fifty-seven degrees in their rooms the next morning ; the snow was melting fast—turned ice-gray , became porous and honeycombed ; great drifts of it sagged now , seemed to creep back into the earth
1	but the city itself didn ’ t have a penny and just muddled along , as my brother-in-law , permaneder , would say , and repairs were out of the question
1	but your poor cousin is seriously ill
1	i carry yours here
1	one would do well to disregard the nationalistic element in all this , dungersheim warned , and regard this complex of problems as bound up with the existence of modern man in general
1	he had gold-colored muttonchops ; quite original—i ’ ve never seen the like
1	no need to worry , nurse schildknecht declared
1	but whether clouds or fog , the damp was penetrating
1	there was even some dancing on the glass floor-schildknapp and schwerdtfeger took turns gliding mlle
1	there they hang dry and elegant , enjoying universal respect
1	there , on the third morning after the argument , as soon as it was light enough , the issue was to be resolved
1	you will be received with the most intense interest
1	she should learn to close a door properly , hans castorp said
1	he was back on duty at the beginning of june , but by the middle of the month he had to rest on his oars again , and he complained bitterly about his bad luck ; he could not hide his fears that he might miss taking part in major maneuvers in early august , to which he had so been looking forward
1	may i see you for a moment , gentlemen , please , he said and led them downstairs , across the corridor , and through the columned hall to the landscape room , where a fire was already burning because of the raw , damp autumn weather
1	thomas , for our dear lord ’ s sake , be fair to me , please
1	his kitchen and wine cellar were considered tip-top ; he was admired as a polite , attentive , tactful host ; and the wit he displayed in his toasts was well above average
1	she watched them wane ; and whenever she felt up to it , she eagerly took the concentrated nourishment she was offered , was stricter than her nurses about the dosages and times of her medication , and was so caught up in it all that she spoke with hardly anyone but the doctors—or at least showed genuine interest only when conversing with them
1	his eyes were directed at the floor , too
1	at which point another , was sent gotthold ’ s way , and , to frankfurt : leaving , if one discounts the few thousand marks courant father left in his will to the holy ghost hospital , the businessmen ’ s widows fund , and so forth , approximately , , plus another , from your dowry
1	we can only hope that she regained her strength once she joined her husband again by the baltic
1	let us not be irritable with one another , not today , not here , while in the very next room … go on , tom
1	the truth was that he hardly believed in such a state himself—but it drove him on and would not leave him in peace
1	people are quite enthusiastic , quite enthusiastic
1	what depresses you about it ?
1	several people held their hands cupped to their ears ; others merely held their hands up halfway , suggesting that the strain of concentration had frozen them in that pose
1	and now they wagged their forefingers , cautioning him—it was all very curious
1	i need some time to outfit myself and take care of other matters
1	if for his part our good engineer has already voiced analogous opinions , that only confirms my surmise that , like so many talented young men , he is playing the intellectual dilettante , temporarily experimenting with possible points of view
1	the consul had just gone through several difficult and exhausting days
1	why no beer ? —he had a slight temperature , hans castorp remarked casually—ninety-nine point seven , insignificant
1	in the cycle partly as an ensemble , partly solo , and even as a duet ( sung by the two brothers )
1	there was no more exciting topic of conversation for the town
1	those were not subhuman creatures , herr settembrini informed him
1	the consul could not get his fill of staring at that profile
1	fräulein kleefeld announced knowingly
1	i am about to introduce into my narrative a figure such as a novelist would never dare present to his readers , since invisibility stands in apparent contradiction to the essentials of artistic endeavor , and so , too , of the novel
1	his eyelids were leaden ; his tongue simply would not obey the simplest thoughts when he tried out of courtesy to chat with the englishwoman ; even shifting the direction of his eyes demanded a great struggle with himself
1	one day herr settembrini saw him vanish in a burst of white fog ; cupping his hands and calling after him to be careful , the contented pedagogue turned homeward
1	from then on he was part of the family
1	revival of an old french dance-he called it simply brilliant and deft in the very best sense
1	do not venture to measure what it would mean if in our extreme , singularly awful situation the dams were to break-as they are about to do-and there were no stopping the immeasurable hatred that we were adept at fanning up against us in the nations roundabout
1	brahms thought as little as possible of bruckner 's symphonies ; he called them formless giant serpents
1	they were fresh and alert , gay and merry , engaged with all their hearts and souls
1	but for now , it will have to be another one
1	and when he came back from the sea , his heartbeat was so calm , untroubled , and regular
1	their leading and spiritually most respected members lived celibate lives and were therefore honored with the name of solitary brothers and sisters
1	lads exercised trotting , whinnying , head-tossing horses , ran beside them , one hand on the halter , tugged at their long bridles when they reared , or rode them bareback , naked heels drumming at the animals ’ flanks , out into the sea—and then the muscles of the boys ’ golden-tan backs played in the sunlight and the cries they exchanged or shouted to the horses sounded inexplicably enchanting
1	we provide analysis , a chance to talk things out—and a hell of a lot of good it does
1	my god , you are the one to go , and not our lieutenant
1	raising their eyebrows , total strangers sitting nearby eavesdropped on the altercation , captivated by the passion and finesse of the interchange
1	thomas had not written christian a single line since that day in hamburg when he had personally delivered ten thousand marks courant to him , an advance on his inheritance to cover debts
1	the rest was god ’ s will
1	salomon , redisch , hessenfeld , magnus , iltis , levi , et al
1	no , that ’ s new to me , of course
1	but he was the first person in the house to put aside mourning and suggest life be a bit freer again
1	it may be that mother wouldn ’ t exactly press me to do it—if there ’ s any doubt about something , she always just looks right on past and says , assez
1	for the ancients , in fact , the sacred and the obscene were very often one and the same
1	i haven ’ t got around to buying black ones yet—or , better , i ’ ve neglected to do it
1	his hands now loosened , parted , were spread and raised , palms outward , as if in heathen prayer
1	in fact , he had gradually discovered that it was precisely this sense of intoxication that was the most bearable part of anything he did
1	there was no danger of being cheated
1	we let the lameness and shyness , the chaste scruples and doubts , go to the devil
1	he then laid both hands on his neighbor ’ s forearm , raised one forefinger with its lancelike nail , and , bathing in general approval , demanded they all pay particular attention to the splendid golden hue of the wine in their goblets , to the sugar sweated from the malaga grapes , to a particular kind of salt and poppy-seed pretzel , which he termed divine—and then with one peremptory cultured gesture nipped in the bud any objection to so forceful a word
1	i did indeed once suggest , if we wanted to be serious for a moment , that we consider whether or not a thinker , to whom the needs of the community might matter a great deal , would not perhaps do better to set truth rather than community as his goal , since indirectly and over time community is better served by truth , even by bitter truth , than by a mode of thinking that claims to serve it at the expense of truth , but in reality , by the very denial of the basis of genuine community , works from within in a most sinister fashion for its destruction
1	he had been spared any sight of the struggle , which had taken place primarily at night , and had been touched by it only indirectly—the anxious atmosphere in the house , old fiete ’ s reddened eyes , the comings and goings of doctors
1	we shall have crabs for lunch , herr permaneder , he went on , in high spirits himself
1	when it was all so marvelously remote , lost in the gray distance far beyond those four weeks
1	she bounced up , letting her feet drop over the edge of the bed , and now she started in—with flushed cheeks , scowling brows , and quick , abrupt motions of her head and hands
1	we perceive space with our senses , with vision and touch
1	probably the most distinctive characteristic was the prominent , high cheekbones : they pushed against her unusually wide-set eyes , flattening and lifting them at a subtle slant , and at the same time they were the reason for the soft concavity of her cheeks , which was , then , the direct cause for the slightly voluptuous pout to her lips
1	he had not returned to his former life , then , but had stayed on here—in part , to be sure , because he did not want to leave her grave behind ; but the deciding , and less sentimental , factor had probably been that he had become slightly infected himself and , in his own professional opinion , actually belonged here
1	why do not you call me a coward straight-out !
1	and yet , figurez-vous , i have come to abduct you , to tempt you to be unfaithful for a time , to carry you off through the air on my cloak and show you the kingdoms of the world and their glory , and what is more , to lay them at your feet
1	no , no , i never managed anything more than a watercolor or two
1	economic space , however , is totally different from political , and there is no direct access from ideas of economic usefulness to a political consciousness related to history
1	this would decide herr modersohn ’ s future , his very existence
1	the consul never gambled
1	do you know the feeling , thomas , do you know it ?
1	and before settembrini could rebuke him , naphta began to speak of pious excesses of charity witnessed in the middle ages , amazing examples of fanaticism and ecstasy in the care of the sick—the daughters of kings had kissed the stinking wounds of lepers , with the express purpose of becoming infected , had called the ulcerated sores to which they exposed themselves roses , had drunk the water with which they had bathed those festering bodies , and had declared they had never drunk anything so tasty
1	at first kai ’ s stories were short and simple ; they soon grew bolder , however , and more complicated—and more interesting , because they were not pure fabrications but had some basis in reality , but a reality bathed in a strange and mysterious light
1	ah , it is hard , surrounded by such creatures
1	before the lecture , however , he did something quite perverse and ill advised : he took the notion of going for an extended walk all by himself , which turned out bad beyond all expectation
1	this was how joachim put it—and it pained everyone to see this gentle , sedate young man in open rebellion
1	he did not like it there and wrote plaintive letters to his family expressing a strong desire to leave the institution , where they apparently were very strict with him , and to live as a free man again
1	coffee had been served unusually late , and they went on sitting there for a long time , too
1	smoking his cigarettes , thomas looked about attentively whenever they passed a field of grain and apprised herr permaneder of how each was doing
1	he had not looked up from his musical notations
1	he had taken it with him to the garden , and now , deeply engrossed , he turned page after page
1	but there he suffered such an awful embarrassment that he did know himself what face to put on
1	we accused hans castorp before of being uninhibited , but whatever the aim of his desires , a social acquaintance with frau chauchat was not what he had in mind , and he was in fundamental agreement with those circumstances that worked against it
1	can the reckoning square of numbers be far behind ?
1	inez rodde-now rich , socially secure , and cushioned against lifehad adopted the knoterichs from the little clique of her mother 's former salon guests and made them part of her and her husband 's own social circle , along with , for instance , dr kranich the numismatist , schildknapp , rudi schwerdtfeger , and myself-though not zink and spengler or the theatrical , artistic crowd who had been clarissa 's fellow students-supplementing them with academic types , older and younger docents and their wives from both universities
1	the instrumentation for this dance of
1	he may have had some trouble , then , in following the conversation that took place after this intimate performance in the abbot 's study
1	it looked for a moment as if he was tempted to shake my hand but then refrained
1	well , wait and see , you ’ ve only just arrived
1	are you well satisfied ?
1	she said , hastily countering a gesture morten had made
1	it was really much wiser to stick to one ’ s guns , the way she did—she , too , had a life down in the flatlands , in cannstatt , to be precise , a husband and two children , but she knew how to contain herself
1	are the netherlands still waiting in vain for you to represent them , tom , my boy ?
1	he must be out to make me his personal target ; he blocks me whenever he can
1	how did one look into the heart and mind of a man who dissembled and denied ?
1	and he turned to ask this question politely and gently of the dwarf
1	on the whole , as was to be expected , the will ’ s provisions were aimed at keeping the estate together as best as possible , making frau elisabeth buddenbrook virtually the universal heir and retaining all assets within the business—in which regard , herr marcus gave notice that as a partner he would be strengthening the firm ’ s capital by , courant
1	my general knowledge allowed me to link the term light-year
1	like churlish dross , a bawd , an utter pimp-master , is how you look , is the guise you thought to put on to visit me-but no angel !
1	he bent a metaphorical knee before hermes trismegistos , the humanistic hermes , the master of the palaestra , whom mankind could thank for the sublime gift of the literary word , of agonistic rhetoric
1	when the rest of the party , laden with large sacks of gingersnaps , emerged from the shop , thomas let his eyes drift discreetly over their heads—they were both obviously very embarrassed
1	excuse me a moment
1	the germans should allow the jew to play the mediateur between them and society , to be the manager , the impresario , the agent of germanness-the jew is definitely the man for the job , he should not be sent packing , he is international , and he is pro-german
1	they were all permanent residents , either firmly rooted or at least of very long standing , like dr ting-fu and wenzel the bohemian , whom he met on the stairs , and the group they greeted in dr krokowski ’ s office : herr ferge and herr wehsal for instance , the prosecutor , the ladies levi and kleefeld , not to mention those who had told him about the apparition of holger ’ s head , and , of course , the medium herself , elly brand
1	i must , however , assert that i consider the manner in which you have chosen to widen the lamentable rift separating us to be a sin for which one day you shall indeed be called to answer before the judgment seat of god
1	on one finger could be seen the bright green gemstone of the large signet ring he had now inherited
1	i ’ m a civilian , more or less responsible for myself
1	in the middle of the street , at home with her family , at the dinner table—she would think of them
1	if i have inwardly shrunk away from you , it was because i had to protect myself from you , because your nature and character are a danger to me
1	and , oh , if only herr settembrini had not had reason to fear hans castorp would find it all worth listening to
1	let us all eat , drink , and chat , and let sorrow take care of itself
1	it seems to me as if this would not be all that contrary to the wishes of my late friend
1	the young man with the moustache entered again , his chin pressed to his chest , and sat down with a worried , self-absorbed look on his face
1	the world was being turned upside down
1	herr köppen ’ s ponderous voice carried over the general table conversation
1	german it is not , but humane
1	in the middle of the room , however , was dr
1	i am certainly no homme de génie by birth , any more than i am a man of stature—good god , no
1	zounds , my good engineer
1	i chose an obsolete and not unprejudicial term for such endeavors , however , because there was evident in them a certain trace of mysticism , which at one time would have been suspect as an interest iri sorcery
1	the sky had clouded over completely again
1	my poor boy , she thought , and watched while her poor boy abandoned himself to exuberant exchanges with his cousin , reliving a hundred memories , asking a hundred questions , and throwing himself back in his chair with a laugh at every answer
1	he spoke so low that one could only barely understand him , forcing words between his teeth , as he usually did when he had a headache
1	we laughed , and our goodbye-for i had to make my train-was easy and cheerful
1	and that would in fact be a release , but only for him , not for her—sister berta was her name , by the way , or more accurately , alfreda schildknecht—because she would only move on then to another patient in a more or less advanced stage of the illness , here or at some other sanatorium
1	as if by tacit agreement , neither of them ever mentioned the lecture again
1	we ’ re sitting here just chatting , but in fact i ’ ve come to see you this evening about a very serious and important matter
1	and so , instead , they stimulated her heart with various drugs and induced vomiting several times , which brought some momentary relief
1	both sisters trusted me , which is to say : they appeared to value me as someone justifiably capable of evaluating others , which , however , if the trust is to be complete , also demands a certain standing-apart from the game , an unruffled neutrality
1	i didn ’ t suspect anything definite , she stammered
1	( and automatically he drawled the last word out sleepily , as if he were stretching and yawning )
1	'like ' is not quite the right word
1	schwerdtfeger stopped and stared at the man who had spoken these words , first into one eye , then the other
1	starting up from my book , i gaze out into the chamber , see that sch
1	beware—its lead may prove deceptive
1	take this note or this one
1	time—not the sort that train station clocks measure with a large hand that jerks forward every five minutes , but more like the time of a very small watch whose hands move without our being able to notice , or the time grass keeps as it grows without our eyes ’ catching its secret growth , until the day comes when the fact is undeniable—time , a line composed of elastic turning points ( and here the late , ill-fated naphta would presumably have asked how purely elastic points can ever begin to form a line ) , time , then , had continued to bring forth changes in its furtive , unobservable , secret , and yet bustling way
1	and wading through snow was just as difficult as wading through sand dunes , except when the sun melted the surface during the day and it froze hard again at night : then you moved across it as lightly as across a parquet floor—it was the same easy , pleasant feeling you got walking over the smooth , firm , springy , salt-rinsed sand at the edge of the sea
1	the oxygen tonic of life in the open air , the impressions of the landscape and its history , exhilarated these young men and raised their spirits to those lux-
1	farm to offer my sad congratulations on his fiftieth birthday
1	hans castorp had them bring him tea , and he dunked zwieback in it
1	he also traveled to mittenwald , the village of violin-makers at the upper end of the isar valley , where an apothecary devoted to the same hobby lived and , with the help of his wife and talented sons , put on puppet shows in the style of pocci and christian winter , attracting a large audience of both locals and outsiders
1	frau ziemssen gave the impression that she had run here all the way from hamburg
1	in short and plain , metaspirochaetosis , that is the menengial process
1	the walls were painted with a hard , glistening white enamel
1	lord , you could decorate your house so splendidly
1	could not be forceful enough in its rejection of any dealings with workers ' and soldiers ' councils or similar such bodies , could not remonstrate enough that peace could be concluded only with a stable germany , that only such a germany would be fed
1	they both enjoyed , however , their visits with anton karlovitch ferge from saint petersburg , a fellow with a huge good-natured moustache and a protruding adam ’ s apple that somehow seemed equally good-natured ; he lay there in his bed , recovering very slowly and with great difficulty from an attempted pneumothorax , which , herr ferge said , had come within an inch of costing him his life
1	the intent apparently is to conjure the element of sin , of sensuality , of evil lust right out of marriage-for lust exists surely only if the flesh is twofold , not one , which means that to say they are to be one flesh is mollifying nonsense
1	he was working on a suite of dramatic grotesques , whose subjects , so we were told , were taken from an old book of anecdotes and tales , the gesta romanorum , and was having a go at them without
1	young hans castorp felt invigorated by the beautiful morning
1	you can be sure of it !
1	i would make it part of me , so i could play it in my sleep , and cherish and coddle every note like a mother , because i would be it 's mother , and you would be the father-it would be like a child between us , a platonic child-yes , our concerto , that would truly be the fulfillment of everything the word 'platonic '
1	when one day is like every other , then all days are like one , and perfect homogeneity would make the longest life seem very short , as if it had flown by in a twinkling
1	they casually drifted away again
1	settembrini asked , and with such earnest expectation of an answer that hans castorp found himself forced to admit that this was the first he had heard of it
1	she would say with a deep , doleful voice rough as desert winds , and even when one asked her , how are you ?
1	hermann ’ s brother , moritz , had been an unusually successful student—despite his bad lungs—and established a law office in town
1	have you lost your senses ?
1	and in between she ’ s somewhere else , at other places like this
1	the will no longer triumphed
1	god gives the strength to some , and not to others
1	jean , you can guide our guests out to the back
1	good god in heaven , don ’ t you understand ?
1	but no sooner am i finished than i have to ask myself what ’ s up
1	needless to say , he had only read about these things , had acquired the appropriate books and fed his imagination with them ; but whether he was so committed to the subject and thus retained its images so clearly , or whether it was simply some whim or other , he pretended that he had made the descent himself-in the area of the bermudas to be precise , several sea miles east of st george , where the natural fantastic phenomena of the abyss had been shown him by a companion named capercailzie , whom he described as an american scholar and with whom he claimed to have set a new record for depth
1	what do you mean rose up ’ ?
1	and as always when hans castorp listened to this aria , deep emotions stirred within him , strengthened this time by certain possibilities that were compacted into a wish , and he thought , idle and sinful or not , it would certainly be wonderfully strange and a very special adventure
1	he departed , and his traveling companion unfortunately was not i , who had barely been able to get away from official duties for the concert ; nor this time was it rudiger schildknapp , he of the same-colored eyes , who had not even bothered to come to
1	to be frank , i must admit that it seems to me that music only really begins for the soloist when he has achieved a very high degree of skill
1	there was the same coming and going between his quarters and mine that there had once been between the blessed messengers and his uncle 's house-both of an evening , whether returning from the theater , a concert , or the winfried fraternity , and of a morning , when one would stop by for the other and we would compare notes before setting out for the university
1	the dog days had come late—it was already the second week in september—and summer lay over the city more oppressively than in july
1	using informal pronouns , he now continued , we welcome you most heartily , good fellow
1	just imagine , one evening at an operetta—it was in london—the curtain went up when i was still out on the stage
1	adrian refused to accept the term
1	i know that before composing the piece , leverkiihn made a careful study of the treatment of the violin by beriot , vieuxtemps , and wieniawski , and applied all this in a style that was half-respectful , halfcaricaturing-and which , by the way , made such technical demands on the soloist ( especially in the extremely rollicking and virtuoso second movement , a scherzo , where there is a quote from tartini 's devil 's trill sonata ) that our good rudi had to summon his utmost skill to do them justice
1	adrian could be certain that elsbeth leverkiihn had taken this death with the same quiet composure , the same understanding acceptance of human mortality , as had mother schweigestill
1	it seemed to have satisfied him , to have actually done him good , finally to have made his brother angry , to have at last enabled him to react vigorously and raise some protest
1	why not another week yet ?
1	to which is added :
1	a few months would have to pass before i followed his call , i had nonetheless been immediately prepared to do so-indeed , it might not even have required his invitation
1	and y ’ certainly wouldn ’ t read no telegram while you ’ re eatin ’ , sure as hell wouldn ’ t
1	no accommodation , no concessions to scientific criticism can help
1	the passage is very funny , especially since it is the women , the vulgar , and the illiterate who rebel against this invention and insist that they be allowed to
1	i took the liberty of paying my respects to your good mother and was grieved to find you weren ’ t at home
1	it was too dark in the carriage to make out the expression on his face
1	positioned between east and west , it will have to choose , will have consciously to decide , once and for all , between the two spheres vying for its heart
1	and soon did parley with him , that killjoy , that bawd , in an italian chamber , had intercourse with him , who had much to convey to me of hell 's quality , fundament , and substance
1	he is inward-looking , intellectually inclined , averse to sensual things , in my opinion
1	good man alive , my best wishes for good results
1	oh , it ’ s just an expression—a figure of speech
1	he shook his head , repeatedly thrusting one index finger at the ground , and his ragged lips parted with considerable effort to form the word here !
1	it was the healthiest of all
1	has he finally gone off the deep end ?
1	i know how very much you contributed to making her stay in munich so pleasant and enjoyable
1	ah , how they all wanted to hear some of his poetry
1	i was surely born for it !
1	prosecutor paravant , who was severely afflicted , threw himself into math—he ’ s busy squaring the circle these days , and it has greatly eased his problem
1	the sun shone , it was a beautiful , bright day ; but it had been a good idea to put on spring overcoats—the drive would be cool , no doubt
1	but the loveliest thing about her was her voice , a warm mezzo-soprano , and when she employed it for speech , colored with a touch of a thuringian accent , it was extraordinarily winning
1	oh , i ’ ll have none of your fate !
1	he mounts the stairs in triumph , waving a stack of programs in his hand
1	but that hearth enables you to perceive me and without it , surely , you would see me not
1	hans castorp peered in as they passed , and discovered them empty
1	they were in their element then , whereas stature was not , and one could at least be of differing minds as to what role it actually did play
1	couldn ’ t you have told me that before now ?
1	he thought it up just now ,
1	but please don ’ t misunderstand me—that does not mean that i consider myself an angel and free of all guilt
1	in that case it ’ s ever so much better never to marry
1	but i fear it will be the only thing i can do for you
1	joachim had been given roses
1	i , on the other hand , declare that the issue of freedom—or , to put it more concretely , the issue of cities—as highly moral an issue as it may be , is historically associated with a most inhuman degeneration of economic morality , with the many horrors of modern marketeering and speculation , with the satanic rule of money , with commerce
1	one should love them
1	already on the second reading , i found it quite remarkable that the style , this burlesque or personal adaptation of kumpfian antiquated german , lasts only until the adventure is told and is afterward casually dropped , so that its color is bleached out of the concluding pages , which display a modern verbal character
1	dark blue smudges of congested blood on clarissa 's beautiful hands and face suggested a rapid death by suffocation , the abrupt paralysis of the breathing mechanism by a dose of cyanide that could easily have killed a company of soldiers
1	and so she inspected apartments , consulted with jakobs the upholsterer , negotiated with shopkeepers about portieres and carpet runners
1	but it would be a very unusual arrangement for our kind of house , he said
1	tony ’ s tears suddenly ceased
1	he asked sympathetically and sat down gently beside hanno on the bench
1	even pastor pringsheim sits there sipping at the layer of cool whipped cream above the hot chocolate ; he is still dressed in his ruff and long robe , his broad , shiny black boots sticking out from under the hem , and he chats away with that same transfigured face , but in an easy conversational tone that is much more effective than his homily
1	them ) ; the hopes that the world wanted to place in you after your first , comparatively gentle collapse , after the abdication of the kaiser 's empire ; the hopes that for a few years-despite your rowdy behavior , despite the totally mad , fiercely desperate , wildly demonstrative bloating of your misery , that inflation of currency scrambling drunkenly skyward-you seemed to justify to some extent
1	washed by surging tides , and there , once fetters have been placed on his feet and the key flung into the sea , gregory spends seventeen years of penitence , at the end of which there comes an overwhelmingthough he , it seems , finds it hardly surprising-elevation by grace
1	but the consul ’ s wife said , when we use such words , christian , the lord punishes us with even worse sickness !
1	he is an angel now , sesame corrected her
1	in that regard , it was herr settembrini who was pious and strict , and naphta who was lax and slovenly , referring truth back to man and declaring that whatever profited man was true
1	nothing left unsaid gnawed at her ; no unspoken emotions weighed her down
1	people left him in peace—rather like a student who enjoys the peculiarly amusing situation of no longer being asked questions , of not having to do any work , because the decision has already been made to hold him back and so he is no longer in the running—an orgiastic sort of freedom , we may add , while asking ourselves whether there can be freedom of any other sort
1	i won ’ t do that , let me tell you
1	it ’ s possible i ’ ll not be able to stay on , that i ’ ll have to leave—would you be offended ?
1	in fact , the moment conversation turned to his late father , he was obviously embarrassed and uneasy , and it seemed that he feared not just some indelicate expression of deep or solemn emotion , but that he feared and avoided all feeling
1	thomas stopped to point up at the pole and wreath with his walking stick
1	he asked as they walked across the entrance hall
1	outlined against the blue were the unchanged hallmarks of schiahorn , green towers , and dorfberg—joachim ’ s eyes rested on them
1	young count mölln had to walk a good distance by himself after that , all the way to his father ’ s manor house
1	in short , it bothered me
1	others emerged to be considered
1	on the way home , he got joachim to agree that official channels should be opened to deal with his cold and sore throat—this meant asking the bath attendant to inform the head nurse , which would then result in something being done for his sufferings
1	that comes from the asiatic east and her illness , hans castorp replied
1	it ’ s hard to imagine what it would be like to touch human skin without greasy cholesterol
1	where the bee sucks , there suck i , in a setting for soprano , celesta , muted violin , oboe , muted trumpet , and the flageolet tones of the harp-and truly anyone hearing these gently spiriting sounds , even if only with his mind 's ear by reading them , may well ask with ferdinand in the play , where should this music be ?
1	now , why was that ?
1	you need only glance out the window when i ’ m done , senator
1	and—bang ! —a bullet had struck him right in the head
1	clarissa was hoping to make her way
1	you can ’ t suppose i ’ ve been struck blind and can ’ t see how things stand
1	and so when i say strep , behrens began anew , you should not picture the standard severe symptoms , of course
1	a little caution is in order—you can ’ t light one from the other
1	the noise level in the classroom did not diminish in the least when the bell rang for fourth period
1	in his jargon , they were dealing with biopsychic projections of subconscious complexes into the objective world , processes whose source one should attribute to the medium , a person whose constitution was in a somnambulant state ; one might speak of such events as objectified dreams to the extent that they demonstrated an ideoplastic capability in nature—the capacity of thoughts , under certain conditions , to assume substance and thus reveal themselves in ephemeral reality
1	with her head laid back and both arms stretched straight ahead or straight up , she spoke out of anger , resentment , out of genuine , deeply felt outrage
1	life ’ s not all that bad here , after all—and a little courtesy is in order
1	the columned hall was the setting for the wedding , just as on that day long ago when frau grünlich had worn the myrtle
1	not for another twelve , thirteen minutes
1	a little mountain air in bad kreuth or a little sea air in glücksburg or travemünde doesn ’ t seem to have had any effect
1	been under consideration for a long time now
1	i can not always be taking care of the child
1	take a train sometime from leuna to halle
1	but i wasn ’ t using it , he suddenly shouted to the whole room
1	and in response to fräulein engelhart , who without looking at him asked , with a dull blush and a skewed smile , how he liked their new guest , he said with perfect equanimity that mynheer peeperkorn was a blurred personality—a personality , true , but a blurred one
1	a quick knock—and she went straight from the hallway to her brother ’ s office
1	our nackedey and kunigunde rosenstiel took turns calling at pfeiffering
1	what do you want ?
1	where was all this getting him ?
1	now he leaned back and ran the tips of his mustache through his fingers , lost in thought
1	she came here with thomas , twenty-one years ago now , and we have all loved her , although she probably always thought of us as something of a bother
1	adam weishaupt modeled his humanitarian secret society strictly on the jesuit order
1	frau ziemssen—a sensible , reasonable , though in no way sanguine lady—took the director aside and suggested the fall , october perhaps , as a date for joachim ’ s discharge , and behrens agreed with her to the extent that by then one would at least be further along than one was at present
1	but is that any comfort when you are lying open-eyed at midnight and , alone and without advice from anyone , you must answer yes or no , must decide the one question that will determine the rest of your life—and not just your life alone ?
1	they came in beautiful enameled boxes with gilt depictions of a globe , lots of medallions , and an exposition hall with banners flying
1	all of that was pleasant
1	quickly closing the door with both hands and without looking around , hans castorp turned now to the right , toward the door with the thumbtacked calling card ; with a kind of forward rocking motion , he reached it in a few soundless strides
1	no , clavdia , you know perfectly well that what you say is not true and is spoken without conviction , of that i am certain
1	you ’ re probably unfamiliar with de miseria humanae conditionis by innocent the third—a very witty literary work , from the end of the twelfth century
1	sit venia verbo , into mere begging , into a plea for mercy , an oh , lord and god , take pity , into a help me and give me and be so good as to
1	muted chords of a chorale drifted toward him ; a march followed after a brief pause
1	that ’ s pure sluggishness , the italian replied
1	ah , the masses are ignorant , i know that
1	the tension was palpable
1	are you trying to tease me , fräulein buddenbrook ?
1	moreover , he had to play for a subscriber 's concert of the zapfenstosser orchestra that same evening , something to which adrian had not even given a thought
1	its rough plank walls were full of carved inscriptions , initials , hearts , and poems
1	i discovered an exotic old tome on his desk , a thirteenthcentury french rendition in verse of the vision of st paul , the greek text of which goes back to the fourth century
1	but lodovico settembrini spoke , too , about himself and his origins when he was alone with the cousins—during walks or at the evening gatherings or after the noonday meal when a large majority of patients had already left the dining hall and the three gentlemen remained seated at one end of the table for a while as dining attendants cleared dishes and hans castorp smoked a maria mancini , which by the third week had regained some of its flavor
1	hans castorp could only smile at it—but he bent down over his knees to hide his smile and experienced the inner glow of joy
1	damages of million , and the figures are a rather precise calculation
1	i ’ ve a business matter to discuss , and if i might ask the good consul to join me for a walk in the garden …
1	why are you so upset ?
1	and he found himself transported to an earlier stage of life , one which only a few nights before had served as the basis for a dream filled with more recent impressions
1	the bones protruded above his sunken cheeks , and his naked , fleshless , gaunt nose jutted out between them in one huge hook
1	hanno buddenbrook had nothing to fear from him and was almost never asked a question
1	there was no other way to put it , the word itself said it all
1	determined not to hear any more , he turned and opened the door
1	he stuck out his hand decisively , as if to say , be quick about it , please
1	i was under the impression that you had sheets of them folded up and tucked away in a little pocket of your wallet , all arranged according to denomination
1	the good of all is the fundamental principle of our brotherhood
1	of late , he had begun to get a little stout—the only part of his carefully groomed exterior that betrayed the advance of years
1	she had locked the girl in her room for now , until this man of the world was gone
1	but even so , what was such ignorance in comparison with our confusion when confronted by phenomena like memory—or the even more astounding extended memory that allowed acquired characteristics to be inherited ?
1	he usually ate his midday meal with adrian , in the hoftheater restaurant or in one of the beer cellars in the center of town , but very soon , putting his leipzig connections to good use , he gained entree to private homes and managed to have a table set here and there for him at noontime ( not to mention evening invitations ) -after a shopping trip , perhaps , with the lady of the house , who found his gentlemanly poverty fascinating
1	a high-flown conversation often passed right over their heads without their much caring-they would pretend to listen in smiling modesty or earnest astonishment
1	as hans castorp passed through the door with the calling card tacked decoratively to it , he found the nordic child already under the doctor ’ s wing
1	well , what is herr von maiboom ’ s problem ?
1	settembrini responded with a subtle remark : it seems some generalizations reflect on the person making them
1	that , too , my lad
1	now would i make cordial christian request of you that you not take and judge my discourse to the worse , but that it be understood to the best , for verily i have a longing to make full and fellowly confession to you , who are good and unharmful and , if not unsinful , sinful but in such common and tolerable wise that i do heartily detest , yet fervently envy you , for the hour-glass stands before my eyes so that i must needs behold when the last grain has run through the bottle neck and he will fetch me to whom i have pacted myself so dearly with my own blood that i shall eternally belong to him body and soul and fall into his hand and dominion when the glass has run out and time , being his ware , is come to its end
1	when he did receive her , or if they happened to meet outdoors , she would tell him about her daughters , making sure to keep her lips closed over a gap in her front teeth when she laughed ; for this , too , and not just her hairline , was now a source of worry to make her flee the company of others
1	but then , when uncle justus began pouring some oily , yellow greek wine in the smallest glasses and the iced meringues appeared—red , white , and brown—his appetite returned
1	then he spits tobacco juice at his feet , because in this crowd there is no way he can shoot in a wide arc , hitches up his trousers by the belt with both hands , and goes on : hagenström , he ’ s such a tub o ’ lard he can ’ t even breathe through his nose right , that ’ s how fat he is
1	herr kesselmeyer asked , wrinkling up his nose and staring through his pince-nez
1	and now give me the letters from clara and the pastor
1	she had known all along that herr permaneder had none of the industriousness that her first husband had displayed far too much of
1	oh , sometimes it ’ s much worse
1	the boy ahead of him was hans hermann kilian , a small fellow with brown , greasy hair and broad shoulders
1	this was a strange wax doll , and there was something gruesome about the way they had dressed it up for this ceremonial occasion
1	invitations were declined on the telephone by his faithful landlady , or were simply left unanswered
1	she was a fairly cheeky young thing , whose high spirits had caused her parents , in particular the consul , considerable worry , and although she was bright enough and could quickly learn anything demanded of her in school , her behavior was so unsatisfactory that the principal , one fräulein agatha vermehren , finally had to visit meng strasse and , though perspiring with embarrassment , politely suggested to the consul ’ s wife that her young daughter be given a serious reprimand—for despite many well-intended warnings she had once again been guilty of a flagrant piece of mischief right out on the street
1	i ’ m merely visiting my cousin ziemssen for a few weeks and using the occasion for a little relaxation myself
1	but just wait , if you had been there , you wouldn ’ t know what kind of face to put on , either , thinking back on it
1	gentlemen , the historical connection between humanism and pedagogy only proves the psychological basis of that connection
1	and all the while he gets harsher and harsher in his demands that erika be cheerful and keep his mind off his worries
1	but there was something else as well that made my heart beat so strangely with joy and doubt , for on my next visit to pfeiffering adrian let drop some remarks to the effect that he had perhaps lived here for too long a time , that changes in the externals of his life were possibly at hand , that if need be his loner 's solitude might quickly come to an end , that he was toying with a plan to make an end of it , etc-in short , remarks whose only possible explanation was that he intended to marry
1	over long complex passages , all three are superimposed , until finally , and indeed in a triumphant fashion that electrifies every concert audience , the c minor declares itself openly
1	he said , directing his pop-eyes at the wall clock
1	but , to judge from her husband ’ s letters , her health was not of the best ; and the headaches from which she had suffered as a child now appeared with periodic regularity and had grown almost unbearable
1	next to the stairs stood a couple of enormous old cupboards and a carved chest
1	no , it never entered his mind to seek out a real acquaintanceship
1	ah , yes , they may well prove to be fascinarii , our revellers-in better cases , such as yours
1	and that encoded sound reads as : h-e-a-e-es : hetaera esmeralda
1	well , that certainly makes a botch of the property
1	he had long since proved what a tough cavalier he was—it was hard to know what he had used to breathe with toward the end
1	and the rest of the day was so free and had no real schedule , a wonderful lazy and coddled life of ease that passed serenely and without a care
1	their fruit should , can , and will be a humanism colored by religion and defined by a sense of man 's transcendental mystery , by proud awareness that he is not merely a biological creature , but rather that a decisive part of his nature belongs to a spiritual and intellectual world ; by awareness that the absolute has been given him-concepts of truth , of freedom , of justice-that he has been charged with the duty of approaching what is perfect
1	her aunt , he said , knew that he was here and would join them after he had spoken with her about a very important , very serious , and lovely matter
1	the consul smiled again
1	costs little or nothing , a mere nineteen pfennigs , natural color , but an aroma that you don ’ t normally find at the price
1	so that was your first night up here
1	since our intent all along has been to make him no better or worse than he was , it should also be noted that when poor wehsal approached him privately one evening and begged with ashen words for god ’ s sake to please tell him in strict confidence about his experiences that night of the mardi gras party , hans castorp had complied with calm charity , although , as the reader can well imagine , he did not permit anything the least bit base or frivolous to sully that hushed scene
1	and now you ’ re starting in on humanity , just like settembrini
1	you see in me a man , father , who has struggled tirelessly against fate , but who has at last been struck down
1	she had been with the buddenbrooks for twenty years now and was proud of how indispensable she was
1	he spoke very forcefully and with unusual coherence about medicines and poisons , and hans castorp tilted his head and nodded as he listened , less concerned with the contents of what was said , which seemed very important to the dutchman , than with quietly exploring the effects of the man ’ s personality , which ultimately was as inexplicable as the effects of snake venoms
1	on the third day , however , it was as if nature had taken a tumble—everything was turned upside down
1	but now tell me , how are you ?
1	others claimed to have seen little flecks of white light , shifting points of concentrated energy that had appeared repeatedly along the folding screen
1	it was just before the presents were to be given out
1	he had a droll plattdeutsch comment to add for every shot , and now and then he cheerily recited to himself : as maréchal saxe …
1	what would a woman like her do with children ?
1	and herr albin pointed with his index finger to his close-cropped blond head
1	he spoke somewhat ponderously and his voice was a little scratchy
1	and he was evidently not in the least embarrassed by it ; on the contrary , he luxuriated grandly in it and took royal delight in jostling his escorts to the right or left as he tottered along
1	ah , and so you have already made his acquaintance ?
1	the fancy can not cheat so well as she is fam would to do , deceiving elf
1	she wept bitterly when the time came to say farewell to her little johann
1	and there in the back row , a head and a pair of shoulders emerged—it was kai , count mölln
1	tony thought : how does he know my parents so well ?
1	he was swamped with private and public duties
1	he laughed and said again , come on , get off , don ’ t be shy !
1	it is sufficient that , supported and strengthened by them , i intend to remain true to my enterprise
1	the rain went on for days , it poured one whole week , and without the compensations of the lounge chair it would have been very hard to spend so many hours reclining out there , your face numbed and wet from the damp murk of clouds
1	isn ’ t it remarkable , morten , how you can ’ t get bored at the beach ?
1	dr krokowski was in professional uniform as well , except that his smock was more shirtlike , with elastic at the wrists , and of a black , shiny fabric that only emphasized his pallor
1	hans castorp let his head fall briefly , but then sat up straight again and took a deep breath
1	good lord , i would not have you believe i consider myself too good for any profession
1	but it is an abstraction in about the same way as the naked body is abstract-it 's practically genitalia
1	it was a great joy to hear him call something true ; it was an anchor , a stay-one no longer asked oneself quite in vain about the
1	with gestures of refined clumsiness , sometimes stroking gently over the thick hair at temples and nape
1	one day he had insisted that , instead of walking along the mühlenwall , hanno come with him to his father ’ s farm to see some newborn guinea pigs , and fräulein jungmann had finally given in to their pleas
1	what i mean is
1	fury , the cerebral achievement that it represents , as it is for the unanticipated mixing of sounds that an incomparable fantasy for combination , that an ear eager to hear what has never been heard before has wrested from all three instruments
1	and how will art live as comprehension ?
1	because he had also hired a chauffeur to drive him to his office , and that young man , nothing special except he looked awfully dapper in his braided livery , had done wrong by the young lady , making her lose her head
1	once again the technician in his white smock opened the door
1	he would speak of dos banderas , of the two flags to which armies rallied for the great struggle—the flags of heaven and hell , the former in the region of jerusalem , with christ as the capitán general commanding the armies of the good , and the latter on the plains of babylon , with lucifer as caudillo or chieftain
1	and now what happened is this
1	to be sure , he could not then count on being fetched at the station by the schweigestill 's vehicle ; in such cases advance arrangements could be made with a livery service in waldshut
1	fat lüders stood up
1	throughout the district , he was thought of as someone special , and not just by those of his own creed , as someone who knew more than others—about religious matters in part , but also about other things that made him seem a little uncanny , or at the least , out of the ordinary
1	ultimately dubious was the legitimacy and relevance of her homesickness for a bourgeois world
1	you had a headache not long ago , too , didn ’ t you ?
1	she was explaining that she knew how to prepare twenty-eight different sauces for fish—and she would stake her reputation on the fact , although her husband had warned her not to speak about it
1	there was no baron riedesel to advocate things graceful ; the piano-playing cavalryman had vanished through history 's trapdoor
1	this is the typical mode of experience of someone lost in a mountain snowstorm , who never finds his way home , he thought as he struggled along , the phrases emerging in tattered , breathless fragments—discretion forbade his putting it more explicitly
1	he kept coming out into the corridor to cry every few minutes , like a little boy
1	but for now , there was a succession of beautiful october days—days like the one on which the cousins had viewed the director ’ s oil paintings
1	i refused him , i could not bring myself to consent to his proposal of marriage
1	well , allow me then to offer my most heartfelt congratulations
1	why , you could marry one of my brothers , for example
1	his offer was refused
1	we wrote it down in our oilcloth-bound notebooks so that , more or less consoled , we could carry it home
1	his acclimatization was complete , he had no more visions , his body no longer lay inert on the bench while his innermost self wandered in some distant present—nothing of that sort happened
1	he could not give the results of this meeting a very high rating
1	and however cold it got—and it did get very cold—there was no point in his taking refuge in the room , because as long as it wasn ’ t snowing , there was no heat , so that it was no more comfortable for him to sit in his room than to put on a winter overcoat , artfully wrap himself in his two good camel-hair blankets , and lie out on the balcony
1	dr blumenkohl , who had been doing very poorly again of late , muttered something to himself—with a look on his face , or better , about his lips , that was peculiarly his own—that indicated the source of these verses
1	ah , clavdia , why not ?
1	i have my shortcomings , and i ’ m quite certain that i didn ’ t always do the right thing
1	what does it matter ?
1	they were about to stand out of respect , but he told them to remain seated
1	and that clearly meant that his freedom , like naphta ’ s truth , was tied to just one thing : man
1	beyond the town , the road became a mountain path that led past a capuchin monastery to the scant remains of an acropolis at the peak , next to which were also the ruins of an ancient theater
1	indeed , one has the impression you have made a bet with madame , a philopena , by the terms of which you are never to address her directly
1	didn ’ t i possess it ?
1	he wrote on sanatorium stationery , taken from an ample supply in his table drawer , to james tienappel , the uncle to whom he felt closest of the three , and asked him to inform the consul
1	i was paying attention , you see , but none of it was clear
1	petersen went limp , his face turned gray
1	was there any point in her wearing gossamer sleeves so that men would be curious about her body—about her diseased body ?
1	people rummaged in their limited knowledge of human nature and found dusty clichés by which to measure senator buddenbrook ’ s wife : still waters run deep , or butter wouldn ’ t melt in her mouth
1	just this visit of ours did me some good
1	oh , right , you are in hops , herr permaneder
1	she was met with anxious agreement , which adrian noticed now with some surprise , since he had not heard the original question
1	a servant arrived with whisky , beer , and soda water on a large tea tray
1	then , when aunt lottie had closed the door behind her and vanished , he said more softly , you can put those away now , anna
1	he had to laugh at the term , bending over as he walked and laughing down at the wet sidewalk
1	the yellow mouthpiece of a russian cigarette he had already finished wandered nervously from one corner of his mouth to the other
1	believe me , pfühl , this music is much less foreign to your inner nature than you think
1	but who would deny that it can also be instructive just to hear of a great unfamiliar work ?
1	they simply struck up silent night , holy night , all by themselves in the salon , after which therese weichbrodt read the christmas story with very precise diction—taking gerda ’ s place , because she did not particularly enjoy that sort of thing
1	and joachim simply replied , yes , so you did , and paid the driver
1	the director promptly dropped the hand
1	i just have to look at her—and then there ’ s the unmannerly way she slams doors , too—i certainly don ’ t imagine she ’ s an angel
1	hans castorp could not help slamming his hand , though with restraint , on the edge of the table
1	he subscribed to a newspaper call the aryan light , and made speeches , as follows :
1	oh , by the way , he said , his hand on the doorknob , you ’ ve made quite an impression on him , tony
1	here , my hand on it
1	it seems you have something weighing on your mind , my friend , the senator said in amazement
1	he paid for their meal
1	the publisher of his translations of older english literature was located here , after all , which was of some practical value for rudiger ; and besides , he had truly missed adrian 's company , whom he immediately brought to laughter with the tales of his father and his view
1	and what do you suppose this tall dragoon says next ? —an émigrée , you mean ?
1	for me , and surely for one or two other guests , this exchange had been a quickly erupting duel between rigorous mediocrity and an intellect pained by the depth of experience
1	the consul spoke earnestly and eagerly
1	she was indeed well-read and was not accustomed to leading a mute interior life , but to articulating it , and even as a young girl had attempted to write poetry
1	there were objects of every sort—made of porcelain , nickel , silver and gold , of wood , silk , and linen
1	it is at your disposal
1	the strangest thing about him , however , was his eyes : large , extraordinarily keen eyes , so black that they seemed to glow somewhere in bottomless depths , eyes that rested on everything and everyone with a shimmering , enraptured seriousness
1	hans castorp and peeperkorn were both seated at the narrow end of their respective tables , their backs to the middle of the room , more or less beside one another , with the dutchman a little ahead of hans castorp , making discreet observation easy—and he could also glance across and see frau chauchat in three-quarter profile
1	slowly she lifted her hands , and those of the two guardians , to her brow , where she let them rest awhile
1	could there be anything more godforsaken than the purely intellectual ?
1	and get well , by the way
1	is a man of a more spindled figure , not near so tall as sch , yet shorter than -a sporting cap tugged at one ear , and on the other side reddish hair extending from the temple upward ; reddish lashes round likewise reddened eyes , the face pale as a cheese , with the tip of the nose bent slightly askew ; a stocking-knit shirt striped crosswise with sleeves too short and fatfingered hands stuck out ; trousers that sit untowardly tight , and yellow , overworn shoes ne'er to be clean again
1	it also opened doors for me , in my role as director , to several aristocratic salons frequented by those same artists
1	a party to your heart ’ s desire ,
1	because men want the company of men up here , if you understand me
1	it sounded like my boshy kock hanna !
1	though i ’ m not sure if it ’ s proper for you to come bearing tales
1	and johann buddenbrook thanked them all for their gracious words , first as the head of the family and second as the senior partner of the commercial enterprise—and sent thomas back for a third bottle of madeira , because it had turned out his son had been wrong in assuming that two would suffice
1	she could not get over it
1	listen here , joachim said , what ’ s wrong with you ?
1	who knows … she stopped right there , and in her face they saw a beautiful dream collapsing in ruins
1	i might compare his isolation to an abyss into which the feelings others expressed for him vanished soundlessly without a trace
1	her answer· was to the effect that this limitation only brought his lovableness closer to her suffering spirit , that without it her spirit would have had no hope , that it had made his fickleness receptive to her own cry of pain
1	here , too , paths had been shoveled between railed-in , snow-covered mounds—gravesites , each containing a series of regular , properly made beds decorated with stone and metal crosses or little monuments adorned with medallions and inscriptions
1	how almost unrecognizable his face became when he was alone
1	and what is closest and most intriguing , most truly my own , is not mere
1	it would be disgraceful if i were to miss the meeting
1	she almost burst with laughter as he started on his way , and then she went back into her apartment
1	i shall attempt to provide as concise an outline as possible of the es-
1	but poor hans castorp grew even gloomier watching the solitaire players , who could be seen at work everywhere in the berghof at all hours
1	maria is back to her old self , thank god , she ’ s been tasting good for several days now
1	he played with the comparison between the knife-sharp pains that the mute beauty was willing to suffer with every step of her white walking-pins and those that he constantly had to endure , called her his sister in sorrow and presented a kind of intimate and humorously objective critique of her conduct , her willfulness , her sentimental longing for the two-legged world of human beings
1	it was not too unreasonable to hope that the adversaries were agreed in their intention not to let it come to actual bloodletting
1	it concludes further that it is the duty of every person who desires to satisfy that natural purpose to cooperate in the cause of human progress
1	so it ’ s to be divided
1	and i have played
1	a colossal smoked ham , brick-red and strewn with bread crumbs , appeared , along with a brown , tart shallot sauce and mounds of vegetables so large that they all could have filled themselves from just one bowl
1	how is it possible , really , that she does not understand something so fundamental , so absolute ?
1	and anyone who dared be seen on the street with a walking stick could likewise expect painful indignities to be visited publicly upon him during the next gym class
1	between nine-thirty and ten , in the middle of the morning , his body temperature was
1	they listened , mouths open and smiling
1	the reader is accustomed to such prematurity from me , and he should not interpret it as befuddlement or a lack of literary restraint on my part
1	surely you like her too , do not you ?
1	he was well past his fifteenth birthday and no longer wore danish sailor outfits , but a tan suit and a blue tie with white polka dots
1	the phenomenon , as i said , amused me-and then again , it weighed more anxiously on my heart , since the reason behind people 's behavior was in fact the atmosphere of indescribable aloofness and solitude that increasingly surrounded him , a distancing that during these years was becoming ever more noticeable and could indeed make one feel as if adrian came from some land where no one else dwells
1	and thomas buddenbrook turned away in hopeless disappointment from his only son , in whom he had hoped to live on , strong and rejuvenated , and began in haste and fear to seek for truth—which had to exist somewhere for him
1	i am your most obedient servant , but i will not play it
1	here and there small boys threw their caps in the air and shouted hurrah !
1	this local advertiser is a pitiful rag , really
1	director wulicke ’ s sudden appearance was a surprise attack , and except for two or three students , no one was prepared
1	but it ’ s high time we went off to our rest cure—twenty minutes at most until tea
1	his reason should have jumped at the chance to assert itself
1	she could not picture any of the skeptical , claret-drinking , jovial young merchants from their social circle taking his place at the side of her serious and god-fearing daughter , but she could definitely imagine a man of the cloth
1	it ’ s the end of september , and travemünde is still operating
1	what is it i want , castorp ?
1	he collected his hat and cane from the landscape room and promised once again to have his bags brought here at once and to return at four o ’ clock after taking care of that bit of business
1	about the person whose guests we just were , settembrini replied , and to whom i introduced you , very much against my will and intentions
1	hans castorp ’ s grief and worry did not prevent him from focusing objectively on this phenomenon , and he formulated awkward , but clearheaded observations about it in his conversations with naphta and settembrini , when he would report to them about his cousin ’ s condition ; he was rebuked by the italian , however , for observing that there was an underlying error in the conventional notion that philosophical credulity and sanguine trust in the good are expressions of health , whereas pessimism and condemnation of the world are signs of illness ; because otherwise the bleak final state could not bring forth an optimism , compared to whose awful rosiness the preceding gloom seemed a coarse , but healthy expression of life
1	suddenly they hear the sound of stomping and shuffling in the vestibule downstairs , as if a great many people are crowding into the entrance hall all at once ; almost simultaneously a loud , booming voice fills the whole house
1	but the mere naming of this sum filled tom with a nervous , compelling pride that almost made him look out of sorts
1	those flashing black eyes , the devil take me if …
1	i mean , there ’ s no rhyme or reason to it—they don ’ t belong together , one is not used to picturing them together
1	and you are of the opinion that you have none , is that it ?
1	he called out to all sides , keeping his left forearm propped against the tabletop , but raising his right hand and shaking it in the air
1	but it is far from the case that adrian 's monstrous fresco programmatically follows those fifteen illustrations by the man from nuremberg
1	and so the senator sat staring with weary eyes into the darkness of the salon , and a familiar sense of shame and desperate impatience came over him as he pictured the fallen state of the firm of johann buddenbrook and all its insignificant , small-scale , pennywise transactions
1	and there ’ s an end to it !
1	for anything our reason is tempted to call unjust
1	the biographical moment for its inclusion has come
1	and now he said stodgily and peevishly , oh , my dear , i wish we could ignore the whole thing
1	and hanno pretended that he did
1	then came the day when the divorce was granted by law and finalized , and tony took care of the last essential formality—asking thomas for the family papers and entering the new fact in her own hand
1	a good thing it was not sentimental , that would have been rather out of place
1	she did not occupy herself with any art or science , but instead attached great importance to her daughterly role of managing the household ; she read a great deal , however , and wrote extraordinarily well-crafted letters
1	y ’ all got things right nice here , herr permaneder said as he sat down , gazing out over the selection of cold delicacies on the table
1	her stomach would empty its contents and then go on cramping , and the spasms could last for long , torturous minutes
1	i have already said that by its very nature theology tends-and under certain conditions must always tend-to become demonology
1	does he still have some money left ?
1	no wonder , then , that the disintegration that came with defeat brought this feeling to its peak , and no wonder , either , that in an overthrown nation like germany it occupied people 's minds more than it did those of the victors , whose average emotional state was , as the result of victory , far more conservative
1	he put together his thoughts about his theory and added them as a foreword to the turtledove
1	and the thrill was not limited to the person who instigated it
1	i don ’ t understand , hans castorp said
1	oh , he had asked himself that question a thousand times , and responded in one way in his strong and optimistic moments , and in another when he was weary
1	his youthful listener was sure to have noticed , he said , the difference , or even contradiction , between external and internal freedom—and at the same time the ticklish question as to which form of unfreedom was least or most likely , hee hee , to be compatible with a nation ’ s honor
1	she published novels , written under a bizarre pseudonym , in various family magazines
1	the dry stuff is a mere twenty-five percent of the whole , twenty percent being ordinary egg white , or protein , if you want a little more noble word for it , to which just a little fat and salt is then added
1	tony , he said , sitting down sideways on his mahogany desk , one leg crossed over the other , and propping his head in his hand
1	’ t ’ s been an honor , good lady
1	at any rate , his heart had shrunk beneath those looks—which in his eyes had contradicted and denied , in a most flagrant and intoxicating fashion , the reality that he and the sick woman were not so much as social acquaintances—had , in fact , shrunk almost painfully at the first rattle of the glass door , and his breath had come short and shallow as he sat waiting for that moment
1	has the club been registered ?
1	you read about this sort of thing in novels , but now here in the flesh was a man in a frock coat , on his knees , begging
1	i stare into the twilight , fix him with an angry eye
1	after first offering an explanation for his actions—almost an apology , really , since he felt that was expected—both to her and to her parents , hans castorp now paid his tender respects in a hushed , emotional voice
1	gerda arnoldsen ’ s fame spread quickly through the town nonetheless—indeed , she was the main topic of conversation on the exchange , at the club , in the theater , in society in general
1	they spoke the word lord with the pristine ease of the first christians , who with their own ears had heard the master say , yet a little while and ye shall see me
1	because you ’ re an aristocrat yourself
1	as a favor to me ?
1	in my eyes it is the brightest sword that reason has against the powers of darkness and ugliness
1	the people in the dining hall had been right , he now discovered , to have taken the interval so lightly
1	do they think , maybe , that there are no longer any other elegant families in town except them ?
1	hans castorp ate heartily , although with not quite the lively appetite he had expected
1	she got only as far as the middle of the room—and there was herr grünlich beside her
1	no , i lack the expertise for that
1	did i not know the feeling as well , the horror at the intellectual vacuity and nothingness that reigned at the average affair , in garish contrast to the attendant feverish excitement that came from wine , music , and the undercurrent of people interacting
1	then the judgment spoken against this very berowne , condemning him to spend his wit on speechless , groaning wretches for a year , and his cry : it can not be , it is impossible
1	but i ’ m joint partner , too , who must represent the firm ’ s interests , and if papa doesn ’ t think he has any obligation to withdraw moneys from our working capital for a disobedient and rebellious son—we are talking about eleven thousand thalers courant
1	the gauges sizzled with blue light
1	propping her elbows on the secretary , she read with growing enthusiasm , with pride and high seriousness
1	what she gave him was a studied , decorous love , and this much is true : she fulfilled her supportive role with perfect distinction , further refining it with her singular delicate and intricate roguishness of expression
1	but a cough like that—that ’ s something new , to me at least—it ’ s not even human
1	the trio now walked toward the bottom of the valley to the ice rink , which was not far from the resort and in summer served as a soccer field
1	but that you can ’ t get up yet , as you well know , because this silly cough has affected your lungs a bit
1	you shouldn ’ t have been so brusque about rejecting medical treatment , at least not the psychological part
1	herr settembrini then took the floor , and by god , he knew how to make the most of it
1	with the irresponsible curiosity of the tourist thirsting for knowledge , he had studied that old demon , indeed had found potentialities within himself for lively participation in the monstrous acts of homage paid to it by the world all about him
1	do let me make a few introductory remarks
1	over the years , her features had curiously become very like her husband ’ s
1	what would we have done without sister leandra when hanno had seizures while he was teething ?
1	he ’ s sure to find one , and his name will be hermann hagenström—the scoundrel
1	oh , my dear boy , that ’ s not the way , the senator cried
1	hans castorp ’ s eyes stared wide when he realized who it was , and he could feel the blood drain from his face and his jaw go slack—his mouth was close to dropping open
1	she repeated herself several times-out of an eagerness to give more suitable expression to what she had said , out of a sense that it had not yet been given its due
1	paths led up the meadowed hills on their left , but were soon lost to sight in the dull black of pine forests
1	it wouldn ’ t be long before they would have to give me a silent sister to keep me from cheating
1	and when at that same moment the glass door on his left slammed shut with a bang and a rattle , just as it had at first breakfast , he did not flinch as he had earlier that morning , but merely grimaced languidly
1	the topic came up because of adriatica von mylendonk , because of her name
1	it was splotched with red , as if he had scarlet fever
1	one need not be a genius , all one needed was a great deal more talent than the author of this little song about a linden tree to become an enchanter of souls , who would then give the song such vast dimensions that it would subjugate the world
1	they should just calm down now
1	oh , you and your learning !
1	and that is what we recognized betimes and why we have had an eye upon you from early on-we saw that your case was entirely worth our attention , that it was a case of favourable disposition , out of which , presupposing but a little enkindling , incitement , and inebriation , something lustrous might be made
1	before knowing it , i could only conditionally have called myself a partner in your sorrow 's mysteries , as the ode on melancholy puts it at one point-my sole justification being a vague concern i had felt since boyhood for the health of adr , an 's soul , rather than any true knowledge of its state
1	you can window-shop and watch people and buy whatever you need
1	not even bothering to look at his own room , he had hurried directly to room to greet his companion from the old days , which were now present days again
1	it ’ s not for me alone to decide—i ’ ll need your consent
1	there in the dark each was evidently stirred in his own way by a sense of personal and national youthfulness fused into a single emotion
1	in a certain sense , i think , i would not have done badly at it
1	and as they sat , here came director behrens walking through the garden
1	i watched adrian as he conversed with her
1	she was sitting on the bed opposite her sister-in-law , and suddenly , putting her throaty voice to use , she folded her hands and began to speak the words of a hymn—very loudly
1	finally it all came to an end
1	so , then , allow me my detachment
1	it all lasted barely two weeks , including early tokens of a change in his state of health , even the earliest of which prompted no one-i truly believe , no one-to have the least suspicion of the horror to come
1	the man of the exact sciences can , of course , become a teacher , but never a pedagogue in the sense and to the degree that the disciple of bonae litterae can
1	yes , the sleeping bag , hans castorp said , that ’ s probably a necessary piece of gear
1	you must admit i ’ m right there
1	we often did this , by the way
1	adieu , my good engineer
1	mynheer had presided over only one evening of eating and drinking in the previous week , and their walks together had likewise been limited to one abridged stroll
1	oh , it is merely a matter of christian ’ s worrying too much about himself , about what is going on inside him
1	with so much time on his hands , he put comparative morphology to work and made considerable progress in botanical taxonomy
1	it was quite likely that hermann hagenström , a freethinking and loyal fellow , whom wealth had made cheerful and magnanimous , would have greeted her on the street if he had not felt it strictly forbidden by the way she laid her head back and looked right past him , avoiding his pâté-de-foie-gras face , which , to use her own strong language , she hated like the plague
1	how genuinely distressed i was , fräulein , to discover i had missed you , he said
1	but you ’ re lying , aren ’ t you ?
1	all the same , it may well be that we do get cynical up here
1	i myself have spent many daylight hours chatting with him in the abbot 's study , when it was kept so dark that only after long adjustment could my eyes distinguish the outlines of the furniture and a pale luster to the walls
1	i was reading it all during class
1	i could drink a sip of port to that—just to fortify myself a little
1	he assured me that he knew our firm ’ s name quite well , and you can imagine , tom , how pleased i was by the respectful way he said it
1	dr krokowski had appeared for breakfast and taken the seat opposite him at the head of the table ; but , as if in a dream , he barely noticed the fact , although the doctor looked him in the eye , repeatedly and sharply , while carrying on a conversation in russian with the ladies on his right , during which the younger ones—that is , marusya with her rosy complexion and the gaunt yogurt-eater—kept their eyes cast down in meek embarrassment
1	and quinine will be effective there
1	the boss ’ s little speech had come at a critical moment
1	and so let us bless the fates that have thrown you upon these dreadful shores , giving me the opportunity to influence your educable youth with my not unskilled , not yet totally enfeebled words , and to make you aware of the responsibility that you and your country bear , while the civilized world looks on
1	it beats not for purely physical reasons , the way fingernails grow on a corpse
1	a young gentleman with a blond goatee was in charge down here
1	the lieutenant is a respectable fellow , but his is a simple temperament , not prone to spiritual dangers—the sort that never perturbs a teacher
1	it pulled the plug on the keg
1	oh yes , energetic , too , very energetic , hans castorp said
1	it is demagoguery , blasphemy , and madness !
1	he might just as easily have asked about whom ?
1	a trim model ship under full sail hung from the middle of the ceiling
1	for we well know how difficult it is to believe with all one ’ s soul that sweet jesus is ours alone , for how small are our earthly hearts… three pages later , the consul added his amen , but the pen continued to glide , gently rustling across several more pages , describing the precious fount that quenches the thirst of the weary wanderer , the sacred and bloody wounds of the redeemer , the narrow way and the broad way , and god ’ s great glory
1	she looked very pale and shaken ; her eyes were red , and her upper lip quivered just as it had when she had cried as a little girl
1	at these words there was a stir in the audience and someone made to leave
1	very good , the doctor said
1	we are taking the same path— ’ to the right , which leads to the walls of mightiest dis
1	and then the joy had become reality
1	we overdid it last night , he said
1	it may well have been that approaching spring was stirring in their bones and making even sedentary folk restless and eager for change—in any case the number of wild and fraudulent departures from the berghof was increasing to acute levels
1	i mine the human soul 's deep shaft by night , descending boldly down the silent dark , where sorrow 's precious ore has left a mark that glistens reticent and yet so bright
1	there they stood , these gentlemen of accomplishment and wealth , their heads lowered or held mournfully to one side—the legislators among them identifiable by their white gloves and neckties
1	if it never came to that , it was only because he had to devote a large part of his time to the performance of what he had written , to recitals and singing lessons-and his achievements there were downright extraordinary
1	it was something for him to jot down for his collection of aphorisms : one either expresses a mystery in the simplest words , or not at all
1	she represented-should i say , nonetheless ? -the conservative element in the little family , lived in protest against its having been uprooted , against southern germany , this city of artists and bohemianism , against her mother 's soirees , and made a point of looking back to the old paternal world of bourgeois dignity and rigor
1	he ’ s leaving the day after tomorrow , he told me so , and he can ’ t possibly stay on if nothing comes of this tomorrow
1	armgard von schilling talked about the cows at home
1	the case in my room expired just before i arrived , you said
1	( i am listing those pieces that are known to me and that are still extant , even if never published )
1	and at the same time one could be sure that such would also be the case come tomorrow , when , given the favorable probabilities of narrow space and regular schedules , everything would begin all over again
1	yes , they are barbarians , so to speak—uncivilized , to put a word on it—i did warn you
1	it was a gramophone
1	but the idea might also be an expression of something needed by the age , something that might promise a remedy in a time of ravaged conventions and the dissolution of all objective obligations-in short , of a freedom that has begun to coat talent like a mildew and is showing signs of sterility
1	hans castorp knew this room well , from the days when he had spent some hours chatting here with the psychoanalyst , behind joachim ’ s back
1	where are you staying ?
1	indeed , all labor truly deserving of the name is difficult , is it not ?
1	but he was in a very sad state nonetheless
1	you see me standing here before you , gentlemen , about to say my farewells
1	and it ’ s back to göttingen with you tomorrow , do you hear , tomorrow morning !
1	an ingenious toy , then , on the line of the stereoscopic viewer , the tubelike kaleidoscope , and the cinematographic drum ?
1	as a result , there began to surface certain peculiarities and odd whims , which even he noticed , to his own amazement and revulsion
1	and let us draw the metaphor out in full , so that we may be just to the rush of his emotions
1	we have reason to be satisfied
1	from boyhood on , these were all familiar sights to hans castorp , awakening in him a warm sense of belonging , a feeling that reached its zenith , perhaps , on those occasions when he would join james tienappel or his cousin ziemssen—joachim ziemssen—in the pavilion on the alster for a sunday breakfast of warm rolls and smoked beef , washed down by a glass of old port , then lean back in his chair and puff devotedly on his cigar
1	nature here exhibited an intermediate state between the free individual existence of simple units and the highly social organization of countless elemental individuals such as tissues and organs within a dominant self—the multicelled organism being only one possible form life might take as it passed through the cyclical process leading from procreation to procreation
1	he was strengthened by forces close-by
1	i am saying all this to remind the reader of the historical circumstances under which this account of leverkuhn 's life is being written , and to make him realize how the agitated state that is part of my work is constantly being fused beyond recognition with that caused by the convulsions of our day
1	but the real novelty , the distinctive trait that made him so attractive and conspicuous a personage and singled him out for a leading position in the eyes of many people , was his liberal and tolerant nature
1	good god , they ’ re throwing bricks
1	but what would you ?
1	this was her life
1	to great applause—and clamoring cheers !
1	and in conclusion he asked that necessary funds be sent regularly
1	you will please acknowledge here and now that the opposite is the case
1	from a distance now , he examined life in his homeland and found that his interlocutor had characterized it correctly
1	her eyes were moist , her cheeks flushed , and the tip of her tongue played along her upper lip , giving her a look that was part desperation , part mischief
1	it was adrian who spoke for the most part , while we others seconded him only lightly
1	suddenly hans castorp recalled that she was also here waiting to be x-rayed
1	ta ra ta ta !
1	he wondered if grandmama—or mamselle severin , because grandmama could not shop for everything herself—had found the scenery he needed for fidelio
1	across the way , st mary ’ s church lay wrapped in shadows , darkness , and rain
1	that human hide there is a matter of science
1	she lunged and stumbled up the stairs more than she climbed them—the hood of her cloak sat wildly askew , her cheeks were flushed , and little beads of sweat had formed on her slightly protruding upper lip
1	and it was no different in lectures and in the conversations of his fellow students , members of winfried , the christian fraternity that he had joined for appearance ' sake and whose guest i was on occasion
1	joachim laughed heartily , too—it seemed to do him good
1	you did not go to barcelona against your doctor ’ s orders
1	so you ’ re visiting high-ranking patients , are you ?
1	there was miserable wehsal , whose desire for frau chauchat continued to smolder and who humbly revered peeperkorn and hans castorp , the former for his command of the present , the latter for events in the past
1	herr settembrini hoped he was not wrong in assuming that hans castorp had made such a remark merely so that it could be contradicted
1	i don ’ t wish to offend you , and i admit that you are caught up in an awful mess
1	well , he did not doubt that the matter could be settled to the satisfaction of all parties concerned
1	but if he hears the voice of life and shies from it , fearful and reticent , if the memories awakened by its lusty challenge only make him shake his head and stretch out his hand to ward them off , if he flees farther down the path that opens before him now as a route of escape—no , it is clear , he will die
1	how foolish to object that there was something particularly ignominious about blows administered as corporal punishment
1	i think so , too !
1	she sincerely regretted having to think that this change in the situation would also affect i : he messenger and advocate of hopes that could never be realized
1	i ’ ll find some use for them again down below—people have blankets everywhere
1	that was now disputed ; hubmeyer and schappeler disputed it , nor was teutleben in agreement , either
1	no sidewalks , grass growing a foot high between the cobblestones , and houses with bays and stoops and benches jutting out into the streets
1	i really do have a fair overview from here at the base of my column
1	it might have seemed surprising that this young italian lad , who spoke only pleasantly broken german and who surely could have found an excellent opportunity at home to train in his specialty , had found his way to adrian 's uncle in kaisersaschern ; but that was an indication of the commercial ties nikolaus leverkiihn maintained in all directions , not just with german centers of instrument-making like mainz , braunschweig , leipzig , or barmen , but also with foreign firms in london , lyons , bologna , even new york
1	we all know that there is a great difference between how this splendid song sounds as an art song and as a tune in the mouths of children and everyday folks
1	sitting up against his pillows , he turned his face toward the wall and drummed his fingertips lightly on his comforter
1	all the same , joachim discovered him one evening at the usual social gathering in the company of hermine kleefeld , her tablemates gänser and rasmussen , and , as a fifth , the lad with the monocle and saltcellar fingernail ; with his eyes glittering undeniably brighter than usual and with emotion in his voice , hans castorp had delivered an extemporaneous oration on frau chauchat ’ s peculiar and exotic facial features , while his audience exchanged glances , nudged one another , and tittered
1	you are not going to do it , thomas buddenbrook repeated , almost mad with rage—pale , trembling , his hands jerking
1	she was wearing a white dress and , what seemed very strange , a wreath of marshy water lilies on her head ; holding both hands clasped against one shoulder , her sister had nodded to her
1	and afterward , when he was alone with his cousin joachim , he expressly let it be known that he found it more than a bit much , indeed absolutely offensive
1	no one had seen him shed a tear over the death of his father
1	there was one in particular that hans castorp had known since childhood , for which he now developed a mysterious , multifaceted love and of which we shall speak later
1	that was not merely a metaphor—any more than it would be a metaphor to call the body of a multicelled creature a city of cells
1	i understand nothing about it , of course , but its main concern is with human beings
1	it wants nothing to do with strange flesh
1	chin up , tony , courage !
1	meanwhile anton the butler is slicing the towering layer cake and mamselle jungmann is arranging the candies and fresh flowers in silver dessert bowls ; and , mustering everything one last time , she lays her head on her shoulder and spreads both pinkies as far as she can
1	before i forget , he suddenly said rather impulsively , you can go ahead and introduce me to the lady in the garden if we happen to meet her , i have no objections
1	and if you study with kretzschmar , it will be
1	i can ’ t stand it any longer
1	dearest , i beg you , don ’ t get overwrought like this
1	the occupants of the good russian table had withdrawn to a smaller adjoining salon that was set off from the game room by heavy curtains—they formed their own intimate clique
1	most assuredly not—i wouldn ’ t think of it !
1	but i beg your pardon—i climbed a good five thousand feet to join you up here
1	the old maid said
1	all the same , he mastered the demands of school with ease-though the word mastered
1	he asked , baring his teeth , tracing vague designs in the air with his hands , rocking his upper body back and forth
1	these were colleagues of clarissa 's , some fiery young man or other who rolled his r 's or young ladies with voices that sat nicely forward ; a married couple by the name of knoterich-the husband , konrad knoterich , indigenous to munich and looking a perfect ancient teuton , a sugambrian or ubian or the like ( the only thing lacking was the twisted tuft of hair on top ) , who pursued a vaguely artistic occupation and , though he would actually have preferred to be a painter , was now a dilettante maker of instruments and a cello-player of considerable savagery and inaccuracy , snorting fiercely through his aquiline nose as he played ; and his wife , natalia , a brunette who wore earrings and long black curls that dangled down over her cheeks , with an exotic spanish look about her , likewise a painter of some sort
1	what now follows occurred on a sunday afternoon late in the summer of
1	but hans castorp , with his eye on his goal and his lungs apparently working superbly , did not let that bother him much
1	it ’ s too late to get married tonight
1	the rooms quickly grow quiet
1	during the one brief hour after supper—and sometimes that shrank to a mere twenty minutes—when there was some regular social interchange , without exception madame chauchat would take her seat at the back of the little salon , an area reserved apparently for the good russian table , where she was joined by the gentleman with the concave chest , the droll frizzy-haired girl , silent dr blumenkohl , and the two hunch-shouldered youths
1	after all , never-failing public indoctrination has made sure that we are profoundly aware of the crushing consequences , in all their irrevocable horror , of a german defeat , so that we can not help fearing it more than anything else in the world
1	quite true , at least in regard to a given people ’ s relation to their clergy
1	and so the week had been devoured , it was sunday afternoon and the distribution of the mail was proceeding as if this were still the sunday of seven days before
1	it was evident that he did it to savor both his own powers of memory and the words themselves—and to show them off to his audience
1	the fact that they give their best to pretense deserves all due respect
1	i suppose you want to go along ?
1	from those godly edifices , our conversation revolved around the person of this , as he is called , unhappy ( why unhappy , really ? )
1	in the most common language she makes it quite clear that i have nothing to say to her , that i am not her employer , that i did not hire her , and that she is going to keep the keys until she leaves
1	an absurd , howling farce ?
1	at least he had a sense of order , and even foolish order is always better than none at all
1	and the young fellow disappeared
1	it is written , of course , that they who are neither cold nor hot but lukewarm are to be cursed and spewed out of the mouth
1	no , he does not like to recall that there was a time when his society was the object
1	then he moved below the shoulder blade and thumped down the side of the middle and lower ribs ; joachim , well trained in all this , now lifted an arm and let him tap just below the armpit
1	and he made the same face he usually made when listening to music—a rather dull , sleepy , and devout face , his head tilted toward one shoulder , his mouth half-open
1	i truly felt sorry for the baron
1	he described the lymphatic vessels , the system of arteries and absorbent tubes ; spoke about how breast milk was formed from lymph collected from the legs , abdomen , chest , one arm , and one side of the head ; then went on to talk about how at various points in the lymph vessels there were delicate filters called lymph glands , located along the neck , in the armpits , at the crooks of the elbows , the backs of the knees , and similar intimate , sensitive spots on the body
1	and i enjoyed my time in london , too
1	when i think of my dressing gowns
1	and under the senator ’ s explicit instructions , ida jungmann , loving but strict as always , saw to it that the medication was dispensed punctually
1	but the english invented economic social theory , and humanity ’ s guardian angel will never forgive them that
1	peeperkorn offered him a glass of wine from the bottle on the nightstand
1	a devil of a fellow , our rhadamanthus
1	there are situations in life on earth , or circumstances of landscape ( if one can speak of landscape in this case ) , in which a confusion and obliteration of temporal and spatial distances , ending in total dizzying monotony , is more or less natural and legitimate , so that immersion into its magic during a vacation , for instance , might likewise be considered legitimate
1	as it darted about , you could watch its shadow tracing zigzag lines on the striped canvas
1	and now came little glasses of sabayon to refresh their palates—served with english plum cake
1	oh , there ’ s not much pleasure in it , thomas buddenbrook said with a heavy sigh , laying his head back against his chair in disgust
1	item , one has always had to grow sick and mad , that others need no longer do so
1	oh , how immensely grateful he felt that he was no longer caught up in uncertainty about himself
1	joachim had to come along for better or worse
1	and in doing so , he said , it celebrated its capacity for cosmic metaphor , since those elements were , so to speak , the world 's first and simplest building blocks , a parallel that a philosophizing artist of recent memory-and again , it was wagner of whom he spoke-had cleverly put to
1	godeau had heard and read about the performance of fragments of the apocalypse in prague and inquired about the work
1	and now here i lie in agony
1	elly felt guilty somehow , felt she had cheated
1	and , i assume , about business as well
1	but they have sneered and watched with pleasure every time we met with misfortune , and usually it was i who provided them their amusement
1	i thought , tom ’ s been wandering about rather glumly for quite a while now
1	of him and the technical principle by which imperious subjectivity took control of musical organization-that is , by development of a theme
1	indeed , until well into the late middle ages , the majority of people , even those in the cities , were vassals
1	but enough about canning jars
1	that ’ s gosch the broker
1	and he prayed in his heart that this innocuous and peaceful first class would never end
1	you ’ ll all have to come to dinner once a week
1	dr krokowski walked over to the wall to turn on the chandelier
1	the only problem was that , in his naïve candor and extraordinary high spirits , he did not pay sufficient attention to what he was saying , and every now and then would tell a story that was somewhat out of place
1	last but not least , it was apparently this awareness that tempted him to continue to badger me that evening with his investigations or , as he pretended , his experiences in regions monstrously above and beyond us humans , and to go right ahead now and fling himself entire-and me with him- into the ocean of the worlds
1	there was also the leaf butterfly , whose wings flaunt a triad of vivid color above , but whose underside counterfeits a leaf with bizarre precision , not just in shape and veining , but also by duplicating little impuritiesmimicked water drops , warty fungal growths , and such
1	there ’ s something so shameless about that sort of unrestrained talk , tony
1	hans castorp was neither a genius nor an idiot , and if we refrain from applying the word mediocre to him , we do so for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with his intelligence and little or nothing to do with his prosaic personality , but rather out of deference to his fate , to which we are inclined to attribute a more general significance
1	but such was not the case , particularly since his checked trousers had been freshly pressed , so that at first glance you might have thought them new—doubtless the work of his landlord , the young men thought in passing
1	his captain ’ s hand trembling slightly , he filled the glasses , with the assistance , offered in respectful bewilderment , of hans castorp
1	thomas buddenbrook greeted her politely and stepped aside
1	our daughter is of a marriageable age and has the opportunity of making a match that anyone can see is both advantageous and honorable—and she should do it !
1	for me , thanks to my friendship with adrian , the artist 's life functions as the paradigm for how fate shapes all our lives , as the classic example of how we are deeply moved by what we call becoming , development , destiny-and it probably is so in reality , too
1	he may have decided to do so as much for the sake of those who lived in the houseand i have one person in particular in mind-as out of pity for the tormented child
1	but what if the artistic paradox , which says that expression , the expression of lament , is born out of the construct as a whole , corresponds to the religious paradox , which says that out of the profoundest irredeemable despair , if only as the softest of questions , hope may germinate ?
1	he learned pathological anatomy from a volume he was now holding to one side to catch the reddish glow of his table lamp ; the text , with a series of illustrations , discussed parasitic cell fusion and infectious tumors
1	mercury had climbed very robustly , reaching degrees , almost
1	and adrian went on , look at it all from a human point of view
1	the smell of fritters frying and of all the people and …
1	presumably she had not had enough sleep
1	his presence enhances the dignity of the celebration
1	i don ’ t have one
1	together with her daughter , erika , and her granddaughter , elisabeth , she had claimed the most conspicuous position , close to the pastor , right next to the wreaths at the head of the casket ; thomas , gerda , christian , klothilde , and little johann , as well as old consul kröger , who sat on a chair , had to content themselves with less prominent places , as if they were more distant relatives
1	the task before them was to recover the considerable losses that the old man ’ s death had meant for the firm—the very word was cloaked in a certain divinity
1	those were the words of la rouchefoucauld—beautiful words , were they not ?
1	and no sooner did she fall silent than the columned hall was filled with harmonious voices singing silent night , holy night , and the family in the landscape room joined in
1	you ’ re not seeing the comic side of this—and your bad digestion is to blame for that , of course
1	it was over now , and that was good—for hans castorp had watched its coming with some uneasiness
1	the art room was large and well lighted
1	—you will always find me ready to provide you with an answer , my good engineer , he said with a bow and a deferential downward sweep of his hand , particularly when your objections show some wit
1	why was he here now ?
1	he looked up , raising one pale eyebrow , and reached a hand out to his sister
1	denser , von teutleben declared
1	his favorite turn of phrase was inexhaustibly vacuous ! , and no one ever found out if he himself was aware of the joke
1	and france , the land of cathedrals , whose king was called his most christian majesty , and which produced theologians like bossuet , like pascal ?
1	as for the valley , this winter valley under a deep blanket of snow , to which hans castorp likewise directed his metaphysical questions from his splendid lounge chair , its peaks , summits , ridges , and brown-green-reddish forests stood there silent in time , were draped in the web of silently flowing earthly days , now sparkling against the deep blue of the sky , now wrapped in mists , now aglow with the red of the setting sun , now glittering hard as diamonds in a world turned magical by moonlight—but always in the snow , while six unbelievably long months had scampered by
1	you speak of morality—but what do you mean by morality in art ?
1	he stood leaning against the wall , contributing a comment to the conversation now and then , but for the most part gazing silently and vacantly out over the banister
1	grobleben is a worker in one of the consul ’ s warehouses , and he is allowed to earn a little extra on the side by polishing his employer ’ s boots
1	calculations from behind a desk don ’ t lead to success
1	as he eased himself into it , thomas buddenbrook briefly explained his problem , laid his head back , and closed his eyes
1	i don ’ t know who ought to like that more—settembrini with his bourgeois world republic , or naphta with his hierarchical cosmopolitanism
1	and then the senator escorted both guests out through the dining room
1	it was six o ’ clock when the consul came upstairs
1	they played a movement of haydn , a few pages of mozart , a beethoven sonata
1	broken s r e
1	marusya , after all , with her little orange-scented handkerchief , sat down at the same table with them five times a day
1	i ’ m certain bed rest will soon take care of it
1	might i be permitted a question : how old are you really ?
1	i want the signal
1	by suppertime on the twenty-fourth , the tree had been gaily decorated with tinsel , glass balls , gilt cones , little apples in nets , and all sorts of candies ; its colorful wax candles burned during the whole meal and for a while afterward
1	and how could i ?
1	but i don ’ t think i ’ ll wait for them
1	they were furnished with beds and chests in the style of the painted hutch in the formal hall , but only a few of them had bedclothes , puffy featherbeds towered high in rustic fashion
1	the young man needed only to look at toxicology
1	johann buddenbrook worked his way about the room , greeting first his old friend c f köppen , and then the latter ’ s competitor , consul kistenmaker
1	yes , it was different in the old days
1	and how very near midsummer night already was , especially with pentecost just around the corner ; and once the longest day had come and gone , the year raced downhill from there , toward winter—so that in a way the great-aunt and marusya were as good as back again
1	i was willing to take that risk because it has long been my wish that clarity should be established between us—between me and the man for whom i entertain such extraordinary respect
1	grandfather said he could make oxen give milk , those were his very words
1	if he was sitting with the rest of the family , he was mute and seemed distracted , and if he happened to set little clara on his knee , perhaps to sing her some old funny songs—let ’ s ride through town on the omnibus or looka that horsefly on the wall , for instance—he might suddenly fall silent , set his granddaughter back on the floor , and turn away , as if caught up in some long , half-unconscious train of thought , which ended then in curious !
1	lemon buns with breast of goose—that really must taste good , she thought
1	after dinner i had her introduce me to herr arnoldsen senior , who responded with special politeness
1	he wished he had already reached his goal , because once you were up there , he thought , you lived just as people did everywhere , instead of having the climb constantly remind you of how unsuitable these precincts were
1	towering behind him were huge columns , piled cylindrical blocks with no bases and with moss growing in the joints—the columns of a temple gate , and he was sitting on the open stairway that led to it
1	frau permaneder cried and , jerking her head back , she stared fiercely into her mother ’ s face with tear-stained eyes , before suddenly dropping her head back into the folds of elisabeth ’ s skirt
1	our paths were parting in any case
1	to judge from what one hears , still further masquerades await us
1	i shall preface his answer simply by saying that its antiquated prose is , of course , intended as a parody , an allusion to his own quaint experiences in halle and to the linguistic deportment of ehrenfried kumpf-at the same time , however , it also expresses his personality ; it is a selfstylization , a manifestation of his inner disposition and of a highly characteristic tendency to hide behind and find fulfillment in parody
1	i want hot tea !
1	but then , suddenly one of the two sentries heard a short , discreet hissing sound from inside the building , and at almost the same moment he saw the flash of a red coat—bailiff uhlefeldt , with his three-cornered hat and ceremonial sword , emerged , bustling with high officiousness , uttered a soft attention ! , and hastily withdrew again , as approaching footsteps echoed across the tile floor inside
1	you ’ ve put it perfectly , dotted the i and crossed the t , herr settembrini
1	the spring in his step , the enterprising swing in his stride as he walked along in his frock coat , fists balanced in front of him , eyes roving , the enormous vigor with which he asked questions and told anecdotes from the heights of unschooled ignorance—it was all gone now
1	frau stöhr was in a state of terrible upset for several days because of a sum of money—ten francs—that she had been foolish enough to lend frau iltis to contribute , but which that lady had forgotten to repay
1	so that such persuasion on his part , which he had used with her , too , and might probably use with me as well , had been cheapened forever
1	the moment he entered the room , he had spotted the theater that his eyes were seeking so feverishly—there on the table , a splendid theater , looking much larger and grander than he had even dared imagine
1	( there could be no question of alarm
1	in my own mind , at least , i never addressed clavdia except by that name and with informal pronouns—or indeed in reality , either
1	you ’ ll discover that the crab form has been used by the greatest composers down through the centuries
1	not only in your dealings with me , but in general
1	that is the sad part
1	we offer better still , we offer foremostly the right and true-a thing no longer even classic , dear boy , which we let be experienced , a thing archaic , primal , a thing that has long since ceased to be attempted
1	that ’ s what we all call her at least , because those are the only words you ever hear out of her
1	his chin and upper lip were clean-shaven , but , following the english fashion , he had long side-whiskers—of a striking tawny , golden color
1	how nice , elisabeth said , smoothing things over ; and that took care of that subject
1	good lord , what ’ s wrong with him , ida ?
1	he did so with overwhelming success
1	the result was that his scholarship was transferred from the second tier , with its more modest board and room , to the first tier , where meals were served by waiters , and the neighbors on each side of his cubicle were a silesian count von harbuval and chamaré and a marquis di rangoni-santacroce from modena
1	we want freedom of the press , of employment , of commerce
1	but as things now stood , one could speak of expansion , but not of any sort of achieved expanded state , whether finite or infinite
1	don ’ t say anything about it !
1	there was senator thomas buddenbrook , whose alert , spirited , even humorous expression was contradicted by the pallor of his face ; his wife , gerda , leaning back in her armchair , immobile , her lovely white face turned upward , her close-set , blue-shadowed eyes glistening strangely under the spell of the flickering light of the chandelier ’ s crystal prisms ; his sister , frau permaneder ; his cousin jürgen kröger , the quiet , neatly dressed civil servant ; his cousins friederike , henriette , and pfiffi , the first two looking skinnier and taller than ever , the latter shorter and plumper , but all three with faces set in one standard expression—a caustic , malevolent smile disparagingly directed at all persons and things , as if they had but one constant , skeptical question : really ?
1	godeau chatted with adrian , responding to his inquiries about her career in paris , about recent works of french ballet and opera , with only some of which he was familiar-the creations of poulenc , auric , rieti
1	and with his advent a new spirit entered the old school
1	she opened a few of the cables : from relatives in hamburg and frankfurt , from herr arnoldsen and his family in amsterdam , from jürgen kröger in wismar
1	i ’ ll watch for now , he exclaimed , brushing the fine drops of rain from his tailcoat
1	i believed in his pride , of which i for my part was also proud , and had no real doubt that pride had been the source of his decision
1	the gambling was obviously of secondary importance to him
1	although he would have said , certainly , mademoiselle , rather unpleasant , and perhaps have pulled his handkerchief from his breast pocket with a little flourish and blown his nose
1	what a contrast between the slack anguish on his face and the elegant , almost martial care he gave to how it looked—to his perfumed mustache , drawn out to long , stiff points , to his fastidiously clean-shaven cheeks and chin , to the meticulous cut of his hair and the way he made sure that the first hint of baldness on the crown was well hidden , to the two long waves that fell back from his delicate temples , to the carefully combed narrow part , to the very cropped trim above the ears that he had adopted of late in place of his old full curls , so that people could not see that his hair was graying there
1	something else contributed to the confusion of clarissa 's life
1	the rain did not let up
1	he wears black to indicate that his particular specialty is the night
1	you ’ re not yet familiar with it , but it reproduces every note of a theme from back to front
1	is that not a bewitching name ?
1	it would be less than precise to say that he was ashamed for frau chauchat ; rather , he felt personally ashamed in front of all these people
1	you are , if i may put it that way , one of life ’ s problem children , a fellow whom others must look after
1	their settlements were two in number : one named ephrata , in lancaster county ; the other , in franklin county , called snowhill ; and all of them had respectfully looked up to their leader , shepherd , spiritual father-to a man named beissel , the founder of the sect , in whose character intense devotion to god was united with the qualities of a pastor of souls and master of men , and fanatic religiosity with gruff energy
1	that ’ s correct , perlemann , herr ballerstedt interrupted him , touched by so much timid subservience , and jotted a good grade in his book
1	i wonder if she ’ ll say the same thing to me when i get to know her ?
1	i have already expressed my regret that my hurried eagerness must here and there leave the impression of thoughts in headlong flight
1	both times , he shook his head and after a moment of silence said softly but firmly , no one is allowed in
1	to the community was debatable , if for no other reason than the community 's failure to appear , which , however , could in part be traced , as noted , to the all too specific nature of the topics treated
1	you think too highly of my flexibility , he rejoined-and had baptist spengler 's bleating laughter to second him
1	dr ting-fu suggested with a giggle that mr holger was apparently rather vain
1	a pale blond , sparse mustache that hung like fringe over his mouth , a perfectly round head , a stump of a nose , and thinning , badly cut hair combined to make him look somewhat like a walrus
1	as things stood , she probably did have to , i realize that , we all had to realize it
1	and seeing her son so downcast , she appeared close to tears herself and was grateful to her nephew for his attempts to revive his despondent cousin ’ s spirits
1	path around a sphere-which , of course , leads around or back around it-can be termed regressive
1	he was trying with his shoulder to push settembrini off balance , as he stood there smiling that refined , dry , ironic smile , just below where his full moustache swept handsomely upward—and it was the smile that offended hans castorp
1	there are so many things to consider
1	his tongue was contentedly wandering among his teeth , causing his dignified mouth to assume the most extraordinary positions
1	i would that schildknapp might return that i could laugh with him
1	pastor pringsheim began to speak , and his elegant voice filled the whole house with sonorous , well-modulated tones
1	old senator möllendorpf presided—a pallid , diabetic gentleman with sparse white whiskers that ended in two points
1	her daughter ’ s future had been a worry for years now , because , compared with other marriageable young ladies , erika was definitely at a disadvantage
1	even hans castorp kept a glass plate framed in cardboard , which , when held up to the light , showed him standing in a garish green woodland meadow , between frau stöhr and fräulein levi of the ivory complexion , the former in a sky-blue sweater , the latter in a blood-red one , his own face coppery against a field of pale yellow buttercups , one of which glowed in his buttonhole
1	time had swept onward , bringing forth more than one change
1	and yet he was one of them , because he managed his small , respectable brokerage business in the best , modest middle-class fashion
1	what a dilemma for our human emotions—and so sad that i can ’ t even begin to express it
1	joachim , being an old hand at this , had moved back toward the exit door to take up a position at an adjustable frame
1	the valley would long since have filled with shadows , and while hans castorp ate , it would grow discernibly darker in the white room
1	the others were busy with ellen brand , whose pose had not changed—she was still sitting in her chair , staring vacantly ahead , a strangely affected expression on her face
1	the word twiddle-twaddle sounded ghastly and bizarre when she spoke it , with her lower lip shoveling away
1	and fräulein kleefeld had just whistled hello to me with her pneumothorax , and i was a little taken aback
1	nothing awful had happened yet , thank god , and nothing awful needed to happen , it was even unlikely it would
1	you are offered the chance to do a good deed and at the same time to make the best business deal of your life , and …
1	no doubt just as the animal kingdom consisted of various species of animals , just as the organism of the human animal consisted of a whole animal kingdom of cell species , so , too , the cell consisted of a new and diverse animal kingdom of elemental , submicroscopic living entities that grew independently , multiplied independently according to the law that each can only produce its own kind , and cooperated by division of labor to serve the next higher level of life
1	but two days later , when he had the pension gisella 's housemaid announce him to the aunt , he was not turned away
1	now the word genius ,
1	and both times , little johann stuck out his arm , so that his blue sailor sleeve with the embroidered anchors was a horizontal bar across the door
1	aviators , pilots , he said , were mostly very nasty , untrustworthy sorts , and were above all very superstitious
1	dr mantelsack , however , went on with the lesson
1	thomas buddenbrook spoke of the central location and the unusually large lot ; but , contorting his lips and hissing in a savage , choked voice , herr gosch now gave him a little lecture , punctuated by horrible gesticulations , about the crushing risk he would be taking—an explanation so trenchant and vivid that it was almost a poem
1	i can never have a little fun without paying for it
1	the englishwoman with the rose-hip tea was named miss robinson
1	entre nous-what does it matter to me ?
1	little johann sat between his parents and managed to force down a piece of white meat and some dressing
1	wishing to give the good man no offense , we gave our promise-which fell to sch
1	immediately after hearing this news , hans castorp took his temperature—it was
1	but , to his father ’ s annoyance , hanno reacted to these healthy exercises with aversion—silent , aloof , almost arrogant aversion
1	the majority were not happy
1	they sat together in the large playroom on the third floor and did their homework
1	and he looked her unexpected companion directly in the eye , not without a defiant toss of his head to mock the masklike face and the grandeur of the figure , not without challenging his own heart to make fun of this exalted personage , whose current rights of possession were cast in a very odd light by certain past events : certain past events , indeed—not dark , uncertain events from the realms of amateur portraits , which had had the power to disquiet him at one time
1	was it necessary to make a trip all the way from munich , with little erika—which to people less sensible than we might almost appear to mean that you never intend to return to your husband again ?
1	until the third week , until the decisive crisis , the question of either-or hovers in the air , and he can not possibly tell whether in this case the disease he calls typhus is an inconsequential mishap , the result of an infection that might perhaps have been avoided and that can be combated with the resources of science—or if it is quite simply a mode of dissolution , the garment in which death has clad itself , though it could just as easily have chosen some other disguise , and for which there is no known remedy
1	he then asked the pianist , a weary-eyed young fellow who had surely dreamt of higher things than his present employment , whether he knew the accompaniment to dvorak 's humoresque , and even on this mediocre fiddle he played that delightful piece with all its numerous grace notes , charming slides , and smart double stops so jauntily and brilliantly that he won loud applause from everyone in the inn-from us , from the nearby tables and dumbfounded musicians , even from the two waiters
1	adrian saw all this , wandered amid it , sampled it during the nine months of his first stay in upper bavaria-an autumn , a winter , a spring
1	she ’ s gone to the apothecary , frau permaneder said
1	he climbed into the fly beside his father and then sat mutely at his side in various parlors , watching with quiet eyes the easy , tactful , and yet so varied and carefully measured way his father dealt with these people
1	but oblivion would not come
1	they prayed only for the mercy of a gentle passing
1	goblet in hand , bareheaded , the collar of his wrinkled , almost floor-length overcoat turned up , his idol-like creased brow encircled by flames of white hair—there he stood beside a boulder , and his face grew more animated as he held the ring of thumb and forefinger up to it , finger lances jutting into the air , and lectured , punctuating his vague , inaudible toast with the spellbinding token of precision
1	as always with love ,
1	the dermatologist 's two waiting rooms , with one reserved for female patients , were decorated with potted plants-palms and african hemp
1	that is , of course , no word for it , mynheer peeperkorn , said hans castorp , who had some difficulty downing the whole glass in one draft , and now took out his handkerchief to wipe the wine he had spilled on his knee
1	what lies below is still as nothing in comparison with the quantity above-we give time , abundant , immeasurable time , the end of which one need not contemplate , not for a long while , nor even yet have cause to be fretted with that point in time when one might begin to think on the end , when arespice finem ' might pertain , inasmuch as it is an unsteady point in time , subject to vagaries and temper , and no man knows where it ought be set and at how far a distance from the end
1	that touch had come as a profound shock , an experience of depths of which he had never thought the world capable , and , if i see it all correctly , an experience that contributed not a little to making him a recluse in the world
1	my conscience-and i use the word here in a more-thanpersonal sense-was not quite pure
1	she feels the tears welling up inside her
1	he heard another cold , deep voice reply : i ’ ve been watching him for some time now
1	that was a bit of royal foolishness
1	and for one man 's raptures to be ancillary borrowings modeled on the raptures of another
1	as strange as it may sound in light of our long years of comradeship , the subject of love , of sexuality , of the flesh had never been touched upon in our conversations in any personal or intimate fashion ; the matter had entered into our exchanges always and only through the medium of art and literature , occasioned by manifestations of passion in the intellectual sphere that prompted remarks from him that were matter-of-factly knowledgeable but in which his own person played no role
1	every lady in town said , either to elisabeth buddenbrook or to her daughter : what a treasure your mamselle jungmann is , my dear
1	yes , indeed—but i can ’ t stay here
1	since that day , fräulein antonie , my sole , my ardent wish had been to gain your beautiful hand until death do us part
1	but tell me now , my good engineer , he said , how has your family taken the news ?
1	i ’ m much obliged to you for your reminder and warning
1	and besides , it would be quite counter to reason—no , you must admit
1	they stared at the ostentatious funerary display , at first in amazement and then with increasing boredom ; they fidgeted with their caps in their hands , until one of them found the courage to depart , and then the whole troop shuffled out behind him
1	a conservatory , neither the great one nor the hasean , where he instructs ; 'twould be , he says , no climate for me , but rather i should do as did papa haydn , who had no preceptor anywhere , but rather procured for himself the gradus ad parnassum by fux and other sundry music of the day , most particularly that of bach of hamburg , and doughtily perfected his craft therefrom
1	and indeed it came to pass that he himself heard her lips form the mournful phrase that had become her nickname
1	and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee
1	go fetch your rescuer some ice cream and ask her for the next waltz
1	her own face was flushed
1	no , no , she repeated , so touched that she bent down to him , i don ’ t despise you , herr grünlich
1	but he did not let anyone notice , and no gesture carried any intimation that all this had , or would ever have , anything to do
1	by the way , none of them owned pistols
1	the corners of thomas ’ s mouth were drawn down , lending him an almost contemptuous look
1	we repeat , he recalled all this and realized not only that it would have been difficult not to betray oneself under such circumstances , but also that the attempt would hardly have been worthwhile
1	he lay there for a long time feeling queasy , excited , weary , anxious , and happy , and could not fall asleep
1	it ’ s just strange to hear it , hans castorp said
1	i ’ ll tell you something—just before i came here to see you , i was seriously considering going to cremer and throwing myself on him , begging him to intervene , to get involved in this
1	they ’ re all simply too short
1	he was said to be very religious , which , as might be expected , was not uncommon among the people up here , or so hans castorp had been told
1	frau salomon from amsterdam might sit on the balustrade—hard-pressed on one side by the knees of thick-lipped gänser and on the other by the swedish bruiser , who , although completely well now , had extended his stay for a little extra therapy
1	is that any comfort ?
1	i had to toss it away , there was no point in forcing it
1	the chin was too small
1	that was joachim ’ s advice ; and official channels worked
1	a new rumor emerging from somewhere has run in a zigzag all the way to her
1	it would have been monstrous to express alarm at the boy ’ s childish awkwardness
1	serenus , she said , it is inevitable , i know it
1	might i inquire if you intend to bring these scurrilities to a close soon ?
1	wendell kretzschmar subscribed to the principle-one we repeatedly heard from lips first shaped around the english language-that it was not a matter of other people 's interest , but of his own , and thus of exciting their interest , which could only happen , indeed was guaranteed to happen , if one had a fundamental interest in the subject oneself and so , when speaking of it , could not help involving others in that interest , infecting them with it , thereby creating an interest never extant , never even suspected before-all of which was worth a great deal more than catering to one that already existed
1	we shall see them again , friederike buddenbrook said , folding her hands firmly in her lap ; she lowered her eyes and thrust her nose in the air
1	they began to tease him , laying heads to one side , winking , and putting fingers up to their ears , as if these were racy , risqué revelations about someone who had played the innocent until now
1	his wife nodded with some hesitation ; her embroidery still lay in her lap
1	but as for his dignified nurse , madame decho , who had cared for him until now , the decision had been made that it would not be she who would move into the new house , but that ida jungmann would replace her and that elisabeth would have to look for other help
1	everyone , however , received the affidavits , even people quite removed from the matter
1	i do not assume so ; rather , i believe that if there was some defect , it was psychological , disposing her to show forbearance and consideration wherever it was required
1	i ’ m in my early thirties now , but i ’ m not yet so old that my dearest friends should be the last himmelsbürger or the ladies gerhardt or one of mother ’ s men in black who devour widows ’ houses
1	but now as the young man grew more confused , the older man gradually began to rear up out of his chair , taller and taller , to full size—his majestic head swelling and turning red , the arabesques on his brow rising and spreading , his little eyes growing ever larger in pale threat
1	majoresku , and several others , for whom not the last reason for attending was , to be sure , to see the future bridegroom , rudi schwerdtfeger , at his music stand up front on the left
1	my respects , for that
1	my good engineer , he said in a choked voice , my good engineer
1	what , not a one ?
1	even then , however , he towered over herr lodovico and was several heads taller than little naphta ; but that was not the only reason why his presence weighed so heavily—so overwhelmingly heavily , just as hans castorp had pictured it in his imagination—on the existence of the two political theorists
1	but now my brain is so numb that i could be struck by lightning and not bat an eyelash
1	would not that be lovely , they suggested , if only old age were permitted to judge youth , leaving it forever the object of outside observation , as if it had no share in objective thought
1	but the song ’ s best son may yet have been the young man who consumed his life in triumphing over himself and died , a new word on his lips , the word of love , which he did not yet know how to speak
1	during the break between classes , he monitored the corridor and was also responsible for order in the classrooms
1	( though god only knew how he had managed to be witty—with apparently not a drop of blood left in his head )
1	people said that behrens , who idolized her , had been so overwhelmed by the blow that he had temporarily fallen into a strange melancholy and had been seen walking the streets giggling , gesticulating , and talking to himself
1	so let us go and lie down , my good engineer
1	i don ’ t want to be famous
1	it was at this same time , by the way , that his inherited migraine began to give him bad days
1	various boys were called upon to show what they knew about job , the man from the land of uz ; and gottlieb kassbaum , the son of the unfortunate wholesaler herr kassbaum , was given an excellent grade despite his family ’ s shattered circumstances , because he was able to state definitely that job ’ s substance consisted of seven thousand sheep , three thousand camels , five hundred yoke of oxen , five hundred asses , and a very great household
1	then you can ’ t imagine what an annoyance , what a disappointment that is for someone like myself , who has smoked with such gusto from youth on
1	it would mean the constellation has renewed what was worn-out
1	why , you don ’ t suppose she provoked him a little , just to test him ?
1	frau permaneder had run out of objections to gerda ’ s decision
1	i can stand here all night if need be , he thought
1	oh , it was pointless to get up now and work—there was too much to do , there was something to learn for almost every class , it wasn ’ t worth trying to start now , and the time he had set for getting up had passed anyway
1	that does not prevent his nails and hair from growing , or that all in all—but we shall not repeat the slang idiom that joachim once used in this same context and that at the time offended hans castorp ’ s flatland sensitivities
1	a voice in the tiny audience cried , for the speaker could not manage the final word , which he had used so frequently till now , and was still stuck mumbling its initial consonant
1	instead , the remarkable and profoundly significant thing was that although humankind was a sexual creature in two different forms , and although it was more appropriate to localize the demonic in the loins of the male than the female , nonetheless the whole curse of the flesh and the enslavement to sexuality had been laid upon the female , until it had come to proverbs like : as a jewel of gold in a swine 's snout , so is a fair
1	what was all this he had himself believing ?
1	what a damn sly person little tony was !
1	rumor had it that she had entered a tuberculosis sanatorium as a very young girl and had never lived in the outside world since
1	and at this moment there doesn ’ t seem to be anyone on her side
1	it ’ s still in the family papers
1	and although this harmless vice added a jaunty touch to his appearance , the ultimate effect was much more that of the license of old age , the kind of carelessness that age either consciously and merrily permits itself or brings with it , cloaked in dignified oblivion ; in any case , it was the only such carelessness in his grandfather ’ s appearance that little hans castorp ’ s sharp eye ever observed
1	if only he could take hanno ’ s education in hand himself , he could then mold his mind , every hour of every day
1	it came , swept over him , and he no longer fought it
1	yes , morten said , let ’ s take a seat
1	perhaps it had escaped from a magic forest or from one of the grimm ’ s fairy tales that ida read to him at home
1	but of course , to be sure , james tienappel concurred , somewhat intimidated by his foster brother , who spoke so calmly and in a monotone ; the crisp autumn evening was close to freezing , yet there beside him sat hans castorp without hat or overcoat
1	only mamselle jungmann was already up , making coffee for breakfast
1	it ’ s not clear when or if he will be allowed to leave here
1	it goes without saying that adrian shared in the raptures of my humanist 's heart with only a nod and a smile that was not without irony
1	on tuesday or wednesday , however , he would depart , and leave joachim behind alone , poor joachim , for whom rhadamanthus had decreed who-knew-how-many more months and whose gentle black eyes dimmed with melancholy every time hans castorp made a passing reference to his approaching departure
1	no , that ’ s not what i wanted to ask
1	to offer no reply
1	true , with time she had ceased making the pale man dance or visiting the doll lady ; but she had a way of tossing her head that was getting saucier and saucier , and she exhibited , especially after spending a summer in the country with her grandparents , a serious proclivity to be vain and haughty
1	the prince ’ s scandalous behavior was still the talk of the valley , but rhadamanthus had simply winked an eye , both eyes—every inch a hofrat
1	to be sure , his eldest daughter ’ s dowry had been forfeited , and the losses the firm had suffered in that bankruptcy in bremen in had been a heavy blow
1	and then they ’ ll be accepted at last
1	only one person talked like that , one bothersome person
1	it was incredible that , although poor klothilde partook daily of large quantities of strong nourishment , it was all to no avail
1	and so , he declared , pieter peeperkorn will now regale himself with a schnapps
1	he said nothing more , just grabbed a roll and , without sitting down , his hat still on his head and his satchel under one arm , began to drink his cocoa
1	possibly not , the consul said , mulling it over and without addressing anyone in particular
1	o salute , o satana , o ribellione , o forza vindice della ragione ’
1	there is no stopping it : surrender on all sides , everyone scattering
1	now good rudi was no hero of self-mastery and had never done anything in his life that had not come easily to him-as for example , and above all , his excellent violin playing
1	and joachim would have been amazed at his easygoing manner—presumably , however , without seriously wanting to have changed places with him
1	ways found rather oppressive-between the arena of adrian 's childhood and the framework of his later life
1	i ’ m getting blepharospasmosis from all the winking i do
1	they realized that it was lodovico settembrini at the side of a stranger , but it appeared that he did not recognize them or at least did not want to encounter them , because he quickly turned his head away and dived back into the conversation with his companion , gesticulating and at the same time trying to move quickly on ahead of them
1	but what about you ?
1	partenkirchen , about an hour from munich , and the next station , pfeiffering or pfeffering , is only ten minutes farther , although express trains do not stop there
1	his head felt hot , and a strange pressure , a disquieting tension had built up inside it , as if something were about to burst
1	the sta�e of war , for which the highest authority was transferred from civilians to the military , to a general who issued proclamations , was greeted with a cozy shudder
1	october—that ’ s when it will be
1	this will allow him to make up for many a setback and show people that good luck hasn ’ t quite deserted the firm of johann buddenbrook yet
1	it was an ordinary hour , neither long nor short
1	take my volubility as an expression of the fact that i have abandoned the plan that brought me here !
1	the process has not been totally explained , since so far we have been unable to locate dilating muscles along the blood vessels that are activated by the vasomotor nerves
1	actually you have heard it already
1	by which you probably mean a love that has been deprived of its animal warmth , is that it ?
1	although they tell me that you are musical and play the piano , is that right ?
1	appearances were deceiving , but he looked exactly like someone democrats would not be able to count on , and the resemblance to his grandfather was undeniable
1	your very humble servant , say i i ought to know you thus , and i find it courteous of you to read me a private lecture here in my hall
1	she had been a very charming woman , if a little cross-eyed and gaunt , to judge from photos you found scattered about the director ’ s official residence , not to mention oil portraits of her that were hung on the walls—painted by his own amateur hand
1	there was none of the confusion and provocation of spring down on the plains—no seething in the depths , no damp odors , no sultry vapors
1	the consul watched her in bewilderment
1	when accompanying a lady shopping , he might very well point to an object and say , well , i would not actually spend money on it
1	our army , under hausen , lay south of chalons-sur-marne and was poised for the march on paris , as was kluck 's army at another position
1	but joachim was obviously unaware of any possible insult in his explanation , and now inquired about the residents of the berghof and the latest news—not only without any arrogance , but indeed with the insistent animation of the traveler come home
1	his protest against the egotism prevalent here was only one of them
1	but rudolf made it difficult for you to perceive his value and to keep
1	that is adrian leverkiihn in his entirety
1	then allow me to avail myself of— he spilled a little wine as he poured himself another glass
1	wet grass sprouted up between the cracked cobblestones
1	his petition was refused !
1	what do you say to that ?
1	letting oneself go , in fact , was doubtless a definition of madness in many cases , inasmuch as it was a way of fleeing from great affliction and served weak natures as a defense against the overpowering blows of fate , which such people felt they could not withstand in their right mind
1	he had rejected the proposal with all the determination he could put into his voice
1	god will punish them one day , i firmly believe that !
1	he did not go to bed , however
1	the school clock was a little slow , but he would be late all the same , that was certain
1	myself whether the reader 's patience is holding out
1	now he ’ s grabbing my wrist , he thought
1	the two brothers glared eye to eye now across the table
1	whose details can be of interest to no one
1	but i must ask one thing of you , my friend
1	’ nd a good day to you , madame grünlich , the harbor pilot said , so delighted he went right on speaking plattdeutsch
1	because it ’ s not a matter of a brilliant match this time , but solely of patching over the past as best we can with a second marriage
1	these schwarzkopfs were marvelous people
1	i have always feared adrian 's penchant for laughter , which , unlike rudiger schildknapp , i was always poor at encouraging-and i feel that same fear , that same timid and anxious helplessness when listening to this sardonic gaudium of gehenna as it sweeps across fifty bars , beginning with the giggle of a single voice , only to spread rapidly and seize choir and orchestra , then , amid rhythmic upheavals and counterblows and jettisons , to swell to a horrible fortissimo tutti , to a dreadful mayhem of yowls , yelps , screeches , bleats , bellows , howls , and whinnies , to the mocking , triumphant laughter of hell
1	needless to say , you shall destroy this at once
1	the metal casket was hermetically sealed and covered with flowers , the candles were lit , and the house filled up with people
1	less than fifteen minutes now …
1	oh , you have no idea what bad shape i ’ m in
1	and as you heard i ’ m all in favor of that , of celebrating things as they come , just as the calendar dictates
1	those were extremely tenacious , important seconds—they stretched out into a little eternity , leaving extraordinarily dense deposits in the scurrying shadow of grand time
1	everywhere the hour-glass has been turned and time has been given , incomprehensible , but bounded time and an appointed end , there are we upon the field , there grows our sweet clover
1	that night , while the frau senator sat in profound grief beside the rigid remains of her child , we three-adrian , frau schweigestill , and
1	he said things—you know the things i mean—about modern communism and the godly zeal of the proletariat that can not refrain from shedding blood
1	she was ready to pay anything for this delicacy
1	how utterly ridiculous it all is
1	at last peeperkorn said softly : you were clavdia ’ s lover during her previous stay here
1	the ladies had not been following the discussion for some time
1	i was talking with fräulein wasserklosett ; actually her name was miss waterhouse , a very pretty girl
1	and where did the soul go until then ?
1	what a puny , disgustin ’ cuss !
1	we have told it to its end ; it was neither short on diversion nor long on boredom—it was a hermetic story
1	and thank god , he had shown sufficient feverish presence of mind to reply , pas de quai , madame !
1	grandson settembrini mentioned one detail that made a special impression on young hans castorp : grandfather giuseppe had worn only black when appearing among his fellow citizens , because , as he said , he was in mourning for italy , his fatherland , which languished in misery and bondage
1	i must ask you something , ask you something very urgent , but in german
1	they have been sent to me from lugano , where the league has a branch office
1	hans castorp went on
1	as if they called to me—
1	and although one may tend and nurse illness in the individual case , to honor it intellectually is an aberration—imprint that on your minds ! —an aberration and the beginning of all intellectual aberrations
1	hans castorp himself had the impression that checkups , quite apart from the results , were a source of entertainment for the ladies , for which they attired themselves in their flirtatious best
1	you have no idea how that torments me , do you , father ?
1	old scratch himself atop them all , settembrini explained softly , gesturing toward the director—and then was dragged away from hans castorp ’ s side
1	the pride and joy on her face and in her movements became a kind of grave solemnity whenever she led visiting relatives through her new home—making erika weinschenk look like another admiring guest in her own house
1	where might i be , if i were not here ?
1	but , rather , her melancholy , which sought out misfortune , fixed on the man whom to her disgust she had heard say : there are lots of unhappy women already !
1	and hans castorp tossed his hat and cane on the hallstand—and carefully , cautiously , his tongue between his teeth , he squeezed his way past the glass door , only just ajar , and entered the dining hall , where the residents were sitting in rows of chairs
1	but why does she keep saying man alive , as if she were addressing me ?
1	this charge was leveled against the fusion of oldest and newest elements that is so characteristic of the work , but is in no way arbitrary , since it lies , rather , in the nature of things-by which i mean , that it is based on the curvature of the world , which allows the earliest things to come round again in what is most recent
1	so i hear , herr grünlich said with grim certainly
1	it fell to rudiger to set us laughing about it , although he did acknowledge my rather emotion-laden remarks ; by parodying that ponderous thinker and his draping of a cloak of moral tropes over a long-standing strategy , he transformed all those brutal sentiments , solemn regrets , and respectable atrocities into something irresistibly comic-and made something even more comical of them than of the virtuous roar of a stunned world , which had in fact
1	yes , i am quite taken by munich
1	naphta sat silent , his eyes sparkling , a caustic look on his face
1	yet the manner in which you are treating me at present cries out to heaven , and , should you entertain the idea that in light of your silence i shall be content to remain silent myself , you are sadly mistaken
1	do be just , even if you are angry , be just to her and to … why shouldn ’ t it be mine ?
1	yes , that ’ s what they say
1	in any case , circumstances were now such that his acceptance was no longer an issue
1	good heavens , jean , your father would have laughed about it
1	two or three times he felt his chest shaken by suppressed laughter at the gruesome term that frau stöhr had used in her ignorance
1	the child is not to have a governess
1	the picnickers leapt to their feet
1	a firm grows , a family prospers ; in short , conditions change and improve
1	but enough , that takes care of it , i suppose
1	a man with a red beard and a brown long-tailed coat came in
1	the great scholastics of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries were unanimous in their conviction that nothing could be true in philosophy that was theologically false
1	as for me , i call lublin my place of birth-yet another worthy town gray with age , from which one carries a wealth of severite into life , un hat d'ame solennel et un peu gauche
1	i must reproach myself for being tactless , because at such words i automatically glanced adrian 's way to read his expression-tactless , that is , because of the discomfort in his response , the annoyance he showed in blushing and turning aside
1	yes , i ’ ve always taken a great deal of interest in it
1	he has feathered legs and a beak of iron , an iron hook at the very tip , and talons of horrendous power , claws that turn inward , one long rear claw that forms an iron vise with those at the front
1	he had begun love 's labour 's lost , the piano sketch of its expository scenes was complete , but then work came to a standstill
1	johann buddenbrook wants to pipe on his flute , and i simply have to wait for that
1	not at all , inez , i replied
1	fräulein engelhart , however , could not satisfy him about these matters , either , and had to put him off with assurances that she would make further inquiries
1	let us say , as a psychologist , he replied
1	it is itself spirit
1	quartan fever , the director called it , because it struck the dutchman down approximately every fourth day—it started with chattering teeth , then came a hot flush , and finally the sweats
1	your standard soldier is the mercenary who can be hired for one cause or another
1	now she glances his way again , notices his wide eyes and the way he is poised to leap—and she turns away with a smile
1	she softly stroked the short-cropped hair at the back of his head with one hand
1	i really don ’ t believe it ’ s good for him to take everything to heart so
1	and on the other hand , his love was something utterly elusive and amorphous , a thought—no , a dream , the terrifying and infinitely seductive dream of a young man whose answer to certain , though subconsciously posed questions would have been only hollow silence
1	it was holger in person , the spirit named holger , the one who had known about the pinch of salt and all the rest , but who , of course , never got mixed up in any questions at school
1	had she known that he had made an appointment for an examination at two o ’ clock ?
1	dressed in greatcoats and with weapons on their shoulders , two sentries paced the designated distance , striding resolutely through the filthy slush under their feet
1	behrens called , with a strong emphasis on the first word
1	the needle struck home
1	do you want to retain the capitalist system , deutschlin , arzt asked , because it keeps alive the memory of the perils of human life ?
1	he simply won ’ t give in , the lad won ’ t
1	humankind must be informed that certain effects can be diminished only when one first recognizes their causes and negates them , and that almost all sufferings of the individual are illnesses of the social organism
1	so this had been the effect of her father ’ s discreet letter , which was meant to postpone any decision indefinitely
1	after all , we are here to talk business
1	i say thank god , because it really is a reason to praise god
1	the science of religion , then , has nothing to do with philosophical theses , but with a psychological fact , a given within man
1	hans castorp only surmised all this , however , more than he actually saw it—she was really too far away
1	shhh , ida said , yes , he ’ s asleep
1	south of be noted
1	you don ’ t feel the cold that much , because the air is so dry and the wind is still
1	yes , what was the source of my distrust of
1	there , i have rhymed it all together , dreamed a poem of humankind
1	at the start of the new season , then , clarissa met this young man , who promised to rescue her from her failed career and in its place offered , as her husband , a peacefully secure , indeed well-situated existence in a world that was , granted , foreign to her , but not unlike that of her bourgeois origins
1	one girl , her hair wound in a knot , but with a few , especially charming stray strands at the back of her neck , sat with her feet dangling in a little dell and played a shepherd ’ s pipe , her eyes gazing out over her capering fingers to her playmates dressed in long , loose robes , some of whom stood alone , smiling , arms spread wide , while others danced in couples , leaning against one another , temples sweetly touching ; and at the piper ’ s back—bent to one side in a long , graceful , white curve because of the way she held her arms—still more of her sisters sat or stood together , embracing , watching , and talking quietly
1	stop pampering and indulging your condition—stop talking about it
1	'' i am not at all in the mood for jokes , adri , if only because the role you ascribe to me in your life-and even for posterity-touches my heart and makes me feel solemn somehow
1	moreover , he tried out going through a door without troubling to latch it behind him , but merely letting it close by itself ; and that proved both convenient and easy—as an expression of feeling , it corresponded to the shrug with which joachim had greeted him that day at the train station and which since then he had often noticed people use here
1	he said , beg pardon , ma ’ am , for that callin ’ card there
1	he sent it to him in lubeck , where that stutterer was still in charge , and a year later , even though war had already broken out , the theater there did indeed produce the opera , in a german version in which i had some involvement-with the result that two-thirds of the audience left the theater in the middle of the performance , just as is said to have happened in munich six years before at the premiere of debussy 's pelleas et melisande
1	it announced itself most clearly in the songs of this series taken from the purgatorio and paradiso and chosen with a clever sense of their affinity with music-for instance , in the piece that especially fascinated me and that kretzschmar had also declared to be very good , where by the light of venus the poet beholds the lesser lights ( which are the souls of the blessed ) describing their circles , some more quickly , others more slowly , each according to its contemplation of god , and compares the various sparks distinguishable in the flame , the voices audible in the larger song , when the one entwines the other
1	because marusya , laughter-loving marusya , with the little ruby on her pretty finger , her orange-blossom perfume , and her prominent , worm-eaten chest , was usually present at the gathering as well ; and hans castorp understood that it was this circumstance that drove joachim away , precisely because it held such a strong , terrible attraction for him
1	what a talented shipmate !
1	he seldom stayed there much over an hour ; he would write two or three urgent letters and telegrams , give an order here , an instruction there , nudging , as it were , the great wheel of industry and leaving its further revolutions to the watchful eye and sidelong glances of herr marcus
1	and they all believed every word—she was so hopeless , dusty , and withered
1	from then on , if they chanced to meet in the village or on country lanes , they merely exchanged a friendly greeting or just stood for a few minutes conversing about their nation 's sad state or the growing lack of food in the cities , which was so little a problem hereand which indeed lent the frau senator 's seclusion a practical justification , the appearance of a deliberate precaution that allowed her to supply her daughters , even former friends of her house like the knoterichs , with goods from pfeiffering : eggs , butter , sausages , and flour
1	see them again—if only it were so
1	he was heading down the trough now , its walls rising on both sides—it seemed to be a fold , a narrow pass leading into the mountain itself
1	in it one had a piece that was intended for neither the human voice nor any known instrument , indeed for no sense-based realization whatever , but that was music per se , music as pure abstraction
1	he asked , turning toward her
1	horrors consists only of wind instruments and an insistent accompanying ensemble made up of two harps , cembalo , piano , celesta , glockenspiel , and percussion-a kind of continuo that constantly reappears throughout the work
1	the murmur of isolation reigned above this beautiful , remote spot
1	he paid adrian clever compliments on his brentano songs , which he had purchased and studied at his piano
1	he was still twenty paces from the long , red wall with its two wrought-iron gates that separated the front schoolyard from the street , when he heard the steady , shrill bell , the signal for the beginning of monday-morning prayers
1	these included : frau möllendorpf , née langhals , who was toying with a long-handled lorgnette , her gray hair flying in all directions ; frau hagenström , plus julie , who had never grown all that much , but already wore diamond earrings like her mother ; frau kistenmaker and her daughters ; and frau fritsche , a small wrinkle-faced lady , who wore a bonnet and was in charge of the spa ’ s entertainments
1	with what was free and more than free , rebellious , as well as with passages that scorned every restraint of musical key ; and so he had to fear that those sections of the score , with all their unfamiliarity and aggressive heresy , would be more inaccessible to an audience than would the orthodox and strict parts
1	you are speaking foolishness , my good engineer , herr settembrini responded
1	you are going to do all right , i finally said
1	satisfactory , the professor said when timm had finished
1	he talked about how new and fresh everything would be—life , himself , time , each day , each hour
1	you have every reason to say you speak as if in a dream , my friend
1	not everything done in madness should therefore be prevented at all cost , and the obligation to preserve life was discharged here in hardly anyone 's interest except that of the mother-who doubtless prefers to find an infantile son rather than a dead one
1	you remarked that i speak maliciously , but if i have done so , then it was not without a pedagogic purpose
1	their words of greeting were lost in the barking of the watchdog , who trampled his bowls in his excitement and almost tugged loose his house bedded with straw
1	because feeling , young man , is divine
1	eight days later , a small , smooth-shaven old man with snow-white hair combed forward at his brow and temples visited senator buddenbrook in his private office
1	actually , when viewed from an emotional perspective , it was more that joachim lived at hans castorp ’ s side , and no longer the other way around—for the latter was now the old-timer , whose existence his cousin simply shared for a brief time as a visitor
1	the harmonium was like an overpowering dream , but he had no time to explore it more closely just yet
1	and if i scold him , he ’ ll blow up , because he ’ s testy beyond belief—and has rented three rooms for his family
1	he fashions it new and adds : ameilleur '
1	his mother saw to it that he got exercise , putting her arm in his and taking him for walks across the silent landscape
1	well , that ’ s up to the highest standards , let me tell you , not a hint of slipshod manners and simply letting things take their course—just the contrary
1	after a while he tried again
1	instead he had labored in his room , on the credo , the credo with its fugue ; his disciples could hear him working behind the closed door
1	dr krokowski was on hand as well
1	may those i love all-ready be
1	the girl still had her key ring and candle in hand—she must have been taking care of some late chore in the house—and she twisted and turned to defend herself against the master of the house , who was holding her in a tight embrace and kept trying to press his walrus face to hers , occasionally succeeding in the attempt , with the result that his hat kept slipping farther down the back of his head
1	fine , i won ’ t die , then
1	one could not speak in finer , clearer , more rounded phrases than herr settembrini
1	her hair was parted and pulled back smooth—and it was the same reddish blonde as always
1	and now they ’ re doin ’ right good themselves and we sell ’ em our hops and have a nice little income from the int ’ rest besides— ’ tain ’ t bad at all , herr permaneder concluded ; and , declining either cigarette or cigar , he asked if he could smoke his pipe
1	the term that mother schweigestill had applied to him was jauntily justified , however , by the easy carelessness of his manners , by a refreshingly light touch , which was inherent both in his rapid , slightly blurred , rather high speaking voice , breaking at times into the treble , and in his whole demeanor , and which stood somewhat in contradiction to the stoutness of his figure and yet again , was in harmony with it
1	it turned out that his son ’ s illness had not involved any immediate danger , but that it was very wise to send him at once to a health spa in the mountains in the south of france ; and as luck would have it , herr van der kellen ’ s young son had also been planning a vacation , and as soon as thomas was up to it , the two young men left together for pau
1	she had black eyes and wore golden earrings ; a flirt who loved her finery , she was nevertheless a perfect job , a lazarus in a female body , whom god had visited with every sort of affliction
1	it found its most powerful , sensual realization in orchestral music , where , entering through the ear , it seemed to affect all the senses , to act as an opiate , allowing the pleasures of the realm of sound to melt with those of color and fragrance
1	jack frost had painted the window with flowers—the blind had been left rolled up to let the first daylight in
1	he called himself a recluse and did not intend it as any kind of praise
1	they would be staying here
1	and , grünlich , the consul said , those new laces are in the little handbag on top ?
1	that ’ s quite a generalization , clavdia
1	there ’ s not even any fat on it—nothing but lean meat
1	he practiced the piano for a while and then just lounged around the living room
1	it is a metaphysical gift , something essential , a structure and a vocation
1	he expostulated that it was obvious from'that start that he was lost to any career as a virtuoso soloist ; for no use killing nettles to grow docks , he wrote , and he had come into contact with the instrumentor even with the very notion ·of trying it out-much too late , in which one could clearly see a lack of any instinctual drive in that direction
1	there was music playing here , as well
1	mynheer suddenly asked , turning toward his guest a regal countenance with painfully ragged lips and pale little eyes under a brow full of arabesques
1	they now saw pictures from all over the world : the top-hatted president of the french republic reviewing a long cordon , then sitting in his landau to reply to a welcoming speech ; the viceroy of india at the wedding of a rajah ; the german crown prince on a barracks drill field in potsdam
1	they despised the usual nicknames given the teachers , because these were based on a humor that left them cold , didn ’ t even make them smile
1	saying something like that—if it really must be said
1	petersen clung to his book
1	even hans castorp smiled discreetly , and then they both nodded awhile in agreement
1	during his period of bed rest , he had made sparing use of the stock of two hundred he had brought with him and so still had some of those left
1	well , i ’ m not so certain about that
1	it was all a little haphazard for me
1	that much in my own justification and for your instruction
1	the malayan watched his every move without turning his head , but the whites of his eyes were clearly visible
1	the krögers no longer played any role at all ; they lived in seclusion and continued to have dreadful troubles with their son
1	true , she hardly ever saw herr grünlich , but she knew he was in town , negotiating with her parents and waiting
1	but for some , that just do not work and it 's not their way , and when the cheeks get wrinkly and the neck gets scrawny and there 's not much in the way of teeth when they laugh , they feel shamed and fretful when they look in the mirror and avoid other people 's eyes and get the urge to hide , like some sick kitten
1	which is to say , i want my capital
1	joachim replied curtly in the negative , his eyes lowered
1	the examination was over
1	and now that his second teeth were starting to come in , his sufferings increased
1	the lieutenant set me to rights—hmm , or should we say , set me to what was wrong , if that does not sound impolite
1	what a horrifying sight !
1	he also mentioned that he had been put on the list of candidates for the officer ’ s exam
1	and if as pedagogues we sow doubt , a doubt more profound than your modest enlightenment ever dreamed possible , we are well aware of what we are doing
1	should one take the children of the soil as models because they po·ssessed the depth of organic reality , whereas the ice flowers were mere external phenomena ?
1	then he stepped back and began to pace the room , while his eyes wandered here and there
1	they had now circled back to the house , and schwerdtfeger still had time to share a little snack with his friend in the winged-victory room
1	it was not unusual for her parents to change roles like this out of courtesy—it only reinforced the unanimity of their opinions
1	now y ’ take munich—from the way he pronounced the name of his hometown , one could only guess what he meant—munich ain ’ t no town for business
1	that is how a friendship marked by pain taught me to see music , although , given my own simple nature , i would perhaps have gladly seen something else in it
1	the consul thought , while returning a bow to the glasses lifted in his honor
1	he automatically opened the cigar cabinet , but immediately closed it again and then lifted the lid of a small oak chest on the card table—inside were playing cards , scoring pads , and similar items
1	adrian clapped a hand to his brow and apologized for his thoughtlessness
1	analysis is good as a tool of enlightenment and civilization—to the extent that it shakes stupid preconceptions , quashes natural biases , and undermines authority
1	and between the walls , the snow was packed so thick , despite all the shoveling , that here and there you came across holes and soft spots where you could suddenly sink in , sometimes up to the knee
1	doesn ’ t she even write you now and then , from her other places of residence ?
1	tucking the cord of her pince-nez behind her ear with a sigh , she had hurried off to nurse him—it was the only prospect that had opened up for her
1	it was eleven o ’ clock in the morning
1	and little johann stopped in his tracks , swallowed hard , and hastily answered softly , yes , papa
1	he had not come here for that sort of thing , was certainly not here to enjoy his stay by organizing his life around a variety of diversions , but solely for the purpose of detoxifying his body as quickly as possible , so that he could take up his duties in the plains below , real duties , not just the duties of rest cure—which , even though it was only a substitute , he was loath to slight in any way
1	what spoke out of them , what triumphed within them , was technique as an ascetic religion—virtuosity for its own sake , holy in and of itself
1	herr naphta is not a priest
1	mere being lived in brute
1	the street itself was otherwise deserted , with only a few curious faces silhouetted against the light in the windows of the buildings , all staring down at the black mass of insurgents below
1	his brother , georg , who surely runs the farm up there nowadays , was his senior by five years
1	he was one of those people who always have to grab , feel , touch , an arm , an elbow , a shoulder
1	he looked at his cousin—who simply lowered his eyes—and then said , ah , herr settembrini , you take my words all too literally
1	and saith unto them , sleep on now , and take your rest
1	this is not about an advance
1	the gaze faltered , the unconscious strain left the features , the painful swelling vanished rapidly from the lips , a more handsome , youthful look spread across our joachim ’ s silenced countenance , and it was over
1	it permitted him the solitude he sought , the profoundest solitude imaginable , touching his heart with a precarious savagery beyond human understanding
1	there he lay , paying full price , and what they brought him at this hour of fixed eternity was midday soup , the six-course berghof dinner in all its splendor , with nothing missing—a hearty meal six days a week , a sumptuous showpiece , a gala banquet , prepared by a trained european chef in the sanatorium ’ s deluxe hotel kitchen
1	and , besides , each is then divided up into several parts itself—into melodic phrases , and those by the rhythm itself—so that something ’ s always going on and every moment takes on a certain meaning that a person can hold on to , whereas otherwise—i don ’ t know if i ’ m putting it right , but
1	indeed it rather wears me down , i must say
1	the leuchtenfeld flats , which got their name from the lighthouse that rose up somewhere off to the right , stretched out far before him under the bright white sky , until the short grass , interspersed with patches of bare earth , gave way to taller shore vegetation and then to the sandy beach , where he could make out rows of little private wooden pavilions and wicker beach chairs facing the open sea
1	and second , this is definitely not to say that the things i have described must go on at every performance of a progressive nature
1	for that same reason i now want to invite the reader to accompany us young sons of the muses on the long walks beyond halle that we all enjoyed taking together in good weather
1	we have called it a basement , but although the stone stairway leading down to it from the ground floor did indeed create the impression of a descent into a basement , this was almost entirely an illusion , the reasons for which were , first , that the ground floor sat rather high , and second , that the whole edifice had been built on a steep , mountainous slope , so that the basement rooms faced the front and looked out onto the garden and the valley—a state of affairs countered and negated , as it were , by the effect of the stairway
1	do you know how you get goose bumps ?
1	in addition there is apparently an active proclivity for catarrh in the upper respiratory system
1	au revoir , my dear jean
1	without saying a word , he stands up
1	for breisacher , biblical personages revered by every christian child ( such as king david and king solomon , as well as the prophets with their pious harangues about god in his heaven ) were already decrepit representatives of a diluted late theology , which no longer had any notion of the old and genuinely hebrew presence of yahweh , the people 's elohim , and saw only riddles of ancient days
1	he would do worse here than the russian lady from the baltic region
1	so much has changed and will have to go right on changing
1	was large enough to lend its owner the title of freeholder or yeoman and comprised a good eighty acres of fields and meadows , a share in some cooperatively managed woodland , and a very comfortable timberwork house set on a stone foundation
1	and there ’ s no doubt he will handle the matter with a shrewdness equal to his very high fee
1	the truth was that the consul had left behind a much more considerable fortune than anyone would have imagined
1	although he was only a visiting guest up here , he , too , found it to be a very suitable arrangement
1	he will leave me
1	in my opinion the blackguard was intent not just on extorting pleasure , but also on her death
1	deep vertical furrows of contempt and ill humor formed between hans castorp ’ s eyebrows , and from under those furrows he gazed at the returned traveler five times a day , happy at least to gaze at her , but filled with scorn for the exalted personage who had not the least notion what an odd light past events cast upon him
1	now and then his chest gave an uneasy heave , and then he would have to cough his bronchial cough
1	while the consul smoked cigarettes and herr permaneder puffed away on several very black cigars and drank his beer , the family sat chatting with their guest for quite a long time
1	i have no choice but to listen to you play some of your student songs , morten , though i find them awfully boring
1	joachim had caught up by now
1	ottilie had no fever
1	degrees—that was too high , it was a fever , the result of an infection to which he had been susceptible
1	and it had hardly any for him , either , for unless a migraine had silenced him , he was a lively contributor to the day 's conversation ; and although nature elicited from him no cries of enthusiasm and he gazed at her with a certain meditative reserve , i nonetheless have no doubt that her images , rhythms , and high-borne melodies entered more deeply into his soul than into those of the others , so that in later years many a fleeting passage of pure , unruffled beauty emerging from his intellectually taut work has made me
1	the state , my dear sir—
1	why must almost everything appear to me as its own parody ?
1	seven hours in heavy , rain-sodden coats , with battle gear—this was no promenade
1	little dark curls fell down across his immobile , yellowish brow , which looked as if it were made of some noble , yet delicate material halfway between wax and marble , and the arch of his lips was full and proud under his slightly curly moustache
1	he , naphta , regretted having to disappoint his vis-à-vis , for he found the humanist fear of the very word illiteracy merely amusing
1	the permaneders had been living together in munich as man and wife for several weeks when consul buddenbrook finally was able to convert into cash the amount specified in his father ’ s will for his sister ’ s dowry , a total of fifty-one thousand marks courant , which sum was then converted into guldens and was received intact by herr permaneder , who then transferred it to secure and profitable investments
1	he now took up his position and glanced at the window while he stuck a forefinger , the one with a large signet ring , down inside his collar and rubbed
1	and he patted the neck of his imaginary nag
1	frau stöhr , sitting just a little behind him , had an expression on her face revealing such ignorant ecstasy that it was pitiful to behold , while fräulein levi of the ivory complexion sat leaning back in her chair with half-closed eyes and hands resting palms-up in her lap—and one would have taken her for a corpse if her chest had not risen and fallen with such striking regularity , although hans castorp thought she looked more like a mechanically driven wax figure he had once seen in a sideshow
1	are we supposed to turn it into a tenement ?
1	did he think the other members of the party had ?
1	the group included naphta and settembrini , hans castorp , ferge , and wehsal
1	but just before that , i saw the hujus girl ’ s head emerge for a mere second , her light blond hair , and her pale eyes , no color to them at all , gaping wide , staring at the priest—and then she ducked under the sheets again with a loud wail
1	rising slightly from his seat at the piano and respectfully lowering his head to the hand she offered him , he brought his left hand down on the firm , clear chords of a fifth , whereupon gerda picked up her stradivarius and quickly tuned the strings with a practiced ear
1	a pale red sunset that had enlivened the generally overcast sky faded now , leaving nature under the transient sway of the lackluster , lifeless , and mournful light that immediately precedes nightfall
1	it has an absolutely medieval ring
1	all the same—we can not be so imprudent as to depend too much on that
1	shortly after the holidays , the austrian horseman died
1	only a very few old veterans , joachim said , were able to fling both blankets around them at once in three deft motions , but that was a rare and coveted skill , which demanded not only years of practice , but also a natural predisposition
1	to be sure , to be sure , hans castorp replied superciliously
1	how strange that lament for culture , raised now against crimes that we called down upon ourselves , sounds in the mouths of those who entered the arena of history proclaiming themselves bearers of a barbarism that , while wallowing in ruthlessness , was to rejuvenate the world
1	that ’ s not a stupid way to put it , hans , she said , and her slanted eyes grew fixed , lost in thought
1	well , fine , then , ziemssen
1	there are times when she ’ s more quiet and serious and caught up in her own thoughts , and then he scolds her and flares up , says things that , to be honest , are not exactly considerate
1	inez , the older sister , was likewise destined for a tragic deed
1	your husband has left himself open , there can be no doubt of that
1	many thanks , mynheer peeperkorn
1	what was happening inside him could shock me , but never drive me from him
1	just think of all that water
1	it was all done in the old style—gothic arches still sedately spanned corridors and arcades
1	let ’ s go to bed
1	demoiselle meyer–de la grange was the latest in this year ’ s series of actresses whom he had favored with diamonds
1	he did so in a quasi-humanistic sense , in order to highlight the lofty view these ostensibly dark ages had fostered for the exclusive status of the human body
1	he determined that both heart and lungs were working quite vigorously , but that the occasional shortness of breath could be traced to a sluggishness in certain muscles , and prescribed both the use of a fan to ease respiration and a greenish powder that one first ignited in order to breathe its fumes
1	it ’ s a large sum , a very large sum
1	and the source of the terrible disgrace when feeling is lacking , when there is an inability to awaken the female to desire
1	in a word , a confused soul
1	so that quite a bit is happening backstage
1	and there you have your own intimate photograph , taken with no apparatus at all
1	you really should have a look , it ’ s so refreshing to watch her
1	he knows what he wants , he continued , and it is rather embarrassing that i do not know precisely
1	her father continued to probe her with his eyes
1	you will have to think and act for us all , because gerda and i are just women , and christian—well , god bless him
1	both cousins were surprised by the luxury of the two-windowed study into which they had stepped—indeed , they were dazzled , for they had not expected anything of the sort given the shabby little house with its dingy corridor and stairway , in contrast to which naphta ’ s furnishings seemed almost fabulously elegant , when in point of fact they weren ’ t , nor would hans castorp or joachim ziemssen normally have regarded them as such
1	that culture as an idea was a historically transitory phenomenon , that it could lose itself again in some other idea , that the future did not necessarily belong to it-he had most definitely extracted that notion from kretzschmar 's lecture
1	terribly , hans castorp said , terribly lifelike skin
1	i can only answer : it was the music that made the gift possible-the music of these verses , which lies in so light a slumber that it needed only the gentlest touch of an expert hand to awaken it
1	can ’ t say i know that exactly , either
1	they completely avoided the german element-schildknapp would invariably take flight the moment a sound of his mother tongue struck his ear ; he was perfectly capable of climbing right back off an omnibus or train if he encountered germans there
1	he was , in reality , bored by the small , steady , secure commissions he made on the sale of this or that piece of real estate , but this loss , this tragic blow that heaven had struck against him , the great schemer , was pure joy , a source of happiness on which he feasted for weeks afterward
1	we ’ re in the same boat , he declared cheerfully
1	at one point the beach turned rocky , and they climbed up into the woods to reach the path that led to the temple of the sea—a round pavilion of logs and planks , its interior full of carved inscriptions , initials , hearts , and poems
1	the butchers had set up their stalls under the pointed arches of the town-hall arcades , and they weighed their wares with bloody hands
1	what our age needs , what it demands , what it will create for itself , is—terror
1	it didn ’ t make me any happier , as you can well imagine
1	hans castorp , who could not look at this ill-mannered woman without feeling some disapproval , thought to himself : she reminds me of something , but i can ’ t really say what
1	she felt confident that she could hold him , bind him , domesticate this wild creature
1	ah yes , very sad , grätjens the broker said , and when you think what madness led to their ruin—if only dietrich ratenkamp hadn ’ t made geelmaack a partner
1	this was the frightening course hans castorp ’ s thoughts took
1	so you see the fracases a fellow is constantly getting involved in , even when he would much rather keep quiet and go his pure and spotless way
1	as if that were not enough , he wrote a series of sizable choral works with texts taken directly from the bible
1	we know what we are saying when we add—perhaps somewhat darkly—that his fate might have been different if his disposition had not been so highly susceptible to the charms of the emotional sphere , to the universal state of mind that this song epitomized so intensely , so mysteriously
1	but as regards me , your eldest son , you have gone so far in your un-christian anger as to refuse me outright any compensation for my share in the house !
1	in his shock , hans castorp stammered , you asked if—that is—but of course i respect frau chauchat in her position as—
1	and i can rattle off the litany of the rule ’ and observe it quite faithfully
1	there ’ s your new house , a dream come true
1	on the one hand , his love was caught up—and with such an immediacy that it could make the young man blanch and grimace—in frau chauchat ’ s knee , the contour of her leg , her back , the nape of her neck , her upper arms and the way they pressed her small breasts together , in brief , caught up in her body , her careless body , so accentuated and vastly enhanced by her illness that it was a second embodiment of her body
1	it was all about a kind of poisoning , about the organism poisoning itself , which , dr krokowski had said , was the result of the decomposition of a certain , still-unidentified substance present throughout the body ; the by-products of that decomposition had an intoxicating effect on certain centers in the spinal cord , not all that different from what happens when other poisons , such as morphine or cocaine , are introduced into the body
1	he was nervous and anxious himself , because the awkward situation in schleswig-holstein had set the stock market in turmoil
1	even hanno buddenbrook was unable to resist this impression , although he sensed something deep inside rebelling against the idea
1	hans castorp had been unaware of her sudden turn for the worse and exitus ; otherwise he would gladly have taken part in her burial , both out of friendship and his admitted love of funerals in general
1	be that in all humility , my friend , not with strut and bluster ; and always bear in mind that self-satisfaction is itself apostasy and ingratitude to the spender of every mercy !
1	as noted , mutual sympathy was at work here , the kind of family affection and affinity of personality that not infrequently leaps a generation
1	circumstances did not exactly offer luck excessive latitude
1	but be and remain himself , except lifted to his natural elevation by his half-bottle of champagne , and might in drunken indulgence taste every bliss of almost intolerable infusion , till he be convinced more or less rightly that there has not been such an infusion for thousands of years and till in certain wanton moments he may plainly and honestly deem himself a god
1	his voice had grown strangely impassioned
1	and who will dispute that hopeful progress in that direction was indeed discernible among us-everywhere throughout germany , that is , with the exception of one or two obstinate spots , of which our good city of munich was an exemplary model ?
1	he just washed his hands quickly ; and they walked down to the dining hall , for the third time
1	what is life like in old scratch 's house ?
1	and even in terms of the objects and faces that made up the details of a day , hans castorp had to learn at every step to take a closer , less casual look at accustomed facts and faces and assimilate new things with youthful receptivity
1	what do you have against analysis ?
1	and rightly so , rightly so
1	and he observed the other guests , too—the crowd was beginning to sort itself out for him and individuals were emerging
1	with clara ’ s hand in his , sievert tiburtius talked about his parents , his youth , and his plans for the future ; the arnoldsens told about the history of their family , which had originated in dresden and only one branch of which had been transplanted to holland
1	all the same , he was summoned to rhadamanthus out of turn
1	would you attest to your reputed stupidity and bell yourself as a cat , by wanting to found your business and promise on so pliant , so captious a term as-'love ' ?
1	and in the morning he would remember nothing at all
1	the now· predominantly gray beard made the narrow face look even longer , so that it bore a striking resemblance to that of a nobleman by el greco
1	it was about abstractions , about ideas
1	such industry and invention will not be found a second time on god ’ s good , wide earth
1	things take care of themselves
1	but that hand betrayed an infinitely sad and soft surrender to memories , to sweet longings that drifted into the distance
1	on the table was a long row of gingerbread cakes , glazed and sprinkled with almonds , alternating with loaves of marzipan bread , so fresh they were still moist inside
1	we are about to introduce it , since we ourselves are much taken by that mysterious object ’ s secret charms and are honestly eager to share them
1	for me not to set all too much store by schwerdtfeger 's charms-that is , to warn me against them
1	i have been damned from the start with the need to laugh at the most mysterious and impressive spectacles , and i fled from my exaggerated sense of the comic into theology , hoping it would soothe the tickle-only to find a lot of things awfully comic there as well
1	and no one was about to abandon that hope
1	you probably want to make fun of my serenus
1	it is quite clear : when she was an object of courtship , her thoughts turned to him in sorrow ; as an experienced wife , she fell in love with him , fully aware of what that meant and with all her feelings and desires for him intact
1	his primary object was director behrens—he sneered at the size of the man ’ s feet and lingered over his title of hofrat , which had been bestowed on him by a prince suffering from tuberculosis of the brain
1	tony was almost a little ashamed and for the first time felt inclined to see something laudable in herr permaneder ’ s lack of passion when it came to money matters
1	but i had to lie in bed for four weeks when i first arrived , joachim objected
1	then he said , all the better , gentlemen
1	christian , however , had no opinion whatever ; he confined himself to wrinkling up his nose and observing these gentlemen in order to imitate them later at the club or for his family
1	but that in no way affected the look of pride and joy that appeared in the consul ’ s eyes when he thought of his eldest son
1	tony had heard such remarks often enough so that she was not inclined to have an especially high opinion of julie hagenström
1	the senator stopped here , turned his back on the hunchbacked apprentice , and broke open the telegram
1	hans castorp stirred his spoon in his cup , although there was nothing in it
1	the hands had turned a blackish blue , as had parts of the face , resulting in considerable disfigurement , although the regal features were unaffected
1	wild horses couldn ’ t get him here
1	but it ’ s best we not speak of it
1	then he once again sank back into a brown study
1	but hans castorp was bent forward , glancing up only fleetingly while drawing figures in the sand with the silver-trimmed knob of his citified cane
1	but i am bringing with me the promise that all three arnoldsens—gerda , her father , and her married sister—will visit us in august
1	he could not express , he wrote its composer , how the work took his breath away in its boldness , its novelty
1	they said he would spend the whole day with germans at the gaming table , and for no modest stakes , but of an evening he would play with his own generals
1	and a light fever now , too—oh , insignificant , but fever nonetheless
1	he is , i would say , too comfortable a man for that , he takes life too easy—which is , however , a fault in its own way , too
1	his good-natured bushy moustache bobbed violently up and down
1	perhaps what instills such an insurmountable aversion in me is a certain mawkish dishonesty to which the vice lends itself , or that is peculiar to it from the start
1	you ’ re being ridiculous—your hands feel satisfied
1	then he would sprawl back again in all his grandeur , lay one arm across the back of a neighboring chair , and bewilder them all by demanding they plunge with him into his vivid , keen imaginings of morning—of a frosty , dark winter morning , when the yellowish glow of a nightstand lamp is mirrored in the window-pane and shines out into bare branches , stiff in the icy fog of a morning harsh with the cries of crows
1	and friedrich wilhelm of prussia ’ s doing poorly , herr buddenbrook
1	except that herr permaneder let the chance go by and confined himself to censuring herr grünlich in such strong terms that the goatee on his little round chin bristled
1	mendelssohn , for whom , as you know , i have a tender spot , took up , so to speak , with beethoven 's third period , ie , with his multivoiced style-and at something else and more than an ambling gait
1	as in the past , he often suffered from the vague but unconquerable fear of a sudden paralysis of his tongue , throat , and extremities—even of his intellectual powers
1	and what are we to her ?
1	it was originally nothing more than the attempt by a man of action to be certain that from head to toe he displayed the impeccable correctness that sustains self-confidence
1	in your twenty-fourth year , you say ?
1	a quarter past two—that ’ s as good as half past ; and half past two is the same as half till three , for heaven ’ s sake
1	they did not speak much , only the phrases a normal day at the berghof brought to their lips , nothing more
1	but then settembrini added , over a glass of wine , on the evening of mardi gras , my good engineer , you will recall that you more or less took your leave of me—yes , it was very like a good-bye
1	in short , nothing happened , and that was , to use hans ’ s term , no more and no less than a mystery
1	they walked toward the pier , taking the boardwalk laid well above the waterline ; and as they passed the boulders where morten schwarzkopf was sitting reading , tony quickly nodded to him several times from a distance
1	on the left the lot was separated from the neighbor ’ s garden by a wall , but on the right it was bounded by the house next door , covered to the roofline with a wooden lattice , which in time would be home to climbing vines
1	i can read from your relatively broad face that there is the danger of—bread ,
1	his lips were pressed tight and turned down maliciously at the corners , and the gaze he directed at the senator was so nasty , piercing , and treacherous that it seemed incomprehensible why the latter would not prefer to avoid the company of such a man
1	if it ’ s all right with you , we can go to breakfast—tous les deux , he added as a joke , in a burst of high spirits
1	there she sat with them in her checked house apron , an oval brooch at its rounded neckline , her back straight , her brown hair only slightly flecked with gray and pulled back tight and smooth , so that the part revealed the white skin of her head ; her small , well-formed , competent hands , a plain wedding band on the right one , were neatly folded on the tabletop
1	even when he appeared to be relaxing—reading his newspapers after dinner , for instance—a thousand plans were simultaneously at work in his brain , while he slowly , even passionately twirled one long tip of his mustache and the veins on his pallid temples swelled and stood out
1	he could be certain that any literary efforts beyond these were not demanded or expected of him
1	in his silent matter-of-factness , he left no doubt that he recognized his elder brother ’ s superiority , his greater expertise , competence , and respectability
1	asterisks , too , serve to refresh the reader 's eye and mind-it does not always require a roman numeral , which gives a new section even stronger definition ; and i could not possibly have granted a chapter of its own to the foregoing excursus on a present that adrian leverkiihn did not himself experience
1	true , the orchestra ’ s second-rate violins had faltered a little during the overture , and the boat , carrying a fat , conceited man with a reddish-blond beard , had entered by fits and starts
1	was joachim locked up here , too ?
1	pastor pringsheim ’ s eulogy probed the gaping wound that death had left ; he quite intentionally evoked vivid memories of what each of them had lost ; he knew how to squeeze tears from those who would never have shed them on their own and were all the more grateful for having been so moved
1	closest to the door stood a group of less important men : two or three shopkeepers ; a high-school teacher ; herr mindermann , the orphanage director ; and herr wenzel , the well-liked barber
1	they had better wait , not make any moves
1	no , i would do better to speak only of myself , of my enchantment , my delight- !
1	do you think i don ’ t have eyes in my head ?
1	hans castorp now operated the machine
1	for in that is found goodness and brotherly love , and in that alone
1	all the good things that madame permaneder envisioned when she was expecting are ready and waiting
1	i believe that god made me—
1	i can ’ t seem not to , even though it makes everything worse
1	i had a brief conversation with gosch the broker this afternoon—such a bizarre man , who sees everything with the eyes of a poet and dramatist
1	next—whoever feels up to it , he shouted , staring into the air
1	and after his demise—well , even after that , hans castorp ’ s relationship to the local landscape , if one ignores his ski outings , had maintained its conservative , monotone character , a trait that had held a certain special charm for the young man when he contrasted it with the range of his inner experiences and the duties involved in playing king
1	what had been his objections ?
1	yes , yes—herr settembrini has done a splendid job of helping me pass the time—though that ’ s a poor way of putting it
1	i stand there conversing with him for some five minutes
1	it ’ s strange , i can never picture you doing anything else
1	your individualism , as i made bold to remark before , is a makeshift thing , a series of concessions
1	yes , here i am , but i ’ ve come with a heavy heart today
1	you ’ d never know it , hans castorp said
1	the young people—totally languid , stuffed with roasts and desserts , all slightly feverish—chatted , joked , and flirted with their eyes
1	yes i am , tony , he said emphatically
1	but he was still waiting for something else , too , although he did not really ask himself what it was
1	and i repeat , we should have chatted long before this
1	how did young hans castorp actually feel about all this ?
1	even when it is a matter of a pure and authentic genius , bestowed or perhaps inflicted hy god , rather than an acquired and destructive genius , a sinful and morbid necrosis of natural talents , the fruition of some horrible pact
1	what are you doing up here ?
1	do that , hans castorp said
1	'the last chapter of world history
1	would you like to see it ?
1	to be sure , it is a german superstition that there is nothing but valse brillante in the world outside , and seriousness only in germany
1	and so the prosecutor now had a free hand either to do battle over frau wurmbrandt , or to come to an understanding with the swede
1	indeed we sat there until lnstitoris returned from the allotria , where he had been playing tarok with some other gentlemen
1	he went back into the room to run a brush through his hair ; as he did , joachim took another look at the thermometer on the washstand—and hans castorp watched him from a distance
1	and since old newspaper would also be recycled as valuable packing paper and cardboard , which would then provide an important economic base for national and local taxation , the plan would also reduce the tax burden on newspaper subscribers
1	lighted to the point of elation
1	clear out , dear out , run along , back to the barracks !
1	there was no porter , unfortunately
1	and then a swim , which was much more enjoyable here than at herr asmussen ’ s—there wasn ’ t any goose grass here , only pale green , crystal-clear water that foamed when you splashed it , and instead of slimy wooden planks there was gently rilled sand under your feet , and consul hagenström ’ s boys were far , far away , in norway or tyrolia
1	you ’ re something of a coward , man , a phony , and if your cousin calls you a civilian , that ’ s merely a very euphemistic way of putting it
1	the family dining room was located upstairs and adjoined an even larger kitchen , where friends from the village were received and which had a vast , gloomy chimney and was hung full with ladles out of a fairy tale and carving knives and forks that could have belonged to an ogre , its shelves filled with copper utensils , saucepans , bowls , platters , terrines , and mortars , and was ruled over by signora manardi ; called nella by her family ( i believe her name was peronella ) , a stately matron of the roman type , with an arched upper lip , kindly brown ( but not dark brown , just chestnut ) eyes and hair pulled smoothly and tightly back and flecked with silver ; her full evenly proportioned figure was that of a competent and simple country woman-and one would often see her small , but work-roughened hands , a double widow 's band on the right one , set akimbo on sturdy hips bound tightly by apron strings
1	you do regard this as one of your duties here , am i not right , lieutenant ?
1	which news do you mean ?
1	there were paintings everywhere , the director ’ s paintings—the visitors ’ eyes at once began courteously to wander over them , ready to admire
1	it is not true clarity , but a dreamy , empty clarity that demands nothing of us , a clarity without consequences , and therefore dangerous , because it seduces us to take our ease beside it
1	adrian said to me , but a novel
1	a sign that he was well aware of the rules he had broken
1	while inspecting a harbor warehouse on a windy day the following spring , he caught pneumonia , and since , despite all the conscientious attention given him by dr heidekind , his already agitated heart could not hold out against the high fever , he , too , was dead within five days
1	but they weren ’ t , and in all honesty hans castorp had not assumed they would be—to tell the truth , from his personal point of view , he would not have understood it if they had remained quiet
1	i am honored by your offer , she said , as calmly as she could , but i can not accept it
1	director behrens threw his arms above his shoulders and let them fall , noisily slapping his thighs
1	consul fritsche , an older gentleman with a distinguished clean-shaven face , was standing up in the pavilion , busily directing a telescope at a sailboat visible in the distance
1	i don ’ t really understand much more about it myself , and i ’ ve never met a literary man before
1	he was a totally different sort of fellow , as we shall see
1	her daughter , who had also been invited , had visited her husband in prison that afternoon and , as was always the case afterward , had felt tired and out of sorts and so had remained at home
1	the old man exclaimed and pretended to be itching all over with curiosity
1	the next time they would appoint someone to be secretary and then check how it sounded when you had it fixed in black and white and could read it as a whole ; for the moment , however , and before holger returned to the serenity of his hastening while , it would be much better , or in any event extraordinarily kind of him , if he would be willing perhaps to answer one or two practical questions the group still had for him—not that they had anything definite in mind , but , just on principle , would he be prepared in that case to do them this special favor ?
1	there were many times of an evening when adrian 's father would open his books with colorful illustrations of exotic moths and sea creatures , and we all-his sons and i , and on occasion frau leverkiihn as well-would gather to gaze from over the back of his leather wing chair ; and he would point with his forefinger at the splendors and oddities pictured there : the papilios and morphos of the tropics , flitting along , somber and radiant , in all the colors of the palette , configured and patterned with the most exquisite taste any artisan could ever invent-insects that in their fantastically exaggerated beauty eke out an ephemeral life and some of which native peoples consider to be evil spirits that bear malaria
1	hans castorp sat there , chin in hand
1	but working against these influences was the jealous insult he felt as a result of his conquest 's change of mind , so that he was now only good enough to be a tool , a means to an end ; and i do believe that secretly he felt free-th�t is , felt no obligation to return such demanding unfaithfulness with faithfulness
1	and then , finally , there were adrian and rudiger schildknapp , who for month after month remained within the peacefully austere circle we had come to know , living a life no different from that of the monks in the cloister up the hill
1	and i suppose you think that ’ s news to me , do you ?
1	thirty-five thousand marks courant , due within less than two weeks
1	it occurred after dinner ; they ran into one another at the door that no longer slammed
1	several times he had inserted fugues into subsequent piano music , but in a three-voiced form : both in the hammerklavier sonata and in the one that begins in a-flat major
1	the humanist then took advantage of this animated mood to explain further about how one ought to pay no attention to those who suffered from hallucinations , to pazzi in general , advancing the proposition that such people let themselves get carried away , quite illegitimately , and often had it within their power to control their madness , as he had himself observed on several visits to madhouses
1	there he sat , sporting a little beard that he had let grow by then , a blond goatee , the color of straw and of rather indefinite shape , which we are forced to interpret as a sign of a certain philosophical indifference to his appearance
1	and without a word of thanks , she nonchalantly took a cigarette from the silver case he held out to her , then accepted a light from the pocket lighter he let flicker before her face as she leaned forward
1	the votin ’ now is between hagenström , kistenmaker , ’ nd buddenbrook
1	he can never get past the start—the same lines he was just sobbing over in his sleep just now
1	yes , we are a completely different nation , one that is a contradiction to sobriety and common sense and whose soul is powerfully tragic ; our love belongs to fate , any fate , if only it is one , even a doom that sets the heavens afire with the red twilight of the gods
1	it is a responsibility , doctor
1	to be sure , if you looked more closely , there were wildflowers that gently made the same point
1	to be sure , these crea-
1	he guided him slowly along a few steps of gravel walk to the glistening white stairway that led to the dining room
1	in short , one can not help speaking about it in confusion commensurate with his confused impressions
1	on the wall across from the door were several high racks hung with coats and hats
1	that hasn ’ t changed in the past few days
1	the only objection i would raise against him is that polyphony came too easily to him
1	oh , a place where they eat their cake with a knife , where even princes can ’ t get their don ’ ts and doesn ’ ts straight , and where they think a gentleman is courting a woman if he picks up her fan for her—it ’ s easy to be thought arrogant in a place like that , tom
1	can i help it if phthisis is accompanied by increased concupiscence ?
1	i feel as if i should like to-as if i must see her always , have her near me always
1	we call it a creeping sensation in order to differentiate between its purely physical and its psychological aspects , since there was hardly any sense of horror involved
1	certainly , the arts and music in particularno less than the sciences-assumed a subservient , subsidiary role in relation to the study and worship of god ; and that idea was associated with certain discussions we had once had about art 's destiny , about its emancipation from the cult , its cultural secularization-which ory
1	he propped his elbows against the cushion behind him , his chin in one hand , and gazed at them for a while from a distance
1	then all three of them left
1	illness battered its victim until they got along with one another : the senses were diminished , there were lapses in consciousness , a merciful self-narcosis set in—all means by which nature allowed the organism to find relief , to adapt mentally and morally to its condition , and which the healthy person naively forgot to take into account
1	my good engineer , you are a wag
1	it was perhaps no matter that her marriage with pastor tiburtius had not been blessed with children , particularly since clara buddenbrook had never wanted them and almost certainly had very few of the requisite maternal talents
1	behind the glass door that opened onto the second floor was a small hallway
1	i repeat , he said , raising a finger lance , while the wineglass continued to tremble in his other hand , i repeat , that it is our duty , our religious duty to feel
1	it felt as if the humidity had doubled ; in less than a second the atmospheric pressure rose rapidly , alarmingly , oppressing heart and brain and making breathing difficult
1	for here , in a most remarkable fashion , he found himself reminded of his own—or should one say , his former—profession and of the fact that on his arrival he had presented himself to whomever he met , from dr krokowski to herr settembrini , as a member of the scientific caste
1	he was merely suggesting they give it a try
1	the surface offers greater difficulties
1	the music of ephrata , kretzschmar told us , had been too unusual , too strangely unorthodox , to be adopted by the outside world , and it had therefore fallen into practical oblivion once the sect of german seventh day baptists had ceased to flourish
1	until adrian 's arrival , nikolaus , a widower-his wife had died young-had lived in the house alone with an old , long-time housekeeper , frau butze ; a maid ; and a young italian from brescia named luca cimabue ( he did indeed carry the family name of that thirteenthcentury painter of madonnas ) , an apprentice who assisted in making violins-for uncle leverkiihn was also a violin-maker
1	and to play it for the masses-pure nonsense !
1	why frighten him unnecessarily ?
1	christian sat staring mutely at the theater for a while , blinking his eyes as if deep in thought
1	( he was twenty-nine as he lived and breathed )
1	she lacked his humor , but was the personification of the energetically hospitable housewife and was of one accord with her husband about the pleasures of sheltering fame in her home and allowing the carefree spirit of virtuosity to reign within its walls
1	there ’ s a slit in the lid , or so you think , and it ’ s on a slant
1	i know this building well
1	these young people who have joined to celebrate with us older folks probably can not imagine that things were ever any different
1	his own music theory , one suited to his special purposes ; he froze out the singing teacher and took matters firmly in hand-with such success that within a short time he had made music the most important element in the religious life of the settlement
1	the great-aunt gave her some candies , konfekti as she called them in russian ; the teacher , fräulein engelhart , appeared , as did the man from mannheim—although he stood off at some distance , watching gloomily ; but then his mournful eyes glided up to the window , where he had spotted hans castorp , and lingered gloomily there for a while
1	the excellent pedagogue expanded eloquently , though somewhat nervously , on his opinions , spoke of the important difference between a line and a stroke , mentioned the lovely woodland green as well as the coal box , making frequent use during the course of his visit of the word consequently , which seemed to him aptly suited to his elegant surroundings
1	ah , it ought not be !
1	c ’ est une abdication , she said
1	settembrini ’ s smile was not forced this time ; he was sure of himself
1	they all were to get up by artificial light , go without breakfast , and gather in the bitter chill of morning—that had been the agreement
1	joachim listened for hours to the sound coming from his cousin ’ s balcony : a paper knife slipping through uncut pages
1	the path opening before you today is the one to which destiny has called you , as you well know
1	he left his sinewy throat exposed and was no friend of standard city attire , which did not do anything for his looks , and especially not for his hands-a strong , tanned , parched , and lightly freckled hand whose grip completely covered the head of his cane whenever he set out for a council meeting in the village
1	fiance were to find her out , she always had the stuff that could put everything to rights and that she had kept for ages inside her objet d'art , inside the book with the skull
1	an hour later he was cradled in the highly civilized atmosphere of the berghof
1	it was hans castorp ’ s turn to answer
1	soothes one ’ s cares away , catches fire like brandy , but , all the same , she packs something of a wallop toward the end
1	hanno was eleven now , and along with his little friend count mölln he had been promoted to the fourth grade , but by the skin of his teeth—it had taken two extra exams in arithmetic and geography
1	someone just went in
1	thomas was not in the mood to think about that
1	he would cry , just as he always did when someone demanded that he perform , drilled him , tested his abilities and cleverness , the way papa loved to do
1	there could be no question of surprise on my part , nor would there have been even if , without any preparation , i had one day been presented with a fait accompli
1	you do that very well , hans castorp said
1	just prompt me a little , todtenhaupt , if i get called on , hanno begged , shoving the book away
1	but the style of the entire work was strictly that of chamber music , a filigree handiwork , a clever grotesquery of notes , humorous and ingenious in its combinations and rich with the inventions of a refined playfulness ; and any lover of music who , weary of romantic democracy and popular moralistic harangues , might have demanded an art or for art 's sake , or for artists ' and experts ' sake , art with no ambitions or rather with only the most exclusive ambitions , would have had to be enraptured by this self-centered and perfectly cool esotericism-which in the esoteric spirit of the piece , however , at every turn mocked and exaggerated itself as parody , mixing a drop of sadness , a grain of hopelessness into the rapture
1	space , as it rolls and tumbles away between him and his native soil , proves to have powers normally ascribed only to time ; from hour to hour , space brings about changes very like those time produces , yet surpassing them in certain ways
1	hans castorp was silent , too
1	indeed no doctor was at hand , not one among so many concertgoersalthough doctors do tend to be musical , if only because there are so many who are jewish
1	they were in the duchy of oldenburg now
1	it was exactly as if someone had taken hold of his brain and with incredible force started swinging it in wide concentric circles that grew smaller and smaller , so that it picked up speed , frightening speed , as it whirled around and around , until at last it crashed with tremendous , brutal , merciless force against the stone-hard center of the circle
1	and hans castorp experienced much the same thing
1	clarissa , she reported , truly loved her artistic profession and was not allowing the joy she took in it to be diminished by a certain coldness of the audience , the nit-picking of critics , or the cheeky cruelty of various directors who attempted to spoil her mood by shouting pick it up !
1	what sort of malarkey is that , smolt !
1	the gentlemen on the exchange nodded to one another and said , buddenbrook is out to make money , and how !
1	i implore you , madam—where were you ?
1	it ’ s much too small a space for dancing
1	but once the postlude to the choral anthem was over and herr pfühl had slowly removed all ten fingers from the keys to let the bass of the tonic chord echo softly and solemnly , there would be a meaningful , artful pause , and then pastor pringsheim would lift up his voice from beneath the canopy of the pulpit ; and at that point , it was not unusual for herr pfühl to start mocking the sermon and to laugh at pastor pringsheim ’ s stylized franconian accent , his long and dark or sharply accented vowels , his sighs , and the abrupt shifts of darkness and transfiguration passing over his face
1	no , you have nothing to do with the devil
1	kai ’ s mood was vastly improved by the sight of the lord god , who continued to terrorize everyone for a while , turning faces ashen as he snarled horribly and pointed in various directions at the litter of sandwich papers tossed aside here and there around the brick courtyard
1	and now , and now … to sell it …
1	for the message to be inaccessible , and for one to immerse oneself in that contradiction-that also has its pleasure
1	a problem child , that ’ s certainly what i ’ ve been for you and your pedagogic streak—you spoke about that the very first day
1	prosecutor paravant had been given a hefty slap on the cheek from the transcendent world , and had received it with scientific amusement , had even eagerly turned the other cheek—despite his being a cavalier , lawyer , and alumnus of a dueling fraternity , all of which would have demanded quite different conduct had the blow ’ s origin been from the world of the living
1	this remark contained two jokes
1	and so , after she had devoured her cake and chocolate , she would pick up her school bag , skip across the terrace , and walk down through the well-tended front garden
1	well , cheer up , hans castorp said , as he sat down on his cousin ’ s bed in room
1	did director behrens also tell you about a certain russian woman whom we had here for five months last year—no , wait , the year before last ?
1	then , while they sang the first verse of o , tannenbaum in rather subdued voices , they moved through the rooms to the grand hall
1	and that , i think , is premature , precisely because you can ’ t be sure
1	they spent recess hand in hand , and he talked about his home , about the puppies and chickens ; and sometimes he was even allowed to join hanno at lunchtime , although ida jungmann always stood waiting at the school gate with a package of sandwiches , ready to take her charge for their midday stroll
1	he now gazed out across the room where people were coming and going : early breakfast was not a strictly communal affair
1	you may regard the sum , if you wish , as a final settlement , as your daughter ’ s inheritance , as an interest-bearing loan
1	but that was no good , since joachim would have heard him get up , and so he decided he had best put it off and catch behrens sometime later in the afternoon
1	germans , the fledging university student said , a blade of grass in his mouth , have two-tracked minds and a way of illegitimately combining ideas
1	but little johann was no longer little , he was fifteen years old now , and , despite his delicate health , she could no longer be of much help to him
1	music is invaluable as the ultimate means for awakening our zeal , a power that draws the mind trained for its effects forward and upward
1	on one such occasion he learned that young buddenbrook was called hanno at home , and he immediately adopted the nickname and never called him anything else from then on
1	you have made a stroke ! —he said struck instead of stroke
1	he waited , his spine pressed against the high chairback , his gaze clairvoyant at hearing that voice anew ; but he was once again uncertain whether she was still behind him , afraid that the scraps of music from the next room might have drowned out her departing footsteps
1	she picks up the silk dresses , plus a whole stack of underclothes , and leaves
1	that experienced soul followed her back , bringing along a farm hand , who , after repeated calls and knocks by the women ,
1	the collection was now split in two—the muscovites declaring they wanted to present behrens a gift of their own
1	did i get into this carriage with you to talk about him ?
1	could he ever explain to his father , his grandfather , or any of his fellow merchants how he could play with such an idea , let alone put it into words ?
1	it was after a meal , she was standing in the dining room with both hands in the pockets of her sweater , trying to carry on a conversation with another patient , an acquaintance from the lounging arcade presumably , struggling in a most charming way , as hans castorp could hear , to speak german ; and he suddenly discovered a pride in his own mother tongue that he had never known before—and , simultaneously , an urge to sacrifice that pride to the enchantment that filled him at the sound of her winsomely bungled , broken stammering
1	and yet—and i ’ m as good a christian as gotthold—and yet …
1	i believe in progress , certainly
1	otherwise i couldn ’ t move a finger
1	landscapes , still lifes , animals—a fellow like me shrinks from absolutely nothing
1	and the pinches hurt , of course , so we would reluctantly supply the correct answer
1	he had a bulldog face and brown , apathetic eyes
1	old dr grabow appeared in person
1	the phrase saddled you with sounded particularly droll coming from him
1	sievert tiburtius and clara buddenbrook held back a little
1	but the moment he took hold of the white door ’ s burnt-gold handle , a storm of music surged up again and he shrank back
1	it is as if this loyalty may well have made up for my having fled in horror from my country 's guilt
1	he had lost his self-control after all
1	well , my boy , have fun with it , he said , stroking hanno ’ s hair
1	he cried , his voice cracking
1	about like john the martyr in his cauldron of oil
1	he spoke quite extempore , distinctly , without effort or pause , inphrases tinged with light irony and as precise as the printed word-and not from a chair behind his lectern , but somewhere off to one side , half-sitting , halfleaning against a railing , the tips of his fingers lying interlaced in his lap with thumbs spread wide , while his small forked beard bobbed up and down , revealing the splinter-sharp teeth set between it and his tapered and twirled moustache
1	it comes to mind because kretzschmar-that was my teacher , an organist , a man of the fugue , you should know-had an oddly passionate regard for the piece , a true weakness
1	the good-natured martyr , what was he up to there ?
1	she obviously enjoyed listening to his descriptions of life in travemünde and joined in enthusiastically whenever he wistfully sang its praises
1	herr naphta would rather impugn art than admit it could make a human being of even the worst reprobate
1	naphta was told to be silent on that account—first , because it was an outrage to humane feelings , and second , because he , settembrini , had heard enough evasions and could see through the tricks of his opponent ’ s apologetics to the thoroughly infamous and devilish cult of nihilism , which desired to be called spirit and managed to perceive something legitimizing and sanctifying in the acknowledged unpopularity of the ascetic principle
1	you aren ’ t even thinking of the actual state of affairs , thomas
1	life is short , whereas our ability to meet its challenges is but—those are facts , my child
1	i ’ ll go back to amsterdam and play duets with papa , and then later i ’ ll live with my married sister
1	besides , there is my cousin with whom i am involved and who has little or no inclination to amuse himself here ; he thinks about nothing except returning to the plains to be a soldier
1	the cousins sat down on an unoccupied bench to watch and critique the play
1	that the decision would be rnade , i foresaw with some emotion , and the fact that it was already as good as made served as the basis for an ensuing conversation about both our immediate futures
1	hans castorp counted now
1	she lived in an inexpensive boardinghouse in dorf—nineteen years old , a slip of a thing , with smooth oily hair , eyes that shyly tried to hide a glint that matched the hectic flush of her cheeks , and a distinctively husky but sympathetic voice
1	i did not at all enjoy it when kjoejelund the concert singer would blast siegfried 's endless and rather dull smithy songs , setting the salon 's more sensitive pieces of decor , the vases and glass objets d'art , vibrating and humming excitedly along
1	without exchanging a word or a sign , joachim and hans castorp were in complete agreement about this little speech : they found it petulant and unsettlingly seditious—but entertaining as well , of course , indeed edifying in its brazen rebelliousness
1	if , for example , conversation turned to the history of the buddenbrooks , christian could become wrapped up in a mood of high seriousness—which ill became him—and speak with love and admiration of his hometown and his forebears
1	what is this i hear , my good engineer ?
1	and yet it can not be , nor has it ever been denied that the demonic and irrational have a disquieting share in that radiant sphere , that there is always a faint , sinister connection between it and the nether world , and for that very reason those reassuring epithets i sought to attribute to genius- noble , humanely healthy , and harmonious-do not quite fit , not even when ( and it is rather painful for me to make this distinction ) not
1	you could say that
1	i ’ m not going to make rules for you
1	then hans castorp stood there drawing figures on the asphalt with his cane
1	hans castorp labored to climb the steep stairs , helping himself with his hands at times ; sighing heavily to relieve the growing pressure around his heart , he now reached the forest of columns
1	literally , the director said
1	you should call him that sometime , too , just as a joke
1	we all look forward to the moment when we may embrace you once again
1	yes , well , he said with a blush , i read it , too , as you can see , simply because there ’ s nothing else
1	it sits right here , sort of in your stomach—really quite curious
1	a delightful lady , of german heritage , married , a young mother
1	and tomorrow i ’ m going to see gieseke !
1	man is master of his fate
1	and what was an hour , spent for instance lying in rest cure or taking a walk after a meal—which more or less exhausted the possibilities for using up such a unit of time ?
1	his relations with gerda buddenbrook , however , drove him to despair
1	such gushing in cries of absolutely noncommittal amazement was , by the way , also the technique this basically unpleasant man employed in any conversation that went beyond his own horizons as an artist and carnivalist , and he even used it for a while during the exchange i have in mind , which touched on issues of aesthetics and morality
1	i am tormented by the memory of how difficult it was to ring the custodian awake in his ground-floor apartment
1	on holiday afternoons , after partaking of cake and wine , he and his fellow students—in gray-and-green uniforms with stiff collars , striped trousers , and caps—went for a walk in closed formation
1	she fetched a pinch of salt from the dining hall and sprinkled it on prosecutor paravant ’ s head , then took him by the hand , led him to the piano , and held his forefinger to plunk out the beginning of twinkle , twinkle , little star
1	kesperlin being caspar , and thus caspar and samiel are one and the same
1	yes , yes , nature knows her leaf precisely , not just in its perfection , but with all its little everyday blemishes and defects , and she obligingly , mischievously repeats its external appearance in another realm , on the underside of the wings of this butterfly of hers , in order to delude her other creatures
1	a proper man , a gentleman ,
1	there was as yet no consensus
1	i protest , settembrini cried , holding his teacup out at arm ’ s length toward his host
1	one should not deny the humanist his position as an educator—indeed it can not be denied to him , for he alone preserves the tradition of man ’ s dignity and beauty
1	your letter duly received
1	she had always been in awe of his powerful position in the town , of his diligent , sober , stern , and pious competence , had felt more respect than tenderness for him , but during the stormy scene in her salon , he had shown her his human side ; it had touched her and filled her with pride that he had found her worthy of a serious , confidential discussion of the matter , that he had put the decision in her hands , and that he , who had always been so unimpeachable , had admitted almost humbly that he did not feel guiltless in what had happened to her
1	she bent forward to toss the butt of her cigarette into the grate beside her , then sat back and crossed her arms
1	moreover , the league is engaged in founding popular universities , in working to overcome class struggle by every means of social improvement that commends itself for the purpose , and , finally , in eliminating conflict between nations , war itself , by fostering international law
1	but to a far greater extent than down below , there was something inappropriate about the jokes , something to do with chattering teeth and shortness of breath , something that marked such jokes all too clearly as transparent disguises for the anguish hidden beneath them , or rather for the anguish impossible to hide
1	a silent sister , then , is merely a column of mercury without a scale
1	that ’ s a bit much , i must say
1	to be sure , this refreshment of our sense of time extends beyond the interlude ; its effect is noticeable again when we return to our daily routine
1	horrible , he said , visibly shuddering as he stood up
1	she grasped the hands of her grandson , johann , and her great-granddaughter , elisabeth , and strode across the room
1	i ask-and am i asking too much ?
1	but she swore that she had been infected only temporarily , very slightly and superficially , for just a brief time as a young girl
1	shortly after his arrival , evidently feeling somewhat lonely and forlorn , he had in fact requested that i join him in halle , and although
1	he certainly felt that he was part of a different , more restricted society , was anything but a tourist ; and his more recent , broadening perspective had brought with it attenuating duties and a dignity that distanced him from others , so that he was not of a mind to join them in their romps or to roll in the snow like a fool
1	i am glad to see you , even more than usual
1	and he saw giuseppe settembrini—the tricolor in one hand , a swinging saber in the other , black eyes turned heavenward to seal his vow—at the head of a troop of revolutionaries storming the phalanx of despotism
1	and as hans castorp thought about it , he closed his eyes tight and shook his head cautiously , which could just as easily have been taken as an expression of admiration for giuseppe settembrini as of dismay and rejection
1	which is a good thing , by the way—one can live with that
1	and women showed a general tendency to kneel beside nepomuk
1	time is what is real , the best we give , and our gift is the hour-glass-indeed
1	he sees things from a very peculiar angle , doesn ’ t he ?
1	they had all pulled back in shock
1	and the young man laughed and looked again at tony ’ s plate—and blushed
1	suppose he has eclipsed me in business and successfully opposed me now and then in public affairs—that ’ s perfectly fine
1	not at all , lebrecht kröger replied sternly
1	hans castorp asked sternly
1	i never would have thought that i could fail so miserably at being some help to you , tom
1	illness and despair , settembrini said , are often only forms of depravity
1	indeed , inasmuch as these refinements are meant to intoxicate or excite us—are stimulants , as they say—they support and enhance the intensity of feelings , which means , then , that their purpose and goal are life itself , a love of feeling , are inadequacy ’ s way of striving for feeling
1	no , i ’ m not , tom
1	and my name is fairly frequent among their children , and your mama ’ s name , too
1	yes , just him , joachim said , obviously preoccupied
1	but music and speech , he insisted , belonged together , were ultimately one-language was music , music a language ; when separated , each always stood in reference to the other , imitated the other , made use of the other 's methods , always insinuated that it was the substitute for the other
1	by heart myself , and only because i once-or might it have been several times ? -heard them recited in his little voice with its marvelous accents
1	ruses and only by stages , by way of the oddest transitions , arrive at the richest vocal music ; choruses , that is , that move through all the shades of graduated whispering , antiphonal speech , and quasi-chant on up to the most polyphonic song-accompanied by sounds that begin as simple noise , as magical , fanatical african drums and booming gongs , only to attain the highest music
1	her dark eyes were inert ; she seemed frozen with grief and the fear of god
1	hans castorp had been offended by joachim ’ s rather ! —it had sounded so impertinent , or at least oddly indifferent under the circumstances
1	but from its outcome , which he now found displayed before him in the dining room , he gathered that his grandfather had now received solemn dispensation from his interim stage and had finally returned to the form appropriate to him—an event of which he could only approve , though old fiete wept and constantly shook his head , even though hans castorp himself wept , just as he had wept at the sight of his unexpectedly deceased mother and , a short time later , of his father lying there equally serene and strange
1	but for some reason , whether it was from an excess of delight or the pure love of hearing herself talk , tony stubbornly insisted that gerda had always hated her , whereas she , for her part—and her eyes would fill with tears—had always repaid that hate with love
1	and go his stiff-kneed way
1	but the events on the far side of the wall were even more audible from his room
1	afterward he spent a great deal of time in the leipzig library , copying out carissimi 's ] ephta and schutz 's psalms of david
1	i could not hide from myself my joy that his intentions would mean release from his elfin bond to schwerdtfeger , and indeed i was inclined to see them as a conscious means to accomplish that
1	thomas buddenbrook left his office and hurried up the stairs
1	you are , on the whole , an impertinent person , god knows why
1	shall i admit that i , very privately and apart from any historical aspect , felt deeply , intimately , personally ashamed of the fact ?
1	for this was now the third time within so few months and at such a young age that little hans castorp ’ s mind and senses had been affected by death—his senses in particular
1	she had been accepted by the johannis cloister
1	that was not for him , he required sensible barometric pressure or he would have another attack
1	so i can have them right away !
1	it seems to me , however , that you should have told me about that before class , instead of waiting until i called on you
1	people were laughing as if they agreed with me
1	people thought that thomas buddenbrook looked , as they said , rather tumbledown
1	serves you right , hans castorp thought with distaste
1	he was gaunt and pale
1	he had a strange bumpy head and his blond hair was pasted to it like smooth , shiny glass ; there were black rings around his gray eyes , and his long , brown hands stuck out from under coat sleeves that were too short but always brushed and spotless
1	julie möllendorpf , née hagenström , never greets me
1	what do you want to bet that our exotic on guard duty in there—who just happened to don his best for tonight—could tell us exactly what ’ s what ?
1	he kept his eyelids lowered , so that his long , brown lashes fell across the bluish shadows around his eyes , and he held his tight-closed lips a little askew
1	world , in contrast to the wide and mighty german reich with its
1	it sucked hungrily at its last sweet drops with almost cynical despair , with a deliberate willing of bliss and doom , and it fell away in exhaustion , revulsion , and surfeit , until finally , finally , in the languor that followed , all its excesses trickled off in a long , soft arpeggio in the minor , modulated up one key , resolved to the major , hesitated , and died a wistful death
1	fräulein severin , i say , i want the keys
1	i scarcely need mention that the beginnings of the developments mentioned here were very remote { rom adrian ; he paid them hardly any notice and was directed toward them to some extent only by me , whose inherent social curiosity-or should i say , human sympathy-was greater than his
1	anyone who would claim that such scruples are detrimental to love surely understands absolutely nothing about love
1	he ’ s a tall , broad-shouldered man , to be sure , and likes to stand with his legs set wide apart , his hands buried in his trouser pockets—i couldn ’ t help noticing they ’ re sewn in vertically , instead of on the slant the way yours and mine are , the way pockets generally are in the better classes
1	now , justus is a very charming fellow , but not exactly a good businessman , and he has also had some setbacks that were not his fault
1	so then , fine , i ’ ll accept your term
1	it slid down now with a low rumble
1	next to him on a chair was a tray with coffee things and on his nightstand , amid glasses of medicine , was a half-empty bottle of wine—the simple , sparkling swiss red of the night before
1	and thomas , who was well versed in such tasks , ran off and returned with two very dusty and cobwebbed bottles
1	across the way , a little distance up the hill , was the walled cemetery of davos-dorf—and joachim pointed it out as well with his walking stick
1	the other way round : the special occurrence assumes an air as if it were identical with the preexisting , familiar formula
1	one can imagine my amazement !
1	frau permaneder paid extraordinarily close attention , and the moment any doubt arose as to the future owner of a given object , she would say in her inimitable fashion , well , i ’ d be willing to take it , and look as if the whole world should thank her for such self-sacrifice
1	a few days later , after a stay of three weeks , we had to extricate ourselves again and begin the trip home to germany , while for several months , well into autumn , they remained faithful to the idyllic regularity of their existence , with its cloister garden , family table , campagna rimmed with sleek gold , stony living room , and evenings of reading by lamplight
1	he fell silent and a restless , earnest look passed over his face ; he rubbed his hand across his bald head and then down his whole left side
1	i like to think back to the chaldeans when i ’ m lying there watching the planets , the ones they already knew about , because they didn ’ t know them all , clever as they were
1	there was a new sport , hans castorp learned , an invention from the north called skijoring , a race in which contestants on skis were pulled by horses
1	a few stout maids and even a waiter in a greasy frock coat were marching at high speed across the lawn , bearing cold plates , lemonade , milk , and beer up to the tables , several of which were already occupied by scattered families with their children
1	even naphta let it be known through his second , wehsal , that this was his opinion , too—and hans castorp said all right
1	at this point she offered her guests coffee and pound cake , but schildknapp and adrian said that they would rather use the time left them to have a look at the house and courtyard , if she would be so kind as to show them
1	for inventing melodic lines whose notes could be set one above the other and , when played simultaneously , folded up into complicated harmonies-and , vice versa , of establishing chords made up of many notes that could be spread out horizontally into melodies
1	it was very good and , despite a threadbare outfit that his finances dictated always remain the same , he looked the elegant and sporty gentleman
1	i repeat : how could one possibly manage without it ?
1	if abdul hamid falls , that ’ s the end of your influence in turkey , and england will set itself up as protector
1	its work is terror , that the world may be saved and the ultimate goal of redemption be achieved : the children of god living in a world without classes or laws
1	for god 's sake , what 's the problem ?
1	october began as new months are wont to do—their beginnings are perfectly modest and hushed , with no outward signs , no birthmarks
1	but here he was again now !
1	i ’ m standing here with my eyes closed and feeling pleasantly drowsy
1	or just one or two trunks ?
1	what made you be so malicious ?
1	oh , fine , tony said , now what has she smashed to smithereens ?
1	the cousins had arisen earlier than usual in order to honor the morning by extending their constitutional a little beyond its normal limits and continuing along the forest path beyond the bench beside the water trough
1	he was alone , and as he lay there quietly enjoying the beneficial effects of the bicarbonate , he closed his eyes and saw again the dining room full of gifts , glowing in all its brilliance
1	and so all our measurements are merely conventions , if you please
1	perhaps she would follow the path laid out for her and marry herr grünlich , she didn ’ t care one way or the other
1	we italians followed his example
1	i had left him behind then within the familiar framework of
1	and kai knew he would have felt exactly the same in hanno ’ s shoes
1	the a , which demands a resolution to g-sharp , yielding the modulation from b major to a major , led him on until he came by way of a , d , and g major , to c major , and from there into the flatted keys , thus demonstrating for me that one can build a major or minor scale by using any of the twelve tones of the chromatic scale
1	not when i ’ m ordered to do so , settembrini replied
1	no doubt of it—thomas buddenbrook ’ s existence was no different from that of an actor , but one whose whole life has become a single production , down to the smallest , most workaday detail—a production that , apart from a few brief hours each day , constantly engaged and devoured all his energies
1	music , nature , and cheerful devotion , those were closely related and prescribed ideas in the winfried fraternity , and when i spoke of the sons of the muses , the phrase , which to some perhaps might not seem to apply to theology students , had its justification in that combination of attitudes , in that spirit of unconstrained piety and bright-eyed regard for the beautiful that likewise characterized our hikes into nature-and i now return to them
1	to which was added , as noted , practical reasons having to do with my own studies
1	two ladies from the lower common lounging area , frau redisch , the wife of a polish industrialist , and a certain widow hessenfeld from berlin , both of them recent october arrivals , became involved in a rather unedifying scene after supper ; indeed they came to blows and one of them began screaming hysterically ( it might have been redisch , but could just as easily have been hessenfeld ) , and finally , simply sick with rage , had to be taken to her room—all because each claimed she was first in line for the book
1	she was even on friendly , indeed intimate footing with frau knoterich , natalia of the exotically spanish look , despite the fact that it was reputed ( and probably rightly so ) that this quite charming woman was addicted to morphine-a rumor confirmed by personal observation of her engaging , bright-eyed volubility at the beginning of a party and occasional disappearances to refresh her gradually waning high spirits
1	far more useful , rather , were irony , mockery , which cleared the air by opposing romanticism , pathos , and prophecy , and joining literature and the intoxication of sound in a common front with what is objective and elemental-which is to say , with the rediscovery of music itself as organization of time
1	besides , hans castorp said , if i had spoken to you before this , i would have had to use the formal pronoun
1	there are thermometers for sale here everywhere , in almost any shop
1	are you cured , then ?
1	a party of guests of both sexes was coming toward him—he had noticed them moving along a level stretch of path about halfway up the slope , and now they were tramping downhill , moving directly toward him , and he could hear the babble of voices
1	he is the very feeling of god
1	and when the poor , dear child tumbles to his ruin , she takes him back to her bosom , forgiving him everything and with no other thought than that he would have done better never to have left
1	do you believe religiosity is a peculiarly german talent ?
1	in the evening he would study the stars
1	borne upon pinions , we bombarded many more villages
1	he was constantly improving his knowledge of languages ; recently , purely for scientific purposes and without any practical effect , he had attempted to learn chinese—had worked very diligently at it for two weeks
1	nothing—nothing he could put a name to
1	the rich lilac of her gown matched her heavy , dark chestnut hair in some very odd way and made her lusterless complexion look paler than ever ; even the bluish shadows seemed deeper and darker in the corners of her close-set brown eyes
1	this attribute definitely demanded , to god 's glory , that it be put into practice and could not have been revealed had god not consigned his creature to sin
1	otherwise one quickly finds oneself regarded as an unhappy loner and is held in less esteem
1	as he ascended the stairs his eyes bounced shyly in all directions , looking for his boss , and when he at last discovered him at the far end of the staircase , he worked his way back through the obstructing crowd , muttering hasty apologies as he went
1	wehsal had set his jaw askew
1	all too soon , he had grown quiet again , perhaps quieter than before
1	we have no more business to discuss , really , i am as good as on my way , have the doorknob in hand-we have been on our feet for a while now , and still i prattle on merely pour prendre conge
1	do not presume that you can conceive of much of anything on your own , but rather attempt to receive and ponder
1	yes , the last few days have been exhausting
1	his pink face was incapable of turning totally pale
1	management was on the ground floor : after crossing the lobby and following the hallway past the cloakroom , kitchen , and housekeeping , you could not miss it , especially given the porcelain sign on the door
1	you bother me , he heard himself saying quite clearly
1	the courage of self-recognition and expression—that is literature , that is humanity
1	pulling aside the portieres , she entered from the living room and gently bade frau iwersen to come nearer—and only then did she risk moving out a little farther across the parquet floor
1	along with the results of the director ’ s examination , this meant that honor-loving joachim would have to stay with his little extra therapy before he could rush off to the colors again
1	ah , it is probably more than a mere question that for that very reason this defeated nation now stands wild-eyed before the abyss , because its final and most extreme attempt to find its own political form is perishing in such ghastly failure
1	he was not interested in escapades , he would proceed in moderation
1	and a great deal more happens yet before it comes to an end
1	and it probably wasn ’ t in fact , because it left his head feeling just as hot as before , as if he were sitting in an overheated room or had drunk too much wine
1	yet it makes a good point , for it indicates an elevation of state that both music and musicians owe to romanticism
1	the band of poor , who had always gathered on meng strasse to receive shoes and woolens , was missing , and there were no carols by choirboys
1	it sealed his doom—he would be held back at easter
1	hans castorp stood there piously for a while , using the time to take in the situation , hesitating to change his pose , waiting for the widow to address him
1	but her little brown eyes were as loyal , bright , and alert as ever
1	he knew only one , dreadfully tedious topic of conversation : the ratio pi , that forlorn fraction , which a lesser genius of mental arithmetic named zacharias dase had once worked out to two hundred decimal places—a superfluous task , since even at two thousand places he would have had no greater prospect of approaching unattainable accuracy , indeed would not have been one whit closer to it
1	he sat there with his mouth closed , his hands folded in his lap , one check-trousered leg crossed over the other , and he gazed sternly at his foot swinging gently in the air
1	she sat bent over , almost drawn up into a crouch , and didn ’ t even notice when a warm drop fell on her hands , lying limp in her lap
1	good lord , the dregs !
1	someone tell me—am i hearing right ?
1	that little limping devil up front already handed me my paltry correspondence , settembrini said , shoving a hand down into the side pocket of his ineluctable petersham coat
1	declared it spontaneously to his parents at buche ! , whose reaction was even more favorable , and he had already informed me some time before , though implying that he saw these studies not as a preparation for practical pastoral service in the church , but for an academic career
1	adieu , my carnival prince !
1	but with this final and conclusive action by the consul , herr kesselmeyer ’ s good cheer returned—indeed , it grew more intense and dreadful , until it burst all bounds
1	meme pour un homme gate , endurci comme moi , c'est toujours une experience touchante de rencontrer un grand homme-enchante , monsieur le professeur , he added in passing and , since adrian had introduced me , casually offered me his hand , only to turn immediately back to the proper party
1	unfortunately , it does indeed look as if things are about to take this or that course
1	and i mention it now , thomas , as you can well hear , because i plan to marry her
1	the day after the celebrissimo ’ s arrival , the patient had died
1	i am deeply obliged to you , madame buddenbrook , he said , his expression underscoring how touched he was
1	there was a sudden surge in the tumult outside—the revolution had reached the windows of the assembly hall
1	the harbor pilot entered his office with the bearing of a man satisfied with the hearty lunch he has just eaten
1	a little squab , a little french bread …
1	but one can always pull oneself together again
1	the director himself hardly bothers to conceal the fact , not even for appearance ’ sake
1	leipzig , which plays such a significant role in leverkiihn 's evolution , in the tragedy of his life , has recently borne the full impact : its famous publishing district is , i sadly hear , only a heap of rubble and an immeasurable wealth of literary and educational material is now the spoil of destruction-a heavy loss not only for us germans , but also for a whole world that cares about culture
1	when he did appear in pfeiffering , for he came by now and again all the same , he would wear a flannel body wrap , and sometimes even a moist throat compress wrapped in gutta-percha-a source of bitter comedy and anglo-saxon jokes for him and of amusement for adrian , who could rise above his physical torments to find liberation in jests and laughter with no one else so well as with riidiger
1	an embroidered green runner ran across the snow-white cloth of woven damask spread over the round table , which was set with gold-rimmed porcelain of such transparency that here and there it shimmered like mother-of-pearl
1	isn ’ t it rather shabby of us to speak about him this way ?
1	only a very few people had paid attention to his meddling , but frau chauchat had felt the benefit at once and turned around—and held that pose until hans castorp had reached his chair again
1	but behrens would probably make an exception and give you permission if you made it a point to ask
1	there were blizzards that prevented you from staying out on the balcony , when the wind drove great masses of white before it , covering the floor , furniture , everything , with a thick layer of snow
1	mirth can not move a soul in agony
1	the soft red glow of winter twilight shone through the window and fell on the muddy clothes draped over a chair in one corner of the room
1	moreover , she declared her outrage that the boss was not sitting at their table again today
1	is it not like a cleansing bath for the soul ?
1	he asked as they descended the stairs
1	also in the room , besides frau schweigestill who was constantly moving to and fro , was frizzy-haired kunigunde rosenstiel , who , on one of the visits allowed her , had made the boy 's acquaintance and passionately taken him to her melancholy heart
1	you are sure to be thinking that what i have in mind is your fierce discipline , et que vous enchainez votre art dans un systeme de regles inexorables et neoclassiques , that you force your art to move in those iron chains-if not with grace , then with intelligence and boldness
1	but no matter—all the better !
1	was it because he had turned the air blue and she did not really believe him—or that she did believe him , as she surely must , but found the state of hovering between life and death too funny for words ?
1	or , you will find out soon enough as always , my good man !
1	he would have to be content with 'german , with wouldeutsch'-and would be giving himself a jewish name , oh , ia , ia !
1	whatever has stature can not be called vice
1	i am a free man—i am my own master
1	and we old folks are heartless scoffers
1	i ’ m often embarrassed for him here—yes , i ’ ll admit it openly to you , ida
1	oh yes , that was the question , had always been the right question , for as long as he could remember
1	the latest achievement , children , top-notch , a- , nothing better in the warehouse
1	she cried , returning home from a walk with a red face and tossing her hat on the sofa in the landscape room
1	it was quite consistent with her viewpoint for her to say that her suitor was wrong about this and every similar question
1	tom pulled one of her hands away and took it in his own
1	madame buddenbrook had gone out , and tony was sitting alone , reading , at the window in the landscape room , when anton presented her with a calling card
1	you arrived at the last moment , joachim said
1	not in vain does he wink so audaciously and craftly with his eyes , and not in vain does inez rodde call him an underhand sneak
1	facing the door were two rows of soldiers , rifles resting at their sides ; lieutenant von throta stood at the head of the company , his drawn sword held in his arm , his glowing eyes fixed on the bay window upstairs
1	is areally ' not what works , and truth not experience and feeling ?
1	as long as one spoke of living entities , any discussion of elemental units was dishonest , because the concept of an entity carried with it , ad infinitum , the concept of the subordinate , organizing unit
1	just right , hans castorp thought , not one word too many , and yet it takes care of things for a while , no matter what
1	she raised her arms , let them fall again , and then slid to her knees beside her mother , hiding her head in the folds of the old woman ’ s skirt and sobbing bitterly
1	he was an exotic and attractive character among the bourgeois inhabitants of the old commercial town
1	no , permit me to say it—weak
1	in freising it meant that my senior students ' faces were flushed , their eyes beaming
1	fourteen days had passed , and hanno told himself and anyone else who would listen that there was still plenty of time left , as much time as the holidays at michaelmas
1	i mean … and he grew quite agitated trying to express himself , to explain
1	hans castorp cried , availing himself in his eagerness of herr settembrini ’ s favorite expression of approval
1	he held the instrument close to his eyes , turned it back and forth—and could make out nothing
1	he pulled on his thick wool winter coat , donned his hat , grabbed his satchel , blew out the candle , stormed downstairs to the ground floor , and , passing the stuffed bear , turned right to enter the dining room
1	but come on , let ’ s have a look at your room , and you can wash up
1	nature all spookily scattered about , with the sweet purity of the last ,
1	but you look so flushed that i ’ m afraid we ’ ve seen the end of your lowered temperature
1	and so kretzschmar lived in the selfevident , unuttered conviction that music had found its ultimate , highest manifestation and efficacy in orchestral works-something adrian no longer believed
1	this was the word he used , not explicitly , not by forming the syllables in his mind , but as something he felt in its most comprehensive sense , in the sense in which he had learned to understand it during his stay here—though that was a sense that had little to do with the meaning settembrini attached to the word
1	they were led back from their aberrations to reason , usefulness , and progress , to the battle against prince and priest—in short , to social happiness
1	yes , like him—or not quite like him , either
1	the entire work had been denounced as murky to the point of unpalatability , and for at least twenty bars , they had claimed , such scandalous confusion reigned-primarily the result of excessively colored modulations-that after that one could calmly close the file on the man 's incompetence in this strict style
1	and if you had picked up on it , i would have been very proud to have been the middleman , because you know it ’ s always been my dream , my fondest hope , to be of some use to the family name
1	foul , rancid sin i did prefer ,
1	but all the same , he took the elevator up with joachim and several other patients
1	so far so good , kretzschmar said
1	when she finished , she let the newspaper sink to her lap and leaned back to gaze at her brother and sister-in-law with uncomprehending , mournful eyes
1	in the next second , she flung her arms wide , and then—so abruptly , so instantaneously that both what she had heard and her answer seemed almost simultaneous—she cried out in the most absolute obedience , with boundless , fearful , loving submission and surrender , here i am !
1	if he had been able to believe at the foundations of his soul ( there where he himself did not know what was what ) that work has unconditional value , is a principle that answers its own question , might not both body and mind—first his mind , and through it , his body—have been more amenable to work and exhibited more stamina ?
1	thomas shouted , stopping in his tracks and crossing his arms on his chest
1	after having been treated by joachim so coolly—indeed , hans castorp sensed something of a gentle hostility in good joachim ’ s attitude toward their fellow patient , a hostility that made him smile despite his own inner turmoil—clavdia tried pacing the room ; but there was not enough space for that , and so she , too , picked up a magazine from the table and returned to her round chair with its rudimentary arms
1	we would have liked to say that the hot and very tasty coffee warmed our five friends and gave rise to elevated conversation
1	i ’ ll go up to her
1	but since all reactions and reflexes , by their very nature , serve some purpose , we physiologists are almost forced to conclude that such secondary phenomena due to psychological factors are actually meant to protect the body , are defense mechanisms , much like goose bumps
1	i mean—what about the house ?
1	had his mind been less muddled , he would have had to admit that in terms of getting back home this was perhaps the worst thing he could have done ; and indeed he told himself as much after he had taken a few sips , which produced an immediate effect , much the same effect as that caused by kulmbach beer his first evening up here , when with a lot of loose , disreputable talk about fish sauces and the like he had offended settembrini—herr lodovico , the pedagogue , who could keep madmen from letting themselves go , return them to reason with just a glance , and whose melodious little horn hans castorp now heard in the air around him , the signal that his oratorical teacher was now approaching at a forced march to free his troublesome pupil , life ’ s problem child , from his mad situation and lead him home
1	the conductor had motioned for the orchestra to rise so that along with him it could receive the audience 's thanks for their beautiful work
1	it was most assuredly what people called a coup , wasn ’ t it ?
1	oh , i worry constantly that the climate there may be bad for him
1	she asked coquettishly ; and her fiery femininity triumphed over the eczema covering half her face
1	good lord , it was all just as it had been before
1	indeed , the question of his life , his very being and becoming , ultimately interested me more than that of my own , which was simple enough , requiring me to give it little thought , but merely to work diligently to create conditions for its predetermined solution
1	for a long time i didn ’ t think it possible i would ever find the right woman
1	for its own sweet , simple sake , we must totally and fully—oh , and with our highest and most perceptive—settled , ladies and gentlemen !
1	should i sell or do you think the price will go back up ?
1	they all stood together on the gravel path in front of the huge grave cover with the family crest chiseled into the stone and surrounded by the names of those who rested there ; rising behind it was a marble cross silhouetted against the little woods , leafless now in winter
1	but on all sides there were people willing to help him get through them ; the general regard in which his orderly demeanor was held manifested itself in visits from near and far
1	free notes would no longer exist
1	please , have a seat
1	i would suggest you consult a doctor
1	it was , rather , that all these effects could be traced to the influence of one masterful nature among those present , to the personality among them , to mynheer peeperkorn , who held the reins in his grandly gesticulating hands and bound them all to the spell of the hour with the drama of his countenance , with pale eyes gazing out from under the monumental creases of his brow , with words and compelling pantomime
1	and to express this one , if we must , the only thing to say , as bluntly as possible , is that pieter peeperkorn—with his regal mask , his high , creased brow , his poignantly ragged lips—was both at the same time
1	and in the environs where we now find ourselves , such would be the case even less than elsewhere
1	then she fell silent for a moment and let her arms drop ; her mouth widened , her chin puckered up and began to quiver , and as two large tears welled up under her lowered eyelashes , she added very softly , what about me ?
1	lebrecht kröger took charge of the carving
1	there were certificates of citizenship , with the crest and seal of the free hanseatic city , insurance policies , poems of congratulation , and requests to serve as a godparent
1	he then spread out the contents of the basket on a tablecloth laid at their feet : a coffee service and glasses , thermos bottles , pastries , and wine
1	i am by now the only one who still preserves it !
1	a difference in temperament , herr settembrini
1	and that is over
1	the veiled lady should have known all along
1	the visit we have described here was the cousins ’ first with naphta
1	it was eleven-thirty now ; all the hotel guests must already have gone to the beach
1	do you care to recall the incident ?
1	his long lashes could not hide the bluish shadows brooding in the corners of his eyes
1	when i think that you ’ ve had the privilege of living your life here all these years …
1	and when father leverkiihn would ask us what we thought they were , and we hesitantly answered that
1	they walked along the rows of tables , the director dispensing a casual , witty remark to almost everyone , so that a wake of mirth rippled behind him
1	thank god , because that meant hanno was probably safe now
1	people usually judged him wrongly-he would much rather have a serious , elevating , and beneficial conversation with a man like that than to be lying next to some woman
1	ah , so here you are—well , speak up and answer me !
1	monk , the venerable bede , a work in which a goodly portion of celtic fantasies about the next world and the visionary experiences from the early years of irish and anglo-saxon christianity have been handed down
1	we , too , would often accompany them up to this rather haphazard garden of spice-laden shade set within a crumbling wall and discreetly leaving them to their work , spend the increasingly hot morning to ourselves behind a screen of oleander , laurel , and broom , invisible to them both , just as they were invisible to one another-helene with her crocheting and i with a book , content and alertly mindful that nearby adrian was making progress on his opera
1	would return to kaisersaschern , the young student of divine sciences saw his high-school musical mentor , visited him , and conferred with him in the organist 's apartment near the cathedral , saw him at his uncle leverkiihn 's home as well , and once or twice prevailed on his parents to invite him for a weekend at buche !
1	why are you standing there ?
1	they ’ ll be quiet this evening , at least i certainly expect them to be
1	in its never-resting concern for its guests , a thoughtful management had decided to add another amusing gadget to the collection in the main social room—purchased at a price we do not care to estimate , but that must have been considerable , a handsome disbursement on the part of the administration of this highly recommended institution
1	let me try to describe it precisely
1	so let us go inside , he declared and took nepomuk 's hand again to lead him
1	all those other ingredients are not very stable without life
1	his gray hair was combed down over his brow for sinister effect
1	he spoke with the consul about business and politics , propounding some very serious and germane principles ; he chatted with the consul ’ s wife about fashions , balls , and the theater ; he had kind words for tom , christian , and poor klothilde , even for little clara and mamselle jungmann
1	and here ’ s our afternoon snack—
1	the young people said their good-byes , likewise expressing their thanks , and were in turn encouraged to come again
1	i intend to hold that principle sacred to the end of my days , although now and then one may entertain doubts when confronted with people who apparently have better success without such principles
1	i can predict that you ’ ll see a nasty rise in your fever chart this evening
1	just look where such impudence got you !
1	a ia bonne heure
1	might i presume to inquire as to the state of your health ?
1	good ash—what brand of lovely brunette is she ?
1	it is an organ that merely wards off danger , sends up signals , though it does keep a damned good eye out for anything that gets too near the body
1	yes , yes , they would probably have to fight ; that way matters might at least be salvaged by chivalrous rules that moderated the primal state
1	let no one tell me nothing is being communicated here !
1	i ’ ll just wait for my d ’ gods ’ comrade , he ’ ll be here any moment , since it ’ s already half past three , i notice
