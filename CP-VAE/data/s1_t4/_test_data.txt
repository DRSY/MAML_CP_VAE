from hamburg to davos is a long journey—too long , indeed , for so brief a stay .
it crosses all sorts of country ; goes up hill and down dale , descends from the plateau of southern germany to the shore of lake constance , over its bounding waves and on across marshes once thought to be bottomless .
at this point the route , which has been so far over trunk-lines , gets cut up .
there are stops and formalities .
at rorschach , in swiss territory , you take train again , but only as far as landquart , a small alpine station , where you have to change .
here , after a long and windy wait in a spot devoid of charm , you mount a narrow-gauge train ; and as the small but very powerful engine gets under way , there begins the thrilling part of the journey , a steep and steady climb that seems never to come to an end .
for the station of landquart lies at a relatively low altitude , but now the wild and rocky route pushes grimly onward into the alps themselves .
hans castorp—such was the young man ’ s name—sat alone in his little greyupholstered compartment , with his alligator-skin hand-bag , a present from his uncle and guardian , consul tienappel—let us get the introductions over with at once—his travelling-rug , and his winter overcoat swinging on its hook .
the window was down , the afternoon grew cool , and he , a tender product of the sheltered life , had turned up the collar of his fashionably cut , silk-lined summer overcoat .
near him on the seat lay a paper-bound volume entitled ocean steamships ; earlier in the journey he had studied it off and on , but now it lay neglected , and the breath of the panting engine , streaming in , defiled its cover with particles of soot .
two days ’ travel separated the youth—he was still too young to have thrust his roots down firmly into life—from his own world , from all that he thought of as his own duties , interests , cares and prospects ; far more than he had dreamed it would when he sat in the carriage on the way to the station . space , rolling and revolving between him and his native heath , possessed and wielded the powers we generally ascribe to time . from hour to hour it worked changes in him , like to those wrought by time , yet in a way even more striking .
space , like time , engenders forgetfulness ; but it does so by setting us bodily free from our surroundings and giving us back our primitive , unattached state . yes , it can even , in the twinkling of an eye , make something like a vagabond of the pedant and philistine . time , we say , is lethe ; but change of air is a similar draught , and , if it works less thoroughly , does so more quickly .
such was the experience of young hans castorp . he had not meant to take the journey seriously or commit himself deeply to it ; but to get it over quickly , since it had to be made , to return as he had gone , and to take up his life at the point where , for the moment , he had had to lay it down .
only yesterday he had been encompassed in the wonted circle of his thoughts , and entirely taken up by two matters : the examination he had just passed , and his approaching entrance into the firm of tunder and wilms , shipbuilders , smelters , and machinists . with as much impatience as lay in his temperament to feel , he had discounted the next three weeks ; but now it began to seem as though present circumstances required his entire attention , that it would not be at all the thing to take them too lightly .
this being carried upward into regions where he had never before drawn breath , and where he knew that unusual living conditions prevailed , such as could only be described as sparse or scanty—it began to work upon him , to fill him with a certain concern . home and regular living lay not only far behind , they lay fathoms deep beneath him , and he continued to mount above them .
poised between them and the unknown , he asked himself how he was going to fare .
perhaps it had been ill-advised of him , born as he was a few feet above sea-level , to come immediately to these great heights , without stopping at least a day or so at some point in between . he wished he were at the end of his journey ; for once there he could begin to live as he would anywhere else , and not be reminded by this continual climbing of the incongruous situation he found himself in .
the train wound in curves along the narrow pass ; he could see the front carriages and the labouring engine vomiting great masses of brown , black , and greenish smoke that floated away .
water roared in the abysses on the right ; on the left , among rocks , dark fir-trees aspired toward a stonegrey sky .
the train passed through pitch-black tunnels , and when daylight came again it showed wide chasms , with villages nestled in their depths .
then the pass closed in again ; they wound along narrow defiles , with traces of snow in chinks and crannies . there were halts at wretched little shanties of stations ; also at more important ones , which the train left in the opposite direction , making one lose the points of the compass . a magnificent succession of vistas opened before the awed eye , of the solemn , phantasmagorical world of towering peaks , into which their route wove and wormed itself : vistas that appeared and disappeared with each new winding of the path .
hans castorp reflected that they must have got above the zone of shade-trees , also probably of song-birds ; whereupon he felt such a sense of the impoverishment of life as gave him a slight attack of giddiness and nausea and made him put his hand over his eyes for a few seconds . he perceived that they had stopped climbing .
the top of the col was reached ; the train rolled smoothly along the level valley floor .
it was about eight o ’ clock , and still daylight .
a lake was visible in the distant landscape , its waters grey , its shores covered with black fir-forests that climbed the surrounding heights , thinned out , and gave place to bare , mist-wreathed rock . they stopped at a small station .
hans castorp heard the name called out : it was davosdorf . soon he would be at his journey ’ s end . and suddenly , close to him , he heard a voice , the comfortable hamburg voice of his cousin , joachim ziemssen , saying : hullo , there you are !
here ’ s where you get out !
and peering through the window saw his cousin himself , standing below on the platform , in a brown ulster , bareheaded , and looking more robust than ever in his life before .
he laughed and said again : come along out , it ’ s all right !
but i ’ m not there yet ! said hans castorp , taken aback , and still seated .
it is nearer to the sanatorium from here . i have a carriage .
just give us your things . and laughing , confused , in the excitement of arrival and meeting , hans castorp reached bag , overcoat , the roll with stick and umbrella , and finally ocean steamships out of the window .
then he ran down the narrow corridor and sprang out upon the platform to greet his cousin properly . the meeting took place without exuberance , as between people of traditional coolness and reserve . strange to say , the cousins had always avoided calling each other by their first names , simply because they were afraid of showing too much feeling .
a man in livery with a braided cap looked on while they shook hands , quickly , not without embarrassment , young ziemssen in military position , heels together . then he came forward to ask for hans castorp ’ s luggage ticket ; he was the concierge of the international sanatorium berghof , and would fetch the guest ’ s large trunk from the other station while the gentlemen drove directly up to supper . this man limped noticeably ; and so , curiously enough , the first thing hans castorp said to his cousin was : is that a war veteran ?
he ’ s got it in his knee—or , rather , he had it—the knee-pan has been removed .
hans castorp bethought himself hastily .
so that ’ s it ? he said , and as he walked on turned his head and gave a quick glance back . but you can ’ t make me believe you ’ ve still got anything like that the matter with you !
joachim was taller and broader than he , a picture of youthful vigour , and made for a uniform .
he was of the very dark type which his blond-peopled country not seldom produces , and his already nut-brown skin was tanned almost to bronze .
with his large , black eyes and small , dark moustache over the full , well-shaped mouth , he would have been distinctly handsome if his ears had not stood out .
up to a certain period they had been his only trouble in life .
now , however , he had others .
hans castorp went on : you ’ re coming back down with me , aren ’ t you ?
back down with you ?
asked his cousin , and turned his large eyes full upon him . they had always been gentle , but in these five months they had taken on a tired ,
why , in three weeks .
oh , yes , you are already on the way back home , in your thoughts , answered joachim .
you ’ ve only just come .
three weeks are nothing at all , to us up here—they look like a lot of time to you , because you are only up here on a visit , and three weeks is all you have .
get acclimatized first—it isn ’ t so easy , you ’ ll see .
and the climate isn ’ t the only queer thing about us .
about me—it isn ’ t such smooth sailing as you think , you with your going home in three weeks . that ’ s the class of ideas you have down below .
yes , i am brown , i know , but it is mostly snow-burning . it doesn ’ t mean much , as behrens always says ; he told me at the last regular examination it would take another half year , pretty certainly .
they had climbed into the yellow cabriolet that stood in the stone-paved square in front of the shed-like station , and as the pair of brown horses started up , he flounced indignantly on the hard cushions . you ’ ve been up here half a year already ! who ’ s got so much time to spend—
said joachim , and nodded repeatedly , straight in front of him , paying his cousin ’ s honest indignation no heed . they make pretty free with a human being ’ s idea of time , up here . you wouldn ’ t believe it .
three weeks are just like a day to them .
you ’ ll learn all about it , he said , and added : one ’ s ideas get changed .
hans castorp regarded him earnestly as they drove .
but seems to me you ’ ve made a splendid recovery , he said , shaking his head .
you really think so , don ’ t you ? answered joachim ; i think i have too .
he drew himself up straighter against the cushions , but immediately relaxed again .
yes , i am better , he explained , but i am not cured yet .
in the left lobe , where there were rales , it only sounds harsh now , and that is not so bad ; but lower down it is still very harsh , and there are rhonchi in the second intercostal space .
how learned you ’ ve got , said hans castorp .
fine sort of learning !
god knows i wish i ’ d had it sweated out of my system in the service , responded joachim .
but i still have sputum , he said , with a shoulder-shrug that was somehow indifferent and vehement both at once , and became him but ill. he half pulled out and showed to his cousin something he carried in the side pocket of his overcoat , next to hans castorp . it was a flat , curving bottle of bluish glass , with a metal cap .
most of us up here carry it , he said , shoving it back .
it even has a nickname ; they make quite a joke of it .
you are looking at the landscape ?
they had driven for a space straight up the axis of the valley , along an irregularly built street that followed the line of the railway ; then , turning to the left , they crossed the narrow tracks and a watercourse , and now trotted up a high-road that mounted gently toward the wooded slopes . before them rose a low , projecting , meadow-like plateau , on which , facing south-west , stood a long building , with a cupola and so many balconies that from a distance it looked porous , like a sponge . in this building lights were beginning to show .
it was rapidly growing dusk .
the faint rose-colour that had briefly enlivened the overcast heavens was faded now , and there reigned the colourless , soulless , melancholy transition-period that comes just before the onset of night . the populous valley , extended and rather winding , now began to show lights everywhere , not only in the middle , but here and there on the slopes at either hand , particularly on the projecting right side , upon which buildings mounted in terrace formation . paths ran up the sloping meadows to the left and lost themselves in the vague blackness of the pine forest .
behind them , where the valley narrowed to its entrance , the more distant ranges showed a cold , slaty blue .
a wind had sprung up , and made perceptible the chill of evening .
no , to speak frankly , i don ’ t find it so overpowering , said hans castorp .
where are the glaciers , and the snow peaks , and the gigantic heights you hear about ? these things aren ’ t very high , it seems to me .
you can see the tree line almost everywhere , it is very sharply defined ; the fir-trees leave off , and after that there is absolutely nothing but bare rock .
and up there to the right of the schwarzhorn , that tooth-shaped peak , there is a glacier—can ’ t you see the blue ?
it is not very large , but it is a glacier right enough , the skaletta .
piz michel and tinzenhorn , in the notch— you can ’ t see them from here—have snow all the year round .
eternal snow , said hans castorp .
eternal snow , if you like .
yes , that ’ s all very high .
but we are frightfully high ourselves : sixteen hundred metres above sea-level .
yes , what a climb that was ! i was scared to death , i can tell you .
sixteen hundred metres—that is over five thousand feet , as i reckon it .
i ’ ve never been so high up in my life .
and hans castorp took in a deep , experimental breath of the strange air . it was fresh , and that was all .
it had no perfume , no content , no humidity ; it breathed in easily , and held for him no associations .
yes , the atmosphere is famous .
but the place doesn ’ t look its best to-night . sometimes it makes a much better impression—especially when there is snow .
but you can get sick of looking at it .
all of us up here are frightfully fed up , you can imagine , said joachim , and twisted his mouth into an expression of disgust that was as unlike him as the shoulder-shrug . it looked irritable , disproportionate .
said joachim , concerned , and turned to look at his cousin .
oh , no , of course i don ’ t mean you really have—i suppose it just seemed so to me for the moment , hans castorp hastened to assure him .
it was the expression all of us up here , which joachim had used several times , that had somehow struck him as strange and given him an uneasy feeling .
our sanatorium is higher up than the village , as you see , went on joachim .
in the prospectus it says a hundred , but it is really only fifty .
the highest of the sanatoriums is the schatzalp—you can ’ t see it from here .
they have to bring their bodies down on bob-sleds in the winter , because the roads are blocked .
and suddenly he burst out laughing , a violent , irrepressible laugh , which shook him all over and distorted his face , that was stiff with the cold wind , until it almost hurt .
and you can tell it me just like that , in cold blood !
you ’ ve certainly got pretty cynical in these five months .
not at all , answered joachim , shrugging again .
it ’ s all the same to them , isn ’ t it ? but maybe we do get cynical up here .
behrens is a cynic himself—but he ’ s a great old bird after all , an old corps-student .
they mention his activities specially , in the prospectus . he psycho-analyses the patients . psycho-analyses—how disgusting !
cried hans castorp ; and now his hilarity altogether got the better of him .
he could not stop .
the psycho-analysis had been the finishing touch . he laughed so hard that the tears ran down his cheeks ; he put up his hands to his face and rocked with laughter . joachim laughed just as heartily—it seemed to do him good ; and thus , in great good spirits , the young people climbed out of the wagon , which had slowly mounted the steep , winding drive and deposited them before the portal of the international sanatorium berghof .
on their right as they entered , between the main door and the inner one , was the porter ’ s lodge . an official of the french type , in the grey livery of the man at the station , was sitting at the telephone , reading the newspaper . he came out and led them through the well-lighted halls , on the left of which lay the reception-rooms .
hans castorp peered in as he passed , but they were empty .
where , then , were the guests , he asked , and his cousin answered : in the rest-cure .
otherwise i am always up in my balcony , after supper .
hans castorp came near bursting out again .
you lie out on your balcony at night , in the damp ?
he asked , his voice shaking .
yes , that is the rule .
from eight to ten .
but come and see your room now , and get a wash. they entered the lift—it was an electric one , worked by the frenchman .
as they went up , hans castorp wiped his eyes .
i ’ m perfectly worn out with laughing , he said , and breathed through his mouth .
i suppose i am a bit relaxed from the journey .
but my face burns so , it is really unpleasant .
do we eat now ?
is the food decent up here ? they went noiselessly along the coco matting of the narrow corridor , which was lighted by electric lights in white glass shades set in the ceiling .
the walls gleamed with hard white enamel paint .
they had a glimpse of a nursing sister in a white cap , and eyeglasses on a cord that ran behind her ear . she had the look of a protestant sister—that is to say , one working without a real vocation and burdened with restlessness and ennui . as they went along the corridor , hans castorp saw , beside two of the white-enamelled , numbered doors , certain curious , swollen-looking , balloonshaped vessels with short necks .
here you are , said joachim .
the other side you have a russian couple , rather loud and offensive , but it couldn ’ t be helped .
well , how do you like it ?
there were two doors , an outer and an inner , with clothes-hooks in the space between . joachim had turned on the ceiling light , and in its vibrating brilliance the room looked restful and cheery , with practical white furniture , white washable walls , clean linoleum , and white linen curtains gaily embroidered in modern taste .
the door stood open ; one saw the lights of the valley and heard distant dance-music . the good joachim had put a vase of flowers on the chest of drawers—a few bluebells and some yarrow , which he had found himself among the second crop of grass on the slopes . awfully decent of you , said hans castorp .
what a nice room !
i can spend a couple of weeks here with pleasure .
an american woman died here day before yesterday , said joachim .
behrens told me directly that she would be out before you came , and you might have the room .
her fiancé was with her , an english officer of marines , but he didn ’ t behave very well .
he kept coming out in the corridor to cry , just like a little boy .
he rubbed cold cream on his cheeks , because he was close-shaven and the tears smarted .
night before last she had two first-class haemorrhages , and that was the finish .
but she has been gone since yesterday morning , and after they took her away of course they fumigated the room thoroughly with formalin , which is the proper thing to use in such cases .
he was standing with his sleeves pushed back before the roomy wash-hand-basin , the taps of which shone in the electric light , and gave hardly a glance at the white metal bed with its fresh coverlet .
that ’ s ripping , he said loquaciously and rather absurdly , as he washed and dried his hands .
methyl aldehyde ; yes , that ’ s too much for the bacteria , no matter how strong they are .
of course , perfect sanitation is absolutely essential .
he spoke with more of a hamburg accent than his cousin , who had broken himself of it since his student days .
but what i was about to say was , probably the officer of marines used a safety-razor ; one makes oneself sore with those things easier than with a wellsharpened blade—at least , that is my experience , and i use them both by turns .
well , and salt water would naturally make a tender skin smart , so he got in the way , in the service , of rubbing in cold cream .
i don ’ t see anything strange about that… he rattled on : said that he had two hundred maria mancinis ( his cigar ) in his trunk , the customs officers had been very courteous ; and gave his cousin greetings from various people at home .
don ’ t they heat the rooms here ?
he broke off to inquire , and ran to put his hands on the radiator .
no , they keep us pretty cool , answered joachim .
the weather would have to be different from this before they put on the heat in august .
but i am cold , abominably cold ; i mean in my body , for my face burns shockingly—just feel it !
joachim did not take up the offer , but merely said : that is the air—it doesn ’ t mean anything ; behrens himself is purple in the face all day long .
some people never get used to it .
come along now , do , or we shan ’ t get anything to eat .
outside they saw the nursing sister again , peering short-sightedly and inquisitively after them .
but in the first storey hans castorp suddenly stopped , rooted to the spot by a perfectly ghastly sound coming from a little distance off round a bend in the corridor . it was not a loud sound , but so distinctly horrible that hans castorp made a wry face and looked wide-eyed at his cousin .
it was coughing , obviously , a man coughing ; but coughing like to no other hans castorp had ever heard , and compared with which any other had been a magnificent and healthy manifestation of life : a coughing that had no conviction and gave no relief , that did not even come out in paroxysms , but was just a feeble , dreadful welling up of the juices of organic dissolution .
an austrian aristocrat , you know , very elegant . he ’ s a born horseman—a gentleman rider .
and now he ’ s come to this .
but he still gets about .
as they went , hans castorp discoursed earnestly upon the gentleman rider ’ s cough . you must realize , he said , that i ’ ve never heard anything like it before . it is entirely new to me , and naturally it makes a great impression .
there are different kinds of cough , dry and loose , and people always say the loose one is better than the other , the barking kind .
when i had croup , in my youth ( he actually said in my youth ! ) , i bayed like a wolf , and i can still remember how glad everybody was when it got looser .
but a cough like this—i didn ’ t know there was such a cough !
it isn ’ t dry and yet isn ’ t loose either—that is very far from being the right word for it .
it is just as if one could look right into him when he coughs , and see what it looks like : all slime and mucous—
oh , said joachim , i hear it every day , you don ’ t need to describe it to me .
but hans castorp could not get over the coughing he had heard . he kept repeating that he could see right into the gentleman rider ’ s vitals ; when they reached the restaurant his travel-weary eyes had an excited glitter . it was charming in the restaurant , elegantly appointed and well lighted .
the room lay to the right of the hall , opposite the salons , and was , joachim explained , used chiefly by new arrivals , and by guests eating out of the usual meal hours or entertaining company . but it also served for birthday feasts , farewell parties , even to celebrate a favourable report after a general examination .
there were lively times here in the restaurant on occasion , joachim said , and champagne flowed freely .
now , no one was here but a solitary lady of some thirty years , reading a book and humming ; she kept tapping the table-cloth lightly with the middle finger of her left hand . after the young people had taken their places , she changed hers , in order to sit with her back to them .
joachim explained in a low voice that she suffered from shyness as from a disease , and ate all her meals in the restaurant , with a book .
it was said that she had entered her first tuberculosis sanatorium as a young girl , and had never lived in the world since .
so compared with her , you are only a novice , with your five months ; and still will be when you have a year on your back , said hans castorp to his cousin ; whereat joachim , with his newly acquired shoulder-shrug , took up the menu .
they had sat down at the raised table in the window , the pleasantest spot in the room , facing each other against the cream-coloured hangings , their faces lighted by the red-shaded table-lamp .
hans castorp clasped his freshly washed hands and rubbed them together in agreeable anticipation—a habit of his when he sat down to table , perhaps because his ancestors had said grace before meat .
they were served by a friendly maid in black frock and white apron . she had a pleasant , throaty voice , and her broad face was indisputably healthy-coloured .
to his great amusement , hans castorp learned that the waitresses here were called dining-room girls .
they ordered a bottle of gruaud larose , and hans castorp sent it back to have it warmed .
the food was excellent : asparagus soup , stuffed tomatoes , a roast with vegetables , an exceedingly well-prepared sweet , cheese , and fruit . hans castorp ate heartily , though his appetite did not turn out quite so stout as he had thought .
but he always ate a good deal , out of pure self-respect , even when he was not hungry . joachim paid scant honour to the meal .
he was tired of the cooking , he said ; they all were , up here , and it was customary to grumble at the food . if one had to sit up here for ever and a day— !
but , on the other hand , he partook of the wine with gusto , not to say abandon ; and repeatedly , though with careful avoidance of emotional language , expressed his joy at having somebody here with whom one could have a little rational conversation .
yes , it ’ s first-rate you ’ ve come , he said , and his gentle voice betrayed some feeling .
i must say it is really an event for me—it is certainly a change , anyhow , a break in the everlasting monotony . but time must go fast , living up here , was hans castorp ’ s view .
fast and slow , as you take it , answered joachim .
hans castorp drank too , though his face was like fire .
yet he was still cold , and felt a curious restlessness in his limbs , at once pleasurable and troubling .
his words fell over each other , he often misspoke and passed it over with a deprecating wave .
joachim too was in a lively humour , and their conversation continued in a still freer and more convivial vein after the humming , tapping lady had got up suddenly and left the room . they gesticulated with their forks as they ate , nodded , shrugged their shoulders , talked with their mouths full .
joachim wanted to hear about hamburg , and brought the conversation round to the proposed regulation of the elbe .
epoch-making for the development of our shipping . can ’ t be over-estimated . we ’ ve budgeted fifty millions for immediate expenditure and you may be sure we know what we ’ re about .
but notwithstanding all the importance he attached to the projected improvement , he jumped away from the theme and demanded that joachim tell him more about life up here and about the guests—which the latter straightway did , being only too pleased to be able to unbosom himself . he had to repeat the story of the corpses sent down by bob-sleigh , and vouch for its truth .
hans castorp being taken by another fit of laughing , his cousin laughed too , with hearty enjoyment , and told other funny things to add fuel to their merriment . there was a lady sitting at his table , named frau stöhr , the wife of a cannstadt musician ; a rather serious case , she was , and the most ignorant creature he had ever seen . she said diseased for deceased , quite seriously , and she called krokowski the asst .
and you had to take it all in without cracking a smile .
she was a regular gossip—most people were , up here—and published it broadcast that another lady , a certain frau iltis , carried a steriletto on her person .
they lolled in their chairs , they flung themselves back and laughed so hard that they shook ; and they began to hiccup at nearly the same time .
now and then joachim ’ s face would cloud over and he would remember his lot .
yes , we sit here and laugh , he said , with a long face , his words interrupted by the heaving of his diaphragm , we sit here and laugh , but there ’ s no telling when i shall get away . when behrens says half a year , you can make up your mind it will be more .
it is hard , isn ’ t it ? —you just tell me if you don ’ t think it is pretty hard on me .
i had already been accepted , i could have taken my exams next month .
and now i have to drool about with a thermometer stuck in my mouth , and count the howlers of this ignorant frau stöhr , and watch the time slipping away .
a year is so important at our age . down below , one goes through so many changes , and makes so much progress , in a single year of life .
and i have to stagnate up here—yes , just stagnate like a filthy puddle ; it isn ’ t too crass a comparison .
strange to say , hans castorp ’ s only reply to all this was a query as to whether it was possible to get porter up here ; when joachim looked at him , in some astonishment , he perceived that his cousin was overcome with sleep , that in fact he was actually nodding .
come along , it is time we both went to bed .
he went with his cousin , rather bent and stiff in the knees , like a man bowed to the earth with fatigue . however , in the dimly lighted corridor he pulled himself sharply together on hearing his cousin say : there ’ s krokowski sitting there . i think i ’ ll just have to present you , as briefly as possible .
dr. krokowski sat in the bright light at the fire-place of one of the reception-rooms , close to the folding doors .
he was reading a paper , and got up as the young people approached .
joachim , in military position , heels together , said : herr doctor , may i present my cousin castorp from hamburg ?
he has just arrived . dr. krokowski greeted the new inmate with a jovial and robust heartiness , as who should say that with him all formality was superfluous , and only jocund mutual confidence in place .
he was about thirty-five years old , broad-shouldered and fleshy , much shorter than either of the youths before him , so that he had to tip back his head to look them in the face . he was unusually pale , of a translucent , yes , phosphorescent pallor , that was further accentuated by the dark ardour of his eyes , the blackness of his brows , and his rather long , full whisker , which ended in two points and already showed some white threads .
he had on a black double-breasted , somewhat worn sack suit ; black , open-worked sandal-like shoes over grey woollen socks , and a soft turndown collar , such as hans castorp had previously seen worn only by a photographer in danzig , which did , in fact , lend a certain stamp of the studio to dr. krokowski ’ s appearance . smiling warmly and showing his yellow teeth in his beard , he shook the young man by the hand , and said in a baritone voice , with rather a foreign drawl : welcome to our midst , herr castorp !
may you get quickly acclimatized and feel yourself at home among us !
do you come as a patient , may i ask ?
it was touching to see hans castorp labour to master his drowsiness and be polite .
it annoyed him to be in such bad form , and with the self-consciousness of youth he read signs of indulgent amusement in the warmth of the assistant ’ s manner .
he replied , mentioning his examinations and his three weeks ’ visit , and ended by saying he was , thank god , perfectly healthy .
asked krokowski , putting his head teasingly on one side .
then you are a phenomenon worthy of study .
i , for one , have never in my life come across a perfectly healthy human being . what were the examinations you have just passed , if i may ask ?
i am an engineer , herr doctor , said hans castorp with modest dignity .
dr. krokowski ’ s smile retreated as it were , lost for the moment something of its genial warmth .
and so you will not require any attention while you are here , either physical or psychical ?
oh , no , thank you ever so much , said hans castorp , and almost drew back a step as he spoke .
at that dr. krokowski ’ s smile burst forth triumphant ; he shook the young man ’ s hand afresh and cried briskly : well , sleep well , herr castorp , and rejoice in the fullness of your perfect health ; sleep well , and auf wiedersehen !
with which he dismissed the cousins and returned to his paper .
the lift had stopped running , so they climbed the stairs ; in silence , somewhat taken aback by the encounter with dr. krokowski .
joachim went with his cousin to number thirty-four , where the lame porter had already deposited the luggage of the new arrival . they talked for another quarter-hour while hans castorp unpacked his night and toilet things , smoking a large , mild cigarette the while .
a cigar would have been too much for him this evening—a fact which impressed him as odd indeed . he looks quite a personality , he said , blowing out the smoke .
he is as pale as wax .
but dear me , what hideous footgear he wears !
grey woollen socks , and then those sandals !
was he really offended at the end , do you think ?
he is rather touchy , admitted joachim .
you ought not to have refused the treatment so brusquely , at least not the psychical .
he doesn ’ t like to have people get out of it .
he doesn ’ t take much stock in me because i don ’ t confide in him enough .
but every now and then i tell him a dream i ’ ve had , so he can have something to analyse .
then i certainly did offend him , hans castorp said fretfully , for it annoyed him to give offence . his weariness rushed over him with renewed force at the thought . good-night , he said ; i ’ m falling over .
at eight o ’ clock i ’ ll come fetch you to breakfast , joachim said , and went .
hans castorp made only a cursory toilet for the night .
hardly had he put out the bedside light when sleep overcame him ; but he started up again , remembering that in that bed , the day before yesterday , someone had died .
that wasn ’ t the first time either , he said to himself , as though the thought were reassuring .
it is a regular death-bed , a common death-bed .
and he fell asleep .
no sooner had he gone off , however , than he began to dream , and dreamed almost without stopping until next morning .
principally he saw his cousin , joachim ziemssen , in a strange , dislocated attitude on a bob-sled , riding down a steep course .
he had a phosphorescent pallor like dr. krokowski , and in front of him sat the gentleman rider and steered . the gentleman rider was indistinct , like someone one has heard cough , but never seen .
it ’ s all the same to us up here , remarked the dislocated joachim ; and then it was he and not the gentleman rider who was coughing in that horribly pulpy manner . hans castorp wept bitterly to hear , and then perceived that he must run to the chemist ’ s to get some cold cream .
but frau iltis , with a pointed snout , sat by the road-side with something in her hand , which must be her steriletto , but was obviously nothing else than a safety-razor .
this made hans castorp go from tears to laughing ; and thus he was tossed back and forth among varying emotions , until the dawn came through his half-open balcony door and wakened him .
of the christening basin , and of grandfather in his two-fold guise hans castorp retained only pale memories of his parental home .
his father and mother he had barely known ; they had both dropped away in the brief period between his fifth and seventh birthdays ; first the mother , quite suddenly , on the eve of a confinement , of an arterial obstruction following neuritis—an embolus , dr. heidekind had called it—which caused instantaneous cardiac arrest . she had just been laughing , sitting up in bed , and it looked as though she had fallen back with laughter , but really it was because she had died .
the father , hermann castorp , could not grasp his loss . he had been deeply attached to his wife , and not being of the strongest himself , never quite recovered from her death .
his spirit was troubled ; he shrank within himself ; his benumbed brain made him blunder in his business , so that the firm of castorp and son suffered sensible financial losses ; and the next spring , while inspecting warehouses on the windy landing-stage , he got inflammation of the lungs . the fever was too much for his shaken heart , and in five days , notwithstanding all dr. heidekind ’ s care , he died . attended to his rest by a respectable concourse of citizens , he followed his wife to the castorp family vault , a charming site in st. katherine ’ s churchyard , with a view of the botanical gardens .
his death agony was sore , for unlike his son , hans lorenz castorp had been a man of tough constitution , and firmly rooted in life . before his death , for the space of a year and a half , the grandfather harboured the orphaned hans castorp in his home , a mansion standing in a narrow lot on the esplanade , built in the early years of the last century , in the northern-classic style of architecture . it was painted a depressing weather-colour , and had pilasters on either side the entrance door , which was approached by a flight of five steps .
besides the parterre , which had windows going down to the floor and furnished with cast-iron grilles , there were two upper storeys .
in this room , daily , at four o ’ clock , for the space of eighteen months , grandfather and grandson dined together , served by old fiete , who had ear-rings in his ears and silver buttons on his livery , also a batiste neckcloth like his master ’ s , in which he buried his shaven chin just as hans lorenz castorp did in his .
hans castorp liked to hear it , and very much he liked to hear fiete reply , in dialect too , bending over as he served and speaking into his master ’ s left ear , for the senator could hear much better on that side .
the old man would listen and nod and go on eating , sitting erect between the table and the high back of his mahogany chair , and scarcely at all bending over his plate .
and his grandson , opposite , watched in silence , with deep , unconscious concentration , grandfather ’ s beautiful , thin , white old hands , with their pointed nails , and , on the right forefinger , the green seal ring with the crest ; watched the small , deft , practised motions with which they arranged a mouthful of meat , vegetable , and potato on the end of his fork , and with a slight inclination of the head conveyed it to his mouth .
one would have to be as old as grandfather for that ; in these days , save for him and his old fiete , nobody , far and wide , wore such collars and neckcloths .
it was a pity ; little hans castorp liked the way grandfather ’ s chin nestled in the high , snow-white band . even after he was grown , he recalled it with pleasure ; something in the depth of his being responded to it .
when they had done , they folded their table-napkins and put them in their silver rings—a job at which hans castorp never acquitted himself very well , for they were the size of small tablecloths . then the senator got up from his chair , which fiete drew away behind him , and went with shuffling steps into his office to get a cigar .
sometimes the grandson followed him in .
this office had come to exist because of a peculiarity in the arrangement of the lower floor—namely , that the dining-room had been planned with three windows instead of two , and ran the whole width of the house ; which left space for only two drawing-rooms , instead of the usual three , and gave to one of them , at right angles to the dining-room , with a single window on the street , a quite disproportionate depth . of this room , therefore , some quarter of the length had been cut off , and turned into a cabinet . it was a strip of a room , with a skylight ; twilighted , and not much furnished—there was an étagère , on which stood the senator ’ s cigar case ; a cardtable , the drawer of which held whist cards , counters , little marking-boards with tiny teeth that clapped open and shut , a slate and slate-pencil , paper cigar-holders , and other such attractions ; and finally , in the corner , a rococo case in palisander-wood , with yellow silk stretched behind its glass doors .
grandpa , little hans castorp might say , standing on tiptoes to reach the old man ’ s ear , please show me the christening basin . and the grandfather , who had already pulled back the skirts of his long cashmere frock-coat and taken the bunch of keys from his trouser pocket , forthwith opened the door of the glass case , whence floated odours odd and pleasant to the boy ’ s sense .
inside were all manner of disused and fascinating objects : a pair of silver-branched candlesticks , a broken barometer in a wooden case with allegorical carving , an album of daguerreotypes , a cedar-wood case for liqueurs , a funny little turk in flowing silk robes , under which was a hard body with a mechanism inside .
but from one of the middle shelves grandfather took a much-tarnished , round silver dish , with a tray likewise of silver , and showed them both to the boy , lifting them separately and turning them about in his hands as he told the story he had so often told before . plate and basin , one could see , and as the little one heard once again , had not originally belonged together ; but , grandfather said , they had been in use together for a round hundred years , or since the time when the basin was made . the latter was very beautiful , of simple and elegant form , in the severe taste of the early nineteenth century .
it rested , plain and solid , on a round base , and had once been gilt within , but the gilding had faded with time to a yellow shimmer .
its single decoration was a chaste garland of roses and serrated leaves about the brim . as for the plate , its far greater antiquity could be read on the inside : the date was engraved there in ornamental figures , framed in curly engraved lines executed in the modern manner of the period , florid and capricious devices and arabesques that were something between star and flower .
on the back , engraved in a variety of scripts , were the names of its successive owners , seven in number , each with the date when it had passed into his hands . the old man named each one to his grandson , pointing with beringed index finger .
there was hans castorp ’ s father ’ s name , there was grandfather ’ s own , there was great-grandfather ’ s ; then the great came doubled , tripled , quadrupled , from the old man ’ s mouth , whilst the little lad listened , his head on one side , the eyes full of thought , yet fixed and dreamy too , the childish lips parted , half with awe , half sleepily .
that great-great-great-great—what a hollow sound it had , how it spoke of the falling away of time , yet how it seemed the expression of a piously cherished link between the present , his own life , and the depth of the past ! all that , as his face showed , made a profound impression . as he listened to the great-great-great , he seemed to smell the cool , earthy air of the vault of st. michael ’ s or saint katherine ’ s ; the breath of regions where one went hat in hand , the head reverently bowed , walking weavingly on the tips of one ’ s toes ; seemed , too , to hear the remote and set-apart hush of those echoing places .
grandfather set the vessel back on the tray , and let the boy look into the smooth , faintly golden inside , which caught the light from the window in the ceiling .
yes , he said , it will soon be eight years since we held you over it , and the water flowed into it from your baptism .
lassen , the sexton of st. jacob ’ s , poured it into our good pastor bugenhagen ’ s hand , and it ran out over your little topknot and into the basin .
we had warmed it , so it should not frighten you and make you cry , and you did not ; you cried beforehand , though , so loud that bugenhagen could hardly get on with the service , but you stopped when you felt the water—and that , let us hope , was out of respect for the holy sacrament .
a few days from now it will be forty-four years since your blessed father was a baby at the baptismal font , and it was over his head the water flowed into the basin .
that was here in this house , where he was born , in front of the middle dining-room window , and old pastor hezekiel was still alive . he was the man the french nearly shot when he was young , because he preached against their burning and looting . he has been with god these many years .
then , five-and-seventy years ago , i was the youngster whose head they held over this selfsame basin ; that was in the dining-room too , and the minister spoke the very words that were spoken when you and your father were baptized , and the clear , warm water flowed over my head precisely the same way—there wasn ’ t much more hair than there is now—and fell into this golden bowl just as it did over yours .
the little one looked up at grandfather ’ s narrow grey head , bending over the basin as it had in the time he described . a familiar feeling pervaded the child : a strange , dreamy , troubling sense : of change in the midst of duration , of time as both flowing and persisting , of recurrence in continuity—these were sensations he had felt before on the like occasion , and both expected and longed for again , whenever the heirloom was displayed .
as a young man he was aware that the image of his grandfather was more deeply and clearly imprinted on his mind , with greater significance , than those of his own parents . the fact might rest upon sympathy and physical likeness , for the grandson resembled the grandfather , in so far , that is , as a rosy youth with the down on his chin might resemble a bleached , rheumatic septuagenarian , yet it probably spoke even more for that which was indeed the truth , that the grandfather had been the real personality , the picturesque figure of the family . long before hans lorenz castorp ’ s passing , his person and the things for which he stood had ceased to be representative of his age .
he had been a typical christian gentleman , of the reformed faith , of a strongly conservative cast of mind , as obstinately convinced of the right of the aristocracy to govern as if he had been born in the fourteenth century , when the labouring classes had begun to make head against the stout resistance of the free patriciate and wrest from it a place and voice in the councils of the ancient city .
his active years had fallen in a decade of rapid growth and repeated upheavals , a decade of progress by forced marches , which had made continual demands on the public capacity for enterprise and self-sacrifice . certainly he had no part or lot , old castorp , in the brilliant triumph of the modern spirit that followed hard upon . it was not his fault ; he had held far more with ancestral ways and old institutions than with ruinous schemes for widening the harbour , or godless and rubbishing plans for a great metropolis .
he had put on the brakes ; he had whittled things down wherever he could ; and if matters had gone to his liking , the administration would have continued to wear the same old-fashioned , idyllic guise as , in his time , his own office did .
such , in his lifetime and afterwards , was the figure the old man presented to the eye of his fellow burghers ; and such , in essentials , was he also to the childish gaze of little hans castorp , who knew naught of affairs of state , and whose formless , uncritical judgments were rather the fruit of mere lively perceptions . yet they persisted into later life , as the elements of a perfectly conscious memory-picture , which defied expression or analysis , but was none the less positive for all that . we repeat that natural sympathy was in play here too , the close family tie and essential intimacy which not infrequently leaps over an intervening generation .
senator castorp was tall and lean .
the years had bent his back and neck , but he tried to counteract the curvature by pressure in another direction ; drawing down his mouth with sedulous dignity , though the lips were shrunken against the bare gums , for he had lost all his teeth , and put in the false ones only to eat . it was this posture also which helped to steady an incipient shaking of the head , gave him his look of being sternly reined up , and caused him to support his chin on his neckcloth in the manner so congenial to little hans castorp ’ s taste .
he loved his snuff-box—it was a longish , gold-inlaid tortoise-shell one—and on account of his snuff-taking , used a red pocket-handkerchief , the corner of which always hung out of the back pocket of his coat .
if this foible added a quaint touch to his appearance , yet the effect was only of a slight negligence or licence due to age , which length of days either consciously and cheerfully permits itself , or else brings in its train without the victim ’ s being aware .
if weakness it were , it was the only one the sharp eye of the child ever noted in his grandfather ’ s exterior . but the old man ’ s everyday appearance was not his real and authentic one , either to the seven-year-old child , or to the memory of the grown man in after years . that was different , far finer and truer ; it was grandfather as he appeared in a life-size portrait which had once hung in the house of hans castorp ’ s own parents , had moved over with him to the esplanade on their death , and now hung above the great red satin sofa in the reception-room .
the painting showed hans lorenz castorp in his official garb as councillor : the sober , even godly , civilian habit of a bygone century , which a commonwealth both self-assertive and enterprising had brought with it down the years and retained in ceremonial use in order to make present the past and make past the present , to bear witness to the perpetual continuity of things , and the perfect soundness of its business signature .
senator castorp stood at full length on a red-tiled floor , in a perspective of column and pointed arch .
his chin was dropped , his mouth drawn down , his blue , musing eyes , with the tear ducts plain beneath them , directed toward the distant view . he wore the black coat , cut full like a robe , more than knee-length , with a wide trimming of fur all round the edge ; the upper sleeves were wide and puffed and furtrimmed too , while from beneath them came the narrow under-sleeves of plain cloth , then lace cuffs , which covered the hands to the knuckles .
the slender , elderly legs were cased in black silk stockings ; the shoes had silver buckles . but about his neck was the broad , starched ruff , pressed down in front and swelling out on the sides , beneath which , for good measure , a fluted jabot came out over the waistcoat .
under his arm he held the old-fashioned , broad-brimmed hat that tapered to a point at the top .
it was a capital painting , by an artist of some note , in an old-masterish style that suited the subject and was reminiscent of much spanish , dutch , late middle ages work .
little hans castorp had often looked at it ; not , of course , with any knowledge of art , but with a larger , even a fervid comprehension . only once—and then only for a moment—had he ever seen grandfather as he was here represented , on the occasion of a procession to the rathaus . but he could not help feeling that this presentment was the genuine , the authentic grandfather , and the everyday one merely subsidiary , not entirely conformable—a sort of interim grandfather , as it were .
for it was clear that the deviations and idiosyncrasies presented by his everyday appearance were due to incomplete , perhaps even unsuccessful adaptation ; they were the not quite eradicable vestiges of grandfather ’ s pure and genuine form .
the choker collar and band , for instance , were old-fashioned ; an adjective it would have been impossible to apply to that admirable article of apparel whose interim representative they were : namely , the ruff .
the same was true of the outlandish top-hat grandfather wore , with the bellshaped crown , to which the broad-brimmed felt in the painting corresponded , only with a higher degree of actuality ; and of the voluminous frock-coat , whose archetype and original was for little hans castorp the lace- and fur-trimmed ceremonial garment . thus he was glad from his heart that it should be the authentic , the perfect grandfather who lay there resplendent on that day when he came to take last leave of him . it was in the room where so often they had sat facing each other at table ; and now , in the centre , hans lorenz castorp was lying in a silver-mounted coffin , upon a begarlanded bier .
he had fought out the attack on his lungs , fought long and stoutly , despite his air of being at home in the life of the day only by dint of his powers of adaptability . one hardly knew whether he had won or lost in the struggle ; but in any case there he lay , with a stern yet satisfied expression , on his bed of state . he had altered with the illness , his nose looked sharp and thin ; the lower half of his body was hidden by a coverlet on which lay a palm branch ; the head was lifted high by the silken pillow , so that his chin rested beautifully in the front swell of the ruff .
between the hands , half-shrouded in their lace cuffs , their visibly cold , dead fingers artfully arranged to simulate life , was stuck an ivory cross . he seemed to gaze , beneath drooping lids , steadfastly down upon it .
hans castorp had probably seen his grandfather several times at the beginning of this last illness , but not toward the end .
they had spared him the sight of the struggle , the more easily that it had been mostly at night ; he had only felt it through the surcharged atmosphere of the house , old fiete ’ s red eyes , the coming and going of the doctors . what he gathered as he stood now by the bier in the dining-room , was that grandfather had finally and formally surmounted his interim aspect and assumed for all time his true and adequate shape . and that was a gratifying result , even though old fiete continually wept and shook his head , even though hans castorp himself wept , as he had at sight of the mother he had abruptly been bereft of , and the father who , so little time after her , lay in his turn still and strange before the little boy ’ s eyes .
thus for the third time in so short a space and in such young years did death play upon the spirit and senses—but chiefly on the senses—of the lad .
the sight was no longer strange , it was already right familiar ; and as on those earlier occasions , only in still greater degree , he bore himself in the presence of death with a responsible air , quite self-controlled , showing no nervous weakness , if some natural dejection . he was unaware of the practical result the loss would mean to his own life , or else with childlike indifference was instinctively confident that he would be taken care of somehow ; thus , at the bier , he displayed both an uncomprehending coolness and a detached alertness of observation , to which were added , on this third occasion , a feeling and expression of connoisseurship . and something more , a peculiar , precocious variation : he seemed no longer to think of tears—either the frequent outburst of grief or the contagion from the grief of others—as a natural reaction .
in three or four months after his father ’ s passing he had forgotten about death ; but now he remembered , and all the impressions of that time recurred , precise , immediate , and piercing in their transcendent strangeness .
in one aspect death was a holy , a pensive , a spiritual state , possessed of a certain mournful beauty .
it was precisely the opposite , it was very physical , it was material , it could not possibly be called either holy , or pensive , or beautiful—not even mournful . the solemn , spiritual side expressed itself in the ceremonial lying-in state of the corpse , in the fan-leaved palm and the wealth of flowers , all which symbolized the peace of god and the heavenly kingdom , as did even more explicitly the ivory cross stuck between the dead fingers of what was once grandfather , and the bust of christ by thorwaldsen at the head of the bier , with towering candelabra on either side . it was these last that gave a churchly air to the scene .
but over and above that raison d ’ être they had another , of a more profane kind , of which little hans castorp was distinctly aware , though without admitting it in so many words .
one and all of them , but expressly the flowers , and of these more expressly the hosts of tuberoses , were there to palliate the other aspect of death , the side which was neither beautiful nor exactly sad , but somehow almost improper—its lowly , physical side—to slur it over and prevent one from being conscious of it . it was this other aspect of death that made grandfather himself look so strange ; not like grandfather at all , more like a life-size wax doll , which death had put in his place to be the centre of all this pious and reverent spectacle . he who lay there—or , more correctly , that which lay there—was not grandfather himself , but a shell , made , as hans castorp was aware , not of wax , but of its own substance , and only of that .
therein , precisely , was the impropriety . it was scarcely sad at all—as things are not which have to do with the body and only with it . little hans castorp regarded that substance , waxy yellow , and fine-grained like cheese , of which the life-size figure was made , the face and hands of what had been grandfather .
a fly had settled on the quiet brow , and began to move its proboscis up and down .
old fiete shooed it cautiously away , taking care not to touch the forehead of the dead , putting on a seemly air of absent-mindedness—of obscurantism , as it were—as though he neither might nor would take notice of what he was doing .
but the fly , after a circling flight , came to rest on grandfather ’ s fingers , close to the ivory cross .
and hans castorp , watching , thought he detected , more plainly than ever before , a familiar , strange exhalation , faint , yet oddly clinging—he blushed to find that it made him think of a former schoolfellow , who was avoided by his classmates because he suffered from a certain unpleasant affection—for the drowning out of which the tuberoses were there , and which , with all their lovely luxuriance and the strong-ness of their scent , they yet failed to overpower .
he stood three times by his grandfather ’ s bier . once alone with old fiete ; once with great-uncle tienappel , the wine merchant , and his two uncles , james and peter ; the third and last time when a group of harbour hands in their sunday clothes came to take leave of the head of the house of castorp and son . then came the funeral .
the room was full of people , and pastor bugenhagen of st. michael ’ s , the same who had baptized little hans , preached the sermon in a ruff . he was most friendly with the boy as they drove out together to the cemetery , in the first carriage behind the hearse . thus did another epoch in the life of hans castorp come to an end , and again he moved to a new home and new surroundings , for the second time in his young life .
the change was no loss to him ; for he entered the home of his appointed guardian , consul tienappel , where he wanted for nothing .
for consul tienappel , an uncle of hans ’ s deceased mother , was administrator of the castorp estate ; he put up the property for sale , took in hand the business of liquidating the firm of castorp and son , importers and exporters , and realized from the whole nearly four hundred thousand marks , the inheritance of young hans . this sum consul tienappel invested in trust funds , and took unto himself two per cent of the interest every quarter , without impairment of his kinsmanly feeling . the tienappel house lay at the foot of a garden in harvestehuderstrasse ; the windows looked out on a plot of lawn in which not the tiniest weed was suffered to flourish , then upon public rose-borders , and then upon the river .
the consul went on foot every morning to his business in the old town—although he possessed more than one fine equipage—in order to get a little exercise , for he sometimes suffered from cerebral congestion . he returned in the same way at five in the afternoon , at which time the tienappels dined , with due and fitting ceremony . he was a weighty man , whose suits were always of the best english cloths ; his eyes were watery blue and prominent behind his gold-rimmed glasses , his nose was ruddy , and his square cut beard was grey ; he wore a flashing brilliant on the stubby little finger of his left hand .
his wife was long since dead .
he had two sons , peter and james , of whom one was in the navy and seldom at home , the other occupied in the paternal wine trade , and destined heir to the business .
the housekeeping , for many years , had been the care of an altona goldsmith ’ s daughter , named schalleen , who wore starched white ruffles at her plump , round wrists . hers it was to see to it that the table , morning and evening , was richly laden with cold meats , with crabs and salmon , eel and smoked breast of goose , with tomato ketchup for the roast beef . she kept a watchful eye on the hired waiters when consul tienappel gave a gentlemen ’ s dinner ; and she it was who , so far as in her lay , took the place of a mother to little hans castorp .
so he grew up ; in wretched weather , in the teeth of wind and mist , grew up , so to say , in a yellow mackintosh , and , generally speaking , he throve .
a little anæmic he had always been , so dr. heidekind said , and had him take a good glass of porter after third breakfast every day , when he came home from school . this , as everyone knows , is a hearty drink—dr . heidekind considered it a blood-maker—and certainly hans castorp found it most soothing to his spirits and encouraging to a propensity of his , which his uncle tienappel called dozing : namely , sitting staring into space , with his jaw dropped and his thoughts fixed on just nothing at all .
but on the whole he was sound and fit , an adequate tennis player and rower ; though actually handling the oars was less to his taste than sitting of a summer evening on the terrace of the uhlenhorst ferry-house , with a good drink before him and the sound of music in his ears , while he watched the lighted boats , and the swans mirrored in the bright water . hear him talk , sedate and sensible , in a rather low , monotonous voice , just tinged with dialect ; observe him in his blond correctness , with his well-shaped head , which had about it some stamp of the classic , and his self-possessed , indolent bearing , the fruit of innate , inherited , perfectly unconscious self-esteem—you would swear that this young castorp was a legitimate and genuine product of the soil in which he flourished , and strikingly at home in his environment . nor would he , had he ever put such a question to himself , have been for a single second doubtful of the answer .
yes , he was thoroughly in his element in the atmosphere of this great seaboard city : this reeking air , compact of good living and a retail trade that embraced the four corners of the earth . it had been the breath of his father ’ s nostrils , and the son drew it in with profound acquiescence and a sense of well-being . the exhalations from water , coals , and tar , the sharp tang in the nostrils from heaped-up stacks of colonial produce ; the huge steam-cranes at the dock-side , imitating the quiet , the intelligence , and the giant strength of elephants at work , as they hoisted tons of sacks , bales , chests , vats , and carboys out of the bowels of seagoing ships and conveyed them into waiting trains and scales ; the business men , in yellow rubber coats like his own , streaming to the bourse at midday , where , as he knew , there was oftentimes pretty sharp work , and a man might have to strengthen his credit at short notice by giving out invitations to a big dinner—all this he felt , saw , heard , knew .
besides it all , there was the field in which later was to lie his own particular interest : the confusion of the yards , the mammoth bodies of great ships , asiatic and african liners , lying in dry-dock , keel and propeller bare , supported by props as thick as tree-trunks , lying there in monstrous helplessness , swarmed over by troops of men like dwarfs , scouring , whitewashing , hammering ; there were the roofed-over ways , wrapped in wreaths of smoke-like mist , holding the towering frames of rising ships , among which moved the engineers , blueprint and loading scale in hand , directing the work-people .
all these were familiar sights to hans castorp from his youth upwards , awaking in him only the agreeable , homely sensations of belonging , which were the prerogative of his years . such sensations would reach their height when he sat of a sunday forenoon with james tienappel or his cousin ziemssen—joachim ziemssen—in the pavilion at alster , breakfasting on hot cuts and smoked meat , with a glass of old port ; or when , having eaten , he would lean back in his chair and give himself up to his cigar . for therein especially was he true to type , that he liked good living , and notwithstanding his thinbloodedness and look of over-refinement clung to the grosser pleasures of life as a greedy suckling to its mother ’ s breast .
comfortably , not without dignity , he carried the weight of culture with which the governing upper class of the commercial city endowed its children . he was as clean as a well-cared-for baby , and dressed by the tailor in whom the young men of his social sphere felt most confidence .
schalleen took beautiful care of his small stock of carefully marked linen , which was bestowed in a dressing-chest on the english plan . when he studied away from home , he regularly sent back his laundry to be washed and mended , for it was a saying of his that outside hamburg nobody in the kingdom knew how to iron . a rough spot on the cuff of his dainty coloured shirts filled him with acute discomfort .
his hands , though not particularly aristocratic in shape , were well tended and fresh-skinned , and he wore a platinum chain ring as well as the seal ring inherited from grandfather .
standing and walking , he rather stuck out his abdomen , which hardly made an athletic impression ; but his bearing at table was beyond cavil . sitting very erect , he would turn the whole upper part of his body to speak to his neighbour ( with selfpossession , of course , and a little platt ) and he kept his elbows well in as he dismembered his piece of fowl , or deftly , with the appointed tool , drew the rosy flesh from a lobster ’ s shell . his first requirement after a meal was the finger-bowl of perfumed water , his second the russian cigarette—which paid no duty , as he had a convenient way of getting them smuggled in .
after the cigarette the cigar ; he favoured a bremen brand called maria mancini , of which we shall hear more hereafter ; the fragrant narcotic blended so soothingly with the coffee .
hans castorp protected his supply of tobacco from the injurious effects of steam-heating by keeping it in the cellar , whither he would betake himself every morning to load his case with his stock for the day . it went against his grain to eat butter served in the piece instead of in little fluted balls . it will be seen that we mean to say everything that may be said in hans castorp ’ s favour , yet without fulsomeness , not making him out as better , or worse , than he was .
he was neither genius nor dunderhead ; and if , in our description of him , we have avoided the use of the word mediocre , it has been for reasons quite unconnected with his intelligence , hardly even with any bearing upon his whole simple personality , but rather out of regard for his lot in life , to which we incline to ascribe a certain importance above and beyond personal considerations . his head-piece sustained without undue strain the demands made upon it by the course at the realgymnasium—strain , indeed , was something to which he was quite definitely disinclined , whatever the circumstances or the object of his effort ; less out of fear of hurting himself than because he positively saw no reason , or , more precisely , saw no positive reason , for exertion . this then , perhaps , is why we may not call him mediocre : that , somehow or other , he was aware of the lack of such a reason .
a man lives not only his personal life , as an individual , but also , consciously or unconsciously , the life of his epoch and his contemporaries .
he may regard the general , impersonal foundations of his existence as definitely settled and taken for granted , and be as far from assuming a critical attitude toward them as our good hans castorp really was ; yet it is quite conceivable that he may none the less be vaguely conscious of the deficiencies of his epoch and find them prejudicial to his own moral well-being . all sorts of personal aims , ends , hopes , prospects , hover before the eyes of the individual , and out of these he derives the impulse to ambition and achievement . now , if the life about him , if his own time seem , however outwardly stimulating , to be at bottom empty of such food for his aspirations ; if he privately recognize it to be hopeless , viewless , helpless , opposing only a hollow silence to all the questions man puts , consciously or unconsciously , yet somehow , puts , as to the final , absolute , and abstract meaning in all his efforts and activities ; then , in such a case , a certain laming of the personality is bound to occur , the more inevitably the more upright the character in question ; a sort of palsy , as it were , which may even extend from his spiritual and moral over into his physical and organic part .
all this that we have said has reference to the inward state of the young man not only during his school years , but also in those that followed , after he had made choice of his civil profession .
on his way through his forms at school , he had now and again to take one for the second time .
but in the main his origin , his good breeding , and also a pretty if unimpassioned gift for mathematics got him forward ; and when he received his one-year service certificate , he made up his mind to continue at school , principally , it must be said , because he thus prolonged a situation he was used to , in which no definite decisions had to be taken , and in which he had further time to think matters over and decide what he really wanted to do , which he was far from knowing after he had arrived at the top form .
so much , however , was true , that he had always liked ships .
as a small boy he had filled the pages of his note-books with drawings of fishing-barks , five-masters and vegetable-barges .
when he was fifteen , he had had a front seat at the christening ceremony of the new double-screw steamer hansa . he had watched her leave the ways at blohm and voss ’ s , and afterwards made quite a happy water-colour of the graceful ship , done with a good deal of attention to detail , and a loving and not unskillful treatment of the glassy green , rolling waves . consul tienappel hung it in his private office , and somebody told him that it showed talent , that the artist might develop into a good marine painter—a remark which the consul could safely repeat to his ward , for hans castorp only laughed good-humouredly , and not for a moment considered letting himself in for a career of being eccentric and not getting enough to eat .
you haven ’ t so much , you know , his uncle tienappel would say to him .
james and peter will get most of what i have ; that is to say , it stops in the business , and peter will draw his interest .
what belongs to you is well invested , and brings you in something safe .
but it ’ s no joke living on your interest to-day , unless one has at least five times what you have ; and if you want to be somebody here in this town and live as you have been brought up to , you ’ ll have to earn a good bit more to put with it , you mark my words , my son .
hans castorp marked them . he looked about for a profession suitable in his own eyes and those of his fellow citizens .
and when he had once chosen—it came about at the instance of old wilms , of the firm of tunder and wilms , who said to consul tienappel at the saturday whist-table that young castorp ought to study ship-building ; it would be a good idea , he could come into his office and he would keep an eye on him—when he had once chosen , he thought very highly of his calling .
it was , to be sure , confoundedly complicated and fatiguing , but all the same it was very first-rate , very solid , very important . and certainly , being peaceful in his tastes , he preferred it to that of his cousin ziemssen , the son of his mother ’ s half-sister , who was bent on being an officer .
but joachim ziemssen was rather weak in the chest , and for that reason a calling which would keep him in the open , and in which there was no mental strain or fatigue to speak of , might be quite the right thing for him , hans castorp thought with easy condescension .
he had the greatest respect for work—though personally he found that he tired easily .
and here we revert to our suggestion of a few pages back : the idea that an unfavourable influence exerted upon a man ’ s personal life by the times in which he lives may even extend to his physical organism . hans castorp respected work—as how should he not have ?
it would have been unnatural .
work was for him , in the nature of things , the most estimable attribute of life ; when you came down to it , there was nothing else that was estimable . it was the principle by which one stood or fell , the absolute of the time ; it was , so to speak , its own justification .
his regard for it was thus religious in its character , and , so far as he knew , unquestioning .
but it was another matter , whether he loved it ; and that he could not do , however great his regard , the simple reason being that it did not agree with him .
exacting occupation dragged at his nerves , it wore him out ; quite openly he confessed that he liked better to have his time free , not weighted with the leaden load of effort ; lying spacious before him , not divided up by obstacles one had to grit one ’ s teeth and conquer , one after the other . these conflicting sentiments on the subject of work had , strictly speaking , to be reconciled . is it , perhaps , possible , if he had been able to believe in work as a positive value , a self-justifying principle , believe in it in the very depth of his soul , even without being himself conscious of doing so , that his body as well as his spirit—first the spirit and through it the body as well—would have been able to devote itself to his task with more of joy and constancy , would have been able to find peace therein ?
here again is posed the question of hans castorp ’ s mediocrity or more than mediocrity , to which we would give no hard and fast answer .
for we do not set up as the young man ’ s encomiast , and prefer to leave room for the other view : namely , that his work stood somewhat in the way of his unclouded enjoyment of his maria mancini .
to military service he was not inclined .
his being revolted against it , and found ways of making difficulties .
it may be , too , that staff medical officer dr. eberding , who visited at harvestehuderstrasse , heard from consul tienappel , in the course of conversation , that young castorp was leaving home to begin his technical studies , and would find a call to the colours a very sensible interruption to his labours .
working slowly and deliberately—he kept up his soothing habit of porter breakfasts while he was away—he filled his brain with analytic and descriptive geometry , differential calculus , mechanics , projection , hydrostatic ; reckoned full and empty displacement , stability , trim moment , and metacentre ; and sometimes he got very sick of it .
his technical drawings , the draughts and designs of frames , waterlines and longitudinal projections , were not quite so good as the picturesque representation of the hansa on the high seas ; but wherever it was in place to call in the sense perceptions to help out the intellectual , wherever he could wash in the shadows and lay on the cross-sections in the conventional colours , there hans castorp showed more dexterity than most .
when he came home for the holidays , very clean , very well dressed , with a little red-blond moustache that became his sleepy , young patrician face , obviously en route to a considerable position in life , people looked at him , the people who concerned themselves with the affairs of the community and made it their business to know all about family and social relations—and that , in a self-governing city-state , meant most of the population—they looked him well over , his fellow citizens , and asked themselves what public rôle young castorp was destined to fill .
he had traditions , his name was old and good , they would certainly have to reckon with him one day , as a political factor .
some day he would sit in the assembly , or on the board of directors , he would help make the laws , he would occupy some honourable office and share the burdens of sovereignty . he would belong to the executive branch , perhaps , or the finance or building commission .
his voice would be listened to , his vote would count .
it would be interesting to see what party he would choose .
appearances were deceiving , but he did not look as a man does whom the democrats can count on ; and his likeness to his grandfather was unmistakable .
would he take after him , and be a drag , a conservative element ?
it was quite possible—but so was the opposite .
he was an engineer , studying ship-building ; on the technical side , in touch with world commerce .
he might turn out to be a radical , a reckless spender , a profane destroyer of old buildings and landscape beauties . he might be as unfettered as a jew , as irreverent as an american ; he might prefer a ruthless break with tradition to a considered development of natural resources ; he might incline to plunge the state into foolhardy experimentation . all that was conceivable .
was it in his blood to feel that their worships in the senate , before whom the double sentry at the rathaus presented arms , were likely to know best in all contingencies ; or would he side with the opposition in the assembly ?
in his blue eyes , under their reddish-brown brows , his fellow citizens read no answer to their curious questioning . and he probably knew none himself , hans castorp , this still unwritten page .
when he took the journey upon which we have encountered him , he was in his twenty-third year . he had spent four semesters at the dantzig polytechnic , four more at the technical schools of braunschweig and karlsruhe , and had just previously passed his first final , quite respectably , if without any fanfare of trumpets . and now he was preparing to enter the firm of tunder and wilms , as volunteer apprentice , in order to get his practical training in the ship-yards .
but at this point his life took the following turn .
he had had to work hard and steadily for his examination , and came home looking rather paler than a man of his blond , rosy type should do .
dr. heidekind scolded , and insisted on a change of air ; a complete change , not a stay at norderney or wyk on föhr—that would not mend matters this time , he said ; if they wanted his advice , it was that hans castorp should go for a few weeks to the high mountains before he took up his work in the yards . consul tienappel told his nephew and foster-son he approved of the plan , only that in that case they would part company for the summer , for wild horses couldn ’ t drag him into the high mountains .
they were not for him ; he required a reasonable atmospheric pressure , else he might get an attack . hans castorp would be good enough to go by himself—let him pay his cousin ziemssen a visit .
it was an obvious suggestion . joachim ziemssen was ill—not ill like hans castorp , but in all seriousness , critically . there had been a great scare , in fact .
he had always been subject to feverish catarrh , and one day he actually spat blood ; whereupon he had been rushed off to davos , heels over head , to his great distress and affliction , for he had just then arrived within sight of the goal of all his hopes . some semesters long , he had complied with the wish of his family and studied law ; then , yielding to irresistible inward urging , he had changed over , presented himself as ensign and been accepted .
and now , for the past five months , he had been stuck in the international sanatorium berghof ( directing physician hofrat behrens ) and was bored half sick , as he wrote home on postcards .
if hans castorp wanted to do himself a good turn before he entered his post at tunder and wilms ’ s , what more natural than that he should go up to davos and keep his poor cousin company for a while—it would be agreeable on both sides .
it was midsummer before he made up his mind to go . already the last week in july . he left for a stay of three weeks .
he had been so utterly weary , he had feared to oversleep ; but he was on his legs rather earlier than usual , and had a superfluity of leisure in which to perform the accustomed ritual of his morning toilet , in which a rubber tub , a wooden bowl of green lavender soap , and the accompanying little brush played the principal parts . he had even time to do some unpacking and moving in . as he covered his cheeks with scented lather and drew over them the blade of his silver-plated safety , he recalled his confused dreams and shook his head indulgently over so much nonsense , with the superior feeling a man has when shaving himself in the clear light of reason .
he did not feel precisely rested , yet had a sense of morning freshness .
with powdered cheeks , in his scotch-thread drawers and red morocco slippers , he walked out on the balcony , drying his hands . the balcony ran across the house and was divided into small separate compartments by opaque glass partitions , which did not quite reach to the balustrade .
the morning was cool and cloudy .
trails of mist lay motionless in front of the heights on one side and the other , while great cloud-masses , grey and white , hung down over the distant peaks .
patches and bands of blue showed here and there ; now and then a gleam of sunshine lighted up the village down in the valley , till it glistened whitely against the dark fir-covered slopes .
somewhere there was music , very likely in the same hotel where there had been a concert the evening before .
the subdued chords of a hymn floated up ; after a pause came a march .
hans castorp loved music from his heart ; it worked upon him in much the same way as did his breakfast porter , with deeply soothing , narcotic effect , tempting him to doze . he listened well pleased , his head on one side , his eyes a little bloodshot .
he could see below him the winding road up to the sanatorium , by which he had come the night before .
among the dewy grass of the sloping terrace short-stemmed , star-shaped gentians stood out .
a hall , with reclining-chairs and a galvanized roof , opened towards the south ; near it stood a flag-pole , painted reddish-brown , on which the flag fluttered open now and then on its cord . it was a fancy flag , green and white , with the caduceus , the emblem of healing , in the centre .
a woman was walking in the garden , an elderly lady , of melancholy , even tragic aspect .
dressed all in black , a black veil wound about her dishevelled grey-black hair , with wrinkled brow and coal-black eyes that had hanging pouches of skin beneath them , she moved with rapid , restless step along the garden paths , staring straight before her , her knees a little bent , her arms hanging stiffly down .
the ageing face in its southern pallor , with the large , wried mouth drawn down on one side , reminded hans castorp of a portrait he had once seen of a famous tragic actress . and strange it was to see how the pale , black-clad woman unconsciously matched her long , woeful pace to the music of the march .
he looked down upon her with pensive sympathy ; it seemed to him the sad apparition darkened the morning sunshine .
but in the same instant he became aware of something else , something audible : certain noises penetrating to his hearing from the room on the left of his own , which was occupied , joachim had said , by a russian couple .
hans castorp recalled having heard similar sounds the evening before , though his weariness had prevented him from heeding them : a struggling , a panting and giggling , the offensive nature of which could not long remain hidden to the young man , try as he good-naturedly did to put a harmless construction on them . perhaps something more or other than good nature was in play , something to which we give a variety of names , calling it now purity of soul , which sounds insipid ; again by that grave , beautiful name of chastity ; and yet again disparaging it as hypocrisy , as hating to look facts in the face ; even ascribing it to an obscure sense of awe and piety—and , in truth , something of all these was in hans castorp ’ s face and bearing as he listened .
with this mien , then , he drew back from the balcony into his room , in order not to listen further to proceedings which , for all the giggling that went with them , were plainly in dead earnest , even alarming . but from indoors the noise could be heard even more plainly . he seemed to hear a chase about the room ; a chair fell over ; someone was caught and seized ; loud kissing ensued—and the music below had changed to a waltz , a popular air whose hackneyed , melodious phrases accompanied the invisible scene .
hans castorp stood towel in hand and listened , against his better judgment .
and he began to blush through the powder ; for what he had all along seen coming was come , and the game had passed quite frankly over into the bestial .
he turned away and made as much noise as possible while he concluded his toilet .
well , at least they are married , as far as that goes , he said to himself .
but in broad daylight—it ’ s a bit thick !
but of course they are ill , or at least one of them , or they wouldn ’ t be here—that may be some excuse .
the scandalous part of it is , the walls are so thin one can ’ t help hearing everything . the place is shamefully jerry-built , of course .
what if i should see them , or even be introduced ? i simply couldn ’ t endure it !
here hans castorp remarked with surprise that the flush which had mounted in his freshly shaven cheek did not subside , nor its accompanying warmth : his face glowed with the same dry heat as on the evening before . he had got free of it in sleep , but the blush had made it set in again . he did not feel the friendlier for this discovery towards the wretched pair next door ; in fact he stuck out his lips and muttered a derogatory word in their direction , as he tried to cool his hot face by bathing it in cold water—and only made it glow the more .
he felt put out ; his voice vibrated with ill humour as he answered to his cousin ’ s knock on the wall ; and he appeared to joachim on his entrance like anything but a man refreshed and invigorated by a good night ’ s sleep .
well , that was your first night up here .
how did you find it ? he was dressed for out-of-doors , in sports clothes and stout boots , and carried his ulster over his arm . the outline of the flat bottle could be seen on the side pocket .
as yesterday , he wore no hat .
thanks , responded hans castorp , it was well enough , i won ’ t try to judge yet .
it ’ s annoying.— who is that dark woman down in the garden ?
joachim knew at once whom he meant .
oh , he said , that ’ s tous-les-deux . we all call her that up here , because it ’ s the only thing she says .
mexican , you know ; doesn ’ t know a word of german and hardly any french , just a few scraps .
she has been here for five weeks with her eldest son , a hopeless case , without much longer to go .
behrens says it is much like typhus , at the end—horrible for all concerned . well , two weeks ago the second son came up , to see his brother before the end—handsome as a picture ; both of them were that , with eyes like live coals— they fluttered the dovecots , i can tell you . he had been coughing a bit down below , but otherwise quite lively .
well , he no sooner gets up here than he begins to run a temperature , high fever , you know , .° . they put him to bed—and if he gets up again , behrens says , it will be more good luck than good management .
but it was high time he came , in any case , behrens says.—well , and since then the mother goes about—whenever she is not sitting with them—and if you speak to her , she just says : tous les deux ! she can ’ t say any more , and for the moment there is no one up here who understands spanish .
so that ’ s it , hans castorp said .
will she say it to me , when i get to know her , do you think ?
that will be queer—funny and weird at the same time , i mean . his eyes looked as they had yesterday , they felt hot and heavy , as if tired with weeping , and yet brilliant too , with the gleam that had been kindled in them yesterday at the sound of that strange , new cough on the part of the gentleman rider .
he had the feeling that he had been out of touch with yesterday since waking , and had only now picked up the threads again where he laid them down .
he told his cousin he was ready , sprinkling a few drops of lavender-water on his handkerchief as he spoke and dabbing his face with it , on the brow and under the eyes .
if you like , we can go to breakfast , tous les deux , he recklessly joked .
joachim looked with mildness at him , then smiled his enigmatic smile of mingled melancholy and mockery—or so it seemed , for he did not express himself otherwise .
after looking to his supply of cigars hans castorp took coat and stick , also , rather defiantly , his hat—he was far too sure of himself and his station in life to alter his ways and acquire new ones for a mere three weeks ’ visit—and they went out and down the steps . in the corridor joachim pointed to this and that door and gave the names of the occupants—there were german names , but also all sorts of foreign ones—with brief comments on them and the seriousness of their cases .
they met people already coming back from breakfast , and when joachim said good-morning , hans castorp courteously lifted his hat .
he was tense and nervous , as a young man is when about to present himself before strangers—when , that is , he is conscious that his eyes are heavy and his face red . the last , however , was only true in part , for he was rather pale than otherwise .
before i forget it , he said abruptly , you may introduce me to the lady in the garden if you like , i mean if it happens that way , i have no objection .
she would just say : tous les deux ’ to me , and i shouldn ’ t mind it , being prepared , and knowing what it means—i should know how to look .
but i don ’ t wish to know the russian pair , do you hear ?
i expressly don ’ t wish it .
they are a very ill-behaved lot . if i must live for three weeks next door to them , and nothing else could be arranged , at least i needn ’ t know them . i am justified in that , and i simply and explicitly decline .
very good , joachim said .
did they disturb you ? yes , they are barbarians , more or less ; uncivilized , i told you so before . he comes to the table in a leather jacket , very shabby , i always wonder behrens doesn ’ t make a row .
and she isn ’ t the cleanest in this world , with her feather hat .
you may make yourself quite easy , they sit at the bad ’ russian table , a long way off us—there is a good ’ russian table , too , you see , where the nicer russians sit—and there is not much chance of you coming into contact with them , even if you wanted to .
it is not very easy to make acquaintance here , partly from the fact that there are so many foreigners .
personally , as long as i ’ ve been here , i know very few .
which of the two is ill ?
the man i think .
they passed among the hat- and coat-racks and entered the light , low-vaulted hall , where there was a buzzing of voices , a clattering of dishes , and a running to and fro of waitresses with steaming jugs .
there were seven tables , all but two of them standing lengthwise of the room .
they were good-sized , seating each ten persons , though not all of them were at present full . a few steps diagonally into the room , and they stood at their places ; hans castorp ’ s was at the end of a table placed between the two crosswise ones .
erect behind his chair , he bowed stiffly but amiably to each table-mate in turn , as joachim formally presented him ; hardly seeing them , much less having their names penetrate his mind .
he caught but a single name and person—frau stöhr , whom he perceived to have a red face and greasy ash-blond hair . looking at her he could quite credit the malapropisms joachim told of . her face expressed nothing but ill-nature and ignorance .
he sat down , observing as he did so that early breakfast was taken seriously up here . there were pots of marmalade and honey , basins of rice and oatmeal porridge , dishes of cold meat and scrambled eggs ; a plenitude of butter , a gruyère cheese dropping moisture under a glass bell . a bowl of fresh and dried fruits stood in the centre of the table .
a waitress in black and white asked hans castorp whether he would drink coffee , cocoa or tea .
she was small as a child , with a long , oldish face—a dwarf , he realized with a start .
he looked at his cousin , who only shrugged indifferently with brows and shoulders , as though to say : well , what of it ?
so he adjusted himself as speedily as possible to the fact that he was being served by a dwarf , and put special consideration into his voice as he asked for tea .
then he began eating rice with cinnamon and sugar , his eyes roving over the table full of other inviting viands , and over the guests at the six remaining tables , joachim ’ s companions and fellow victims , who were all inwardly infected , and now sat there breakfasting . the hall was done in that modern style which knows how to give just the right touch of individuality to something in reality very simple .
it was rather shallow in proportion to its length , and opened in great arched bays into a sort of lobby surrounding it , in which serving-tables were placed .
the pillars were faced halfway up with wood finished to look like sandalwood , the upper part white-enamelled , like the ceiling and upper half of the walls . they were stenciled in gay-coloured bands of simple and lively designs which were repeated on the girders of the vaulted ceiling . the room was further enlivened by several electric chandeliers in bright brass , consisting of three rings placed horizontally one over the other and held together by delicate woven work , the lowest ring set with globes of milky glass like little moons .
there were four glass doors , two on the opposite wall , opening on the verandah , a third at the bottom of the room on the left , leading into the front hall , and a fourth , by which hans castorp had entered through a vestibule , as joachim had brought him down a different stair from the one they had used yesterday evening .
he had on his right a plain-looking woman in black , with a dull flush on her cheeks , the skin of which was downy-looking , as an older person ’ s often is . she looked to him like a seamstress or home dressmaker , the idea being suggested by the fact that she took only coffee and buttered rolls for breakfast ; since his childhood he had always somehow associated dressmakers with coffee and buttered rolls .
on his left sat an english spinster , also well on in years , very ugly , with frozen , withered-looking fingers . she sat reading her home letters , which were written in round hand , and drinking tea the colour of blood .
next her was joachim , and then frau stöhr , in a woollen blouse of scotch plaid . she held her left hand doubled up in a fist near her cheek as she ate , and drew her upper lip back from her long , narrow , rodent-like teeth when she spoke , obviously trying to make an impression of culture and refinement .
a young man with thin moustaches sat next beyond . his facial expression was of one with something bad-tasting in his mouth , and he ate without a word . he had come in after hans castorp was already seated , with his chin sunk on his breast ; and sat down so , without even lifting his head in greeting , seeming by his bearing plumply to decline being made acquainted with the new guest .
he was , perhaps , too ill to have thought of or care for appearances , or even to take any interest in his surroundings .
opposite him there had sat for a short time a very lean , light-blonde girl who emptied a bottle of yogurt on her plate , ladled it up with a spoon , and took herself off .
the conversation at table was not lively .
joachim talked politely with frau stöhr , inquired after her condition and heard with proper solicitude that it was unsatisfactory .
she complained of relaxation .
and she had had .° when she got up that morning— what was she likely to have by afternoon ? the dressmaker confessed to the same temperature , but she on the contrary felt excited , tense , and restless , as though some important event were about to happen , which was certainly not the case ; the excitation was purely physical , quite without emotional grounds . hans castorp thought to himself that she could not be a dressmaker after all ; she spoke too correctly , even pedantically .
he found her excitation , or rather the expression of it , somehow unsuitable , almost offensive , in so homely and insignificant a creature . he asked her and frau stöhr , one after the other , how long they had been up here , and found that one had five , the other seven months to her credit . then he mustered his english to inquire of his neighbour on the right what sort of tea she was drinking ( it was made of rose-hips ) and if it tasted good , which she almost passionately affirmed ; then he watched people coming and going in the room ; the first breakfast , it appeared , was not regarded as a regular meal , in any strict sense .
he had been a little afraid of unpleasant impressions , but found himself agreeably disappointed . the room was lively , one had not the least feeling of being in a place of suffering .
tanned young people of both sexes came in humming , spoke to the waitresses , and fell to upon the viands with robust appetite .
there were older people , married couples , a whole family with children , speaking russian , and half-grown lads .
the women wore chiefly close-fitting jackets of wool or silk—the so-called sweater—in white or colours , with turnover collars and side pockets ; they would stand with hands thrust deep in these pockets , and talk—it looked very pretty .
at some tables photographs were being handed about—amateur photography , no doubt—at another stamps were being exchanged .
the talk was of the weather , of how one had slept , of what one had measured in the mouth on rising .
nearly everybody seemed in good spirits , probably on no other grounds than that they were in numerous company and had no immediate cares .
here and there , indeed , sat someone who rested his head on his hand and stared before him .
they let him stare , and paid no heed .
hans castorp gave a sudden angry start . a door was slammed—it was the one on the left , leading into the hall , and someone had let it fall shut , or even banged it , a thing he detested ; he had never been able to endure it .
whether from his upbringing , or out of a natural idiosyncrasy , he loathed the slamming of doors , and could have struck the guilty person .
in this case , the door was filled in above with small glass panes , which augmented the shock with their ringing and rattling .
oh , come , he thought angrily , what kind of damned carelessness was that ?
but at the same time the seamstress addressed him with a remark , and he had no time to see who the transgressor had been . deep creases furrowed his blond brows , and his face was contorted as he turned to reply to his neighbour .
joachim asked whether the doctors had come through .
yes , someone answered , they had been there once and left the room just as the cousins entered . then it would be better not to wait , joachim thought .
an opportunity for introducing his cousin would surely come in the course of the day .
but at the door they nearly ran into hofrat behrens , as he entered with hasty steps , followed by dr. krokowski .
that might have been rough on all of our corns !
he spoke with a strong low-saxon accent , broad and mouthingly .
oh , so here you are , he addressed hans castorp , whom joachim , heels together , presented .
he reached the young man a hand the size of a shovel .
he was some three heads taller than dr. krokowski ; a bony man , his hair already quite white ; his neck stuck out , his large , goggling bloodshot blue eyes were swimming in tears ; he had a snub nose , and a close-trimmed little moustache , which made a crooked line because his upper lip was drawn up on one side .
what joachim had said about his cheeks was fully borne out ; they were really purple , and set off his head garishly against the white surgeon ’ s coat he wore , a belted smock of more than kneelength , beneath which showed striped trousers and a pair of enormous feet in rather worn yellow laced boots . dr. krokowski too was in professional garb ; but his smock was of some shiny black stuff and made like a shirt , with elastic bands at the wrists .
his manner suggested that he was present solely in his capacity as assistant ; he took no part in the greeting , but a certain expression at the corners of his mouth betrayed the fact that he felt the strain of his subordinate position . the hofrat asked , motioning with his hand from one to the other of the two young men and looking at them with his bloodshot eyes .
is he going to follow the drums like you ?
he addressed joachim , jerking his head at hans castorp .
i could tell as soon as i saw you—he spoke now directly to the young man—that you were a layman ; there ’ s something civilian and comfortable about you , not like our sabre-rattling corporal here !
you ’ d be a better patient than he is , i ’ ll wager .
i can tell by looking at people , you know , whether they ’ ll make good patients or not ; it takes talent , everything takes talent—and this myrmidon here hasn ’ t a spark .
maybe he shows up on the parade-ground , for aught i know ; but he ’ s no good a ’ being ill. will you believe it , he ’ s always wanting to clear out !
badgers me all the time , simply can ’ t wait to get down there and be skinned alive . there ’ s doggedness for you !
won ’ t give us even a measly half-a-year !
… well , your cousin will appreciate us , even if you don ’ t . he ’ ll get some fun out of it .
there ’ s no shortage in the lady market here , either ; we have the most charming females .
at least , some of them are very picturesque on the outside . but you ought to have better colour yourself , you know , if you want to please the sex .
the golden tree of life is green , as the poet says—but it ’ s a poor colour for the complexion , all the same .
totally anæmic , of course , he broke off , and without more ado put up his index and middle fingers and drew down hans castorp ’ s eyelid . totally anæmic , as i was saying .
you know it wasn ’ t such a bad idea of yours to let your native hamburg shift for itself awhile .
but if i may take the occasion to give you the benefit of my poor opinion—sine pecunia , you understand , quite sine pecunia—i would suggest that you do just as your cousin does , while you are up here . you couldn ’ t turn a better trick than to behave for the time as though you had a slight tuberculosis pulmonum , and put on a little flesh . it ’ s curious about the metabolism of protein with us up here .
then get on with the out-of-doors exercise—but not more than half an hour , you hear ?
and afterwards stick the quicksilver cigar in your face , eh ? and be good and write it down , ziemssen ! that ’ s a conscientious lad !
saturday i ’ ll look at the curve .
your cousin better measure too .
measuring can ’ t hurt anybody . have a good time—morning— morning— krokowski joined him as he sailed off down the hall , swinging his arms palms backward , directing to right and left the question about sleeping well , which was answered on all sides in the affirmative .
very nice man , hans castorp said , as after a friendly nod to the lame concierge , who was sorting letters in his lodge , they passed out into the open air .
the main entrance was on the south-west side of the white building , the central portion of which was a storey higher than the wings , and crowned by a turret with a roof of slatecoloured tin .
you did not issue from this side into the hedged-in garden , but were immediately in the open , in sight of the steep mountain meadows , dotted with single fir-trees of moderate size , and writhen , stunted pines . the way they took—it was the only one they could take , outside the drive going down to the valley—rose by a gentle ascent to the left , behind the sanatorium , past the kitchen and domestic offices , where huge dustbins stood at the area rails . thence it led in the same direction for a goodish piece , then made a sharp bend to the right and mounted more rapidly along the thinly wooded slopes .
it was a reddish path , firm and yet rather moist underfoot , with boulders here and there along the edge .
the cousins were by no means alone upon it : guests who had finished breakfast not long after them followed hard upon their steps , and groups of others , already returning , approached with the stalking gait of people descending a steep incline .
very nice man , repeated hans castorp .
he has such a flow of words i enjoy listening to him .
quicksilver cigar ’ was capital , i got it at once.—but i ’ ll just light up a real one , he said , pausing , i can ’ t hold out any longer .
i haven ’ t had a proper smoke since yesterday after luncheon .
excuse me a minute .
he opened his automobile-leather case , with its silver monogram , and drew out a maria mancini , a beautiful specimen of the first layer , flattened on one side as he particularly liked it ; he cut off the tip slantingly with a sharp little tool he wore on his watch-chain , then , striking a tiny flame with his pocket apparatus , puffed with concentration at the long , blunt-ended cigar until it was alight .
now , as far as i ’ m concerned , we can get on with the exercise .
i never do smoke , answered joachim ; why should i begin up here .
i don ’ t understand it , hans castorp said .
i never can understand how anybody can not smoke—it deprives a man of the best part of life , so to speak—or at least of a first-class pleasure . when i wake in the morning , i feel glad at the thought of being able to smoke all day , and when i eat , i look forward to smoking afterwards ; i might almost say i only eat for the sake of being able to smoke—though of course that is more or less of an exaggeration .
but a day without tobacco would be flat , stale , and unprofitable , as far as i am concerned . if i had to say to myself to-morrow : no smoke to-day ’ —i believe i shouldn ’ t find the courage to get up—on my honour , i ’ d stop in bed .
but when a man has a good cigar in his mouth—of course it mustn ’ t have a side draught or not draw well , that is extremely irritating—but with a good cigar in his mouth a man is perfectly safe , nothing can touch him—literally .
it ’ s just like lying on the beach : when you lie on the beach , why , you lie on the beach , don ’ t you ? —you don ’ t require anything else , in the line of work or amusement either.—people smoke all over the world , thank goodness ; there is nowhere one could get to , so far as i know , where the habit hasn ’ t penetrated .
even polar expeditions fit themselves out with supplies of tobacco to help them carry on .
but after all , joachim said , it is rather flabby-minded of you to be so dependent on it . behrens is right , you are certainly a civilian .
he meant it for a sort of compliment , i dare say ; but the truth is , you are a civilian—incurable .
but then , you are healthy , you can do what you like , he added , and his eyes took on their tired look .
yes , healthy except for the anaemia , said hans castorp .
that was certainly straight from the shoulder , his telling me i look green .
but it is true—i ’ ve noticed myself that i look green in comparison with the rest of you up here , though it never struck me down home .
and it was nice of him to give me advice gratis like that— sine pecunia , as he put it .
i ’ ll gladly undertake to do as he says , and live just as you do . after all , how else should i do while i ’ m up here ?
and it can ’ t do me any harm ; suppose i do put on a little flesh , then , in god ’ s name—though it sounds a bit disgusting , you will admit . joachim coughed slightly now and then as they walked , it seemed to strain him to go uphill .
when he did so for the third time , he paused and stood still with a frown .
go on ahead , he said .
hans castorp hastened to do so , without looking round .
then he slackened his pace , and finally almost stopped , as it seemed to him he must have got a good distance ahead of joachim .
but he did not look round .
a troop of guests of both sexes approached him . he had seen them coming along the level path half-way up the slope ; now they were stalking downhill directly towards him ; he heard their voices .
they were six or seven persons of various ages : some in the bloom of youth , others rather older . he took a good look at them , from the side , as he walked with bent head , thinking about joachim . they were tanned and bareheaded , the women in sweaters , the men mostly without overcoats or even walkingsticks , all of them like people who have just gone casually out for a turn in the open .
going downhill involves no sustained muscular effort , only an agreeable process of putting on the brakes in order not to finish by running and tripping head over heels ; it is really nothing more than just letting yourself go ; and thus the gait of these people had something loose-jointed and flighty about it , which communicated itself to the appearance of the whole group and made one almost wish to be of their lively party . they came close up to him , he saw their faces clearly .
no , they were not all brown : two of the ladies were , on the contrary , distinctly pale ; one of them thin as a lath , and ivory-white of complexion , the other shorter and plump , disfigured by freckles . they all looked at him , smiling rather boldly .
a tall young girl in a green sweater , with untidy hair and foolish , half-open eyes , brushed past hans castorp , nearly touching him with her arm .
yes , she did though ; not with her mouth , indeed , for she did not pucker the lips , but held them firmly closed .
she whistled from somewhere inside , and looked at him with her silly , half-shut eyes—it was an extraordinarily unpleasant whistle , harsh and penetrating , yet hollow-sounding ; a long-drawn-out note , falling at the end , like the sound made by those rubber pigs one buys at fairs , that give out the air in a wailing key as they collapse .
the sound issued , inexplicably , from her breast—and then , with her troop , she had passed on . hans castorp stood and stared .
in a moment he turned round , understanding at least so much , that the atrocious thing must have been a joke , a put-up job ; for he saw over his shoulder that they were laughing as they went , that a stodgy , thick-lipped youth , whose coat was turned up in an unseemly way about him so that he could put both hands in his trouser pockets , turned his head and laughed quite openly . he had greeted the group with his usual punctiliousness , almost pausing , and bowing with heels together ; now he came mildly up to his cousin . why are you making such a face ?
she whistled , answered hans castorp .
she whistled out of her inside as she passed .
will you have the goodness to explain to me how ?
joachim said , and laughed curtly .
that was hermine kleefeld , she whistles with her pneumothorax .
he felt wrought up , without knowing why .
his voice was between laughter and tears as he added : you can ’ t expect me to understand your lingo .
oh , come along , joachim said .
i can explain it to you as we go .
you looked rooted to the spot ! it ’ s a surgical operation , they often perform it up here .
behrens is a regular dab at it .
when one of the lungs is very much affected , you understand , and the other one fairly healthy , they make the bad one stop functioning for a while , to give it a rest .
that is to say , they make an incision here , somewhere on the side , i don ’ t know the precise place , but behrens has it down fine .
then they fill you up with gas—nitrogen , you know—and that puts the cheesy part of the lung out of operation .
the gas doesn ’ t last long , of course ; it has to be renewed every two weeks ; they fill you up again , as it were .
now , if that keeps on a year or two , and all goes well , the lung gets healed .
not always , of course ; it ’ s a risky business .
but they say they have had a good deal of success with it .
those people you saw just now all have it .
that was frau iltis , with the freckles , and the thin , pale one was fräulein levi , that had to lie so long in bed , you know .
they have formed a group , for of course a thing like the pneumothorax brings people together . they call themselves the half-lung club ; everybody knows them by that name . and hermine kleefeld is the pride of the club , because she can whistle with hers .
i can ’ t tell you how it is done , and she herself can ’ t exactly describe it . but when she has been walking rather fast , she can make it whistle , and of course she does it to frighten people , especially when they are new to the place . also , i believe she uses up nitrogen when she does it , for she has to be refilled once a week .
then it was that hans castorp laughed . his excitement , while joachim was speaking , had fixed for its outlet upon laughter rather than tears ; and he laughed as he walked , his hand over his eyes , his shoulders bent , shaken by a succession of subdued chuckles .
he asked as soon as he could speak . his voice sounded weak and tearful with suppressed laughter . have they any by-laws ?
pity you aren ’ t a member , you could get me in as a guest , as—as associate half-lunger.—you ought to ask behrens to put you out of commission , then perhaps you could learn to whistle too ; it must be something one could learn—well , that ’ s the funniest thing ever i heard in my life !
he finished , heaving a deep sigh .
i beg your pardon for speaking of it like this , but they seem very jolly over it themselves , your pneumatic friends . the way they were coming along—and to think that was the half-lung club .
it was utter cheek—will you tell me why they behave so cheekily ?
joachim sought for a reply .
good lord , he said , they are so free—i mean , they are so young , and time is nothing to them , and then they may die—perhaps—why should they make a long face ? sometimes i think being ill and dying aren ’ t serious at all just a sort of loafing about and wasting time ; life is only serious down below .
you will get to understand that after a while , but not until you have spent some time up here .
surely , surely , hans castorp said .
i ’ m sure i shall . i already feel great interest in the life up here , and when one is interested , the understanding follows.—but what is the matter with me—it doesn ’ t taste good , he said , and took his cigar out of his mouth to look at it . i ’ ve been asking myself all this time what the matter was , and now i see it is maria .
she tastes like papier mâché , i do assure you—precisely as when one has a spoilt digestion .
i can ’ t understand it . i did eat more than usual for breakfast , but that can not be the reason , for she usually tastes particularly good after a too hearty meal . do you think it is because i had such a disturbed night ?
no , i really can ’ t stick it , he said , after another attempt .
every pull is a disappointment , there is no sense in forcing it . and after a hesitating moment he tossed the cigar off down the slope , among the wet pine-boughs . do you know what i think it has to do with ?
i feel convinced it is connected with this damned heat i feel all the time in my face .
i feel as though i were blushing the whole time , deuce take it !
did you have anything like that when you first came ? i was rather queer at first .
don ’ t think too much of it . i told you it isn ’ t so easy to accustom oneself to the life up here .
but you will get right again after a bit .
look , that bench is in a pretty place . let ’ s sit down awhile and then go home . i must take my cure .
the path had become level . it ran now in the direction of davos-platz , some third of the height , and kept a continuous view , between high , sparse , wind-blown pines , of the settlement below , gleaming whitely in the bright air .
the bench on which they sat leaned against the steep wall of the mountain-side , and near them a spring in an open wooden trough ran gurgling and plashing to the valley .
joachim was for instructing his cousin in the names of the mist-wreathed alpine heights which seemed to enclose the valley on the south , pointing them out in turn with his alpenstock . but hans castorp gave the mountains only a fleeting glance . he sat bent over , tracing figures on the ground with the ferrule of his cityish silvermounted walking-stick .
there were other things he wanted to know . what i meant to ask you , he began , the case in my room had died just before i got here ; have there been many deaths , since you came ?
several , certainly , answered joachim .
but they are very discreetly managed , you understand ; you hear nothing of them , or only by chance afterwards ; everything is kept strictly private when there is a death , out of regard for the other patients , especially the ladies , who might easily get a shock .
you don ’ t notice it , even when somebody dies next door . the coffin is brought very early in the morning , while you are asleep , and the person in question is fetched away at a suitable time too—for instance , while we are eating . h ’ m , said hans castorp , and continued to draw .
yes—for the most part . but lately—let me see , wait a minute , it might be possibly eight weeks ago— then you can hardly say lately , hans castorp pounced on him crisply .
well , not lately , then , since you ’ re so precise . i was just trying to reckon .
it was when they brought the sacrament to little hujus , barbara hujus—she was a catholic—the last sacrament , you know , extreme unction . she was still about when i first came up here , and she could be wildly hilarious , regularly giggly , like a little kid . but after that it went pretty fast with her , she didn ’ t get up any more—her room was three doors off mine—and then her parents arrived , and now the priest was coming to her .
but i had gone to sleep in the afternoon rest and overslept myself , i hadn ’ t heard the gong and was a quarter of an hour late . so that at the decisive moment i wasn ’ t where all the others were , but behind the scenes , as you call it ; as i go along the corridor , they come toward me , in their lace robes , with the cross in front , a gold cross with lanterns—it made me think of the schellenbaum they march with , in front of the recruits . what sort of comparison is that ?
hans castorp asked , severely .
they came towards me , marching , quick step , three of them , so far as i remember : the man with the cross , the priest , with glasses on his nose , and a boy with a censer . the priest was holding the sacrament to his breast , it was covered up , and he had his head bent on one side and looked very sanctified—it is their holy of holies , of course . exactly , hans castorp said .
and just for that reason i wonder at your making the comparison you did . yes , but wait a bit—if you had been there , you wouldn ’ t have known what kind of face you would make remembering it afterwards .
it was the sort of thing to give you bad dreams—
like this : i ask myself how i am supposed to behave , under the circumstances .
i had no hat to take off—
hans castorp interrupted him again .
you see now , one ought to wear a hat .
naturally i ’ ve noticed that none of you do up here ; but you should , so you can have something to take off when it is proper to do so .
well , but what then ?
i stood against the wall , joachim went on , as respectfully as i could , and bent over a little when they were by me—it was just at little hujus ’ s door , number twentyeight .
the priest seemed to be pleased that i saluted ; he acknowledged very courteously and took off his cap .
but at the same time they came to a stop , and the ministrant with the censer knocks , and lifts the latch , and makes way for his superior to enter .
just try to imagine my sensations , and how frightened i was ! the minute the priest sets his foot over the threshold , there begins a hullabaloo from inside , a screaming such as you never heard the like of , three or four times running , and then a shriek—on and on without stopping , at the top of her lungs : ah-h-h-h ! so full of horror and rebellion , and anguish , and—well , perfectly indescribable .
hans castorp had turned with violence to face his cousin .
was that the hujus ?
and how do you mean—out of a cellar ?
she had crawled down under the covers , said joachim .
imagine how i felt !
the priest stood on the threshold and spoke soothingly , i can see now just how he stuck his head out and drew it back again while he talked .
the cross-bearer and the acolyte hesitated , and couldn ’ t get in .
i could see between them into the room .
it was just like yours and mine , the bed on the side wall left of the door , and people were standing at the head , the relatives of course , the parents , talking soothingly at the bed , where you could see nothing but a formless mass that was begging and protesting horribly , and kicking about with its legs .
you say she kicked ?
with all her might . but it did her no good , she had to take the sacrament . the priest went up to her , and the two others went inside the room , and the door closed .
but first i saw little hujus ’ s head come up for a second , a shock of blond hair , and look at the priest with staring eyes , that were without any colour , and then with a wail go down under the sheet again . and you tell me all that now for the first time ?
hans castorp said , after a pause .
i can ’ t understand how you came not to speak of it yesterday evening .
but , good lord , she must have had strength , to defend herself like that .
they ought not to fetch the priest before one is quite weak .
she was weak enough !
it was only the fright gave her so much strength . she was in a fearful state when she saw she was going to die ; and she was such a young girl , it was excusable , after all .
but grown men behave like that too , sometimes , and it ’ s deplorably feeble of them , of course .
behrens knows how to treat them , he takes just the right tone in such cases .
what kind of tone ?
hans castorp asked with drawn brows .
don ’ t behave like that , he tells them , joachim answered .
at least , that is what he told somebody lately—we heard it from the directress , who was present and helped to hold the man .
he was one of those who make a regular scene at the end , and simply won ’ t die .
so behrens brought him up with a round turn : do me the favour not to behave like that , he said to him ; and the patient became quite calm and died as quietly as you please .
hans castorp slapped his thigh and threw himself back against the bench , looking up at the sky .
i say , that ’ s pretty steep , he cried .
goes at him like that , and simply tells him not to behave that way !
to a dying man !
but after all , a dying man has something in a way—sacred about him .
one can ’ t just—perfectly coolly , like that—a dying man is sort of holy , i should think !
i don ’ t deny it , said joachim .
no , persisted hans castorp , with a violence out of proportion to the opposition he met , i insist that a dying man is above any chap that is going about and laughing and earning his living and eating his three meals a day .
it isn ’ t good enough—his voice quavered—it isn ’ t good enough , for one to calmly—just calmly—his words trailed off in a fit of laughter that seized and overcame him , the laughter of yesterday , a profound , illimitable , body-shaking laughter , that shut up his eyes and made tears well from beneath their lids .
keep quiet , he whispered , and nudged his uncontrollably hilarious cousin in the side .
hans castorp looked up through tears .
a stranger was approaching them from the left , a dark man of graceful carriage , with curling black moustaches , wearing light-coloured check trousers . he exchanged a good-morning with joachim in accents agreeable and precise , and then remained standing before them in an easy posture , leaning on his cane , with his legs crossed .
his age would have been hard to say , probably between thirty and forty ; for though he gave an impression of youthfulness , yet the hair on his temples was sprinkled with silver and gone quite thin on his head . two bald bays ran along the narrow scanty parting , and added to the height of his forehead .
his clothing , loose trousers in light yellowish checks , and too long , double-breasted pilot coat , with very wide lapels , made no slightest claim to elegance ; and his stand-up collar , with rounding corners , was rough on the edges from frequent washing . his black cravat showed wear , and he wore no cuffs , as hans castorp saw at once from the lax way the sleeve hung round the wrist .
but despite all that , he knew he had a gentleman before him : the stranger ’ s easy , even charming pose and cultured expression left no doubt of that .
yet by this mingling of shabbiness and grace , by the black eyes and softly waving moustaches , hans castorp was irresistibly reminded of certain foreign musicians who used to come to hamburg at christmas to play in the streets before people ’ s doors . he could see them rolling up their velvet eyes and holding out their soft hats for the coins tossed from the windows .
thus he was not surprised at the name he heard , as joachim rose from the bench and in some embarrassment presented him : my cousin castorp , herr settembrini . hans castorp had got up at the same time , the traces of his burst of hilarity still on his face .
but the italian courteously bade them both not to disturb themselves , and made them sit down again , while he maintained his easy pose before them . he smiled standing there and looking at the cousins , in particular at hans castorp ; a smile that was a fine , almost mocking , deepening and crisping of one corner of the mouth , just at the point where the full moustache made its beautiful upward curve . it had upon the cousins a singular effect : it somehow constrained them to mental alertness and clarity ; it sobered the reeling hans castorp in a twinkling , and made him ashamed .
a blue sky , a smiling sun—with an easy , adequate motion of the arm he raised a small , yellowish-skinned hand to the heavens , and sent a lively glance upward after it—one could almost forget where one is .
he spoke without accent , only the precise enunciation betrayed the foreigner .
his lips seemed to take a certain pleasure in forming the words .
it was most agreeable to hear him .
you had a pleasant journey hither , i hope ?
he turned to hans castorp .
and do you already know your fate—i mean has the mournful ceremony of the first examination taken place ?
here , if he had really been expecting a reply he should have paused ; he had put his question , and hans castorp prepared to answer .
but he went on : did you get off easily ?
one might put—here he paused a second , and the crisping at the corner of his mouth grew crisper—more than one interpretation upon your laughter .
how many months have our minos and rhadamanthus knocked you down for ?
the slang phrase sounded droll on his lips .
hans castorp laughed , astonished , at the same time racking his brains to remember who minos and rhadamanthus were .
he answered : not at all—no , really , you are under a misapprehension , herr septem— settembrini , corrected the italian , clearly and with emphasis , making as he spoke a mocking bow .
herr settembrini—i beg your pardon .
no , you are mistaken .
really i am not ill. i have only come on a visit to my cousin ziemssen for a few weeks , and shall take advantage of the opportunity to get a good rest—
you don ’ t say ?
here i have climbed up some five thousand feet to get here—
upon my honour , it was an illusion , the italian said , with a decisive-wave of the hand .
he said to joachim , who , no little gratified at this method of address , thought to hide his satisfaction , and answered reflectively :
yes , yes , yes , he said , repeating the word three times , with a sharp s , turning to hans castorp again as he spoke , and then , in the same measured way , clucking three times with his tongue against his palate .
he looked the newcomer so steadfastly in the face that his eyes grew fixed in a stare ; then , becoming lively again , he went on : so you come up quite of your own free will to us sunken ones , and mean to bestow upon us the pleasure of your company for some little while ?
i don ’ t mean precisely .
three weeks , hans castorp said , rather pridefully , as he saw himself the object of envy .
our smallest unit is the month . we reckon in the grand style—that is a privilege we shadows have . we possess other such ; they are all of the same quality .
herr settembrini is a literary man , joachim explained , rather self-consciously .
he got more self-conscious still , for his cousin looked at him in amazement , as though to say : carducci ?
yes , the italian said , nodding .
i had the honour of telling your countrymen the story of our great poet and freethinker , when his life had drawn to a close .
settembrini ’ s eyebrows went up .
oh , he said , so you call on the devil to witness that sentiment—the devil incarnate , satan himself ?
he knew no italian , and the rest of it sounded no less uncomfortable , and reminded him of sunday sermons , though delivered quite casually , in a light , even jesting tone .
the demands made to-day on a man in my profession are simply enormous . it is better not to have too clear an idea of their magnitude , it might take away one ’ s courage : no , it ’ s no joke .
so many fine , self-denying spirits have refrained .
then you have already made his acquaintance ?
you have made his acquaintance ?
hans castorp answered in the affirmative .
i am beginning to suspect that you like him , too .
i don ’ t know , really , herr settembrini .
i am inclined to look at people and say : so that ’ s you , is it ?
you felt that i spoke maliciously , just now . if i did , perhaps it was not without intent to teach .
we humanists have all of us a pedagogic itch .
humanism and schoolmasters—there is a historical connexion between them , and it rests upon psychological fact : the office of schoolmaster should not— can not — be taken from the humanist , for the tradition of the beauty and dignity of man rests in his hands .
the priest , who in troubled and inhuman times arrogated to himself the office of guide to youth , has been dismissed ; since when , my dear sirs , no special type of teacher has arisen .
the humanistic grammar-school—you may call me reactionary , engineer , but in abstracto , generally speaking , you understand , i remain an adherent—
he continued in the lift to expatiate upon this theme , and left off only when the cousins got out as the second storey was reached .
he himself went up to the third , where he had , joachim said , a little back room .
he hasn ’ t much money , i suppose , hans castorp said , entering joachim ’ s room , which looked precisely like his own .
no , i suppose not , joachim answered , or only so much as just makes his stay possible . his father was a literary man too , you know , and , i believe , his grandfather
yes , of course , hans castorp said .
is he seriously ill ?
not dangerously , so far as i know , but obstinate , keeps coming back .
he has had it for years , and goes away in between , but soon has to return again .
so frightfully keen on work as he seems to be !
enormously chatty , goes from one thing to another so easily .
rather objectionable , though , it seemed to me , with that girl . i was quite put off , for the moment . but when he talked about human dignity , afterwards , i thought it was great—sounded like an address .
do you see much of him ?
he had taken a small thermometer from a red leather , velvet-lined case on his table , and put the mercury-filled end under his tongue on the left side , so that the glass instrument stuck slantingly upwards out of his mouth . then he changed into indoor clothes , put on shoes and a braided jacket , took a printed form and pencil from his table , also a book , a russian grammar—for he was studying russian with the idea that it would be of advantage to him in the service—and , thus equipped , took his place in the reclining-chair on his balcony , throwing his camel ’ s-hair rug lightly across his feet . it was scarcely needed .
during the last quarter-hour the layer of cloud had grown steadily thinner , and now the sun broke through in summerlike warmth , so dazzlingly that joachim protected his head with a white linen shade which was fastened to the arm of his chair , and furnished with a device by means of which it could be adjusted to the position of the sun .
hans castorp praised this contrivance .
he wished to await the result of joachim ’ s measurement , and meanwhile looked about to see how everything was done : observed the fur-lined sleeping-sack that stood against the wall in a corner of the loggia , for joachim to use on cold days ; and gazed down into the garden , with his elbows on the balustrade . the general rest-hall was populated by reclining patients , reading , writing , or conversing . he could see only a part of the interior , some four or five chairs .
how long does that go on ?
he asked , turning round .
joachim raised seven fingers .
but they must be up !
joachim shook his head .
a little later he took the thermometer out of his mouth , looked at it , and said : yes , when you watch it , the time , it goes very slowly .
i quite like the measuring , four times a day ; for then you know what a minute—or seven of them actually amounts to , up here in this place , where the seven days of the week whisk by the way they do ! you say actually , hans castorp answered . he sat with one leg flung over the balustrade , and his eyes looked bloodshot .
when it seems long to you , then it is long ; when it seems short , why , then it is short .
but how long , or how short , it actually is , that nobody knows .
he was unaccustomed to philosophize , yet somehow felt an impulse to do so .
how so ? —we do measure it .
we have watches and calendars for the purpose ; and when a month is up , why , then up it is , for you , and for me , and for all of us . wait , said hans castorp .
a minute , then , is as long as it seems to you when you measure yourself ?
a minute is as long—it lasts as long—as it takes the second hand of my watch to complete a circuit .
but it takes such a varied length of time—to our senses !
and as a matter of fact—i say taking it just as a matter of fact , he repeated , pressing his forefinger so hard against his nose that he bent the end of it quite round , it is motion , isn ’ t it , motion in space ?
that means that we measure time by space . but that is no better than measuring space by time , a thing only very unscientific people do .
from hamburg to davos is twenty hours—that is , by train . but on foot how long is it ?
and in the mind , how long ? i say , joachim said , what ’ s the matter with you ?
seems to me it goes to your head to be up here with us ! i ’ m very clear-headed to-day .
well , then , what is time ?
asked hans castorp , and bent the tip of his nose so far round that it became white and bloodless .
can you answer me that ?
space we perceive with our organs , with our senses of sight and touch .
but which is our organ of time—tell me that if you can . you see , that ’ s where you stick .
but how can we possibly measure anything about which we actually know nothing , not even a single one of its properties ? we say of time that it passes .
very good , let it pass . but to be able to measure it—wait a minute : to be susceptible of being measured , time must flow evenly , but who ever said it did that ?
as far as our consciousness is concerned it doesn ’ t , we only assume that it does , for the sake of convenience ; and our units of measurement are purely arbitrary , sheer conventions—
then perhaps it is pure convention that i have five points too much here on my thermometer .
it ’ s going down already , and joachim made the entry on his chart . last night it was almost °—that was your arrival .
but it is a good thing , notwithstanding .
i ’ ll go now , said hans castorp .
i ’ ve still a great many ideas in my head about the time—a whole complex , if i may say so .
i ’ ll keep them all and return to them later , perhaps after breakfast .
you will call me when it is time , i suppose .
i ’ ll go now and lie down ; it won ’ t hurt me , thank goodness .
with which he passed round the glass partition into his loggia , where stood his own reclining-chair and side-table .
he fetched ocean steamships and his beautiful , soft , dark-red and green plaid from within the room , which had already been put into perfect order , and sat himself down .
soon he too had to put up the little sunshade ; the heat became unbearable as he lay .
the frame—a little oldfashioned , perhaps , a mere matter of taste , for the chair was obviously new—was of polished red-brown wood , and the mattress was covered in a soft cotton material ; or rather , it was not a mattress , but three thick cushions , extending from the foot to the very top of the chair-back .
there was a head-roll besides , neither too hard nor too yielding , with an embroidered linen cover , fastened on by a cord to the chair , and wondrously agreeable to the neck .
hans castorp supported his elbow on the broad , smooth surface of the chair-arm , blinked , and reposed himself .
the landscape , rather severe and sparse , though brightly sunny , looked like a framed painting as viewed through the arch of the loggia .
hans castorp gazed thoughtfully at it .
suddenly he thought of something , and said aloud in the stillness : that was a dwarf , wasn ’ t it , that waited on us at breakfast ?
don ’ t speak loud . we hadn ’ t mentioned it .
it had been ten o ’ clock when he lay down .
it was an ordinary hour , not long , not short .
at its close a bell sounded through the house and garden , first afar , then near , then from afar again .
breakfast , joachim said and could be heard getting up .
hans castorp too finished with his cure for the time and went into his room to put himself to rights a little .
the cousins met in the corridor and descended the stair .
hans castorp said : well , the lying-down is great !
what sort of chairs are they ?
if they are to be had here , i ’ ll buy one and take it to hamburg with me ; they are heavenly to lie in .
or do you think behrens had them made to his design ?
joachim did not know .
they entered the dining-room , where the meal was again in full swing . at every place stood a large glass , probably a half litre of milk ; the room shimmered white with it . no , hans castorp said , when he was once more in his seat between the seamstress and the englishwoman , and had docilely unfolded his serviette , though still heavy with the earlier meal ; no , god help me , milk i never could abide , and least of all now !
is there perhaps some porter ?
he applied himself to the dwarf and put his question with the gentlest courtesy , but alas , there was none . she promised to bring kulmbacher beer , and did so .
it was thick , dark , and foaming brownly ; it made a capital substitute for the porter . hans castorp drank it thirstily from a half-litre glass , and ate some cold meat and toast .
again there was oatmeal porridge and much butter and fruit .
he let his eyes dwell upon them , incapable of more . and he looked at the guests as well ; the groups began to break up for him , and individuals to stand out . his own table was full , except the place at the top , which , he learned , was the doctor ’ s place .
for the doctors , when their work allowed , ate at the common table , sitting at each of the seven in turn ; at each one a place was kept free . but just now neither was present ; they were operating , it was said . the young man with the moustaches came in again , sank his chin once for all on his breast , and sat down , with his self-absorbed , care-worn mien .
the lean , light blonde was in her seat , and spooned up yogurt as though it formed her sole article of diet .
next her appeared a lively little old dame , who addressed the silent young man in russian ; he regarded her uneasily , and answered only by nodding his head , looking as though he had a bad taste in his mouth .
opposite him , on the other side of the elderly lady , there was another young girl—pretty , with a blooming complexion and full bosom , chestnut hair that waved agreeably , round , brown , childlike eyes , and a little ruby on her lovely hand .
she laughed often , and spoke russian .
hans castorp learned that her name was marusja .
he noticed further that when she laughed and talked , joachim sat with eyes cast sternly down upon his plate . settembrini appeared through the side door , and , curling his moustaches , strode to his place at the end of the table diagonally in front of that where hans castorp sat .
his table-mates burst out in peals of laughter as he sat down ; he had probably said something cutting .
hans castorp recognized the members of the half-lung club .
hermine kleefeld , heavy-eyed , slid into her place at the table in front of one of the verandah doors , speaking as she did so to the thick-lipped youth who had worn his coat in the unseemly fashion that had struck hans castorp .
the ivory-coloured levi and the fat , freckled iltis sat side by side at a table at right angles to hans castorp—he did not know any of their table-mates .
there are your neighbours , joachim said in a low voice to his cousin , bending forward as he spoke .
the pair passed close beside hans castorp to the last table on the right , the bad russian table , apparently , where there already sat a whole family , one of whom , a very ugly boy , was gobbling great quantities of porridge .
the man was of slight proportions , with a grey , hollow-cheeked face .
he wore a brown leather jacket ; on his feet he had clumsy felt boots with buckled clasps .
his wife , likewise small and slender , walked with tripping steps in her tiny , high-heeled russia leather boots , the feathers swaying on her hat . around her neck she wore a soiled feather boa .
hans castorp looked at them with a ruthless stare , quite foreign to his usual manner—he himself was aware of its brutality , yet at the same time conscious of relishing that very quality .
his eyes felt both staring and heavy . at that moment the glass door on the left slammed shut , with a rattle and ringing of glass ; he did not start as he had on the first occasion , but only made a grimace of lazy disgust ; when he wished to turn his head , he found the effort too much for him—it was really not worth while . and thus , for the second time , he was unable to fix upon the person who was guilty of behaving in that reckless way about a door .
the truth was that the breakfast beer , as a rule only mildly obfuscating to the young man ’ s sense , had this time completely stupefied and befuddled him . he felt as though he had received a blow on the head .
his eyelids were heavy as lead ; his tongue would not shape his simple thoughts when out of politeness he tried to talk to the englishwoman . even to alter the direction of his gaze he was obliged to conquer a great disinclination ; and , added to all this , the hateful burning in his face had reached the same height as yesterday , his cheeks felt puffy with heat , he breathed with difficulty ; his heart pounded dully , like a hammer muffled in cloth .
if all these sensations caused him no high degree of suffering , that was only because his head felt as though he had inhaled a few whiffs of chloroform . he saw as in a dream that dr. krokowski appeared at breakfast and took the place opposite to his ; the doctor , however , repeatedly looked him sharply in the eye , while he conversed in russian with the ladies on his right . the young girls—the blooming marusja and the lean consumer of yogurt—cast down their eyes modestly as the doctor spoke .
hans castorp did not , of course , bear himself otherwise than with dignity . in silence , since his tongue refused its office , but managing his knife and fork with particular propriety .
when his cousin nodded to him and got up , he rose too , bowed blindly to the rest of the table , and with cautious steps followed joachim out . when do we lie down again ?
he asked , as they left the house .
it ’ s the best thing up here , so far as i can see .
i wish i were back again in my comfortable chair .
do we take a long walk ?
at this period i always go down below , through the village as far as the platz if i have time .
there are shops and people , and one can buy what one needs .
don ’ t worry , we rest for an hour again before dinner , and then after it until four o ’ clock .
they went down the drive in the sunshine , crossed the watercourse and the narrow track , having before their eyes the mountain heights of the western side of the valley : the little schiahorn , the green tower , and the dorfberg—joachim mentioned their names . the little walled cemetery of davos-dorf lay up there , at some height ; joachim pointed it out with his stick .
they reached the high road that led along the terraced slope a storey higher than the valley floor .
it was rather a misnomer to speak of the village , since scarcely anything but the word remained .
the resort had swallowed it up , extending further and further toward the entrance of the valley , until that part of the settlement which was called the dorf passed imperceptibly into the platz .
hotels and pensions , amply equipped with covered verandahs , balconies , and reclining-halls , lay on both sides of their way , also private houses with rooms to let .
here and there were new buildings , but also open spaces , which preserved a view toward the valley meadows .
hans castorp , craving his familiar and wonted indulgence , had once more lighted a cigar ; and , thanks probably to the beer that had gone before , he succeeded now and then in getting a whiff of the longed-for aroma—to his inexpressible satisfaction . but only now and then , but only faintly ; the anxious receptivity of his attitude was a strain on the nerves , and the hateful leathery taste distinctly prevailed .
unable to reconcile himself to his impotence , he struggled awhile to regain the enjoyment which either escaped him wholly , or else mocked him by its brief presence ; finally , worn out and disgusted , he flung the cigar away . despite his benumbed condition he felt it incumbent upon him to be polite , to make conversation , and to this end he sought to recall those brilliant ideas he had previously had , on the subject of time . alas , they had fled , the whole complex of them , and left not a trace behind : on the subject of time not one single idea , however insignificant , found lodgment in his head .
he began , therefore , to talk of ordinary matters , of the concerns of the body—what he said sounded odd enough in his mouth .
when do you measure again ?
yes , that ’ s a good time .
when the organism is in full activity , it must show itself .
behrens must have been joking when he told me to take my temperature—settembrini laughed like anything at the idea ; there ’ s really no sense in it , i haven ’ t even a thermometer .
well , joachim said , that is the least of your difficulties . you can get one anywhere—they sell them in almost every shop .
i ’ ll gladly do it ; but measuring would be rather too much for a guest ; i ’ ll leave that to the rest of you .
if i only knew , hans castorp went on , and laid his hands like a lover on his heart , if i only knew why i have palpitations the whole time—it is very disquieting ; i keep thinking about it .
for , you see , a person ordinarily has palpitation of the heart when he is frightened , or when he is looking forward to some great joy .
but when the heart palpitates all by itself , without any reason , senselessly , of its own accord , so to speak , i feel that ’ s uncanny , you understand , as if the body was going its own gait without any reference to the soul , like a dead body , only it is not really dead—there isn ’ t any such thing , of course—but leading a very active existence all on its own account , growing hair and nails and doing a lively business in the physical and chemical line , so i ’ ve been told—
joachim said , with serious reproach .
and perhaps he recalled the reproaches he had called down on his own head earlier in the day . it ’ s a fact—it is very lively !
why do you object to that ?
i only meant to say that it is disturbing and unpleasant to have the body act as though it had no connexion with the soul , and put on such airs—by which i mean these senseless palpitations . you keep trying to find an explanation for them , an emotion to account for them , a feeling of joy or pain , which would , so to speak , justify them . at least , it is that way with me—but i can only speak for myself .
yes , yes , joachim said , sighing .
but we are talking such unpleasant stuff , he said , his voice trembling a little , and he broke off ; whereupon hans castorp shrugged his shoulders—with the very gesture , indeed , which had , the evening before , displeased him in his cousin .
they walked awhile in silence , until joachim asked : well , how do you like the people up here ?
i mean the ones at our table .
dear me , he said , i don ’ t find them so very interesting . some of the people at the other tables look more so , but that may be only seeming .
frau stöhr ought to have her hair shampooed , it is so greasy . and that mazurka—or whatever her name is—seemed rather silly to me .
she keeps giggling and stuffing her handkerchief in her mouth .
joachim laughed loudly at the twist his cousin had given the name .
her name is marusja , with your kind permission—it is the same as marie .
yes , she really is too undisciplined , and after all , she has every reason to be serious , he said , for her case is by no means light .
she looks so very fit .
chest trouble is the last thing one would accuse her of .
he tried to catch his cousin ’ s eye , and saw that joachim ’ s sunburnt face had gone all spotted , as a tanned complexion will when the blood leaves it with suddenness ; his mouth too was pitifully drawn , and wore an expression that sent an indefinable chill of fear over hans castorp and made him hasten to change the subject .
he hurriedly inquired about others of their tablemates and tried to forget marusja and the look on joachim ’ s face—an effort in which he presently succeeded .
the englishwoman with the rose tea was miss robinson .
the seamstress was not a seamstress but a schoolmistress at a lycée in königsberg—which accounted for the precision of her speech .
her name was fräulein engelhart .
as for the name of the lively little old lady , joachim , as long as he had been up here , did not know it .
all he knew was that she was great-aunt to the young lady who ate yogurt , and lived with her permanently in the sanatorium .
the worst case at their table was dr. blumenkohl , leo blumenkohl , from odessa , the young man with the moustaches and the absorbed and care-worn air . he had been here years .
they were now walking on the city pavement , the main street , obviously , of an international centre .
they met the guests of the cure , strolling about , young people for the most part : gallants in sporting , without their hats ; white-skirted ladies , also hatless .
one heard russian and english . shops with gay show-windows were on either side of the road , and hans castorp , his curiosity struggling with intense weariness , forced himself to look into them , and stood a long time before a shop that purveyed fashionable male wear , to decide whether its display was really up to the mark .
they reached a rotunda with covered galleries , where a band was giving a concert .
this was the kurhaus .
tennis was being played on several courts by long-legged , clean-shaven youths in accurately pressed flannels and rubber-soled shoes , their arms bared to the elbow , and sunburnt girls in white frocks , who ran and flung themselves high in the sunny air in their efforts to strike the white ball .
the well-kept courts looked as though coated with flour .
the cousins sat down on an empty bench to watch and criticize the game .
you don ’ t play here ?
i am not allowed , joachim answered . we have to lie—nothing but lie .
settembrini says we live horizontally—he calls us horizontallers ; that ’ s one of his rotten jokes .
those are healthy people , there—or else they are breaking the rules .
but they don ’ t play very seriously anyhow—it ’ s more for the sake of the costume .
as far as breaking the rules goes , there are more forbidden things besides tennis that get played here—poker , and petits-chevaux , in this and that hotel .
even so , there are people who slip out after the evening visit and come down here to gamble .
that prince who gave behrens his title always did it , they say .
hans castorp barely attended .
his mouth was open , for he could not have breathed through his nose without sniffing ; he felt with dull discomfort that his heart was hammering out of time with the music ; and with this combined sense of discord and disorder he was about to doze off when joachim suggested that they go home .
they returned almost in silence . hans castorp stumbled once or twice on the level street and grinned ruefully as he shook his head .
the lame man took them up in the lift to their own storey . they parted , with a brief see you later at the door of number thirty-four ; hans castorp piloted himself through his room to the balcony , where he dropped just as he was upon his deck-chair and , without once shifting to a more comfortable posture , sank into a dull half-slumber , broken by the rapid beating of his unquiet heart . of course , a female !
how long it lasted he could not have told . when the moment arrived , the gong sounded .
but it was not the gong for the meal , it was only the dressing-bell , as hans castorp knew , and so he still lay , until the metallic drone rose and died away a second time . when joachim came to fetch him , hans castorp wanted to change , but this joachim would not allow . he hated and despised unpunctuality .
wherein he was , of course , quite right , and hans castorp could only say that he was not ill at all , but only utterly and entirely sleepy .
he confined himself to washing his hands ; and then for the third time they went down together to the dining-hall . the guests streamed in through both entrances , they even came through the open verandah door . soon they all sat at their several tables as though they had never risen .
such at least was hans castorp ’ s impression—a dreamy and irrational impression , of course , but one which his muddled brain could not for an instant get rid of , in which it even took a certain satisfaction , so that several times in the course of the meal he sought to call it up again and was always perfectly successful in reproducing the illusion .
the gay old lady continued to talk in her semifluid tongue at the care-worn dr. blumenkohl , diagonally opposite ; her lean niece actually at last ate something else than yogurt ; namely , the thick cream of barley soup , which was handed round in soup-plates by the waitresses . of this she took a few spoonfuls and left the rest .
pretty marusja giggled , then stuffed her dainty handkerchief in her mouth—it gave out a scent of oranges .
miss robinson read the same letters , in the same round script , which she had read at breakfast .
obviously she knew not a word of german , nor wished to do so .
joachim , preux chevalier , said something to her in english , which she answered in a monosyllable without ceasing to chew , and relapsed again into silence .
frau stöhr , sitting there in her woollen blouse , gave the table to know she had been examined that forenoon ; she went into particulars , affectedly drawing back her upper lip from the rodent-like teeth .
there were rhonchi to be heard in the upper right side , and under the left shoulder-blade the breathing was still very limited ; the old man said she would have to stop another five months .
she displayed , moreover , a feeling of injury because the old man was not sitting at her table to-day , where he should by rights be sitting if he had taken them à la tournée—by which she presumably meant in turn—instead of going to the next table again . ( there , in fact , he really was sitting , his great hands folded before his place . )
but of course that was frau salomon ’ s table , the fat frau salomon from amsterdam , who came décolletée to table even on week-days , a sight which the old man liked to see , though for her part—frau stöhr ’ s—she never could understand why , since he could see all he wanted of frau salomon at every examination .
she related , in an excited whisper , that last night , in the general rest-hall up under the roof , somebody had put out the light , for purposes which she designated as transparent .
the old man had seen it , and stormed so you could hear it all over the place .
he had not discovered the culprit , of course , but it didn ’ t take a university education to guess that it was captain miklosich from bucharest , for whom , when in the society of ladies , it could never be dark enough : a man without any and all refinement—though he did wear a corset—and , by nature , simply a beast of prey—a perfect beast of prey , repeated frau stöhr , in a stifled whisper , beads of perspiration on her brow and upper lip .
the relations between him and frau consulgeneral wurmbrandt from vienna were known throughout dorf and platz—it was idle any longer to speak of them as clandestine .
not merely did the captain go into the frau consul-general ’ s bedroom while she was still in bed , and remain there throughout her toilet ; last thursday he had not left the wurmbrandt ’ s room until four in the morning ; that they knew from the nurse who was taking care of young franz in number nineteen—his pneumothorax operation had gone wrong . she had , in her embarrassment , mistaken her own door , and burst suddenly into the room of herr paravant , a dortmund lawyer .
lastly frau stöhr held forth for some time on the merits of a cosmic establishment down in the village , where she bought her mouthwash . joachim gazed stonily downwards at his plate .
the meal was as faultlessly prepared as it was abundant .
counting the hearty soup , it consisted of no less than six courses .
after the fish followed an excellent meat dish , with garnishings , then a separate vegetable course , then roast fowl , a pudding , not inferior to yesterday evening ’ s , and lastly cheese and fruit . each dish was handed twice and not in vain .
at all seven tables they filled their plates and ate : they ate like wolves ; they displayed a voracity which would have been a pleasure to see , had there not been something else about it , an effect almost uncanny , not to say repulsive .
it was not only the light-hearted who thus laced into the food—those who chattered as they ate and threw pellets of bread at each other . no , the same appetite was evinced by the silent , gloomy ones as well , those who in the pauses between courses leaned their heads on their hands and stared before them . a half-grown youth at the next table on the left , by his years a schoolboy , with his wrists coming out of his jacket sleeves , and thick , round eye-glasses , cut all the heaped-up food on his plate into a sort of mash , then bent over and gulped it down ; he reached with his serviette behind his glasses now and then and dried his eyes—whether it was sweat or tears he dried one could not tell .
there were two incidents during the course of the meal of which hans castorp took note , so far as his condition permitted .
one was the banging of the glass door , which occurred while they were having the fish course .
hans castorp gave an exasperated shrug and angrily resolved that this time he really must find out who did it .
he said this not only within himself , his lips formed the words .
i must find out , he whispered with exaggerated earnestness . miss robinson and the schoolmistress both looked at him in surprise .
he turned the whole upper half of his body to the left and opened wide his bloodshot blue eyes .
it was a lady who was passing through the room ; a woman , or rather girl , of middle height , in a white sweater and coloured skirt , her reddish-blond hair wound in braids about her head . hans castorp had only a glimpse of her profile . she moved , in singular contrast to the noise of her entrance , almost without sound , passing with a peculiarly gliding step , her head a little thrust forward , to her place at the furthest table on the left , at right angles to the verandah door : the good russian table , in fact .
as she walked , she held one hand deep in the pocket of her close-fitting jacket ; the other she lifted to the back of her head and arranged the plaits of her hair .
hans castorp looked at the hand . he was habitually observant and critical of this feature , and accustomed when he made a new acquaintance to direct his attention first upon it . it was not particularly ladylike , this hand that was putting the braids to rights ; not so refined and well kept as the hands of ladies in hans castorp ’ s own social sphere .
rather broad , with stumpy fingers , it had about it something primitive and childish , something indeed of the schoolgirl .
the nails , it was plain , knew nothing of the manicurist ’ s art ; they were cut in rough-and-ready schoolgirl fashion , and the skin at the side looked almost as though someone were subject to the childish vice of finger biting .
but hans castorp sensed rather than saw this , owing to the distance . the laggard greeted her table-mates with a nod , and took her place on the inner side of the table with her back to the room , next to dr. krokowski , who was sitting at the top .
as she did so , she turned her head , with the hand still raised to it , toward the dining-room and surveyed the public ; hans castorp had opportunity for the fleeting observation that her cheek-bones were broad and her eyes narrow.—a vague memory of something , of somebody , stirred him slightly and fleetingly as he looked .
of course , a female !
he thought , or rather he actually uttered , in a murmur , yet so that the schoolmistress , fräulein engelhart , understood .
the poor old spinster smiled in sympathy .
that is madame chauchat , she said .
she is so heedless .
and the downy flush on her cheek grew a shade darker—as it did whenever she spoke .
hans castorp asked , with severity .
no , she is a russian , was the answer .
her husband is very likely french or of french descent , i am not sure .
hans castorp asked , still irritated , if that was he—pointing to a gentleman with drooping shoulders who sat at the good russian table .
oh , no , the schoolmistress answered , he isn ’ t here ; he has never been here , no one knows him .
she ought to learn how to shut a door , hans castorp said .
she always lets it slam .
and on the schoolmistress ’ s meekly accepting this reproof as though she herself had been the guilty party , there was no more talk of madame chauchat . the second event was the temporary absence of dr. blumenkohl from the room— nothing more .
the mildly disgusted facial expression suddenly deepened , he looked with sadder fixity into space , then unobtrusively moved back his chair and went out .
whereupon frau stöhr ’ s essential ill breeding showed itself in the clearest light ; probably out of vulgar satisfaction in the fact that she was less ill than dr. blumenkohl . she accompanied his exit with comments half pitying , half contemptuous .
poor creature , she said .
he ’ ll soon be at his last gasp .
he had to go out for a talk with his blue peter .
quite stolidly , without repulsion , she brought out the grotesque phrase—hans castorp felt a mixture of repugnance and desire to laugh .
presently dr. blumenkohl came back in the same unobtrusive way , took his place , and went on eating . he too ate a great deal , twice of every dish , always in silence , with the same melancholy , preoccupied air .
thus the midday meal came to an end . thanks to the skilled service—the dwarf at hans castorp ’ s table was one of the quickest on her feet—it had lasted only a round hour . breathing heavily , and not quite sure how he got upstairs , hans castorp lay once more in his capital chair upon his loggia ; after this meal there was rest-cure until tea-time—the most important and rigidly adhered-to rest period of the day .
between the opaque glass walls that divided him on the one side from joachim , on the other from the russian couple , he lay and idly dreamed , his heart pounding , breathing through his mouth .
on using his handkerchief he discovered it to be red with blood , but had not enough energy to think about the fact , though he was rather given to worrying over himself and by nature inclined to hypochondria . once more he had lighted a maria mancini , and this time he smoked it to the end , no matter how it tasted .
giddy and oppressed , he considered as in a dream how very odd he had felt since he came up here .
two or three times his breast was shaken by inward laughter at the horrid expression which that ignorant creature , frau stöhr , had used .
below in the garden the fanciful banner with the caduceus lifted itself now and again in a breath of wind .
the sky was once more evenly overcast . the sun was gone , the air had grown almost inhospitably cool .
the general rest-hall seemed to be full ; talking and laughter went on below .
herr albin , i implore you , put away your knife ; put it in your pocket , there will be an accident with it , a high , uncertain voice besought .
then : dear herr albin , for heaven ’ s sake , spare our nerves , and take that murderous tool out of our sight , a second voice chimed in .
a blond young man , with a cigarette in his mouth , sitting in the outside easy-chair , responded pertly : couldn ’ t think of it ! i ’ m sure the ladies haven ’ t the heart to prevent me from amusing myself a little !
i bought that knife in calcutta , of a blind wizard .
he could swallow it , and then have his boy dig it up fifty paces from where he stood .
do look—it is sharper than a razor .
you only need to touch the blade ; it goes into your flesh like cutting butter . wait a minute , i ’ ll show it you close by .
and herr albin stood up .
or rather , said he , i ’ ll fetch my revolver ; that will be more interesting .
no , no , don ’ t , pray don ’ t , herr albin !
but herr albin had already come out to go up to his room : very young and lanky , with a rosy , childish face , and little strips of side-whisker close to his ears . herr albin , cried a lady ’ s voice from within , do fetch your greatcoat instead , and put it on ; do it just to please me ! six weeks long you have lain with inflammation of the lungs , and now you sit here without an overcoat , and don ’ t even cover yourself , and smoke cigarettes !
that is tempting providence ; on my word it is , herr albin !
he only laughed scornfully as he went off , and in a few minutes returned with the revolver in his hand . the silly geese squawked worse than before , and some of them even made as if they would spring from their chairs , wrap their blankets round them , and flee . look how little and shiny he is , said herr albin .
of course , he is loaded—to the hilt , he continued . in this disk here are the six cartridges . it turns one hole at each shot .
but i don ’ t keep him merely for a joke , he said noticing that the sensation was wearing off .
revolver slip into his breast pocket , sat down again , flung one leg over the other , and lighted a fresh cigarette .
certainly not for a joke , he repeated , and compressed his
they asked , their voices trembling .
came a sudden cry , and herr albin nodded .
i see you begin to understand , he said .
in fact , you are right , that is what i keep it for , he went on airily , inhaling , despite the recent inflammation of the lungs , a mass of smoke and breathing it slowly out again . i keep it in readiness for the day when i can ’ t stand this farce any longer , and do myself the honour to bid you a respectful adieu .
it is all very simple .
i ’ ve given the matter some study , and i know precisely how to do it . another screech at the word .
i eliminate the region of the heart , the aim is not very convenient there .
i prefer to annihilate my consciousness at its very centre by introducing my charming little foreign body direct into this interesting organ.—herr albin indicated with his index finger a spot on his close-cropped blond pate .
you aim here—he drew the nickel-plated revolver out of his pocket once more and tapped with the barrel against his skull—just here , above the artery ; even without a mirror the thing is simple— a chorus of imploring protest arose , mingled with heavy sobbing . herr albin , herr albin , put it away , take it from your temple , it is dreadful to see you !
herr albin , you are young , you will get well , you will return to the world , everybody will love you !
but put on your coat and lie down , cover yourself , go on with your cure .
don ’ t drive the bathing-master away next time he comes to rub you down with alcohol .
and stop smoking cigarettes—herr albin , we implore you , for the sake of your young , your precious life !
but herr albin was inexorable .
it is a long trip , however , from hamburg to those elevations—too long , really , for so short a visit .
the journey leads through many a landscape , uphill and down , descends from the high plain of southern germany to the shores of swabia ’ s sea , and proceeds by boat across its skipping waves , passing over abysses once thought unfathomable .
from there the path , which until now has followed grand , direct routes , turns choppy .
there are stopovers and formalities .
at rorschach , a town in swiss territory , you reboard a train that takes you only as far as landquart , a small station in the alps , where you must change trains again .
after standing for a while in the wind , gazing at a rather uncharming landscape , you climb aboard a narrow-gauge train , and the moment the small , but uncommonly sturdy engine pulls out , the real adventure begins , a steep and dogged ascent that will never end , it seems .
the station at landquart lies at a relatively low altitude ; but now your route takes you on a wild ride up into real mountains , along tracks that squeeze their way between walls of rock .
hans castorp—that is the young man ’ s name—found himself alone in a small compartment upholstered in gray ; with him he had an alligator valise , a present from his uncle and foster father—consul tienappel , since we are naming names here—a rolled-up plaid blanket , and his winter coat , swinging on its hook .
the window was open beside him , but the afternoon was turning cooler and cooler , and , being the coddled scion of the family , he turned up the silk-lined collar of his fashionably loose summer overcoat .
on the seat beside him lay a paperbound book entitled ocean steamships , which he had perused from time to time earlier on his trip , but which now lay neglected , the cover dirtied by soot drifting in with the steam of the heavily puffing locomotive .
two days of travel separate this young man ( and young he is , with few firm roots in life ) from his everyday world , especially from what he called his duties , interests , worries , and prospects—separate him far more than he had dreamed possible as he rode to the station in a hansom cab . space , as it rolls and tumbles away between him and his native soil , proves to have powers normally ascribed only to time ; from hour to hour , space brings about changes very like those time produces , yet surpassing them in certain ways .
space , like time , gives birth to forgetfulness , but does so by removing an individual from all relationships and placing him in a free and pristine state—indeed , in but a moment it can turn a pedant and philistine into something like a vagabond . time , they say , is water from the river lethe , but alien air is a similar drink ; and if its effects are less profound , it works all the more quickly .
he had not planned to take this trip particularly seriously , to become deeply involved in it . his intention had been , rather , to put it behind him quickly , simply because that was how things had to be , to return quite the same person he had been at departure , and to pick up his life again where he had been forced to leave it lying for the moment .
only yesterday he had been totally caught up in his normal train of thought , preoccupied with what had just occurred , his exams , and with what was about to occur , his joining the firm of tunder and wilms ( dockyards , machine works , and boilers ) , and looking well beyond these next three weeks with as much impatience as his nature allowed . but now it seemed to him that present circumstances demanded his full attention and that it was inappropriate to shrug them off .
being lifted like this into regions whose air he had never breathed before and whose sparse and meager conditions were , as he well knew , both unfamiliar and peculiar—it all began to excite him , to fill him with a certain anxiety . home and a settled life not only lay far behind , but also , and more importantly , they lay fathoms below him , and he was still climbing .
hovering between home and the unknown ahead , he asked himself how he would do up there .
was it unwise and unhealthy , perhaps , for him , born only a few feet above sea level and accustomed to breathing that air , to be suddenly transported to such extreme regions without spending at least a few days someplace in between ? he wished he had already reached his goal , because once you were up there , he thought , you lived just as people did everywhere , instead of having the climb constantly remind you of how unsuitable these precincts were .
he looked out—the train was winding through a narrow pass ; you could see the forward cars and the laboring engine , emitting great straggling tatters of brown , green , and black smoke .
water roared in the deep ravine on his right ; dark pines on his left struggled up between boulders toward a stony gray sky .
there were pitch-black tunnels , and when daylight returned , vast chasms were revealed , with a few villages far below .
these views closed again , too , and were followed by new passes with patches of snow left in clefts and crevices . the train pulled into dingy little stations and backed out again on the same set of tracks , confusing your sense of direction until you no longer knew whether you were heading north or south . magnificent vistas opened onto regions toward which they were slowly climbing , a world of ineffable , phantasmagoric alpine peaks , soon lost again to awestruck eyes as the tracks took another curve .
hans castorp thought about how he had left hardwood forests far below him , and songbirds , too , he presumed ; and the idea that such things could cease , the sense of a world made poorer without them , brought on a slight attack of dizziness and nausea , and he covered his eyes with his hand for a second or two .
the train was now rolling more comfortably along the level floor of a valley .
it was almost eight o ’ clock , but still daylight .
a lake appeared in the distant landscape ; its surface was gray and from its shores black pine forests climbed the surrounding slopes , grew thinner toward the top , and gave way at last to bare , fog-enshrouded rock .
they stopped at a little station , davos-dorf , as hans castorp learned when someone outside shouted the name—he would be at journey ’ s end shortly . and suddenly , right beside him , he heard his cousin joachim ziemssen saying in an easygoing hamburg voice , hello there .
this is where you get off .
and when he looked out , there on the platform below his window stood joachim , wearing a brown ulster but no hat of any sort , and looking healthier than ever .
he laughed and said again , come on , get off , don ’ t be shy !
but i ’ m not there yet , hans castorp said , dumbfounded , keeping his seat .
this is davos-dorf . the sanatorium ’ s closer from here . i ’ ve got a carriage .
hand me your things . and with a laugh that betrayed his confusion and excitement at having arrived and seeing his cousin again , hans castorp lifted out his valise and winter coat , his plaid blanket roll plus cane and umbrella , and finally ocean steamships .
strangely enough , they had always avoided calling one another by their first names , purely out of fear of showing too much warmth of emotion . and since they could not very well address one another by their last names , they confined themselves to the use of familiar pronouns—now a deeply rooted habit between the two cousins .
they quickly shook hands with some embarrassment—young ziemssen never losing his military bearing—watched all the while by a man in livery with a braided cap , who then approached and asked hans castorp for his baggage ticket ; this was the concierge of the international sanatorium berghof , and he proved quite willing to fetch the guest ’ s large trunk from the station at davos-platz while the gentlemen themselves drove on ahead to dinner . the man had an obvious limp , and so the first thing that hans castorp asked joachim ziemssen was , is he a war veteran ? is that why he limps so badly ?
he ’ s got it in the knee—or had it , that is , now that he ’ s had his kneecap removed .
hans castorp mulled this over as rapidly as possible .
but you ’ re not going to try to tell me that you still have anything like that , are you ? you look as if you ’ ve already received your commission and were just home from maneuvers . and he gave his cousin a sidelong glance .
joachim was taller than he , with broader shoulders , the picture of youthful vigor , a man made for a uniform .
he was very dark-haired , a type not all that uncommon in his blond hometown , and his naturally dark complexion was now tanned almost bronze .
with his large black eyes and dark little moustache above full , finely chiseled lips , he would have been downright handsome , if his ears had not stood out so badly .
for most of his life , they had been his one great sorrow , his only care .
now he had other worries .
you will be coming back down with me , won ’ t you ? hans castorp went on .
back down with you ?
his cousin asked , turning to him with large eyes that had always had a gentle look , but that in the last five months had taken on a weary , indeed sad expression .
why , in three weeks .
oh , i see—you ’ re already thinking about heading back home , joachim replied .
well , wait and see , you ’ ve only just arrived .
three weeks are almost nothing for us up here , of course , but for you , just here on a visit and planning to stay a grand total of three weeks , for you that ’ s a long time .
acclimatize yourself first—and you ’ ll learn that ’ s not all that easy .
besides , the climate ’ s not the only unusual thing about us .
and as for what you ’ ve said about me—well , i ’ m not in such fine feather as all that , my friend . home in three weeks , that ’ s a notion from down below .
i ’ m nicely tanned , of course , but that ’ s mostly from the snow and doesn ’ t mean much , as behrens is always saying , and at my last regular checkup he said that it ’ s fairly certain it will be another six months yet .
they were taking their seats on the hard cushions of a yellow cabriolet that had stood waiting for them on the gravel apron in front of the station , itself not much more than a shed ; and as the pair of bays began to pull , hans castorp spun around now in vexation .
ah yes , time , joachim said , nodding to himself several times , paying no attention to his cousin ’ s honest indignation . you wouldn ’ t believe how fast and loose they play with people ’ s time around here .
three weeks are the same as a day to them .
you have all that to learn , he said , and then he added , a man changes a lot of his ideas here .
hans castorp gazed steadily at his profile .
but you really have made a splendid recovery , he said , shaking his head .
do you think so ? it ’ s true , isn ’ t it ? i think so , too !
he said , sitting up taller against the cushioned back , but immediately slumping again a little to one side .
i am feeling better , he explained , but i ’ m not yet entirely well , either .
the upper left lobe , where the rattling used to be , there ’ s only a little roughness there now , it ’ s not so bad , but the lower lobe is still very rough , and there are also sounds in the second intercostal .
how learned you ’ ve become , hans castorp said .
yes , a fine sort of learning , god knows .
i would gladly have unlearned it all on active duty , joachim retorted .
but i still have sputum , he said with a nonchalant , but somehow vehement shrug that did not suit him at all ; and now he pulled something halfway out of the nearer side pocket of his ulster , showed it to his cousin , and put it away again at once—a curved , flattened bottle of bluish glass with a metal cap .
most of us up here have one , he said .
we even have a name for it , a kind of nickname , a joke really .
having a look at the scenery , are you ?
they had first taken a street that was faced by an irregular pattern of buildings and ran along the railroad tracks , following the valley ’ s axis , but then turned left and crossed the narrow tracks and a brook ; and they were now trotting up a gently rising road in the direction of wooded slopes and a low , outcropping meadow where an elongated building stood , its façade turned to the southwest , topped by a copper cupola , and arrayed with so many balconies that , from a distance as the first lights of evening were being lit , it looked as pockmarked and porous as a sponge .
dusk was falling fast .
a pale red sunset that had enlivened the generally overcast sky faded now , leaving nature under the transient sway of the lackluster , lifeless , and mournful light that immediately precedes nightfall . lights were coming up in the long , meandering , populous valley , dotting its floor and the slopes on both sides—particularly on the swelling rise to the right , where buildings ascended a series of terraces . paths led up the meadowed hills on their left , but were soon lost to sight in the dull black of pine forests .
behind them , the mountains in the more distant background , where the valley tapered to an end , were a sober slate blue .
now that the wind had picked up , the evening had turned noticeably cooler .
no , to be quite frank , i don ’ t find it that overwhelming , hans castorp said .
where are the glaciers and snowcapped , towering peaks ? seems to me , the ones here aren ’ t all that high .
you can see the tree line almost everywhere , it ’ s really quite clearly defined ; the pines come to an end , then everything else—the end , then rocks , as you can see .
and over there , to the right of the schwarzhorn , on that jagged peak there , is a glacier for you—can you still see the blue ?
it ’ s not that big , but it ’ s a textbook glacier , the scaletta glacier .
and there ’ s piz michel and tinzenhorn in that gap—you can ’ t see them from here , but they ’ re always snow-covered , year-round .
eternal snow , hans castorp said .
right , eternal , if you like .
and they ’ re all very high .
but we ’ re dreadfully high up ourselves , keep that in mind .
yes , it was quite a climb . certainly had me scared , let me tell you .
five thousand three hundred feet . why , that ’ s over a mile high .
i ’ ve never been this far up in my whole life .
and in his curiosity , hans castorp took a deep breath , testing the alien air . it was fresh—that was all .
it lacked odor , content , moisture , it went easily into the lungs and said nothing to the soul .
yes , the air is famous .
but the landscape is not showing itself to its best advantage this evening . it can look better , especially in the snow .
but you soon get your fill of staring at it .
believe me , all of us up here have definitely had our fill of it , joachim said , and his mouth wrenched in an expression of disgust that seemed both exaggerated and out of control—and once again it did not suit him .
joachim asked , turning to his cousin and looking worried somehow .
no , no , beg your pardon , it just seemed that way to me for a moment or so , hans castorp hastened to say .
but what he really meant was that the phrase us up here , which joachim had used three or four times already , somehow made him feel anxious and queer .
our sanatorium lies at a higher altitude than the village , as you can see , joachim continued .
a hundred fifty feet . the brochure says three hundred , but it ’ s only half that .
the highest of the sanatoriums is schatzalp , across the way , you can ’ t see it now .
they have to transport the bodies down by bobsled in the winter , because the roads are impassable .
and suddenly he burst into laughter , a violent , overpowering laugh that shook his chest and twisted his face , stiffened by the cool wind , into a slightly painful grimace .
and you can sit there and tell me that so calm and cool ?
you ’ ve become quite the cynic in the last five months .
that ’ s not cynical at all , joachim replied with a shrug .
it doesn ’ t matter to the bodies . all the same , it may well be that we do get cynical up here .
behrens is an old cynic himself—a regular brick , by the way , an old fraternity man and a brilliant surgeon , you ’ ll like him , seems to me .
they make special note of his services in the brochure . he dissects the patients ’ psyches .
hans castorp cried , and now hilarity got the better of him .
he could no longer control it .
psychic dissection had finished the job , and he bent over and laughed so hard that the tears ran out from under the hand with which he had covered his eyes . joachim laughed heartily , too—it seemed to do him good . and so the two young men were in fine good humor as they climbed down from their carriage , which had borne them at a slow trot up the steep loop of the driveway to the portal of the international sanatorium berghof .
on their immediate right , between the outer and inner doors , was the desk for the concierge , and a french-looking attendant , dressed in the same livery as the limping man at the train station , was sitting by the telephone reading newspapers ; he came up to them and led them across the well-lit lobby , with public rooms opening off it on the left .
hans castorp peered in as they passed , and discovered them empty .
where were the guests ? he asked , and his cousin replied , taking their rest cure .
otherwise i ’ d be lying out on my balcony after my evening meal , too .
it would not have taken much for hans castorp to be seized by another fit of laughter .
you lie out on your balcony rain or shine , night or day ?
he asked , his voice wavering on the edge .
yes , it ’ s in the rules .
from eight till ten .
but come on , let ’ s have a look at your room , and you can wash up . they got on the elevator , the frenchman operating the electric switches .
as they glided upward , hans castorp dried his eyes .
i ’ m exhausted , i ’ ve laughed so hard , he said , catching his breath through his mouth .
besides , i ’ m a little weary from the trip , i suppose .
and at the same time your face flushes—it ’ s an unpleasant feeling .
i assume we ’ ll be eating soon ?
do they feed you properly up here ? they passed soundlessly down the coconut runners of the narrow corridor . cool light came from the milk-glass shades of lamps set in the ceiling .
the walls were painted with a hard , glistening white enamel .
a nurse in a white cap appeared from somewhere , a pince-nez set on her nose , its cord tucked behind one ear . she had the look of a protestant nurse , of someone with no real devotion to her profession , but kept restless by curiosity and the burden of boredom . some balloon-shaped objects had been set out in the corridor , beside two of the white-enameled doors—large , potbellied containers with short necks .
here you are , joachim said .
i ’ m on your right , and on your left is a russian couple—they ’ re rather slovenly , and loud , i must say , but there was nothing else we could do .
well , what do you say ?
there was a double door , with clothes hooks in the space between the two . joachim had turned on the ceiling light , and its sharp luster revealed a room that was both cheerful and restful , with white , practical furniture ; heavy , washable wallpaper , likewise white ; a floor covered with spotless linoleum ; and linen curtains , embroidered with a simple , cheerful pattern of modern design .
the door to the balcony stood open to a glimpse of lights in the valley and the sound of distant dance music . joachim had thoughtfully placed a few wildflowers in a small vase on the dresser—some yarrow and a couple of bluebells , in their second bloom this summer , that he had picked on the slopes .
what a nice room .
i ’ ll have no trouble putting up here for a week or two .
an american woman died here the day before yesterday , joachim said .
behrens told me he was sure it would be all over with her before you arrived , and that you could have the room .
her fiancé was with her , an english naval officer , but he didn ’ t exactly keep a stiff upper lip .
he kept coming out into the corridor to cry every few minutes , like a little boy .
and then he ’ d rub his cheeks with cold cream because he ’ d just shaved and the tears stung .
the evening before last , the american woman had two first-class hemorrhages , and that was that .
but she ’ s been gone since yesterday morning , and of course it was all thoroughly fumigated with formalin—they say it ’ s very effective , you know . hans castorp was listening to this narrative with edgy bemusement .
he had rolled up his sleeves and was standing now at the large washbasin , its nickel taps sparkling under the electric light , but he cast no more than a fleeting glance at the bed ’ s white metal frame and fresh sheets .
fumigated , that ’ s spiffing , he said glibly and somewhat incongruously while he washed and dried his hands .
yes , methyl aldehyde , even the toughest bacteria can ’ t take that—hco , but it does burn in your nose , doesn ’ t it ?
it ’ s obvious , of course , that strict cleanliness is essential .
his accent , particularly his it ’ s , betrayed his hamburg origins , whereas starting back in his student days , his cousin had adopted more standard pronunciation .
that naval officer probably used a safety razor , that ’ s what i think , it ’ s easier to cut yourself with those things than with a well-stropped straight razor , that ’ s been my experience at least , so i alternate between the two .
and , of course , salt water does smart on chafed skin , so he probably got in the habit of using cold cream while he was in the service , that doesn ’ t seem at all peculiar to me .
and he chatted away , telling about how he had packed two hundred maria mancinis—his cigars—in his trunk , but that getting through customs had been easy as pie . and then he extended greetings from various people back home .
don ’ t they heat the rooms ?
he suddenly exclaimed and ran over to put his hand on the radiator .
no , they keep it rather cool , joachim answered .
the weather would have to turn really bad before they would turn on the heat in august .
but i ’ m freezing ! i ’ m ab-so-lute-ly freezing , i mean my body is , although my face feels awfully flushed—here , feel it , it ’ s burning up .
joachim did not acknowledge it , but merely said , it ’ s the air here , it doesn ’ t mean anything . behrens himself walks around with purple cheeks all day .
some people never get used to it .
well , come on now , or we ’ ll not get anything to eat .
in the corridor they ran into the nurse again , who squinted with nearsighted curiosity as she watched them pass .
they had reached the second floor , when hans castorp suddenly stopped in his tracks , mesmerized by a perfectly ghastly noise he heard coming from beyond a dogleg in the hall—not a loud noise , but so decidedly repulsive that hans castorp grimaced and stared wide-eyed at his cousin .
it was a cough , apparently—a man ’ s cough , but a cough unlike any that hans castorp had ever heard ; indeed , compared to it , all other coughs with which he was familiar had been splendid , healthy expressions of life—a cough devoid of any zest for life or love , which didn ’ t come in spasms , but sounded as if someone were stirring feebly in a terrible mush of decomposing organic material .
an austrian aristocrat—you know , an elegant fellow , your born horseman .
and now it ’ s come to this .
although he ’ s still up and about .
as they walked on , hans castorp remarked , referring to the horseman ’ s cough , you must realize that i ’ ve never heard anything like it , that it ’ s all quite new to me , and that it does make an impression .
there are so many kinds of coughs , dry ones , loose ones , and loose ones are healthier , people say , better than dry barks .
back in my youth—he actually said in my youth—i caught the croup , and it had me barking like a wolf , and everyone was happy when it loosened up , i still remember it quite well .
but a cough like that—that ’ s something new , to me at least—it ’ s not even human .
it ’ s not dry , but you can ’ t call it loose , either , there ’ s no word for it .
it ’ s as if you were looking right down inside and could see it all—the mucus and the slime .
well , joachim said , i hear it every day , so you don ’ t need to describe it for me .
but hans castorp could not get the cough he had heard out of his mind and kept repeating that it was literally like looking down inside the horseman ; and as they entered the restaurant , his eyes , weary from the trip , had taken on a glint of nervous excitement .
it was to the right of the lobby , directly across from the social rooms , and was used , as joachim explained , primarily for new arrivals or residents who either had missed a regularly scheduled meal or had visitors . but birthdays or imminent departures were celebrated there , too , as were favorable results of a general checkup .
things could get very lively in the restaurant on occasion , joachim said ; they even served champagne .
there was no one there now except one lady , perhaps thirty years old , sitting alone and reading—humming to herself the whole time while drumming softly on the tabletop with the middle finger of her left hand . when the young gentlemen had seated themselves , she changed places , so that her back was to them now .
she was standoffish , joachim explained in a low voice , and always ate in the restaurant with just her book .
rumor had it that she had entered a tuberculosis sanatorium as a very young girl and had never lived in the outside world since .
well then , compared to her you ’ re a mere novice with your five months , and still will be with a whole year to your credit , hans castorp said to his cousin ; to which joachim merely gave his new , uncharacteristic shrug and reached for the menu .
they had taken the raised table beside a window hung with cream-colored curtains—the nicest table in the room . they sat opposite one another , their faces illumined by an electric table lamp with a red shade .
hans castorp clasped his freshly washed hands together and rubbed them in congenial expectation , a habit of his whenever he sat down to eat—perhaps because his forebears had prayed before every meal .
they were waited on by a friendly girl in a black dress and white apron , whose large face glowed with robust health and who spoke in a guttural dialect .
to his great amusement , hans castorp was instructed that waitresses here were called dining attendants .
they ordered a bottle of gruaud larose , which hans castorp sent back to be brought to room temperature .
there was asparagus soup , followed by stuffed tomatoes , a roast with several vegetables , an especially well done dessert , and a tray of cheese and fruit . hans castorp ate heartily , although with not quite the lively appetite he had expected .
but he was accustomed to eating large meals—even when he wasn ’ t hungry—purely out of self-respect . joachim did not do much credit to his meal .
he had had enough of the cooking here , he said , everyone up here had , and it was customary to disparage the food , because when you had to sit up here forever and a day .
but he did enjoy drinking , taking to the wine with something like abandon ; and while carefully avoiding all sentiment-laden phrases , he repeatedly expressed his satisfaction that at last someone was here with whom it was possible to have a rational conversation .
yes , it ’ s top-notch , your having come , he said , and there was feeling in his nonchalant voice .
first of all , just the variety of it—i mean , it ’ s an interruption , a break in the everlasting , endless monotony . but i would think time ought to pass quickly for you all , hans castorp suggested .
quickly and slowly , just as you like , joachim replied .
hans castorp drank as well , although his face was burning like fire by now .
but his body still seemed cold , and he felt a pleasurable and yet somehow annoying restlessness in his joints .
words tumbled out , he misspoke himself several times , but went right on with a dismissive wave of his hand .
joachim was likewise in a lively mood , and after the humming , drumming lady suddenly stood up and departed , their conversation turned even more candid and high-spirited . they gesticulated with their forks as they ate , tucked bites of food in their cheeks , looked important , laughed , nodded , shrugged , and went right on talking without even first swallowing their food properly .
joachim wanted to hear about hamburg and brought the conversation around to plans for making the elbe more navigable .
we ’ ve added a line in our budget for an immediate payment of fifty million , and you can be sure that we know exactly what we ’ re doing .
but then , despite the importance he attached to navigation on the elbe , he at once abandoned the topic and demanded that joachim tell him more about life up here and about the guests ; which joachim proved ready and willing to do , happy to open his heart and unburden himself . he had to repeat the part about the bodies being sent down by bobsled and once again asserted unequivocally that he knew it to be true .
and when hans castorp was taken by another fit of laughter , joachim joined in , seeming heartily to enjoy the opportunity , and then told more comic stories , just to add fuel to the general merriment . there was a lady who sat at his table , frau stöhr was her name , and quite ill by the way , the wife of a musician from cannstatt—and she was the most illiterate person he had ever met .
you had to sit there and swallow it , without a trace of a smile .
and she was a gossip , besides , as were most people up here , by the by , and she claimed that another lady , frau iltis , carried a stirletto around with her .
and throwing themselves back in their chairs , half lying , half leaning , they laughed so hard that they shook until they both began to hiccough at almost the same time .
but every now and then , joachim was reminded of his own fate and would turn gloomy .
yes , here we sit laughing , he said with a pained expression , broken by occasional spasms of his diaphragm , and yet there ’ s no telling when i ’ ll get out of here , because when behrens says another six months , that ’ s his low estimate , and you need to be prepared for even longer .
but it is hard , you must admit . it ’ s really sad , isn ’ t it ?
i had already been accepted and would have taken my officer ’ s exam next month .
and here i am lounging about with a thermometer in my mouth and counting frau stöhr ’ s illiterate howlers , and time is passing me by .
a single year plays such an important role at our age , it brings so many changes and so much progress with it when you ’ re living down below .
and here i am stagnating like an old water hole—a stinking pond , and that ’ s not too crude a comparison , either .
strangely enough , hans castorp ’ s only reply came as a question—did they serve porter here ? and when joachim looked at him in astonishment , he realized that his cousin was very near to falling asleep—was in fact already nodding . why , you ’ re asleep , joachim said .
come on , it ’ s high time we went to bed , both of us .
but he joined his cousin all the same , walking on stiff legs and bent so low that he looked like a man being dragged toward the floor by weariness . but as they moved across the now dimly lit lobby , he pulled himself together by sheer force of effort when he heard joachim say , that ’ s krokowski sitting there .
dr. krokowski was sitting in the light , close to the fireplace , just inside the sliding door opening onto one of the social rooms .
he was reading a newspaper , but stood up as the young men approached .
joachim , striking a military pose , said , might i introduce you , doctor , to my cousin castorp ?
dr. krokowski greeted the new resident with a kind of jovial , rugged , and reassuring heartiness , as if to imply that in his presence any diffidence was quite superfluous and cheerful mutual trust the only appropriate response .
he was about thirty-five years old , broad-shouldered , stout , considerably shorter than the two men across from him , so that he had to tip his head back to look them in the eye , and extraordinarily pale—there was almost a translucence , even phosphorescence , to his pallor , and it was enhanced by dark , glowing eyes , black eyebrows , and a rather long beard that already showed a few gray strands and ended in two diverging points .
he wore a black , rather worn , double-breasted business suit and black open-worked shoes , almost sandals really , over gray woolen socks ; hans castorp had seen a soft , floppy collar like that only once before—sported by a photographer in danzig—and indeed it did lend something of the artist ’ s studio to dr. krokowski ’ s general appearance . as he shook the young man ’ s hand , an effusive smile revealed yellowish teeth under his beard , and in a baritone voice betraying the drawl of a foreign accent , he said , we bid you welcome , herr castorp .
i do hope that you ’ ll make yourself comfortable and soon feel right at home here with us .
you have come as a patient , have you not—if you ’ ll pardon the question ?
it was touching to see how hans castorp struggled to be polite and master his drowsiness .
he was annoyed with himself for being in such bad shape , and with the leery self-consciousness of youth he detected traces of an indulgent smirk in the assistant director ’ s reassuring smile .
in answering , he said something about three weeks , mentioned his exams , and added that , thank god , he was perfectly healthy .
dr. krokowski replied , thrusting his head forward at a derisive slant and smiling more broadly .
in that case you are a phenomenon of greatest medical interest .
you see , i ’ ve never met a perfectly healthy person before . and what kind of exams were those , if you ’ ll pardon the question ?
i ’ m an engineer , doctor , hans castorp answered with modest dignity .
and dr. krokowski ’ s smile receded , as it were , losing something of both its energy and warmth for a moment .
and so you ’ ll not be availing yourself here of any sort of medical attention , either physical or psychological ?
no , no , thanks just the same , hans castorp said , almost stepping back .
with that , dr. krokowski broke into his triumphant smile again , and shaking the young man ’ s hand once more , he exclaimed in a loud voice , in that case , sleep well , herr castorp—in full enjoyment of your impeccable health .
and then he dismissed the young men and sat back down to his newspaper .
the elevator was no longer running , and so they used the stairs , climbing in silence , slightly bewildered by their meeting with dr. krokowski .
joachim accompanied hans castorp to room , where they found that the limping concierge had properly delivered the new guest ’ s luggage ; and they chatted for another fifteen minutes while hans castorp unpacked his nightclothes and toiletries after first lighting a thick , mild cigarette .
he never had got around to a last cigar—which struck him as odd , quite unusual , really . he does have a distinguished look about him , he said , and the inhaled smoke tumbled out with the words .
he ’ s pale as chalk .
but as for his choice of footwear , it ’ s really dreadful , i must say .
gray wool socks—and then those sandals .
was he offended there at the end ?
he ’ s a little sensitive , joachim admitted .
you shouldn ’ t have been so brusque about rejecting medical treatment , at least not the psychological part .
he doesn ’ t like for people to try to avoid it .
he ’ s not all that well disposed toward me , either , because i don ’ t confide enough in him .
but now and then i do tell him a dream , so that he ’ ll have something to dissect .
then i really did rub him the wrong way just now , hans castorp said with annoyance , for it always upset him when he offended someone ; and now weariness overcame him with renewed intensity as well .
i ’ ll come by for you for breakfast at eight , joachim said and left .
hans castorp hastily went through the motions of getting ready for bed .
no sooner had he turned out the lamp on his nightstand than sleep overwhelmed him—but he started up again when he recalled that someone had died in that very bed only two nights before .
not for the first time , either , he told himself , as if that might serve to reassure him .
it ’ s just a deathbed , an ordinary deathbed .
and he dozed off .
but as soon as he was asleep , he began to dream and kept on dreaming almost nonstop until morning .
most of the time he saw joachim ziemssen , in a strangely contorted position , riding down a steep slope on a bobsled .
he was as phosphorescently pale as dr. krokowski , and up front sat the austrian horseman , steering , although the face was very vague , like that of someone you ’ ve only heard cough .
it really doesn ’ t matter to us—to us up here , the contorted joachim said , and now it was he , and not the horseman , who was coughing in that ghastly , slimy way . and this made hans castorp weep bitterly , and he realized that he would have to run to the pharmacist to get himself some cold cream .
but frau iltis was sitting beside the road , a roguish pucker on her face , and she was holding something in her hand that was supposed to be her stirletto , but was really nothing more than a safety razor .
that only made hans castorp laugh again , and so he was tossed back and forth by waves of emotion until the dawn came to the half-open balcony door and awakened him .
hans castorp retained only faint recollections of his actual parental home ; he had hardly known his father and mother .
they had both dropped dead within the brief period between his fifth and seventh years of life . his mother had died first , quite unexpectedly , while awaiting the birth of a second child , of an arterial blockage caused by phlebitis , an embolism , dr. heidekind had called it , triggering instantaneous cardiac paralysis—she had been sitting up in bed , laughing , and it looked as if she simply toppled over in a fit of laughter , whereas in fact she did it because she was dead .
it was not something that hans hermann castorp , the father , found easy to understand , and since he had been very fond of his wife and was not the most robust man himself , he simply did not know how to get over it .
from then on , his mind was muddled , his focus narrow ; and in his befuddlement he made mistakes in his business , resulting in serious losses for the firm of castorp and son . while inspecting a harbor warehouse on a windy day the following spring , he caught pneumonia , and since , despite all the conscientious attention given him by dr. heidekind , his already agitated heart could not hold out against the high fever , he , too , was dead within five days . escorted by a quite respectable number of his fellow citizens , he joined his wife in the castorp family grave , a very beautiful plot in the cemetery of saint catherine ’ s church , with a view to the botanical gardens .
his own father , the senator , survived him , if only by a little , and during the brief period until his death—likewise caused by pneumonia , against which he struggled amid great agony , for unlike his son , hans lorenz castorp was a man rooted firmly in life , a tree hard to fell—during this brief period of a mere year and a half , then , the orphaned hans castorp lived in his grandfather ’ s house , which had been built on a narrow lot on the esplanade in the early years of the century just past . its nordic classical façade , painted a dreary , weather-beaten color , was adorned by pilasters at both sides of the front door , which was set in the center of the first floor and had five stairs leading up to it ; the main level was topped off by two more stories , both with windows reaching to the floor and ornamented with wrought-iron grills .
the first floor was taken up exclusively by formal rooms , including the bright dining room—with its ornamental plaster and three windows hung with burgundy curtains and looking out on the little back garden—where during those eighteen months the grandfather and grandson dined together daily at four in the afternoon , served by old fiete , who had rings in both ears , silver buttons on his swallowtail coat , and a batiste necktie exactly like the one worn by his master , in which , also in imitation of his master , he buried his clean-shaven chin , and whom the grandfather always addressed familiarly in plattdeutsch , not for any comical effect ( for he was a man without humor ) but quite matter-of-factly , just as he did whenever he dealt with the commonfolk—warehouse workers , messengers , coachmen , or servants .
the old man understood and nodded and went on eating , sitting very erect between the high mahogany back of his chair and the table , barely bending forward to his plate ; and his grandson , seated opposite , would watch with silent , profound , and unconscious attention as his grandfather ’ s hands—beautiful , white , gaunt , aged hands , with rounded , sharply tapered fingernails and a green signet ring on the right forefinger—arranged a bite of meat , vegetable , and potato on the tip of the fork with a few practiced motions and guided it to the mouth with just the least forward tip of the head .
hans castorp enjoyed listening to the dialect , and also enjoyed fiete ’ s answers , likewise in plattdeutsch , delivered while serving from the left and bending around behind his master to speak into his right ear , out of which the senator heard considerably better than the left .
hans castorp looked down at his own still awkward hands and sensed stored within them the possibility that one day he would hold and use his knife and fork as adeptly as his grandfather .
it was quite a different matter whether he would ever be able to bury his chin in such a necktie , tied so that it filled the wide opening created by his grandfather ’ s peculiarly shaped collar , whose pointed tips brushed the old man ’ s cheeks .
because for that you would have to be as old as he was , and even in those days no one , far and wide , wore such collars and neckties , except him and his old fiete .
what a shame that was , because little hans castorp was delighted by the way his grandfather could rest his chin in the high , snow-white necktie ; and even as an adult , the memory of it pleased him no end—there was something about it that found approval in the very depth of his soul .
when they were finished eating and had folded their napkins , rolling them up and pushing them through their silver rings—a procedure that hans castorp managed only with difficulty , because the napkins were as large as small tablecloths—the senator would rise from his chair while fiete pulled it back and then walk , shuffling his feet as he went , to the den to fetch a cigar .
sometimes his grandson would follow him .
this den was the result of the dining room ’ s having been designed with three windows , so that it extended across the full width of the house , thus leaving no space for three drawing rooms , as was usual with this style of house , but for only two , one of which , placed at right angles to the dining room , would have been disproportionately deep , with only one window to the street . this was why one quarter of its length had been partitioned off , forming the den , a dim , narrow room lit by a skylight and furnished with only a few items : a whatnot stand for the senator ’ s cigar cabinet , a card table with a drawer full of enticing objects—a deck of whist cards , game tokens , scorecards with little hinged stands , a slate and chalk styluses , paper cigar holders , and other things , too—and finally , set back in one corner , a rococo china cabinet made of rosewood , with yellow silk curtains pulled across the inside of its window-panes .
grampa , little hans castorp might say once they were in the den , raising himself up on tiptoe and stretching to reach the old man ’ s ear , please show me the baptismal bowl . and his grandfather , who had already pushed back the long , soft flap of his frock coat and pulled a bundle of keys from his trouser pocket , now opened the china cabinet , from whose interior rose a fragrance the boy found both strange and pleasant .
all sorts of objects that had fallen out of use , which made them all the more captivating , were kept inside : a pair of sinuous silver candlesticks ; a broken barometer , its wooden case carved with figures ; an album of daguerreotypes ; a cedar chest for liqueurs ; a little turk in a bright silk costume , whose body was rigid to the touch but contained a mechanism that , though it had long since fallen into disrepair , had once enabled him to run across the table ; a model of an old-fashioned ship ; and way at the bottom , a rattrap no less .
but from the middle shelf , the old man took a heavily tarnished , round silver bowl set on a silver plate and showed the boy both pieces , separating them and turning them both about in his hands , all the while reciting a story he had told many times before . the bowl and the plate were not originally a set , as one could plainly see and as the boy was now instructed yet again ; but they had been used together , his grandfather said , for around a hundred years now , ever since the bowl had been acquired . the bowl was beautiful , its lines simple and elegant , fashioned according to the austere taste of the early years of the last century .
smooth and massive , it rested on round feet , its interior lined with gold , though the yellow luster had faded with the years .
the only ornamentation was an embossed wreath of roses and serrated leaves around its rim . as for the plate , one could read its much greater age right on its surface . there stood in ornate numbers , and framing the date were all sorts of curlicued engraved lines , done in the modern fashion of the period , bombastic and capricious arabesques and crests that were half stars , half flowers .
the underside , however , was inscribed in a variety of ever-changing scripts with the names of those heads of the household who had been its owners over the course of time . there were seven names in all now , each rounded out with the date of inheritance , and the old man in the white necktie pointed with his ringed forefinger as he read off each of them to his grandson .
his father ’ s name was there , as was in fact his grandfather ’ s , and his great-grandfather ’ s ; and now that syllable came doubled , tripled , and quadrupled from the storyteller ’ s mouth ; and the boy would lay his head to one side , his eyes fixed and full of thought , yet somehow dreamily thoughtless , his lips parted in drowsy devotion , and he would listen to the great-great-great-great—that somber sound of the crypt and buried time , which nevertheless both expressed a reverently preserved connection of his own life in the present to things now sunk deep beneath the earth and simultaneously had a curious effect on him : the same effect visible in the look on his face .
the sound made him feel as if he were breathing the moldy , cool air of saint catherine ’ s church or the crypt in saint michael ’ s , as if he could sense the gentle draft of places where as you walked , hat in hand , you fell into a certain reverential , forward rocking motion , your heels never touching the ground ; and he also thought he could hear the remote , cloistered silence of those reverberating spaces . at the sound of those somber syllables , religious feelings got mixed up with a sense of death and history , and all of it together somehow left the boy with a pleasant sensation—indeed , it may well have been that it was solely for the sake of that sound , just to hear it and join in reciting it , that he had once again asked to be allowed to see the baptismal bowl .
then his grandfather would put the basin back on its tray and let the boy look into its smooth , soft golden hollow , which began to shimmer as it caught the light falling from above .
and it will soon be eight years now , he said , since we held you over it and the water with which you were baptized trickled down into it .
lassen , the sexton from saint jacob ’ s , poured it into the cupped hands of our good pastor bugenhagen , and then it ran down over your hair and into the bowl here .
but we had warmed it first , so that you wouldn ’ t be frightened and start crying , and you didn ’ t , either , quite the contrary , you had been bawling beforehand , making it difficult for bugenhagen to give his homily , but then came the water , and you fell silent , and that was out of respect for the holy sacrament , let us hope .
and in a very few days now , it will be forty-four years since your dear departed father was the baby being baptized , and water ran down from his head into this same bowl .
that happened here , in his parents ’ home , across the way in the drawing room , in front of the middle window , and it was old pastor hesekiel who baptized him , the same one who almost got himself shot by the french when he was a young man , for preaching against their looting and burning—he ’ s been resting in the lord for a long , long time now .
but seventy-five years ago , it was me they baptized , that was in the drawing room , too , and they held my head over this same bowl sitting on its tray here , and the pastor spoke the same words that were spoken over you and your father , and warm , clear water ran down over my hair , too—there wasn ’ t much more of it in those days than i have on my head now—and flowed into this golden basin .
the boy looked up at his grandfather ’ s narrow gray head which was bent over the bowl again , just as it had been in that long-vanished hour he was talking about , and a familiar feeling stole over him—a strange , half-dreamy , half-scary sense of standing there and yet being tugged away at the same time , a kind of fluctuating permanence , that meant both a return to something and a dizzying , everlasting sameness , a feeling that he knew well from previous occasions and that he had been waiting for , hoping it would touch him again .
when considering it later , as a young man , he realized that the image of his grandfather was imprinted much more deeply , clearly , and significantly in his memory than that of his parents—and this may possibly have had its basis both in mutual sympathy and a special physical affinity , because the grandson did look like his grandfather , to the extent that a lad with down on his rosy cheeks can resemble a sallow and stiff septuagenarian . probably the most significant factor , however , was that without question the old man had been the central figure in the family , its picturesque personality . from the viewpoint of the outside world , time had made hans lorenz castorp ’ s character and convictions obsolete long before his passing .
he was a most christian gentleman , a member of a reformed parish , with strict traditional opinions , so stubborn an advocate of restricting qualifications for those who govern to the aristocracy that it was as if he were living in the fourteenth century , when , against the dogged resistance of the old free patricians , tradesmen had first begun to win seats and voices in the town council—in sum , a man who opposed anything new .
his active years had come during decades of violent expansion and numerous upheavals , decades of progress at a forced march , all of which constantly demanded great public courage and sacrifice . but it had not been old castorp ’ s fault , god knows , that the modern spirit had enjoyed its celebrated , brilliant victories . he had held the customs of his forefathers and their old institutions in far higher regard than any expansion of the harbor at breakneck speed or the godless tomfooleries of a great city , had impeded and tempered wherever he could .
and had it been up to him , the city administration nowadays would look just as old-fashioned and idyllic as his office had looked when he was in his prime .
and this was how the old man was viewed , both during his lifetime and after , by his fellow citizens ; and even though little hans castorp understood nothing about the affairs of government , the perceptions gained by his own calm , alert child ’ s eye were much the same—unspoken and therefore uncritical perceptions , though enthusiastic for all that , which when they later became conscious memories retained their exclusively positive stamp , immune to all discussion or analysis . as noted , mutual sympathy was at work here , the kind of family affection and affinity of personality that not infrequently leaps a generation .
senator castorp was tall and gaunt .
the years had bent his back and neck , but he attempted to compensate for this by pressing against the curvature , which pulled down the corners of his mouth in a kind of painful dignity , while the lips , with no supporting teeth behind them , rested on bare gums—he wore his dentures only to eat—and this counterpressure , which presumably also helped him steady his head ( because it had begun to shake of late ) , was probably what caused him to carry himself with an austere , forward tilt and to prop his chin in the way that so pleased little hans .
he loved his snuff ; he had a longish tortoiseshell box inlaid with gold , and snuff was also the reason he carried red handkerchiefs , the tip of one usually visible dangling from the back pocket of his frock coat .
and although this harmless vice added a jaunty touch to his appearance , the ultimate effect was much more that of the license of old age , the kind of carelessness that age either consciously and merrily permits itself or brings with it , cloaked in dignified oblivion ; in any case , it was the only such carelessness in his grandfather ’ s appearance that little hans castorp ’ s sharp eye ever observed .
both to the mind of the seven-year-old and in the memories of the adult , the everyday appearance of the old man was not what was essential and real about him . his essential reality was quite different , much more handsome and authentic than his everyday appearance . that reality , you see , was to be found in a painting—a life-size portrait that at one time had hung in the living room of hans castorp ’ s parents and had been transported along with the boy to the house on the esplanade , where it had been given a spot above the large red silk sofa in the parlor .
it showed hans lorenz castorp in his official dress as a town councillor—the sober , even godly attire of citizens from a vanished century , a costume that later citizens , whether staid or dashing , had carried with them through the years , continuing to wear it on pompous occasions in order ceremoniously to make the past present , and the present past , and to proclaim the permanent continuity of all things and the venerable trustworthiness of their official signatures .
there , large as life , senator castorp stood on a red-tiled floor , against a perspective of columns and gothic arches .
there he stood , his chin lowered , his mouth drawn down , his blue , thoughtful eyes , the bags heavy beneath them , directed into the distance ; he was clad in a robelike black jacket , hanging open at the front , edged in fur along the hem and lapels , and reaching well below his knees . emerging from under its wide , braid-trimmed , puffy sleeves was a second set of tight-fitting sleeves of simpler fabric , ending in lace cuffs that covered the hands to the knuckles .
he had pulled black silk stockings over his skinny old-man ’ s legs , and on his feet he wore shoes with silver buckles . around his neck , however , lay a wide , starched , heavily pleated ruff , slanted forward , but sloping upward on both sides , beneath which , to top it all , could be seen a pleated batiste jabot and a vest .
under one arm he carried an old-fashioned , broad-brimmed hat that tapered to a point .
it was a splendid portrait , painted by a renowned artist , executed tastefully in the style—as suggested by its subject—of the old masters and awakening in the observer all sorts of images of the late middle ages in the spanish netherlands .
little hans castorp had often studied it , not with any artistic acumen of course , but with a certain more general , even penetrating understanding ; and although he had only once seen his grandfather in real life in the fashion pictured there on canvas—just for a brief moment as part of a dignified procession into the town hall—he could not help , as we have said , regarding this pictorial presence as his authentic and real grandfather , seeing in the everyday one a temporary , imperfectly adapted improvisation , so to speak .
from that perspective , the lapses and eccentricities in his everyday appearance were apparently mere imperfections , or inept adaptations , were the vestiges or hints of a pure and true nature that could not be totally eradicated .
granted , his stiff collar and high , white necktie were old-fashioned ; but such a term could never be applied to that marvelous article of clothing—he meant the spanish ruff—of which the former were merely present-day traces .
and it was the same with the peculiar rounded top hat that his grandfather wore in public , which on some higher plane of reality corresponded to the broad-brimmed felt hat in the picture—or the long , pleated frock coat , whose genuine prototype little hans castorp found in the fur- and braid-trimmed robe . and so when the day came to say farewell , in his heart of hearts little hans castorp was relieved to see his grandfather decked out in his authentic perfection . it was in the dining room , the same room where they had so often sat across the table from one another ; in the middle of the room hans lorenz castorp now lay in a silver-trimmed coffin , atop a bier surrounded and besieged with wreaths .
he had battled pneumonia to the end , had battled long and obstinately , even though , to all appearances , he had accommodated himself only in part to contemporary life ; but now here he lay in state—one could not be sure whether triumphant or vanquished , but in any case , with a stern , satisfied look on his face , though it was greatly changed , his nose looking pinched after his struggles ; his lower body shrouded under a coverlet , on which lay a palm frond ; his head propped up on the silk pillow so that his chin rested most handsomely in the indentation at the front of the ceremonial ruff .
and in his hands—half hidden by lace cuffs , the fingers looking cold and inanimate despite their artificially natural pose—someone had placed an ivory cross , upon which his eyes , beneath their lowered lids , seemed to be fixed .
hans castorp had seen his grandfather several times in the early stages of his last illness , but then no more toward the end .
he had been spared any sight of the struggle , which had taken place primarily at night , and had been touched by it only indirectly—the anxious atmosphere in the house , old fiete ’ s reddened eyes , the comings and goings of doctors . but from its outcome , which he now found displayed before him in the dining room , he gathered that his grandfather had now received solemn dispensation from his interim stage and had finally returned to the form appropriate to him—an event of which he could only approve , though old fiete wept and constantly shook his head , even though hans castorp himself wept , just as he had wept at the sight of his unexpectedly deceased mother and , a short time later , of his father lying there equally serene and strange .
for this was now the third time within so few months and at such a young age that little hans castorp ’ s mind and senses had been affected by death—his senses in particular .
the sight of it , the impression it left , was no longer new to him , but really quite familiar , and just as on the first two occasions he had behaved responsibly and kept his composure—with no sign of nervous weakness , although much distressed , as is only natural—he did so now as well , but to an even greater degree . unaware of the practical implications of these events on his life , or perhaps regarding them with childish indifference while trusting that the world would take care of him one way or the other , he betrayed a similarly childish reserve and businesslike attentiveness when viewing coffins , which on this third occasion took on nuances of precociousness , both in his emotional reaction and the look of knowledgeable experience on his face—it being unnecessary likewise to describe his natural reaction of being caught up in the frequent tearful outbursts of others .
within three or four months after his father died , he had forgotten death ; now he remembered it , and all the impressions from before reemerged simultaneously—in every precise , piercing , and incomparable detail .
analyzed and put into words , his feelings might have been expressed as follows : there was something religious , gripping , and sadly beautiful , which was to say , spiritual about death and at the same time something that was the direct opposite , something very material , physical , which one could not really describe as beautiful , or gripping , or religious , or even as sad .
the religious , spiritual side was expressed by the pretentious lying-in-state , by the pomp of flowers and palm fronds—which he knew signified heavenly peace—and also , and more to the point , by the cross between the dead fingers of what had been his grandfather , by the blessings a copy of thorvaldsen ’ s christ extended from the head of the coffin , and by two towering candelabra on either side , which on an occasion like this also took on an ecclesiastical character . the explicit and well-intended purpose of all these arrangements was apparently to show that grandfather had now passed on forever to his authentic and true form .
but they also served another purpose—one that little hans castorp likewise noted , if not admitting it to himself in so many words ; in particular , the masses of flowers and more especially the very well represented tuberoses were there for a more sobering reason—and that was to gloss over the other side of death , the one that is neither beautiful nor sad , but almost indecent in its base physicality , to make people forget it or at least not be reminded of it .
it was this aspect of death that made his dead grandfather look so strange , not really like his grandfather at all , but like a life-size wax doll that death had slipped into the coffin in his place and for which this whole solemn show was being put on . the man who lay there , or better , what lay there , was not grandfather himself , but a shell—which , as hans castorp knew , was not made of wax , but of its own material . it was just stuff , and that was what was indecent , and so not really even sad—no sadder than things that have to do with the body , and only with it , are sad .
little hans castorp gazed at the stuff out of which this life-size dead figure was made , at this waxy , yellow , smooth stuff with the consistency of cheese , gazed at the face and hands of what had been his grandfather .
and just then a fly settled on the inert forehead and began to move its proboscis up and down .
old fiete circumspectly shooed it off , though avoiding actually touching the forehead ; a shadow of respectability darkened his face , as if he should not know , and did not want to know , what he was doing—an expression of propriety , which apparently was related to grandfather ’ s being only a body and nothing more .
all the same , after a long , looping flight , the fly came to rest again on grandfather ’ s fingers , sitting up pertly very close to the ivory cross .
and while all this was going on , hans castorp thought he could smell more clearly than before those faint , but very peculiar and persistent fumes that he knew from before , and which , to his shame , always reminded him of a school chum who suffered from an offensive affliction that made everyone avoid him , the same odor that the tuberose scent was supposed to cover up on the sly , but was unable to do , for all its lovely , austere richness .
he returned several times to stand by the body : one time all alone , except for old fiete ; a second time together with his great-uncle tienappel , the wine merchant , and his two uncles james and peter ; and then a third time as well , when a group of workmen from the harbor in their sunday best stood for a few moments beside the coffin to take leave of the former head of the house of castorp and son .
then came the funeral and a dining room full of people ; dressed in his spanish ruff , pastor bugenhagen from saint michael ’ s , the man who had baptized hans castorp , performed the service , and afterward he spoke to little hans castorp in very friendly tones as they sat together in the coach , the one right behind the hearse and the first in a long , long procession . and with that , this part of hans castorp ’ s life came to an end as well , and a very short time later he changed homes and neighborhoods—for the second time now in his young life .
the change did not work to his detriment , because he moved in with consul tienappel , his legal guardian , and lacked for nothing—certainly not in any personal sense , or for that matter , as regarded the supervision of his larger interests , about which he still knew nothing .
consul tienappel , an uncle of little hans ’ s late mother , acted as executor for the castorp estate , putting the property up for sale , taking charge of liquidating the firm castorp and son , imports and exports , realizing from these transactions some four hundred thousand marks—hans castorp ’ s inheritance , which the consul then invested in gilt-edged securities . at the beginning of each quarter , he deducted from the interest earned—without any prejudice to his sense of family ties—a commission of percent . set well back from harvestehuder weg , the tienappel home was fronted by a large garden ; to the rear it looked out on a lawn where not the tiniest weed was permitted , a public promenade with roses , and beyond it , the river .
although he owned a fine coach , the consul walked to work in the old city every morning , just to get a little exercise , because he sometimes suffered from congestion of the blood in his head ; and he returned home by the same route at five each evening , when , in most civilized fashion , the tienappels sat down to dinner . he was a heavyset man who always dressed in the best english fabrics . his watery-blue eyes were bulgy behind gold-rimmed spectacles , he had a ruddy nose , a gray seaman ’ s beard , and he wore a sparkling diamond on the stubby little finger of his left hand .
his wife had been dead for years .
he had two sons , peter and james—the one in the navy and seldom at home , the other an employee in the family wine business and the designated heir of the firm .
the house had been kept for many years now by schalleen , the daughter of a goldsmith in altona , who always wore white starched ruffles at her thick , cylindrical wrists . she was responsible for laying out an extensive cold buffet at breakfast and supper : shrimp and salmon , eel , goose breast and roast beef with tomato ketchup ; she kept a vigilant eye on the extra servants hired when consul tienappel gave a formal dinner ; and she was also the person who , as best she could , acted as a mother to little hans castorp .
he grew—despite miserable weather , despite wind and fog—grew up , one might say , in his yellow mackintosh , and on the whole was a quite cheerful lad .
he was probably a little anemic from the start , or so dr. heidekind said , prescribing for him a nice daily glass of porter , to be drunk with his snack when he returned from school—a robust brew , as everyone knows , which dr. heidekind believed helped build the blood and which , however that might be , hans castorp discovered , much to his satisfaction , had a calming effect on his spirits and pleasantly assisted him in his proclivity to doze—as his uncle tienappel put it—when he would sit with his mouth slightly open , dreaming away without a single firm thought in his head .
but otherwise he was a regular , healthy lad , a passable tennis-player and oarsman , although on summer evenings , instead of manning an oar , he preferred sitting on the terrace of the uhlenhorst boathouse , a refreshing drink in hand , listening to music and watching the boats as they drifted among the swans , their lights reflected in the bright , smooth water . and if you were to hear him talking—in his nonchalant , reasonable way , his voice a little hollow and monotone , with just a hint of platt—or even if you just saw him there , so blondly correct , his hair nicely trimmed , his head with the stamp of something classic about it , his air cool and languid , suggesting an inherited , unconscious arrogance , then you could not doubt that this hans castorp was an honest , unadulterated product of the local soil , superbly at home in it—even he himself , had he ever actually considered the matter , would not have doubted it for a moment .
the atmosphere of the metropolitan seaport , the damp atmosphere of global shopkeeping and prosperity , had been the air of life itself for his forefathers , and with great gusto he breathed it now as a matter of course and found it profoundly satisfying . his nose took in the fumes of the harbor , of coal and tar , the pungent odors of the world ’ s produce piled high , and his eyes watched the huge steam cranes on the docks—so calm , wise , and monumentally strong that they looked like hardworking elephants—as they transferred tons of sacks , bales , crates , barrels , and carboys from the bowels of idle seagoing vessels to railroad cars and sheds . he watched the merchants in yellow mackintoshes , like the one he himself was wearing , as they streamed at noon toward the exchange , where things could get quite fierce , as he well knew , and someone might very suddenly be motivated to hand out invitations to a grand dinner , in hopes of prolonging his credit .
he watched—and this would later prove to be his special area of interest—the teeming dry docks , the towering , mammoth cadavers of ships that had sailed to asia and africa , but now lay braced on strutbeams thick as trees , looking monstrous and clumsy on dry land , their keels and screws naked , swarmed over by hosts of midget laborers—hammering , scouring , whitewashing . he gazed at the roofed-over slips , which were wrapped in webs of smoky fog and from which the ribs of ships under construction protruded , while engineers , blueprints and pump-charts in hand , gave orders to the workers .
from boyhood on , these were all familiar sights to hans castorp , awakening in him a warm sense of belonging , a feeling that reached its zenith , perhaps , on those occasions when he would join james tienappel or his cousin ziemssen—joachim ziemssen—in the pavilion on the alster for a sunday breakfast of warm rolls and smoked beef , washed down by a glass of old port , then lean back in his chair and puff devotedly on his cigar . for in this he was true to type : that he dearly and truly loved living well , and despite his thin-blooded , refined appearance , he clung to the cruder pleasures of life as a gluttonous baby clings to its mother ’ s breast .
the upper class of this commercial and democratic city-state bequeaths its children the burden of higher civilization , and hans castorp bore it on his shoulders with a certain easy dignity . he was bathed spotless as a baby , and he had his clothes made by a tailor who enjoyed the trust of the young men in his circle .
schalleen took splendid care of his little treasure of neatly monogrammed underwear and shirts , which were tucked away in the english-style drawers of his wardrobe . even when hans castorp left home to study , he regularly sent his things home to be laundered and mended—for it was his maxim that no one in the empire except residents of hamburg knew how to iron—and a badly creased cuff on one of his pretty pastel shirts filled him with a terrible unease .
although the shape of his hands was not particularly aristocratic , he took good care of them , keeping the skin supple and setting them off with a simple platinum band and his grandfather ’ s signet ring ; his teeth , which were rather soft and subject to damage , had been repaired with gold inlays .
both when standing and walking , he thrust his lower body forward somewhat , which left the impression of a certain slackness ; but his posture at the dinner table was excellent . he would politely turn his erect upper body toward his neighbor for small talk ( always reasonable , with a hint of platt ) , would rest his elbows easily at his sides when cutting a piece of fowl or deftly extracting the pink meat of a lobster claw with the appropriate utensils . when a meal was over , his first requirement was a finger bowl of perfumed water , his second a russian cigarette , on which he paid no customs duties , since he had found a way to obtain them with a few well-placed , casual bribes .
this was a prelude to his cigar , a maria mancini , a very tasty brand from bremen—we shall come to speak about that again—whose spicy toxins blended so satisfyingly with those of his coffee .
hans castorp kept his tobacco away from the deleterious effects of the house ’ s steam heat by storing it in the cellar , and every morning he would descend to provide his cigar case with its daily ration . only reluctantly would he have eaten butter served in pats rather than in fluted little balls . as is apparent , we are attempting to include anything that can be said in hans castorp ’ s favor , and we offer our judgments without exaggeration , intending to make him no better or worse than he was .
hans castorp was neither a genius nor an idiot , and if we refrain from applying the word mediocre to him , we do so for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with his intelligence and little or nothing to do with his prosaic personality , but rather out of deference to his fate , to which we are inclined to attribute a more general significance . he was bright enough to meet the demands of a modern secondary school without overtaxing himself ; in fact , under no conceivable circumstances would he have been willing to do that , no matter what the goal—not so much out of fear that it might be painful as because he saw absolutely no reason why he should , or to put it better : no unequivocal reason . but perhaps that is why we do not call him mediocre—precisely because he felt that in some way or other such an unequivocal reason was lacking .
a human being lives out not only his personal life as an individual , but also , consciously or subconsciously , the lives of his epoch and contemporaries ; and although he may regard the general and impersonal foundations of his existence as unequivocal givens and take them for granted , having as little intention of ever subjecting them to critique as our good hans castorp himself had , it is nevertheless quite possible that he senses his own moral well-being to be somehow impaired by the lack of critique .
all sorts of personal goals , purposes , hopes , prospects may float before the eyes of a given individual , from which he may then glean the impulse for exerting himself for great deeds ; if the impersonal world around him , however , if the times themselves , despite all their hustle and bustle , provide him with neither hopes nor prospects , if they secretly supply him with evidence that things are in fact hopeless , without prospect or remedy , if the times respond with hollow silence to every conscious or subconscious question , however it may be posed , about the ultimate , unequivocal meaning of all exertions and deeds that are more than exclusively personal—then it is almost inevitable , particularly if the person involved is a more honest sort , that the situation will have a crippling effect , which , following moral and spiritual paths , may even spread to that individual ’ s physical and organic life . for a person to be disposed to more significant deeds that go beyond what is simply required of him—even when his own times may provide no satisfactory answer to the question of why—he needs either a rare , heroic personality that exists in a kind of moral isolation and immediacy , or one characterized by exceptionally robust vitality . neither the former nor the latter was the case with hans castorp , and so he probably was mediocre after all , though in a very honorable sense of that word .
in saying this , we are speaking here of the young man ’ s innermost state not only during his years in school , but also during the period that followed , when he had already chosen his profession .
as to his career at school , he did indeed have to repeat a class or two .
but for the most part , his background , his urbane manners , and ultimately a pretty , if rather dispassionate talent for mathematics helped him move ahead ; and after receiving his report card in his freshman year , he concluded he would finish school—primarily , truth to tell , because that allowed him to extend a familiar , provisional , indecisive state of affairs and to win time for reflection as to what hans castorp would most like to do , because he was not even close to deciding that , not even as a senior , and when it finally was decided ( to say he decided would be saying almost too much ) , he was quite aware that the decision could just as easily have been otherwise .
but this much was true—he had always taken great delight in ships .
as a small boy he had filled his notebooks with penciled drawings of fishing cutters , vegetable barges , and five-masters .
and when at age fifteen he had the chance to watch from a front-row seat as the hansa , a new double-screw mail-steamer , was launched from the docks of blohm and voss , he painted a strikingly good watercolor of the trim ship , exact down to almost the last detail , which consul tienappel had hung in his private office . and he had so lovingly and deftly captured the transparent , glassy-green , rolling sea that someone had said to consul tienappel that the lad had talent and would make a good painter of seascapes—a pronouncement that the consul had no qualms repeating to his ward , because hans castorp simply laughed amiably at the idea and gave not a moment ’ s thought to a life of eccentricity and starving for art .
you don ’ t have much , his uncle tienappel would remind him .
james and peter will get the lion ’ s share of my money , that is to say , it stays in the business and peter will draw an annuity .
what belongs to you is invested quite nicely and will yield a secure return .
but it ’ s no fun nowadays trying to live off interest unless one has at least five times as much as you have , and if you fancy living a nice life here in the city , like the one to which you ’ re accustomed , then you ’ ll have to earn a tidy sum yourself—take note of that , my boy .
hans castorp took note and looked around for a profession in which he could prove himself—both to himself and others .
but he thought quite highly of his profession once he had chosen it—at the suggestion of old wilms , of the firm of tunder and wilms , who said to consul tienappel over a game of whist one sunday evening that hans castorp should study shipbuilding , that was the ticket , and join his firm , where he would certainly keep his eye on him .
although damned complicated and demanding , it was nevertheless an excellent , important , splendid profession and far preferable , given his peaceable nature at any rate , to that of his cousin ziemssen , who was the son of his late mother ’ s half sister and determined to become an officer .
joachim ziemssen wasn ’ t exactly strong in the lungs , of course , but that was precisely the reason why a profession in the open air , one that could hardly be said to involve serious brainwork or stress , was probably just the thing for him—as hans castorp had remarked rather patronizingly .
for he had the greatest respect for work , although , for his part , he found that he did tire easily .
which brings us back to our previous suggestion , which proposed that the damage inflicted by the times on someone ’ s personal life can have a direct influence on that person ’ s physical organism . how could hans castorp not have held work in high esteem ?
that would have been unnatural .
as things stood , work had to be regarded as unconditionally the most estimable thing in the world—ultimately there was nothing one could esteem more , it was the principle by which one stood or fell , the absolute of the age , the answer , so to speak , to its own question .
his respect for work was , in its way , religious and , so far as he knew , unquestioning .
but it was another matter to love it . and as much as he respected it , he could not love it—for one simple reason : it did not agree with him .
the exertion of hard work was a strain on his nerves , tiring him quickly , and he quite candidly admitted that he much preferred his leisure—when time passed easily , unencumbered by the leaden weight of toil , and lay open before you , instead of being divided into a series of hurdles that you had to grit your teeth and take . strictly speaking , the contradictions in his attitude toward work needed to be resolved . if he had been able to believe at the foundations of his soul ( there where he himself did not know what was what ) that work has unconditional value , is a principle that answers its own question , might not both body and mind—first his mind , and through it , his body—have been more amenable to work and exhibited more stamina ?
which brings us back to our previous question about his mediocrity or more-than-mediocrity , to which we do not wish to give a conclusive answer .
for we do not see ourselves as hans castorp ’ s eulogist and want to leave room for the suggestion that , for him , work was simply something that stood in the way of the unencumbered enjoyment of a maria mancini .
he was not attracted to military service himself .
something deep within him resisted the idea , and he knew how to avoid it .
it may also be that dr. eberding , the staff surgeon , who was a regular on harvestehuder weg , had heard in casual conversation with consul tienappel that young castorp , having just left for the university , would regard being forced to bear arms as a serious disruption in his studies .
his brain , which worked calmly and slowly—particularly since hans castorp retained the habit of drinking porter with his morning snack—gradually filled up with analytical geometry , differential equations , mechanics , projective geometry , and graphical statics .
he calculated displacements—with full cargo and empty—stabilities , shifts in trim , and metacenters , though it was drudgery at times . his technical drawings , all the sketches of ribbing , waterlines , and full-length projections , were not quite as good as his watercolor depiction of the hansa on the high sea , but when the abstract graphics required the sensual addition of a wash for shading or lively colors for various materials in a cross section , hans castorp proved more skillful than most .
when he came home on vacations—very neat , very well dressed , sporting a little reddish-blond moustache in the middle of his sleepy , young , patrician face , looking for all the world like a young man on his way to a respectable place in life—the people who concerned themselves with the affairs of the community , who kept themselves well informed about various families and the staffing of municipal offices ( and that means most people in a self-governing city-state ) , his fellow citizens , then , looked him over and asked themselves what public role young castorp might one day grow into .
he had tradition behind him , his was a good , old name , and it was almost inevitable that someday he would have to be reckoned with as a political factor .
by then he would be sitting in the assembly or on the committee of burghers , making laws , would hold an honorable post where he would participate in the concerns of government , as an administrator , perhaps as director of the finance or building committees .
his voice would be listened to and his vote would count .
people were curious about which party young castorp would one day embrace .
appearances were deceiving , but he looked exactly like someone democrats would not be able to count on , and the resemblance to his grandfather was undeniable .
perhaps he would take after him , become a conservative , a brake on other elements .
that was quite possible—but so was the opposite .
for he was an engineer after all , a shipbuilder in the making , a man of global commerce and technology .
so that it might well be that hans castorp would join up with the radicals , turn out to be a go-getter , a profane destroyer of old buildings and beautiful landscapes , as footloose as a jew , as irreverent as an american , a man likely to prefer a ruthless break with venerable traditions to cautious development of natural resources , a man who would plunge the state into reckless experiments—that was conceivable , too .
was it in his blood to regard their excellencies , the men for whom the sentries at the town hall presented arms , as elders who knew best—or would he be inclined to support the opposition in the assembly ?
his curious fellow citizens could find no answer to such questions in those blue eyes under their reddish-blond brows ; and hans castorp , being an unwritten page , would probably have had no answer , either .
when he set out on the journey where we met him , he was twenty-three years old . he had four semesters of study at danzig polytechnic behind him , plus four more spent at technical colleges in braunschweig and karlsruhe , had recently put his first final exams behind him , passing them with no trouble , though without fanfare or drum roll , and was about to join the firm of tunder and wilms as an unsalaried engineer-in-training in order to gain practical experience on the docks .
and at that point , his life took the following turn .
his exams had meant a long period of concentrated work , and upon returning home he looked paler than he ought—even given his general type .
dr. heidekind scolded whenever he saw him and insisted on a change of air , and he meant a radical change . norderney or wyk on the island of föhr , he said , would not do it this time , and if you were to ask him , what hans castorp needed was a few weeks in the alps before going to work on the docks . that was fine , consul tienappel told his nephew and ward , but then their paths would have to part for the summer , because wild horses couldn ’ t drag him , consul tienappel , to the alps .
that was not for him , he required sensible barometric pressure or he would have another attack . hans castorp could go right ahead and take a trip to the alps . why not pay joachim ziemssen a visit ?
that was a logical suggestion . joachim ziemssen was ill in fact—not ill like hans castorp , but really , dangerously ill , had even given them all quite a scare .
he had always been susceptible to bronchitis and fevers , and then one day he actually coughed up red , and joachim was shipped off posthaste to davos—much to his great regret and dismay , because he was very close to seeing his ambition fulfilled . bowing to the will of his family , he had first spent a couple of semesters studying law , but then , following an irresistible urge , he had changed horses and volunteered as an ensign , and had been accepted .
and for the last five months he had been sitting in the international sanatorium berghof ( dr. behrens , supervising physician ) , and was bored half to death , as he wrote in a postcard .
and so if hans castorp was to treat himself to a little vacation before taking up his job with tunder and wilms , nothing could be more sensible than to provide his poor cousin with company up there in the mountains—it was the most pleasant solution for both parties .
it was the height of summer when he decided to take the trip—already the last week of july . he planned to stay three weeks .
hans castorp had been afraid he would oversleep , he had been so thoroughly exhausted , but he was up and about earlier than necessary and had plenty of time leisurely to pursue his usual , highly civilized morning routine—its chief utensils included a rubber basin , a wooden bowl of green , lavender-scented soap , and a straw-colored brush—and was able not only to tend to matters of personal hygiene but also to unpack and put his things away . and as he passed the silver-plated blade across the perfumed foam on his cheeks , he recalled his muddled dreams and smiled an indulgent smile at such nonsense , shaking his head with the superiority of a man shaving by the light of reasonable day .
he did not feel all that well rested , but fresh enough to meet the morning .
he powdered his cheeks and slipped into his plaid undershorts and red morocco-leather slippers , and still drying his hands , he stepped out onto the balcony , which , although private , was connected to those adjoining and separated from them only by an opaque glass partition that extended almost to the railing .
the morning was cool and cloudy .
long banks of fog lay motionless along the hills to both sides , while masses of clouds , white and gray , were draped on the more distant mountains .
patches and streaks of blue sky were visible here and there , and when a ray of sun broke through , the village in the valley below glistened white against the dark forests of pine on the slopes .
somewhere morning music was playing ; presumably it came from the same hotel where the concert had been held the evening before .
muted chords of a chorale drifted toward him ; a march followed after a brief pause .
hans castorp loved music with all his heart , its effect being much like that of the porter he drank with his morning snack—profoundly calming , numbing , and doze-inducing—and he listened now with pleasure , his head tilted to one side , mouth open , eyes slightly bloodshot .
he looked down at the winding road they had followed up to the sanatorium the evening before .
short-stemmed , starlike gentians were blooming in the moist grass of the slope .
next to a metal-roofed arcade , open to the south and filled with lounge chairs , stood a flagpole , painted reddish brown and displaying a banner that fluttered full now and then—a fantasy flag , green and white , with a snake-entwined caduceus , the symbol of healing , at its center .
a woman was walking in the garden , an older lady with a gloomy , even tragic look .
clad completely in black , with a black veil wound round her disheveled grayish-black hair , she wandered restlessly along the paths , keeping an even but quick pace , her knees slightly bent , her arms hanging stiffly at an angle in front of her .
her aging face , with its pale mediterranean complexion and large , careworn mouth turned down at one corner , reminded hans castorp of a picture he had once seen of a famous tragedian ; and it was eerie to watch how this pale woman dressed in black matched her long , somber strides , apparently without realizing it , to the rhythm of march music in the distance .
hans castorp gazed down at her in thoughtful sympathy , and it seemed as if her sad appearance darkened the morning sun .
simultaneously , however , he perceived something else , something audible , coming from the adjoining room on his left , the room with the russian couple , so joachim had said—noises that were likewise ill suited to this cheerful , fresh morning , that tainted it , making it seem sultry somehow .
giggles , gasps , grapplings—there was no disguising the indelicate nature of the sound , although in his kindheartedness the young man at first tried hard to give it a harmless interpretation . one could use other terms for his kindheartedness—an insipid phrase like purity of soul , for instance , or a more serious and beautiful word like modesty , or disparaging words such as avoidance of the truth and hypocrisy , or even a phrase about the mystic piety of shyness—and hans castorp ’ s reaction to the sounds from the adjoining room combined something of them all and was visible now as a shadow of respectability that darkened his face , as if he should not know and did not want to know anything about what he heard there .
and with this look on his face he returned to his room to avoid having to listen any longer to the proceedings , which despite the giggles sounded terribly serious , disconcertingly so . but the events on the far side of the wall were even more audible from his room . an apparent chase around the furniture , the crash of an upturned chair , a grab , an embrace , slaps and kisses—and then , of all things to accompany the invisible scene , a waltz was struck up in the distance , the tired melody of a popular ballad .
hans castorp stood , towel in hand , and listened against his best intentions .
and suddenly a blush rose up under his talcum , because what he had clearly seen coming had now arrived , and beyond any doubt , the game had turned bestial .
he thought , turning away to finish dressing with as much noise as he could manage .
well , they ’ re married , for heaven ’ s sake , that ’ s as it should be at least .
but in broad daylight , that is a bit much .
after all , they are ill , that ’ s why they ’ re here , or one of them is at least , and a little self-control wouldn ’ t be out of place .
but of course , he realized angrily , the real scandal is that the walls are so thin and that you can hear everything so clearly , and that ’ s simply intolerable !
i wonder if i shall see these people later , or even be introduced to them ?
but now hans castorp realized to his amazement that the flush that had come to his freshly shaven cheeks had not subsided , or at least the warmth that had come with it was not about to depart—the same hot , dry face that had bothered him yesterday evening , and that had disappeared while he slept , was back now in full force . this did not make him feel any friendlier toward the married couple next door , indeed he pouted his lips and muttered something very disparaging about them ; and now he made the mistake of splashing his face with water again to cool it , which only made matters worse .
and so he was feeling cross and at loose ends when he heard his cousin knock on the wall and call out to him . his expression , as joachim entered the room , was not that of a man refreshed by sleep and ready to greet the morning .
so that was your first night up here .
are you well satisfied ? he was ready for a walk , dressed in sporty clothes and sturdy , tooled boots , his ulster flung over his arm , the outline of the flat bottle clearly visible in one pocket .
he wasn ’ t wearing a hat today , either .
thanks , hans castorp replied , well enough .
who was the woman in black out in the garden ?
joachim knew at once whom he meant .
that ’ s what we all call her at least , because those are the only words you ever hear out of her .
she ’ s mexican , you see , and knows not a word of german and almost no french , either , just a few scraps .
she ’ s been here with her eldest son for five weeks now , a perfectly hopeless case , who ’ ll be making his exit soon enough—it ’ s all through him , his whole body ’ s poisoned with it , you could say , and at that stage it looks a lot like typhoid fever , behrens says—gruesome for all involved , at any rate .
and two weeks ago , now , her second son arrived up here , because he wanted to see his brother one last time—handsome young fellow , by the way , but then so is the other—both of them pretty as pictures , with those glowing eyes that drive the ladies crazy . well , the younger one already had a little bit of a cough down below , but was otherwise in quite good shape .
and no sooner does he arrive than he has a temperature—and i mean a high fever , a hundred and three right away—he takes to his bed , and if he ever gets up again , behrens says , he ’ ll have more luck than sense .
but in any case , it was high time , and then some , for him to come up here . yes , and since then the mother just wanders about , when she ’ s not sitting with them , and the only thing she ever says to anyone she meets is : tous les deux ! because that ’ s all she knows how to say , and there ’ s no one here who understands spanish .
so that ’ s her problem , hans castorp said .
i wonder if she ’ ll say the same thing to me when i get to know her ?
that would be so strange—i mean , it would be comical and weird at the same time , he said , and his eyes took on yesterday ’ s look—seemed too hot and heavy , as if he had been weeping for a long time , and shone with the same glint that the austrian horseman ’ s novel cough had enkindled in them .
in fact , he felt as if he had only just now reestablished a connection with yesterday , as if he were taking in the whole picture again , as it were , which had not really been the case since he awoke .
he was ready , by the way , he declared , shaking a few drops of lavender water on his handkerchief so that he could dab at his brow and under his eyes .
if it ’ s all right with you , we can go to breakfast—tous les deux , he added as a joke , in a burst of high spirits .
joachim cast him a gentle glance and smiled a curious smile—melancholy and slightly mocking , it seemed—but why , he kept to himself .
after making sure that he had cigars to smoke , hans castorp picked up his walking stick , coat , and hat—the last out of obstinacy , because he was all too definite in his own civilized habits to change them lightly and adopt strange new ones for a mere three weeks . and so they left , taking the stairs , and as they passed one door or another , joachim would name its occupant—german names , but also all sorts of odd-sounding ones—adding brief remarks about the person ’ s character and the severity of the case .
they also met people already returning from breakfast , and whenever joachim said good morning to anyone , hans castorp would politely tip his hat .
he was tense and nervous , like a young man about to introduce himself to a host of strangers , all the while plagued by the distinct feeling that his eyes and face are red—which was only partly true , because he was actually rather pale .
before i forget , he suddenly said rather impulsively , you can go ahead and introduce me to the lady in the garden if we happen to meet her , i have no objections .
she can repeat her tous les deux ’ to me , it won ’ t matter . i ’ m ready for it now and understand what it means and will know how to put on the proper face .
but i don ’ t want to make the acquaintance of the russian couple , do you hear ?
i definitely don ’ t want that .
they are people devoid of all manners , and although i am going to have to live next door to them for three weeks because there was no other way to arrange things , i do not wish to know them .
yes , just him , joachim said , obviously preoccupied .
did they disturb you all that much ? yes , they are barbarians , so to speak—uncivilized , to put a word on it—i did warn you . he always comes to meals in a leather jacket—quite shabby , let me tell you .
and she ’ s not all that well groomed herself , despite the plumed hat .
but in any case , you needn ’ t worry , they sit a good distance away , at the bad russian table—because there ’ s also a good russian table , where the more refined russians sit . so there ’ s hardly any possibility you ’ d meet them , even if you wanted to .
it ’ s not at all easy to make acquaintances here , if only because there are so many foreigners among the guests .
i personally have got to know only a few myself in all my months here .
which of them is ill ?
he is , i think .
they hung their coats on the stands outside the dining hall , and entered it , a bright , low-vaulted room , where voices buzzed , dishes clattered , and dining attendants scurried about with steaming pots of coffee .
there were seven tables in the dining hall , five placed lengthwise , only two crosswise .
they took only a few steps diagonally across the room , and hans castorp found that he was already at the place set for him , at the end of the middle table toward the front of the room , halfway between the two crosswise tables .
standing erect behind his chair , hans castorp bowed stiffly and cordially to his tablemates as joachim formally introduced them , although he barely looked at them , let alone made a conscious note of their names .
the only face and name he put together was frau stöhr , noticing her red face and oily , ash-blond hair , and an expression of such willful ignorance that it was easy to believe her guilty of howling gaffes .
there were pots of marmalade and honey , bowls of oatmeal and creamed rice , plates of scrambled eggs and cold meats ; they had been generous with the butter . someone lifted the glass bell from a soft swiss cheese and cut off a piece ; what was more , a bowl of fruit , both fresh and dried , stood in the middle of the table .
a dining attendant in black and white asked hans castorp what he wanted to drink—cocoa , coffee , or tea ?
she was as small as a child , with an old , long face—a dwarf , he realized with a shock .
he looked at his cousin , who merely shrugged and lifted an eyebrow as if to say , right , what else is new ?
and so hans castorp simply accepted the fact and , since it was a dwarf , asked for his tea with special courtesy .
he began with some creamed rice topped with sugar and cinnamon , meanwhile letting his eyes wander over the other items he intended to sample and across the seven tables of assembled guests—joachim ’ s colleagues , his companions in misfortune , all with the same illness deep inside , all chatting and breakfasting . the room was done in the kind of modern decor that combines the most efficient simplicity with just a dash of fantasy .
it was not deep in relation to its width , and on all four sides was a kind of passageway where the sideboards stood and that opened as a series of arches onto the central dining area .
its columns were paneled with a sandalwood finish , but only partway up ; the top of each was painted white , like the upper half of the walls and the ceiling , but colorfully trimmed with simple , cheerful stenciled stripes , which then continued along the broad arches of the low ceiling . the hall was also decorated with several shiny brass chandeliers , all electric , each a series of three stacked rings joined by delicate filigree , with bells of milk glass set like little moons on the lowest circle .
there were four glass doors—two on the long wall opposite , opening onto a veranda outside ; a third up front to the left , leading directly into the front lobby ; and finally the one through which hans castorp had entered and that opened off a different hallway , because joachim had not used the same set of stairs as the night before .
to his right was a homely creature in black , with a dull , flushed complexion and fuzzy cheeks ; he took her to be a seamstress or dressmaker , chiefly because her breakfast consisted of nothing but coffee and buttered rolls—and for some reason he had always associated dressmakers with coffee and buttered rolls .
on his left sat an english maiden lady—likewise well on in years , very ugly , with skinny , frigid fingers , who was drinking tea the color of blood and reading letters from home , written in a full , rounded hand .
next to her came joachim , and then frau stöhr in a scotchplaid woolen blouse . she kept the balled fist of her left hand pressed to her cheek while she ate and took obvious pains to make a refined impression when she talked , primarily by pulling her upper lip back to expose her long , narrow , rabbitlike teeth .
a young man with a sparse moustache and an expression on his face as if he had something foul-tasting in his mouth sat down next to her and ate his breakfast in total silence . hans castorp had already taken his seat when the fellow entered , his chin sunk against his chest as he walked , and took his place without a glance at anyone , showing by his demeanor that he absolutely did not wish to be introduced to the new guest .
perhaps he was too ill to value or see any point in mere formalities , or even to take any interest in his surroundings .
seated across from him , very briefly , was an extraordinarily gaunt , very blond young woman , who emptied a bottle of yogurt onto her plate , spooned down this dairy product , and promptly departed .
the table conversation was not exactly lively .
joachim chatted politely with frau stöhr , inquiring after her health and expressing gentlemanly regrets that it left something to be desired .
she complained of her listlessness .
degrees when she got up , and what would it be by afternoon ? the dressmaker admitted to a temperature equally as high , but declared the effect was just the opposite with her , that she felt quite excitable , nervous and restless inside , as if some special , decisive event were about to happen , which was not the case at all , this being simply a physical excitation with no psychological basis . she was probably not a dressmaker after all , because she spoke correctly , almost pedantically .
all the same , hans castorp found her excitability , or at least her discussion of it , somehow inappropriate , almost indecent for such a nondescript , insignificant creature . he asked them , first the dressmaker and then frau stöhr , how long they had been up here—the former had been a resident for five months , the latter for seven ; he marshaled his english to ask his neighbor on the left what sort of tea that was she was drinking—rose-hip , he learned—and whether it tasted good , to which she responded almost stormily in the affirmative . he now gazed out across the room where people were coming and going : early breakfast was not a strictly communal affair .
he had been a little afraid of the dreadful effect all this might have on him , but found himself disappointed in that—the dining hall atmosphere was quite congenial , one had no sense of being in a place of misery .
well-tanned young people of both sexes entered humming a tune , spoke with the dining attendants , and weighed into breakfast with a robust appetite .
there were more mature people as well , married couples , a whole family with children , including teenage boys , all speaking russian .
almost all the women wore close-fitting jackets of wool or silk , called sweaters , in white or bright colors , with shawl collars and side pockets ; it looked very pretty when they just stood there chatting , both hands buried in their sweater pockets .
photographs were passed around at several tables—recent shots they had taken themselves , no doubt ; at one table they were trading postage stamps .
the talk was of the weather , of how one had slept and what one ’ s oral measurement had been that morning .
most of them were cheerful—for no particular reason presumably , but simply because they had no immediate cares and were assembled in considerable numbers .
a few people , to be sure , sat at the table with heads propped in their hands , staring straight ahead .
people let them stare and paid them no attention .
a door , the one to his left that led to the lobby , had banged shut—someone had simply let it slam , or perhaps even slammed it intentionally , and that was a noise that hans castorp absolutely could not tolerate , he had always hated it .
perhaps it was a learned dislike , perhaps an inborn idiosyncrasy—whatever it was , he abhorred banging doors and could have slapped anyone guilty of slamming one within earshot .
in this case , the door was divided into little glass panes , which only heightened the shock : it was a bang and a rattle .
damn it , hans castorp thought angrily , what kind of sloppiness is that ?
since the seamstress had said something to him at the same moment , he had no chance to determine who the malefactor was . but as he answered the seamstress , there were deep furrows between his blond eyebrows and his face was wrenched with distress .
joachim asked whether the doctors had been through yet .
yes , they had been there once already , someone replied , but had left the dining hall at almost the same moment the cousins arrived . then they might as well not wait , joachim said .
there would be an opportunity in the course of the day to make the introductions .
but at the door they almost collided with director behrens , who came striding through it at high speed , followed by dr. krokowski .
that could have meant some badly trodden corns for all parties .
he spoke with a strong lower saxon accent , chewing his words broadly .
so , you ’ re the fellow , he said to hans castorp , after joachim clicked his heels together and made the introductions .
and he extended a hand as big as a shovel .
he was a bony man , a good three heads taller than dr. krokowski , with a shock of white hair ; his neck vertebrae stuck out , and his watery , bloodshot blue eyes protruded ; he had a snub nose above a little short-cropped moustache , which sat slightly askew because his upper lip was turned up at one corner .
what joachim had said about his cheeks proved to be the absolute truth—they were purple , making his head look that much more colorful against his belted , white surgical smock , which fell just below the knees , revealing striped trousers and colossal feet in a pair of yellow , rather worn , laced boots . dr. krokowski was in professional uniform as well , except that his smock was more shirtlike , with elastic at the wrists , and of a black , shiny fabric that only emphasized his pallor .
he played the role of the perfect assistant , taking no part whatever in the exchanged greetings—although the tense , critical way he held his mouth suggested that he found his subordinate position a little absurd . the director asked , gesturing with his hand , pointing now at one , now at the other , and looking down out of bloodshot blue eyes .
well , is he going to march to the pipe and drum like you ?
he asked joachim , nodding his head toward hans castorp .
ha , god forbid—right ? i spotted it at once . and now he spoke directly to hans castorp : there ’ s something so civilian , so comfortable about you—no rattling sabers like our corporal here .
you would be a better patient than he , i ’ d lay odds on that .
i can tell right off whether someone will make a competent patient or not , because that takes talent , everything takes talent , and this myrmidon here hasn ’ t the least talent for it .
for military drill , maybe , i can ’ t say as to that , but none for being ill. he constantly wants to leave , can you believe it ?
forever asking to leave , pesters and badgers me and simply can ’ t wait to live a life of drudgery down below .
won ’ t give us six months of his time .
well , your good cousin will know better how to appreciate us , he ’ ll be able to amuse himself .
there ’ s no shortage of ladies—we have the most adorable ladies here .
many of them quite picturesque—viewed externally , at least . but you ’ ll have to improve your color somewhat , too , otherwise the ladies will give you the cold shoulder .
the golden tree of life is green , true , but a green face is really not quite the thing .
totally anemic , of course , he said , and mechanically stepped up to hans castorp , extended two fingers , and pulled an eyelid down . no doubt of it , totally anemic , just as i said .
it was not all that stupid of you to leave your hamburg to fend for itself for a while .
but if i might use this opportunity to give you some modest advice—quite sine pecunia , of course—as long as you ’ re here with us , why don ’ t you do just what your cousin does ? in a case like yours , there ’ s no wiser course than to live for a while as if it were a slight tuberculosis pulmonum , and build up your protein a little . it ’ s very curious , you see , the way protein is metabolized up here .
but now , do get on with your promenade ! but no more than half an hour .
and make sure you stick the old mercury cigar in your mouth afterward . and always jot down the results , right , ziemssen ? conscientiously doing one ’ s duty .
i ’ ll want to see your chart come saturday .
and your good cousin should measure , too .
have a good time . and dr. krokowski joined him as he sailed off , swinging his arms , palms turned clear around to the back , tossing his question right and left as to whether people had slept well , which was universally answered in the affirmative .
very nice man , hans castorp said as they walked out the front door , with a friendly nod to the limping concierge , who was sitting in his office sorting letters .
the main door was on the southeast side of the large white building , whose middle section rose one story higher than the two wings and was crowned by a clock tower roofed with slate-colored sheet iron .
leaving the building by this exit , you did not approach the garden , but came out facing directly onto an open slope of mountain meadows , dotted with a few tallish firs and several low mountain pines that hugged the ground . the path they took—actually it was the only one available other than the main road that descended to the valley—led them gently up the rise to their left , past the rear of the sanatorium , where the kitchens and offices were located and steel garbage cans lined the railing beside the cellar stairs , and held to that direction for a good distance , then made a sharp hairpin to the right and began a steeper ascent up the sparsely wooded hill .
it was a firm earthen path , reddish in color and a little damp , with boulders here and there along the edge .
the cousins quickly learned that they were not alone on their walk . guests who had finished breakfast shortly after them followed on their heels , and coming toward them were whole groups of people on their way back , stomping the way people tend to do walking downhill .
very nice man , hans castorp repeated .
has such an easy way with words , it ’ s fun just to listen to him .
but i ’ m going to light a real one now , he said , coming to a halt . i can ’ t stand it any longer .
i ’ ve not had a decent smoke since yesterday noon .
excuse me a moment .
and from a buff leather etui monogrammed in silver , he extracted one of his maria mancinis—a lovely specimen from the top of the box , flattened on just one side the way he especially liked it—trimmed the tip squarely with a small tool that hung from his watch chain , produced a flame from his pocket lighter , and after a bit of concentrated puffing managed to light the rather long , blunt-ended cigar .
now we can get on with our promenade , for all i care .
i ’ ve never smoked , joachim replied . why should i start up here , of all places ?
i don ’ t understand , hans castorp said .
i don ’ t understand how someone can not be a smoker—why it ’ s like robbing oneself of the best part of life , so to speak , or at least of an absolutely first-rate pleasure . when i wake up i look forward to being able to smoke all day , and when i eat , i look forward to it again , in fact i can honestly say that i actually only eat so that i can smoke , although that ’ s an exaggeration , of course .
but a day without tobacco—that would be absolutely insipid , a dull , totally wasted day . and if some morning i had to tell myself : there ’ s nothing left to smoke today , why i don ’ t think i ’ d find courage to get up , i swear i ’ d stay in bed .
you see , if a man has a cigar that burns well—and obviously it can ’ t have any breaks or draw badly , that ’ s really terribly annoying—what i ’ m saying is , that if a man has a good cigar , then he ’ s home safe , nothing , literally nothing , can happen to him .
it ’ s the same as when you ’ re lying on the beach , because there you lie on the beach , you know ? and you don ’ t need anything else—no work , no other amusements . thank god , people smoke all over the world , there ’ s nowhere you could possibly end up , as far as i know , where tobacco ’ s unknown .
even polar explorers lay in a good supply of smokes to get them over their hardships—that ’ s always struck a sympathetic chord in me whenever i ’ ve read about it .
all the same , it ’ s a sign of a rather weak will , joachim said , to be so dependent on tobacco . behrens is quite right—you ’ re a civilian .
he meant it more in praise , to be sure , but you are an incurable civilian , that ’ s the point .
and besides , you ’ re healthy and can do what you like , he said , and a weary look came into his eyes .
yes , healthy except for anemia , hans castorp said .
that was a bit much , though , when he told me that i look green .
but he ’ s right , it ’ s even obvious to me that in comparison to you folks up here i ’ m downright green—whereas i never really noticed it at home .
and that really was very nice of him to just go ahead and offer some advice , quite sine pecunia as he put it .
i ’ ll be happy to do as he says , and i hereby resolve to adapt my habits to yours—what else can i do as long as i ’ m up here with all of you ?
and it can ’ t hurt me , for heaven ’ s sake , to build up my protein , although that does sound disgusting , you must admit . joachim coughed a couple of times as they walked—the climb was taxing for him , it seemed .
when he started coughing a third time , he stopped and scowled .
go on ahead , he said .
hans castorp first hurried on without looking back .
then he slowed his pace and almost came to a stop , assuming that by now he had a considerable lead on joachim .
but he did not look back .
a party of guests of both sexes was coming toward him—he had noticed them moving along a level stretch of path about halfway up the slope , and now they were tramping downhill , moving directly toward him , and he could hear the babble of voices .
there were six or seven people of various ages , from very young things to a few who were somewhat further along in years . still thinking about joachim , he tilted his head and looked them over . they were all bareheaded and tanned , the ladies in colorful sweaters , the gentlemen without overcoats for the most part , even without walking sticks—they looked as if they had just stepped out the door for a breath of air , hands in their pockets .
since walking downhill is not a matter of strenuous exertion but more a sport , where you brace your legs and apply the brakes to keep from tripping or running—nothing more than helping yourself fall , really—there was a kind of nimble frivolity to their gait , which spread even to their faces , until the whole effect might very well have made you want to join their party . they were just ahead of him now , and hans castorp took a close look at their faces .
they were not all tanned , two of the ladies were conspicuously pale : the one thin as a rail , with an ivory complexion ; the other shorter and plump , her face blemished by moles and freckles . they all looked at him , all smiling the same cheeky smile .
a tall young girl in a green sweater , her hair in untidy disarray and with doltish , half-closed eyes , brushed past hans castorp , so close that she almost touched him with her arm .
she whistled at him , but not with her mouth ; her lips weren ’ t puckered at all , were tightly closed in fact .
an extraordinarily unpleasant whistle , harsh , intense , and yet somehow hollow , an extended tone , emerging inexplicably from somewhere in her chest and falling off toward the end—it reminded him of the music you get from those inflatable rubber pigs you buy at a carnival , the way they wail mournfully when you squeeze the air out .
and then she and the rest of her party had moved on . hans castorp stood there aghast , staring straight ahead .
then he quickly turned around and decided that the horrid sound must have been a joke , a prearranged prank—that much at least was clear now , because as they moved off he saw their shoulders jiggling with laughter , and one stocky lad with thick lips , his hands stuck in his pants pockets , hitching his jacket up in a rather unbecoming way , blatantly turned to look back—and laughed . joachim had caught up by now . he greeted the party in his usual chivalrous way , bowing and clicking his heels , almost standing at attention , and there was a gentle look in his eye as he joined his cousin .
the whistle came from inside , and all the while she stared at him , with her doltish , half-closed eyes .
she whistled from her stomach as she passed me by .
would you kindly explain that to me ?
oh , joachim said , laughing dismissively .
that was the kleefeld girl , hermine kleefeld , who can whistle with her pneumothorax .
he was terribly agitated , but he didn ’ t quite know in what sense .
wavering between laughter and tears , he added , you can ’ t expect me to understand your jargon .
let ’ s move on , joachim said .
i can just as easily explain it while we walk .
as you might guess , it has to do with surgery , an operation that they perform up here .
behrens is quite an expert at it .
when one lung has been badly ravaged , you see , but the other is healthy or relatively healthy , the infected one is relieved of its duties for a while , given a rest .
which means that they make an incision here , somewhere along the side here—i don ’ t know precisely where they cut , but behrens has it down perfectly .
and then they let gas in , nitrogen , you see , and that way the caseated lobes of the lung are put out of commission .
the gas doesn ’ t last that long , of course , and has to be replaced twice a month or so—they more or less pump you up , that ’ s how you have to picture it .
and after they ’ ve done that for a year or so , if all goes well , the lung will have rested long enough to heal .
not always , of course , it ’ s really rather risky business .
but they say they ’ ve had some nice successes with their pneumothorax .
all the people you just saw have had it done .
frau iltis was with them—the one with the freckles—and fräulein levi , the skinny one , if you recall—she was confined to bed for a long time .
they ’ ve formed a group—something like pneumothorax brings people together , naturally—and call themselves the half-lung club , that ’ s the name everyone knows them by . but the pride of the club is hermine kleefeld , because she can whistle with her pneumothorax—it ’ s her special talent , it ’ s certainly not something everyone can do .
not that i can tell you how she manages it , she can ’ t explain it clearly herself . but if she ’ s been walking rapidly , then she can whistle from inside , and of course she uses it then to startle people , especially newly arrived patients . i presume , by the way , that she ’ s wasting nitrogen by doing it , because she has to get a refill every week .
and hans castorp was laughing now ; during joachim ’ s explanation , his agitation had resolved into mirth , and as he walked along , bent forward and shading his eyes with his hand , his shoulders were convulsed by his soft , rapid giggles . has the club been registered ?
he asked , though he found it hard to speak , and it sounded more like a whine or whimper from suppressed laughter . do they have bylaws ?
you should ask behrens to put you temporarily out of commission . maybe you ’ d be able to whistle , too , if you really set your mind to it , after all it must be something you can learn . that ’ s the funniest thing i ’ ve ever heard in my life , he said , taking a deep breath .
tweeet ’ she whistles at me—what a harum-scarum !
you ’ ll have to forgive me , really , for talking like this , but they were in a merry mood themselves , your pneumatic friends . here they come walking up . and to think that it was the half-lung club !
and i ’ m sure you can tell me just why they ’ re so devil-may-care , can ’ t you ?
joachim searched for an answer .
i mean , they ’ re young and time plays no role in their lives , and they may very well die . why should they go around with long faces ? i sometimes think that illness and death aren ’ t really serious matters , that it ’ s all more like loafing around , and that , strictly speaking , things are serious only down below in real life .
i think maybe you ’ ll come to understand that in due time , after you ’ ve been up here with us a little longer .
certainly , hans castorp said , i ’ m certain i shall .
i ’ m already taking a great deal of interest in all of you up here , and once one is interested , why then understanding follows as a matter of course , doesn ’ t it ? but what ’ s wrong with me—this doesn ’ t taste good , he said , looking at his cigar . i ’ ve been asking myself the whole time what was the matter , and now i realize that my maria is the problem .
i swear to you , it tastes like papier-mâché , exactly as if i had a terribly upset stomach .
it ’ s really quite incredible ! i did eat an unusually large breakfast , but that can ’ t be the reason , because when you eat a lot , it always tastes especially good at first . do you think it can be because i slept so restlessly ?
no , i ’ m simply going to have to toss it away , he said after trying once more .
every puff is a disappointment ; there ’ s no point in forcing it . he hesitated for a moment and then flicked the cigar down the slope among the wet pines . do you know what i ’ m convinced is to blame ?
i am thoroughly convinced that it has something to do with this damned flushed face of mine—it ’ s been bothering me again ever since i got up .
damned if it doesn ’ t feel as if i ’ m constantly blushing in embarrassment .
was it the same with you , too , when you first arrived ? yes , joachim said , i felt rather strange , too , at first .
don ’ t worry about it . i told you , if you remember , that it ’ s not all that easy to get used to our life up here .
but you ’ ll soon be back on track .
look there , that bench has a nice view . let ’ s sit down for a bit and then head home—i need to take my rest cure .
they were now about a third of the way up the hill , but the path had leveled out , heading now in the direction of davos-platz .
the rudely fashioned bench on which they sat had its back to the steep slope . water fell in an open wooden trough beside them , gurgling and splashing on its way to the valley .
pointing with the tip of his alpenstock , joachim set about teaching his cousin the names of the cloud-topped peaks that appeared to close off the valley to the south . but hans castorp was bent forward , glancing up only fleetingly while drawing figures in the sand with the silver-trimmed knob of his citified cane .
what i wanted to ask you— he began . the case in my room expired just before i arrived , you said . have there been a lot of other deaths since you ’ ve been up here ?
several , certainly , joachim replied .
but they deal with them discreetly , you see , so you don ’ t hear about them , or only occasionally , later on . when someone dies it ’ s kept a strict secret , out of consideration for the other patients , in particular the ladies , who might easily go to pieces .
if someone dies right next door , you don ’ t even notice it . the coffin is brought in early in the morning while you ’ re still sleeping , and then the party in question is removed only at another more suitable time—during meals , for instance . hmm , hans castorp said and went on drawing .
yes , you can put it that way . but recently—it must have been , wait a moment—probably eight weeks ago— then you can ’ t call it recently , an alert hans castorp remarked dryly .
well then , not so recently . you ’ re so precise . i was just guessing at the date .
but anyway , some time ago , i had a peek backstage myself , purely by accident , but it ’ s as real as if it had happened today . it was the little hujus girl , barbara hujus—she was catholic—when they brought her the viaticum , the sacrament for the dying , you know , extreme unction . she was still up and about when i arrived here , and could be so playfully funny , so downright silly , a real teenager .
he came one afternoon , when everyone was at tea , with nobody in the halls . but you have to picture it—i had overslept , had fallen asleep during my rest cure and hadn ’ t heard the gong and was a quarter hour late . and so at the decisive moment i happened not to be where everyone else was , but had wandered backstage , as you put it , and as i ’ m walking down the corridor , i see them coming toward me , in lace shirts , a cross leading the way , a gold cross with little lanterns , one of them carrying it up front like the glockenspiel in a turkish-style military band .
that ’ s a poor comparison , hans castorp said rather sternly .
it automatically reminded me of it . they ’ re coming toward me , left right left , double-time , three of them if i ’ m not mistaken , the man with the cross first , then the priest , spectacles perched on his nose , and then a boy with a censer . the priest was carrying the sacrament against his chest , it had a cover over it , and holding his head very devoutly to one side—it ’ s their holy of holies , after all .
that ’ s precisely it , hans castorp said . that ’ s the reason why i was astounded when you said what you did about the glockenspiel . but just wait , if you had been there , you wouldn ’ t know what kind of face to put on , either , thinking back on it .
it was like something you might see in a dream—
let me tell you . so there i am , asking myself how i ought to act under the circumstances .
i didn ’ t have a hat to take off—
hans castorp quickly interrupted yet again .
you see , a man should always wear a hat .
i ’ ve noticed , of course , that you people up here never wear one . but you should , so that you can tip it whenever the occasion demands .
but now what happened ?
i stood back against the wall , joachim said , taking up a respectful pose , and made a little bow as they came even with me—it was right in front of the little hujus girl ’ s room , number twenty-eight .
the priest was glad to see my response , i think , and returned my greeting very politely , doffing his cap .
but by this time they have all come to a halt , and the altar boy with the censer knocks on the door , then lifts the latch , and lets his supervisor step ahead into the room .
the moment the priest sets a foot over the threshold , a hue and cry starts up inside , first a shriek like nothing you ’ ve ever heard , three or four times in a row , and then just screaming without a pause or break , like a mouth gaping wide open , i suppose , ahhh— ’ and with such misery and terror and defiance in it that i can ’ t describe it , and such ghastly pleading mixed in , too , and then all of a sudden it turns hollow and muffled , as if it has sunk down into the earth or is coming from a deep cellar .
hans castorp had turned abruptly to face his cousin .
and was that the hujus girl ?
but why from a deep cellar ’ ?
she had crawled under her blanket , joachim said .
just imagine how i felt .
the priest was standing just on the far side of the threshold , speaking soothing words—i can still see him—the way he constantly thrust his head forward and then jerked it back .
the cross-bearer and the altar boy were stuck there at the door and couldn ’ t get in .
but i could see between them into the room .
it ’ s a room just like yours or mine , with the bed to the left of the door along one side , and there were people standing at its head , her family of course , her parents , directing comforting words down at the bed , where you could only see a formless mass , begging and protesting hideously and kicking its legs .
are you saying she was kicking with her legs ?
but it didn ’ t help , she had to be given the sacrament of the dying . the pastor walked over to her and the other two stepped inside as well , and then the door was closed .
but just before that , i saw the hujus girl ’ s head emerge for a mere second , her light blond hair , and her pale eyes , no color to them at all , gaping wide , staring at the priest—and then she ducked under the sheets again with a loud wail . and you ’ re telling me only now ?
hans castorp said after a pause .
i can ’ t understand how you didn ’ t bring it up yesterday evening .
but , my god , she must have had a lot of strength left to fight back like that .
you shouldn ’ t send for a priest until they ’ re very weak .
but she was weak , joachim replied .
she was already weak—it was fear that gave her so much strength . she was terribly frightened , because she realized she was going to die . she was just a young girl , so it is excusable , after all .
but even grown men carry on like that sometimes , which is , of course , inexcusably weak-willed of them .
behrens knows how to deal with them , he can strike just the right tone for such cases .
what sort of tone ?
hans castorp asked with a scowl .
don ’ t make such a fuss ! he says , joachim replied .
at least that ’ s what he said to one fellow recently—we heard about it from the head nurse who was present to help restrain the dying man .
he was one of those types who makes a dreadful scene right at the end and absolutely refuses to die .
and so behrens simply dressed him down : would you please not make such a fuss , he said , and the patient quieted down at once and died quite peaceably .
hans castorp slapped his thigh with one hand , threw himself back against the bench , and stared at the sky .
listen here , that ’ s weighty stuff , he cried .
snaps his head off and says , don ’ t make such a fuss !
to a dying man .
a dying man deserves a certain amount of respect .
there ’ s something holy about a dying man , as it were—in my opinion .
i won ’ t deny that , joachim said .
no , hans castorp insisted with a ferocity not at all appropriate to the mild objection joachim had offered . i ’ ll not let you talk me out of it . a dying man has something nobler about him than your average rascal strolling about , laughing and making money and stuffing his belly .
but now his words were swallowed in a fit of laughter that suddenly overwhelmed him , the same laughter as yesterday , welling up from deep inside—convulsive , unbounded laughter , until he had to close his eyes for the tears .
he whispered and gave his cousin , still laughing uncontrollably , a silent poke in the ribs .
hans castorp looked up through his tears .
a stranger was coming up the path on their left , a delicate man with brown hair and a black moustache twirled at the ends ; he was wearing pastel checked trousers and exchanged a good-morning with joachim as he came up to them—his greeting was precise and melodious .
it would have been difficult to guess his age , but it surely had to be somewhere between thirty and forty , because , although the general impression was youthful , he was already silvering at the temples and his hair was thinning noticeably , receding toward the part in two wide arcs , making the brow even higher .
his outfit—loose trousers in a pastel yellow check and a wide-lapelled , double-breasted coat that was made of something like petersham and hung much too long—was far from laying any claim to elegance . the edges of his rounded high collar were rough from frequent laundering , his black tie was threadbare , and he apparently didn ’ t even bother with cuffs—hans castorp could tell from the limp way the coat sleeves draped around his wrists .
all the same , he could definitely see that he had a gentleman before him—the refined expression on the stranger ’ s face , his easy , even handsome pose left no doubt of that .
this mixture of shabbiness and charm , plus the black eyes and a handlebar moustache , immediately reminded hans castorp of certain foreign musicians who would appear in his hometown at christmastime and strike up a tune , then gaze up with velvet eyes and hold out their slouch hats to catch the coins you threw them from the window .
and so he was not surprised by the name he now heard as joachim got up from the bench somewhat flustered and introduced him , castorp , my cousin—herr settembrini . hans castorp had also stood up by way of greeting , traces of excess merriment still on his face .
but the italian politely remarked that he did not wish to disturb them and urged them to take their seats , whereas he remained standing in his becoming pose . he stood there , smiling and observing the cousins , particularly hans castorp , and the delicate line at one corner of his mouth , the mocking curl of the lip just below where his full moustache swept handsomely upward , had a peculiar effect—somehow it exhorted one to be alert and clearheaded , and in a flash so sobered the inebriated hans castorp that he felt ashamed of himself .
and with an easy , felicitous wave of his arm he lifted his little , yellowish hand toward the heavens and simultaneously cast an oblique glance in the same upward direction . one could in fact forget completely just where one is .
he spoke without any accent—at most one might have recognized him as a foreigner from the precision in the way he shaped his sounds .
his lips took a certain delight in forming the words .
it was a pleasure to listen to him .
and your journey , sir , to join us here was pleasant , i hope ?
he asked , turning to hans castorp .
i mean—has the gloomy ceremony of the first examination taken place yet ?
had he cared for an answer , he would have fallen silent and waited—for he had asked a question and hans castorp was about to reply .
but the stranger went right on with his inquiries : and did it go well ?
given your hilarity—he fell silent for a moment and the furrowed curl at the corner of his mouth deepened—one could draw contradictory conclusions .
how many months have our minos and rhadamanthus saddled you with ?
the phrase saddled you with sounded particularly droll coming from him .
hans castorp laughed in surprise—meanwhile trying to recall who minos and rhadamanthus were , exactly .
he answered , how do you mean ? no , you ’ re mistaken , herr septem— settembrini , the italian corrected him with particular verve , accompanied by a facetious bow .
herr settembrini—beg your pardon .
no , you are mistaken .
i am not sick at all . i ’ m merely visiting my cousin ziemssen for a few weeks and using the occasion for a little relaxation myself . you are not one of us ?
you don ’ t say ?
and so let us depart .
the prince ’ s scandalous behavior was still the talk of the valley , but rhadamanthus had simply winked an eye , both eyes—every inch a hofrat .
and so he continued , while good-natured hans castorp laughed heartily at this torrent of glib slander .
each one emerged taut , neat , and brand-new from his mobile lips ; he savored every educated , biting , nimble turn of phrase that he used , taking obvious , effusive , and exhilarating enjoyment even in grammatical inflections and conjugations , and seemed to have far too much clear presence of mind ever to misspeak himself .
ah , behold her flashing eye in the slippery light , he quoted—god only knew from what—and turned to blow a kiss at the embarrassed girl ’ s back .
i don ’ t really know how to put it .
you have such a droll way of speaking , herr settembrini , hans castorp said .
we are taking the same path— ’ to the right , which leads to the walls of mightiest dis . ah , virgil , virgil , gentlemen , he is unsurpassed . i believe in progress , certainly .
and all of a sudden he began to speak about petrarch , whom he called the father of modernity .
ah , krokowski , settembrini exclaimed .
the italian responded , fanning himself with his handkerchief , although the air was actually rather cool .
the literary man , who had underscored all his words with charming gestures , rounded his thoughts off now with a flourish in joachim ’ s direction and said , our lieutenant is pressing us into service .
tut , tut , tut , he clicked his tongue .
he glided on rubber soles , so salzmann said , to keep the dying from hearing his approach .
there was something curiously agreeable in the flow of the italian ’ s words , spoken as they were in pure and precise german , free of every trace of dialect .
the man has but one thought in his head , and it is a filthy one . my good engineer , how is it that we have not yet spoken of the man ?
that is extraordinary—von mylendonk and adriatica , to boot .
have you made his acquaintance ?
have you made his acquaintance ?
hans castorp said he had .
i am beginning to surmise that you liked him as well .
i really don ’ t know , herr settembrini .
i look at people and think : so that ’ s how you are ?
you remarked that i speak maliciously , but if i have done so , then it was not without a pedagogic purpose .
we humanists all have a pedagogic streak .
gentlemen , the historical connection between humanism and pedagogy only proves the psychological basis of that connection . one should not deny the humanist his position as an educator—indeed it can not be denied to him , for he alone preserves the tradition of man ’ s dignity and beauty .
there came a time when he took over from the priest , who in murky and misanthropic eras of the past was permitted to arrogate the education of youth to himself .
schools based on humanistic education—you may call me backward if you like , sir , but on principle and in abstracto , do understand me correctly , i beg you—i remain their firm supporter .
he was still arguing his case in the elevator and fell silent only when the cousins got off at last on the third floor .
he rode it on up to the fourth , where , as joachim explained , he had a small room with a view to the rear .
he hasn ’ t much money , i suppose ? hans castorp asked as they entered joachim ’ s room . it looked exactly like his own next door .
no , joachim said , probably not . or just enough so that he can pay for his stay here . his father was a literary type himself , you know , and i believe the grandfather was , too .
well , you see , hans castorp said .
is he seriously ill , then ?
it ’ s not dangerous , as far as i know , but a stubborn case and it keeps recurring .
he ’ s had it for years and has left off and on , but always returns .
especially since he seems to be such an enthusiast for work .
he ’ s certainly a fantastic talker , just slips easily from one topic to the other .
he was really a little fresh with that girl , i was mortified there for a moment . but then what he said about human dignity , afterward , sounded so spiffing , like formal oratory .
do you often spend time with him ?
a red leather case lined in velvet lay open on the table ; from it he had extracted a little thermometer and stuck the end filled with mercury into his mouth . he held it tightly under his tongue so that the glass tube jutted up at an angle from one corner . then he made himself comfortable , pulling on his house shoes and a tuniclike jacket , picked up a chart and a pencil from the table , plus a book of russian grammar—he was learning russian because , as he said , he hoped it would be of use in his career—and thus equipped , he stretched out on the balcony lounge chair , tossing the camel-hair blanket lightly over his feet .
he hardly needed it , because in the last quarter hour the layer of clouds had grown thinner and thinner , and the summer sun was breaking through—so warm and dazzling now that joachim had to screen his face with a white canvas sunshade ingeniously fixed to one arm of the chair and adjustable to the angle of the glare .
hans castorp praised the contraption .
he wanted to wait until joachim had finished measuring , and so in the meantime he watched how things were done , examined the fur-lined sleeping bag stored in one corner of the balcony—joachim used it on cold days—and propping his elbows on the railing , gazed down into the garden , where the common lounging area had now filled up with recumbent patients—reading , writing , chatting . only a small portion of the inside of the arcade , about five lounge chairs , was visible .
and how long does that take ?
hans castorp turned around to ask .
joachim raised seven fingers .
seven minutes must be up by now .
joachim shook his head .
after a while he took the thermometer out of his mouth , looked at it , and said , yes , when you pay close attention to it—time , i mean—it goes very slowly .
i truly like measuring my temperature four times a day , because it makes you notice what one minute , or even seven , actually means—especially since the seven days of a week hang so dreadfully heavy on your hands here . but actually ’ doesn ’ t apply , hans castorp responded . he was sitting with one thigh hiked up on the railing ; the whites of his eyes were bloodshot .
if it seems long to you , then it is long , and if it seems to pass quickly , then it ’ s short .
but how long or how short it is in actuality , no one knows .
he was not at all used to philosophizing , and yet felt some urge to do so .
we do measure it .
we have clocks and calendars , and when a month has passed , then it ’ s passed—for you and me and everyone . but wait , hans castorp said , holding up a forefinger next to one bloodshot eye .
you said that a minute is as long as it seems to you while you ’ re measuring your temperature , correct ?
a minute is as long as . it lasts , as long as it takes a second hand to complete a circle .
but how long that takes can vary greatly—according to how we feel it !
and in point of fact . i repeat , in point of fact , hans castorp said , pressing his forefinger so firmly against his nose that its tip was folded to one side , that ’ s a matter of motion , of motion in space , correct ?
and so we measure time with space . but that is the same thing as trying to measure space with time—the way uneducated people do .
it ’ s twenty hours from hamburg to davos—true , by train . but on foot , how far is it then ?
and in our minds—not even a second ! listen here , joachim said , what ’ s wrong with you ?
i think being up here with us is getting to you . my mind is very clear today .
so then , what is time ?
hans castorp asked , bending the tip of his nose so forcefully to one side that it turned white and bloodless .
will you please tell me that ?
we perceive space with our senses , with vision and touch .
but what is the organ for our sense of time ? would you please tell me that ? you see , you ’ re stuck .
but how are we ever going to measure something about which , precisely speaking , we know nothing at all— can not list a single one of its properties . we say time passes .
but in order to measure it . in order for it to be measurable , it would have to flow evenly , but where is it written that it does that ?
it doesn ’ t do that for our conscious minds , we simply assume it does , just for the sake of convenience . and so all our measurements are merely conventions , if you please .
fine , joachim said , then it ’ s probably also just a convention that my thermometer has risen four and a half lines above normal .
are you at ninety-nine point five ? it ’ s already going back down . and joachim entered it on his chart .
but that ’ s a good thing , really .
and i ’ ll go now , hans castorp said .
my head is full of all kinds of ideas about time—a whole complex of thoughts , let me tell you .
i ’ ll keep it all in mind , and we can talk about it later then , after second breakfast perhaps .
you will call me when it ’ s time to eat ?
i ’ ll go take my rest cure now , too—it can ’ t hurt , thank goodness .
and with that he slipped past the glass divider across to his own balcony , where someone had placed an unfolded lounge chair and a table .
he fetched his ocean steamships and his traveling blanket , a lovely plaid of dark reds and greens , and noticed that his room had been nicely tidied up .
but he soon had to put up his sunshade , the blazing glare was unbearable the moment you lay down .
the frame , a little old-fashioned in design—but that was only a stylish touch , really , since the chair was obviously new—was made of polished reddish-brown wood , and the mattress , covered with a soft cottonlike fabric , actually consisted of three thick cushions that reached from the foot of the chair up over the back .
and then , attached to a string and slipped into an embroidered linen case was a roll for your neck , neither too firm nor too soft , and it simply worked wonders .
hans castorp propped one elbow on the broad , smooth surface of the chair arm , and lay there blinking , not even bothering to entertain himself with ocean steamships .
seen through the arches of the balcony , the hard , barren landscape lay under the bright sun like a framed painting .
hans castorp regarded it pensively .
suddenly it came to him—and he said aloud into the silence , that was a dwarf who served us at breakfast .
just that we hadn ’ t spoken about it .
it was already ten o ’ clock when he lay down .
it was an ordinary hour , neither long nor short .
and when it was over , a gong rang out in the building and across the garden—first distant , then nearer , then distant again .
breakfast , joachim said , and you could hear him getting up .
hans castorp ended his rest cure for now , too , and went back into the room to get ready .
the cousins met in the corridor and went downstairs .
hans castorp said , well , that felt marvelous just lying there .
what sort of chairs are those ?
if they ’ re for sale up here , i ’ ll take one with me back to hamburg , they ’ re simply heavenly .
or do you think that behrens has them made up according to his own specifications ?
joachim did not know .
they hung up their coats and for the second time today they entered the dining hall , where the meal was in full swing . the room glistened with white from all the milk—a large glass at every place , a good pint of it at least . no , hans castorp said , taking his seat again at the end of the table between the seamstress and the englishwoman and conscientiously unfolding his napkin—although he was still weighed down by his first breakfast .
is there some porter , perhaps ?
and he turned to ask this question politely and gently of the dwarf . there was no porter , unfortunately . but she promised him some kulmbach beer , and indeed she brought it .
it was thick and black , with a foamy brown head , and was an excellent substitute for porter . hans castorp drank thirstily from the tall pint glass . he ate cold cuts on toast .
there was more oatmeal on the table and lots of butter and fruit again .
he at least let his eyes pass over it all , since he was incapable of helping himself to any of it . and he observed the other guests , too—the crowd was beginning to sort itself out for him and individuals were emerging . his own table was full , except for the seat at the head opposite him , which , as he was told , was reserved for the doctors .
because whenever their schedules allowed , the physicians took part in communal meals , but at a different table every time—and a place was kept free for them at the head of each one . neither of them was present at the moment ; word was that they were operating . the young man with the moustache entered again , his chin pressed to his chest , and sat down with a worried , self-absorbed look on his face .
the very blond , gaunt young woman took her seat and spooned down her yogurt again , as if this were the only thing she ever ate .
next to her this time was a chipper little old lady , who spoke to the silent young man in a steady flow of russian , to which his only reply was a worried expression and a nod of the head—and that same look on his face as if he had something foul-tasting in his mouth .
across from him , on the other side of the old lady , yet another young girl was seated—she was pretty , with a rosy complexion , prominent breasts , chestnut hair nicely coiffed and waved , round , brown , childlike eyes , and a little ruby on her pretty hand .
she laughed a great deal and likewise spoke russian , only russian .
her name was marusya , hans castorp heard someone say .
he also happened to notice that joachim would lower his eyes with a stern look whenever she laughed or spoke . settembrini came in by way of the side entrance , and twirling his moustache all the while , he strode to his seat , which was catercorner from hans castorp ’ s .
his tablemates broke into peals of laughter as he sat down—presumably he had made one of his malicious remarks .
and hans castorp also recognized the members of the half-lung club .
doltish-eyed hermine kleefeld shoved her way to her table , over near one of the doors opening onto the veranda , and greeted the thick-lipped lad who had hitched his jacket up so unbecomingly .
at the table set crosswise on his right sat fräulein levi with the ivory complexion and , next to her , plump , freckled frau iltis and a group of others whom hans castorp did not know .
those are your neighbors , joachim said softly to his cousin and bent his head forward .
passing very close to hans castorp was a couple making for the last table on the right—the bad russian table , that was—where a family with an ugly boy was already seated , all of them wolfing down great mounds of oatmeal .
the man was slightly built and had gray , hollow cheeks .
he wore a brown leather jacket , and on his feet were boxy felt boots with clasp buckles .
his wife , likewise small and slim , wore a hat with a bouncing feather and minced ahead on tiny , high-heeled boots of red russia leather ; around her neck was draped a shabby feather boa .
hans castorp stared at the two of them with a tactlessness that was quite foreign to him and that even he found brutal—although what was really brutal about it was the sudden pleasure he took in it .
and when at that same moment the glass door on his left slammed shut with a bang and a rattle , just as it had at first breakfast , he did not flinch as he had earlier that morning , but merely grimaced languidly . and just as he was about to turn his head to look in that direction , he suddenly found that it was simply too much trouble and not worth the effort . and so he did not determine this time , either , who it was that was so sloppy about the door .
the fact was that his breakfast beer , which normally had only a slightly befuddling effect on the young man , had completely stupefied and lamed him—it was as if he had been struck a blow across his brow .
his eyelids were leaden ; his tongue simply would not obey the simplest thoughts when he tried out of courtesy to chat with the englishwoman ; even shifting the direction of his eyes demanded a great struggle with himself . added to all of which , the ghastly flush he had experienced yesterday had returned to his face in full force—his cheeks felt puffy from the heat , he was breathing heavily , his heart was pounding like a hammer wrapped in cloth .
but despite it all , he was not suffering particularly—primarily because his head felt as if he had just taken two or three deep breaths of chloroform . dr. krokowski had appeared for breakfast and taken the seat opposite him at the head of the table ; but , as if in a dream , he barely noticed the fact , although the doctor looked him in the eye , repeatedly and sharply , while carrying on a conversation in russian with the ladies on his right , during which the younger ones—that is , marusya with her rosy complexion and the gaunt yogurt-eater—kept their eyes cast down in meek embarrassment .
it goes without saying that hans castorp kept his dignity , preferring to say not a word once his tongue had proved refractory and handling his knife and fork with special decorum .
when his cousin nodded to him and stood up , he did the same ; after bowing blindly to his tablemates , he followed joachim , taking deliberate , careful steps as he went . when is the next rest cure ?
he asked as they left the building .
that ’ s the best thing here , as far as i can see .
i wish i were lying in my splendid lounge chair again right now .
are we going to walk far ?
around this time i always take just a short walk down through davos-dorf and on into platz , if i have time .
you can window-shop and watch people and buy whatever you need .
not to worry , we ’ ll lie down for an hour before dinner , and then again till four .
they walked down the drive in the sunshine and crossed the brook and the narrow-gauge tracks ; the line of mountains above the valley ’ s western slope rose directly ahead of them , and joachim supplied their names : little schiahorn , the green towers , and dorfberg . across the way , a little distance up the hill , was the walled cemetery of davos-dorf—and joachim pointed it out as well with his walking stick .
and now they were on the main road , which was set one terrace-level above the valley floor .
one could not really call dorf a village ; at least , nothing except the name itself was left now .
it had been devoured by the resort spreading relentlessly toward the entrance to the valley , and that part of the settlement called davos-dorf merged imperceptibly , without transition , into what was called davos-platz .
hotels and boardinghouses , all of them amply equipped with covered verandas , balconies , and rest-cure arcades , lay on both sides , as well as private homes with rooms for rent .
here and there new buildings were under construction , but sometimes the line of houses was broken by an open space that allowed a view of the valley ’ s green meadows .
in his desire for his customary and cherished stimulant , hans castorp had lit another cigar ; and , thanks apparently to the beer he had drunk and much to his indescribable satisfaction , now and then he was able to whiff something of the aroma he craved—but only rarely and faintly , to be sure . it was a strain on his nerves just to try to detect a hint of his usual enjoyment—and that repulsive leathery taste predominated .
unwilling to accommodate himself to such failure , he struggled for a while to find a pleasure that either was totally denied him or simply teased him with a distant inkling of itself , and finally out of weary disgust he tossed the cigar aside . despite his dazed state , he felt courtesy demanded that he carry on a conversation , and for that purpose he tried to recall the excellent things he had wanted to say about time earlier . except it turned out that he had forgotten every bit of the whole complex—not one single thought about time still resided in any corner of his brain .
and so instead he began to speak about bodily functions , although in a rather strange fashion .
when do you take your temperature again ?
yes , that ’ s a good idea .
the organism is at the height of its activity , so it would register then .
why , settembrini laughed his head off at the notion . there would be absolutely no point in it . i don ’ t even own a thermometer .
well , joachim said , that ’ s no problem whatever . you need only to buy one . there are thermometers for sale here everywhere , in almost any shop .
but keeping track of my temperature would be too much for a visitor , i ’ ll leave that to the rest of you up here .
if i only knew , hans castorp continued , pressing his hands to his breast like a man in love , why my heart keeps pounding the whole time—it ’ s so disconcerting . i ’ ve been thinking about it for quite a while now .
because , you see , your heart pounds when you ’ re looking forward to some joyous event or if you ’ re afraid—when your emotions are stirred up , isn ’ t that right ?
but if your heart starts pounding all by itself , for no earthly reason , of its own accord , so to speak , i find that downright bizarre , if you see what i mean ? it ’ s as if the body were going off on its own and no longer had any connection to your soul , more or less like a dead body that is not really dead—even though there is no such thing—and goes on living a very active life , but all of its own accord .
what sort of an expression is that , joachim reprimanded him discreetly .
and perhaps he was revenging himself a little for the rebuke he had received earlier today for his glockenspiel . but it ’ s true !
why are you so offended by that ?
and anyway , i only mentioned it incidentally . all i was trying to say is that it ’ s bizarre and upsetting when the body goes off on its own accord , living with no connection to one ’ s soul and putting on airs—like a heart pounding for no purpose whatever . one literally searches for some reason for it , some emotional stimulus , a feeling of joy or fear , that could justify it , so to speak—at least that ’ s how it is with me , i can only speak for myself .
yes , yes , joachim said with a sigh , it ’ s probably much like having a high fever .
but we ’ re talking about such unpleasant things , he said in a quivering voice and then broke off . to which hans castorp merely gave a shrug—in perfect imitation of the shrug he had first seen joachim give the evening before .
they walked along in silence for a while . then joachim asked , well , how do you like the people here ?
i mean the ones at our table ?
oh , lord , he said , they don ’ t seem very interesting to me . there are more interesting people sitting at some of the other tables , i think , but maybe i ’ m just imagining that .
frau stöhr should get her hair washed , it ’ s so greasy . and little mazurka , or whatever her name is , seems pretty silly to me .
she keeps stuffing her handkerchief in her mouth because she ’ s constantly giggling .
joachim laughed out loud at the bungled name . mazurka ’ —that ’ s splendid !
her name ’ s marusya , if you please—it ’ s about the same as our marie .
yes , she really is too enthusiastic , he said . when she has every reason to be more sedate , because she ’ s more than a little ill .
she ’ s in such good shape .
you ’ d never take her for someone with a weak chest .
and he tried to catch his cousin ’ s eye , but discovered that joachim ’ s tanned face looked all blotchy , the way tanned faces do when the blood rushes out of them , and that he had wrenched his mouth into a peculiar , woeful expression that gave hans castorp a vague fright and caused him immediately to change the subject .
he asked about certain other people and tried to forget both marusya and joachim ’ s expression—and was totally successful at it .
the englishwoman with the rose-hip tea was named miss robinson .
the seamstress was not a seamstress , but a teacher at a public school for well-bred young ladies in königsberg , and that was why she chose her words so precisely .
her name was fräulein engelhart .
as for the chipper old lady , joachim had never learned her name in all the time he had been there .
in any case , she was the great-aunt of the yogurt-eating girl , and both were permanent residents of the sanatorium .
the sickest person at the table was dr. blumenkohl , leo blumenkohl from odessa—the young man with the moustache and the worried , self-absorbed look . he had been up here for years now .
they were now walking on a city sidewalk—it was immediately apparent that this was the main street of an international resort .
the strolling tourists they met were mostly young people , the gentlemen in sport coats and without hats , the ladies in white skirts and also without hats .
you heard russian and english spoken ; to both left and right were rows of shops with elegant displays in the windows . hans castorp ’ s curiosity was now seriously battling his flushed exhaustion , and forcing his eyes to take it all in , he lingered awhile outside a men ’ s clothing shore , just to make sure that his own wardrobe was up to snuff .
then came a rotunda with a covered gallery where a little band was playing .
this was the kurhaus , the spa hotel .
several games were in progress on the tennis courts . long-legged , clean-shaven young men wearing freshly pressed flannels and rubber-soled shoes had rolled up their shirtsleeves to play opposite tanned young ladies in white , who kept reaching boldly up toward the sun in order to hit the chalk-white ball out of the air .
a kind of floury dust drifted over the well-kept courts .
the cousins sat down on an unoccupied bench to watch and critique the play .
you ’ ve not been playing up here , i take it ?
i ’ m not allowed to , joachim answered . we have to rest , always lying at rest .
settembrini says we live horizontally—we ’ re the horizontals , he says , it ’ s another one of his rotten jokes .
those are healthy people playing there , or they ’ re disobeying their doctors ’ orders .
anyway , they ’ re not playing serious tennis—it ’ s more for the outfits .
and as far as not obeying orders goes , lots of forbidden games are played here—poker , you know , and petits chevaux in certain hotels .
but there are plenty of people who sneak past the guards in the evening and come down here to gamble .
they say the prince who gave behrens his title of hofrat did it constantly .
hans castorp was hardly listening .
his mouth was hanging open , because he couldn ’ t breathe through his nose right , although he didn ’ t have a cold . he dimly noticed the disconcerting effect of his heart ’ s pounding out of time to the music . and feeling confused and at odds with himself , he was just dozing off when joachim suggested they needed to start back .
they covered the distance in almost total silence . hans castorp stumbled a few times on the level pavement , at which he merely shook his head and smiled wistfully .
the elevator operator who took them up to their floor was the man with the limp . exchanging a brief till later , they parted outside room number . hans castorp steered his way across the room and out to the balcony , where he let himself fall into his lounge chair , just as he was , and without changing his position once , he fell into a dull semistupor , broken now and then by the annoyance of his rapidly beating heart .
how long that lasted he didn ’ t know . at the appropriate time , the gong rang out .
but , as hans castorp was aware , it was not the call for dinner itself , merely the warning to get ready for it ; and so he lay there for a while until the metallic rumble swelled and fell away a second time . when joachim came through the room to fetch him , hans castorp wanted to change first , but joachim said it was too late and wouldn ’ t let him .
he was right , of course , and hans castorp could only point out that he wasn ’ t the one who was sick , although he certainly was incredibly sleepy .
he just washed his hands quickly ; and they walked down to the dining hall , for the third time . the guests were streaming in through both entrances . some were even coming through the veranda doors that stood open opposite , and soon they were all sitting around the seven tables as if they had never left them .
that at least was hans castorp ’ s impression , a purely dreamy , irrational impression of course , which he could not get out of his befuddled brain for the moment and which even gave him a certain pleasure—such pleasure , in fact , that he tried to recapture it several times during the course of the meal and , indeed , was able to recreate the illusion perfectly .
the chipper old lady was once again keeping up a steady stream of blurry russian directed diagonally toward dr. blumenkohl , who listened with a careworn face . her skinny grandniece finally ate something other than yogurt : the gooey cream of barley soup that the dining attendants had served in large plates—but only a few spoonfuls , and then she let it stand .
pretty marusya kept pressing her little handkerchief , fragrant with orange perfume , to her mouth to stifle her giggles .
miss robinson was reading the same letter in the same rounded hand that she had been reading that morning .
apparently she could speak not a word of german and did not wish to .
joachim struck a chivalrous pose and said something to her in english about the weather , to which , while still chewing , she gave a monosyllabic reply and then fell silent again .
as for frau stöhr in her scotch-plaid woolen blouse , she had had her checkup that morning and reported about it in her affected , uneducated way , drawing her upper lip back from her rabbitlike teeth .
she complained of a rattle on the upper right , and her breathing was reduced just under her left shoulder blade , and the boss had told her she would have to stay another five months .
moreover , she declared her outrage that the boss was not sitting at their table again today . the retardation schedule ( she apparently meant rotation ) demanded that the boss should be sitting at their table for dinner today , whereas the boss was once again sitting at the table on their left ( and indeed there sat director behrens , his gigantic hands folded in front of his plate ) .
though to be sure , that was also where fat frau salomon from amsterdam was seated , and she came to dinner every day of the week in a low-cut dress , apparently quite to the boss ’ s liking , although she , frau stöhr , could not understand it , because , after all , he could see however much of frau salomon he wanted at every checkup .
a little later she told them in an excited whisper that yesterday evening the lights had been turned out in the upper common lounging area—the one on the roof—for purposes that frau stöhr described as transparent .
the boss had noticed it and gone into such a rage that you could hear him all over the building .
but of course once again he had not located the guilty party , although one didn ’ t have to have a university degree to guess that , of course , it had been captain miklosich from bucharest , for whom it could never be dark enough when he was in the company of ladies—a man lacking in every refinement , although he did wear a corset , and who was no better than a beast of prey—yes , a beast of prey , frau stöhr repeated in a smothered whisper as beads of sweat appeared on her brow and upper lip .
why , all of dorf and platz , too , knew the nature of his relationship with frau wurmbrandt from vienna , the general consul ’ s wife—one could hardly call it clandestine anymore .
it wasn ’ t enough that the captain frequently paid morning visits to frau wurmbrandt in her room , with her still lying in bed , and stayed there the whole time she dressed , but last tuesday he had not left wurmbrandt ’ s room until four o ’ clock the next morning—the nurse looking after franz in room , the boy whose recent pneumothorax operation had turned out so badly , had run into him in the hall , and had been so embarrassed that she got her doors mixed up and found herself in the room of prosecutor paravant from dortmund .
and finally frau stöhr held forth at length about a cosmological salon down in town , where she bought her mouthwash . joachim stared down at his plate .
the dinner was as splendidly prepared as it was lavish .
including the nourishing soup , it consisted of no fewer than six courses .
the fish was followed by a superb roast with vegetables , which was followed by a salad , then roast fowl , a dumpling dessert in no way inferior to the one hans had eaten the night before , and , finally , cheese and fruit .
people filled their plates at all seven tables—they ate with the appetites of lions here in these vaulted spaces . theirs was a hot hunger that it would have been a joy to observe , if its effect had not at the same time seemed somehow eerie , even repulsive .
not only the more lively among them displayed such hunger as they chatted and pelted one another with little pills of bread—no , but also the silent , gloomy ones , who between courses would put their heads in their hands and stare into space . at the next table on their left was an adolescent boy—still of school age , to judge by his appearance—whose coat sleeves were too short , and who wore thick , circular glasses ; he chopped up everything heaped on his plate until it was a pasty hodgepodge , then bent over it and wolfed it down , now and then pushing his napkin up behind his glasses to dry his eyes—it was unclear whether this was to wipe away sweat or tears .
during this major meal of the day , two incidents occurred to attract hans castorp ’ s attention , insofar as his condition allowed .
first , the glass door slammed shut again—just as the fish course was being served .
hans castorp flinched in irritation and told himself indignantly that this time he really must find out who the culprit was .
he didn ’ t merely think it—he was so in earnest that he spoke it out loud .
he whispered with exaggerated fervor , so that both miss robinson and the teacher glanced at him in amazement .
and turning his whole upper body to the left , he opened his bloodshot eyes wide .
it was a lady who crossed the hall now , a young woman , a girl really , of only average height , in a white sweater and brightly colored skirt , with reddish-blond hair , which she wore in a simple braid wound up on her head . hans castorp saw only a little of her profile—almost nothing , in fact . in quite marvelous contrast to her noisy entrance , she walked soundlessly , with a peculiar slinking gait , her head thrust slightly forward , and proceeded to the farthest table on the left , set perpendicular to the veranda doors—the good russian table .
as she walked she kept one hand in the pocket of her close-fitting wool jacket , while the other was busy at the back of her head , tucking and arranging her hair .
hans castorp looked at that hand—he had a good eye and a fine critical sense for hands , and it was his habit always first to direct his gaze at them whenever he made a new acquaintance . the hand tucking up her hair was not particularly ladylike , not refined or well cared for , not in the way the ladies in young hans castorp ’ s social circle cared for theirs .
it was rather broad , with stubby fingers ; there was something primitive and childish about it , rather like the hand of a schoolgirl .
her nails had clearly never seen a manicure , and had been trimmed carelessly—again , like a schoolgirl ’ s ; and the cuticles had a jagged look , almost as if she were guilty of the minor vice of nail-chewing .
her tablemates greeted the latecomer with nods ; as she took her seat on the near side of the table—her back to the room and right beside dr. krokowski , who was presiding—she turned , her hand still at her hair , and looked back over her shoulder at the assembly .
and hans castorp caught a fleeting glance of her broad cheekbones and narrow eyes—and at the sight , a vague memory of something or somebody brushed over him .
but of course—a female !
hans castorp thought , and again muttered it so emphatically to himself that the teacher , fräulein engelhart , understood what he had said .
the shriveled old maid smiled in sympathy .
that is madame chauchat , she said .
she ’ s so careless .
and fräulein engelhart ’ s fuzzy cheeks turned a shade rosier—which was the case , actually , whenever she opened her mouth .
hans castorp asked sternly .
no , she ’ s russian , said the teacher .
perhaps her husband is french , or of french extraction , i can ’ t say for sure .
still incensed , hans castorp asked if that was her husband there , and pointed to a gentleman with hunched shoulders sitting at the good russian table .
he ’ s never been here even once , he ’ s quite unknown to us .
she should learn to close a door properly , hans castorp said .
she always lets it slam .
but since the teacher meekly accepted his rebuke as if she were the guilty party , nothing more was said about madame chauchat . the second incident consisted of dr. blumenkohl ’ s leaving the room—it was no more than that .
then he slid his chair back in one decisive motion and left the room .
at this juncture , however , frau stöhr displayed her poor upbringing in the most garish light , because—apparently out of some crude satisfaction that she was less ill than blumenkohl—she accompanied his departure with a few half-sympathetic , half-contemptuous remarks .
the poor man , she said .
he ’ s on his last legs .
he ’ s off to have a talk with his blue henry again .
with a stubborn , obtuse look on her face , she uttered the grotesque term blue henry without the least hesitancy , and hans castorp felt an urge both to laugh and to shudder as she said it .
dr. blumenkohl , by the way , returned after a few minutes , carrying himself in the same diffident fashion as when he left , took his seat again , and went on eating .
then dinner was over ; but thanks to the capable service—and their dwarf in particular was marvelously fleet of foot—it had lasted only a little more than an hour . breathing heavily and not rightly knowing how he had got there , hans castorp found himself lying in the splendid lounge chair on his balcony—because there was a rest cure between dinner and tea , the most important of the day , in fact , and rigorously enforced .
he lay there between the opaque glass walls that separated him from joachim on one side and the russian couple on the other ; his heart pounded as he dozed , and he drew air in through his mouth .
when he used his handkerchief , he found red traces of blood , but he did not have the energy to think much about it , although he was easily inclined to worry about himself and tended by nature to play the hypochondriac . he had lit another maria mancini and smoked it to the end this time , despite the taste .
feeling dizzy , anxious , and dreamy , he thought how very strangely things were going for him up here .
two or three times he felt his chest shaken by suppressed laughter at the gruesome term that frau stöhr had used in her ignorance .
down in the garden the fantasy flag with the caduceus lifted now and then in a light breeze .
the sky had clouded over completely again . the sun was gone , and there was an almost inhospitable chill in the air .
he , too , ate a great deal , and with a worried , self-absorbed look on his face mutely took a second helping from each course .
i beg you , herr albin , do put that knife away , put it in your pocket before there ’ s an accident ! a high , wavering female voice fretted .
my dear herr albin , spare our nerves and remove that dreadful lethal object from view ! a second voice chimed in .
and then a blond young man , sitting sideways on a lounge chair clear at the front , a cigarette dangling from his mouth , replied in a flippant voice , wouldn ’ t think of it .
i bought it in calcutta from a blind magician .
he would swallow it , and then his boy would immediately dig it up some fifty paces away .
it ’ s much sharper than a razor .
you only have to just touch the blade , and it goes right into the flesh as if it were butter . wait a moment , let me show you up close .
and herr albin stood up .
no , i think i ’ ll go fetch my revolver , herr albin said .
herr albin , don ’ t do it !
but herr albin was already emerging from the arcade , heading for his room—very young , with a shambling gait , a rosy childlike face , and narrow sideburns at his ears . herr albin , a woman called after him , you ’ d do better to get your coat—put it on as a favor to me . you lay bedridden with pneumonia for six weeks , and here you are sitting without an overcoat , without even a blanket , and smoking cigarettes .
that ’ s tempting providence , herr albin , i swear it is .
but he only laughed derisively as he walked away , and within a few minutes he returned with his revolver . this aroused even more silly shrieks than before , and you could hear several ladies stumble as they tried to jump up from their chairs and got tangled in their blankets . look how small and shiny it is , herr albin said , but if i press right here—it will bite .
it ’ s loaded with live ammunition , of course , herr albin continued . there are six cartridges in this cylinder here , which moves ahead one chamber with every shot .
and by the by , i don ’ t keep this thing just for fun , he said , noticing that the effect was wearing off .
he slipped the revolver back into his breast pocket , sat back down on his chair , crossed his legs , and lit another cigarette .
definitely not just for fun , he repeated , pressing his lips together .
several trembling voices asked with foreboding .
one voice suddenly cried—and herr albin nodded .
i see you ’ re beginning to understand , he said .
and in fact , that is why i keep it handy , he went on lightly , after first inhaling and then exhaling a great quantity of smoke , despite his recent bout with pneumonia . i keep it at the ready for the day when all this malarkey here gets too boring and i shall have the honor of paying my final regards .
it really is very simple .
i ’ ve studied the matter at some length , and i have a very clear idea about how best to pull it off .
the region of the heart is out of the question—it ’ s rather awkward to aim there .
and besides , i prefer snuffing out the conscious mind on the spot , and can do so by applying one of these pretty little foreign objects to this interesting organ . and herr albin pointed with his index finger to his close-cropped blond head .
one aims here—herr albin pulled the nickel-plated revolver from his pocket again and tapped the barrel against one temple—here , just above the artery . slick as a whistle , even without a mirror . several voices of pleading protest , including one sobbing violently : herr albin , herr albin , put that revolver away , take it away from your temple , i can ’ t even watch !
herr albin , you ’ re young , you ’ ll get well again , you ’ ll enjoy life again in a circle of friends who love you , i swear you will !
put on your coat now , lie down here and pull a blanket over you , it ’ s time for your rest cure .
and don ’ t chase the bath attendant away again when he comes by and offers to rub you down with alcohol .
we implore you , for your own sake , for the sake of your young , precious life !
but herr albin was implacable .
