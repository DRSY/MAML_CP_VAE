it is a long trip , however , from hamburg to those elevations—too long , really , for so short a visit .
the journey leads through many a landscape , uphill and down , descends from the high plain of southern germany to the shores of swabia ’ s sea , and proceeds by boat across its skipping waves , passing over abysses once thought unfathomable .
from there the path , which until now has followed grand , direct routes , turns choppy .
there are stopovers and formalities .
at rorschach , a town in swiss territory , you reboard a train that takes you only as far as landquart , a small station in the alps , where you must change trains again .
after standing for a while in the wind , gazing at a rather uncharming landscape , you climb aboard a narrow-gauge train , and the moment the small , but uncommonly sturdy engine pulls out , the real adventure begins , a steep and dogged ascent that will never end , it seems .
the station at landquart lies at a relatively low altitude ; but now your route takes you on a wild ride up into real mountains , along tracks that squeeze their way between walls of rock .
hans castorp—that is the young man ’ s name—found himself alone in a small compartment upholstered in gray ; with him he had an alligator valise , a present from his uncle and foster father—consul tienappel , since we are naming names here—a rolled-up plaid blanket , and his winter coat , swinging on its hook .
the window was open beside him , but the afternoon was turning cooler and cooler , and , being the coddled scion of the family , he turned up the silk-lined collar of his fashionably loose summer overcoat .
on the seat beside him lay a paperbound book entitled ocean steamships , which he had perused from time to time earlier on his trip , but which now lay neglected , the cover dirtied by soot drifting in with the steam of the heavily puffing locomotive .
two days of travel separate this young man ( and young he is , with few firm roots in life ) from his everyday world , especially from what he called his duties , interests , worries , and prospects—separate him far more than he had dreamed possible as he rode to the station in a hansom cab . space , as it rolls and tumbles away between him and his native soil , proves to have powers normally ascribed only to time ; from hour to hour , space brings about changes very like those time produces , yet surpassing them in certain ways .
space , like time , gives birth to forgetfulness , but does so by removing an individual from all relationships and placing him in a free and pristine state—indeed , in but a moment it can turn a pedant and philistine into something like a vagabond . time , they say , is water from the river lethe , but alien air is a similar drink ; and if its effects are less profound , it works all the more quickly .
he had not planned to take this trip particularly seriously , to become deeply involved in it . his intention had been , rather , to put it behind him quickly , simply because that was how things had to be , to return quite the same person he had been at departure , and to pick up his life again where he had been forced to leave it lying for the moment .
only yesterday he had been totally caught up in his normal train of thought , preoccupied with what had just occurred , his exams , and with what was about to occur , his joining the firm of tunder and wilms ( dockyards , machine works , and boilers ) , and looking well beyond these next three weeks with as much impatience as his nature allowed . but now it seemed to him that present circumstances demanded his full attention and that it was inappropriate to shrug them off .
being lifted like this into regions whose air he had never breathed before and whose sparse and meager conditions were , as he well knew , both unfamiliar and peculiar—it all began to excite him , to fill him with a certain anxiety . home and a settled life not only lay far behind , but also , and more importantly , they lay fathoms below him , and he was still climbing .
hovering between home and the unknown ahead , he asked himself how he would do up there .
was it unwise and unhealthy , perhaps , for him , born only a few feet above sea level and accustomed to breathing that air , to be suddenly transported to such extreme regions without spending at least a few days someplace in between ? he wished he had already reached his goal , because once you were up there , he thought , you lived just as people did everywhere , instead of having the climb constantly remind you of how unsuitable these precincts were .
he looked out—the train was winding through a narrow pass ; you could see the forward cars and the laboring engine , emitting great straggling tatters of brown , green , and black smoke .
water roared in the deep ravine on his right ; dark pines on his left struggled up between boulders toward a stony gray sky .
there were pitch-black tunnels , and when daylight returned , vast chasms were revealed , with a few villages far below .
these views closed again , too , and were followed by new passes with patches of snow left in clefts and crevices . the train pulled into dingy little stations and backed out again on the same set of tracks , confusing your sense of direction until you no longer knew whether you were heading north or south . magnificent vistas opened onto regions toward which they were slowly climbing , a world of ineffable , phantasmagoric alpine peaks , soon lost again to awestruck eyes as the tracks took another curve .
hans castorp thought about how he had left hardwood forests far below him , and songbirds , too , he presumed ; and the idea that such things could cease , the sense of a world made poorer without them , brought on a slight attack of dizziness and nausea , and he covered his eyes with his hand for a second or two .
the train was now rolling more comfortably along the level floor of a valley .
it was almost eight o ’ clock , but still daylight .
a lake appeared in the distant landscape ; its surface was gray and from its shores black pine forests climbed the surrounding slopes , grew thinner toward the top , and gave way at last to bare , fog-enshrouded rock .
they stopped at a little station , davos-dorf , as hans castorp learned when someone outside shouted the name—he would be at journey ’ s end shortly . and suddenly , right beside him , he heard his cousin joachim ziemssen saying in an easygoing hamburg voice , hello there .
this is where you get off .
and when he looked out , there on the platform below his window stood joachim , wearing a brown ulster but no hat of any sort , and looking healthier than ever .
he laughed and said again , come on , get off , don ’ t be shy !
but i ’ m not there yet , hans castorp said , dumbfounded , keeping his seat .
this is davos-dorf . the sanatorium ’ s closer from here . i ’ ve got a carriage .
hand me your things . and with a laugh that betrayed his confusion and excitement at having arrived and seeing his cousin again , hans castorp lifted out his valise and winter coat , his plaid blanket roll plus cane and umbrella , and finally ocean steamships .
strangely enough , they had always avoided calling one another by their first names , purely out of fear of showing too much warmth of emotion . and since they could not very well address one another by their last names , they confined themselves to the use of familiar pronouns—now a deeply rooted habit between the two cousins .
they quickly shook hands with some embarrassment—young ziemssen never losing his military bearing—watched all the while by a man in livery with a braided cap , who then approached and asked hans castorp for his baggage ticket ; this was the concierge of the international sanatorium berghof , and he proved quite willing to fetch the guest ’ s large trunk from the station at davos-platz while the gentlemen themselves drove on ahead to dinner . the man had an obvious limp , and so the first thing that hans castorp asked joachim ziemssen was , is he a war veteran ? is that why he limps so badly ?
he ’ s got it in the knee—or had it , that is , now that he ’ s had his kneecap removed .
hans castorp mulled this over as rapidly as possible .
but you ’ re not going to try to tell me that you still have anything like that , are you ? you look as if you ’ ve already received your commission and were just home from maneuvers . and he gave his cousin a sidelong glance .
joachim was taller than he , with broader shoulders , the picture of youthful vigor , a man made for a uniform .
he was very dark-haired , a type not all that uncommon in his blond hometown , and his naturally dark complexion was now tanned almost bronze .
with his large black eyes and dark little moustache above full , finely chiseled lips , he would have been downright handsome , if his ears had not stood out so badly .
for most of his life , they had been his one great sorrow , his only care .
now he had other worries .
you will be coming back down with me , won ’ t you ? hans castorp went on .
back down with you ?
his cousin asked , turning to him with large eyes that had always had a gentle look , but that in the last five months had taken on a weary , indeed sad expression .
why , in three weeks .
oh , i see—you ’ re already thinking about heading back home , joachim replied .
well , wait and see , you ’ ve only just arrived .
three weeks are almost nothing for us up here , of course , but for you , just here on a visit and planning to stay a grand total of three weeks , for you that ’ s a long time .
acclimatize yourself first—and you ’ ll learn that ’ s not all that easy .
besides , the climate ’ s not the only unusual thing about us .
and as for what you ’ ve said about me—well , i ’ m not in such fine feather as all that , my friend . home in three weeks , that ’ s a notion from down below .
i ’ m nicely tanned , of course , but that ’ s mostly from the snow and doesn ’ t mean much , as behrens is always saying , and at my last regular checkup he said that it ’ s fairly certain it will be another six months yet .
they were taking their seats on the hard cushions of a yellow cabriolet that had stood waiting for them on the gravel apron in front of the station , itself not much more than a shed ; and as the pair of bays began to pull , hans castorp spun around now in vexation .
ah yes , time , joachim said , nodding to himself several times , paying no attention to his cousin ’ s honest indignation . you wouldn ’ t believe how fast and loose they play with people ’ s time around here .
three weeks are the same as a day to them .
you have all that to learn , he said , and then he added , a man changes a lot of his ideas here .
hans castorp gazed steadily at his profile .
but you really have made a splendid recovery , he said , shaking his head .
do you think so ? it ’ s true , isn ’ t it ? i think so , too !
he said , sitting up taller against the cushioned back , but immediately slumping again a little to one side .
i am feeling better , he explained , but i ’ m not yet entirely well , either .
the upper left lobe , where the rattling used to be , there ’ s only a little roughness there now , it ’ s not so bad , but the lower lobe is still very rough , and there are also sounds in the second intercostal .
how learned you ’ ve become , hans castorp said .
yes , a fine sort of learning , god knows .
i would gladly have unlearned it all on active duty , joachim retorted .
but i still have sputum , he said with a nonchalant , but somehow vehement shrug that did not suit him at all ; and now he pulled something halfway out of the nearer side pocket of his ulster , showed it to his cousin , and put it away again at once—a curved , flattened bottle of bluish glass with a metal cap .
most of us up here have one , he said .
we even have a name for it , a kind of nickname , a joke really .
having a look at the scenery , are you ?
they had first taken a street that was faced by an irregular pattern of buildings and ran along the railroad tracks , following the valley ’ s axis , but then turned left and crossed the narrow tracks and a brook ; and they were now trotting up a gently rising road in the direction of wooded slopes and a low , outcropping meadow where an elongated building stood , its façade turned to the southwest , topped by a copper cupola , and arrayed with so many balconies that , from a distance as the first lights of evening were being lit , it looked as pockmarked and porous as a sponge .
dusk was falling fast .
a pale red sunset that had enlivened the generally overcast sky faded now , leaving nature under the transient sway of the lackluster , lifeless , and mournful light that immediately precedes nightfall . lights were coming up in the long , meandering , populous valley , dotting its floor and the slopes on both sides—particularly on the swelling rise to the right , where buildings ascended a series of terraces . paths led up the meadowed hills on their left , but were soon lost to sight in the dull black of pine forests .
behind them , the mountains in the more distant background , where the valley tapered to an end , were a sober slate blue .
now that the wind had picked up , the evening had turned noticeably cooler .
no , to be quite frank , i don ’ t find it that overwhelming , hans castorp said .
where are the glaciers and snowcapped , towering peaks ? seems to me , the ones here aren ’ t all that high .
you can see the tree line almost everywhere , it ’ s really quite clearly defined ; the pines come to an end , then everything else—the end , then rocks , as you can see .
and over there , to the right of the schwarzhorn , on that jagged peak there , is a glacier for you—can you still see the blue ?
it ’ s not that big , but it ’ s a textbook glacier , the scaletta glacier .
and there ’ s piz michel and tinzenhorn in that gap—you can ’ t see them from here , but they ’ re always snow-covered , year-round .
eternal snow , hans castorp said .
right , eternal , if you like .
and they ’ re all very high .
but we ’ re dreadfully high up ourselves , keep that in mind .
yes , it was quite a climb . certainly had me scared , let me tell you .
five thousand three hundred feet . why , that ’ s over a mile high .
i ’ ve never been this far up in my whole life .
and in his curiosity , hans castorp took a deep breath , testing the alien air . it was fresh—that was all .
it lacked odor , content , moisture , it went easily into the lungs and said nothing to the soul .
yes , the air is famous .
but the landscape is not showing itself to its best advantage this evening . it can look better , especially in the snow .
but you soon get your fill of staring at it .
believe me , all of us up here have definitely had our fill of it , joachim said , and his mouth wrenched in an expression of disgust that seemed both exaggerated and out of control—and once again it did not suit him .
joachim asked , turning to his cousin and looking worried somehow .
no , no , beg your pardon , it just seemed that way to me for a moment or so , hans castorp hastened to say .
but what he really meant was that the phrase us up here , which joachim had used three or four times already , somehow made him feel anxious and queer .
our sanatorium lies at a higher altitude than the village , as you can see , joachim continued .
a hundred fifty feet . the brochure says three hundred , but it ’ s only half that .
the highest of the sanatoriums is schatzalp , across the way , you can ’ t see it now .
they have to transport the bodies down by bobsled in the winter , because the roads are impassable .
and suddenly he burst into laughter , a violent , overpowering laugh that shook his chest and twisted his face , stiffened by the cool wind , into a slightly painful grimace .
and you can sit there and tell me that so calm and cool ?
you ’ ve become quite the cynic in the last five months .
that ’ s not cynical at all , joachim replied with a shrug .
it doesn ’ t matter to the bodies . all the same , it may well be that we do get cynical up here .
behrens is an old cynic himself—a regular brick , by the way , an old fraternity man and a brilliant surgeon , you ’ ll like him , seems to me .
they make special note of his services in the brochure . he dissects the patients ’ psyches .
hans castorp cried , and now hilarity got the better of him .
he could no longer control it .
psychic dissection had finished the job , and he bent over and laughed so hard that the tears ran out from under the hand with which he had covered his eyes . joachim laughed heartily , too—it seemed to do him good . and so the two young men were in fine good humor as they climbed down from their carriage , which had borne them at a slow trot up the steep loop of the driveway to the portal of the international sanatorium berghof .
on their immediate right , between the outer and inner doors , was the desk for the concierge , and a french-looking attendant , dressed in the same livery as the limping man at the train station , was sitting by the telephone reading newspapers ; he came up to them and led them across the well-lit lobby , with public rooms opening off it on the left .
hans castorp peered in as they passed , and discovered them empty .
where were the guests ? he asked , and his cousin replied , taking their rest cure .
otherwise i ’ d be lying out on my balcony after my evening meal , too .
it would not have taken much for hans castorp to be seized by another fit of laughter .
you lie out on your balcony rain or shine , night or day ?
he asked , his voice wavering on the edge .
yes , it ’ s in the rules .
from eight till ten .
but come on , let ’ s have a look at your room , and you can wash up . they got on the elevator , the frenchman operating the electric switches .
as they glided upward , hans castorp dried his eyes .
i ’ m exhausted , i ’ ve laughed so hard , he said , catching his breath through his mouth .
besides , i ’ m a little weary from the trip , i suppose .
and at the same time your face flushes—it ’ s an unpleasant feeling .
i assume we ’ ll be eating soon ?
do they feed you properly up here ? they passed soundlessly down the coconut runners of the narrow corridor . cool light came from the milk-glass shades of lamps set in the ceiling .
the walls were painted with a hard , glistening white enamel .
a nurse in a white cap appeared from somewhere , a pince-nez set on her nose , its cord tucked behind one ear . she had the look of a protestant nurse , of someone with no real devotion to her profession , but kept restless by curiosity and the burden of boredom . some balloon-shaped objects had been set out in the corridor , beside two of the white-enameled doors—large , potbellied containers with short necks .
here you are , joachim said .
i ’ m on your right , and on your left is a russian couple—they ’ re rather slovenly , and loud , i must say , but there was nothing else we could do .
well , what do you say ?
there was a double door , with clothes hooks in the space between the two . joachim had turned on the ceiling light , and its sharp luster revealed a room that was both cheerful and restful , with white , practical furniture ; heavy , washable wallpaper , likewise white ; a floor covered with spotless linoleum ; and linen curtains , embroidered with a simple , cheerful pattern of modern design .
the door to the balcony stood open to a glimpse of lights in the valley and the sound of distant dance music . joachim had thoughtfully placed a few wildflowers in a small vase on the dresser—some yarrow and a couple of bluebells , in their second bloom this summer , that he had picked on the slopes .
what a nice room .
i ’ ll have no trouble putting up here for a week or two .
an american woman died here the day before yesterday , joachim said .
behrens told me he was sure it would be all over with her before you arrived , and that you could have the room .
her fiancé was with her , an english naval officer , but he didn ’ t exactly keep a stiff upper lip .
he kept coming out into the corridor to cry every few minutes , like a little boy .
and then he ’ d rub his cheeks with cold cream because he ’ d just shaved and the tears stung .
the evening before last , the american woman had two first-class hemorrhages , and that was that .
but she ’ s been gone since yesterday morning , and of course it was all thoroughly fumigated with formalin—they say it ’ s very effective , you know . hans castorp was listening to this narrative with edgy bemusement .
he had rolled up his sleeves and was standing now at the large washbasin , its nickel taps sparkling under the electric light , but he cast no more than a fleeting glance at the bed ’ s white metal frame and fresh sheets .
fumigated , that ’ s spiffing , he said glibly and somewhat incongruously while he washed and dried his hands .
yes , methyl aldehyde , even the toughest bacteria can ’ t take that—hco , but it does burn in your nose , doesn ’ t it ?
it ’ s obvious , of course , that strict cleanliness is essential .
his accent , particularly his it ’ s , betrayed his hamburg origins , whereas starting back in his student days , his cousin had adopted more standard pronunciation .
that naval officer probably used a safety razor , that ’ s what i think , it ’ s easier to cut yourself with those things than with a well-stropped straight razor , that ’ s been my experience at least , so i alternate between the two .
and , of course , salt water does smart on chafed skin , so he probably got in the habit of using cold cream while he was in the service , that doesn ’ t seem at all peculiar to me .
and he chatted away , telling about how he had packed two hundred maria mancinis—his cigars—in his trunk , but that getting through customs had been easy as pie . and then he extended greetings from various people back home .
don ’ t they heat the rooms ?
he suddenly exclaimed and ran over to put his hand on the radiator .
no , they keep it rather cool , joachim answered .
the weather would have to turn really bad before they would turn on the heat in august .
but i ’ m freezing ! i ’ m ab-so-lute-ly freezing , i mean my body is , although my face feels awfully flushed—here , feel it , it ’ s burning up .
joachim did not acknowledge it , but merely said , it ’ s the air here , it doesn ’ t mean anything . behrens himself walks around with purple cheeks all day .
some people never get used to it .
well , come on now , or we ’ ll not get anything to eat .
in the corridor they ran into the nurse again , who squinted with nearsighted curiosity as she watched them pass .
they had reached the second floor , when hans castorp suddenly stopped in his tracks , mesmerized by a perfectly ghastly noise he heard coming from beyond a dogleg in the hall—not a loud noise , but so decidedly repulsive that hans castorp grimaced and stared wide-eyed at his cousin .
it was a cough , apparently—a man ’ s cough , but a cough unlike any that hans castorp had ever heard ; indeed , compared to it , all other coughs with which he was familiar had been splendid , healthy expressions of life—a cough devoid of any zest for life or love , which didn ’ t come in spasms , but sounded as if someone were stirring feebly in a terrible mush of decomposing organic material .
an austrian aristocrat—you know , an elegant fellow , your born horseman .
and now it ’ s come to this .
although he ’ s still up and about .
as they walked on , hans castorp remarked , referring to the horseman ’ s cough , you must realize that i ’ ve never heard anything like it , that it ’ s all quite new to me , and that it does make an impression .
there are so many kinds of coughs , dry ones , loose ones , and loose ones are healthier , people say , better than dry barks .
back in my youth—he actually said in my youth—i caught the croup , and it had me barking like a wolf , and everyone was happy when it loosened up , i still remember it quite well .
but a cough like that—that ’ s something new , to me at least—it ’ s not even human .
it ’ s not dry , but you can ’ t call it loose , either , there ’ s no word for it .
it ’ s as if you were looking right down inside and could see it all—the mucus and the slime .
well , joachim said , i hear it every day , so you don ’ t need to describe it for me .
but hans castorp could not get the cough he had heard out of his mind and kept repeating that it was literally like looking down inside the horseman ; and as they entered the restaurant , his eyes , weary from the trip , had taken on a glint of nervous excitement .
it was to the right of the lobby , directly across from the social rooms , and was used , as joachim explained , primarily for new arrivals or residents who either had missed a regularly scheduled meal or had visitors . but birthdays or imminent departures were celebrated there , too , as were favorable results of a general checkup .
things could get very lively in the restaurant on occasion , joachim said ; they even served champagne .
there was no one there now except one lady , perhaps thirty years old , sitting alone and reading—humming to herself the whole time while drumming softly on the tabletop with the middle finger of her left hand . when the young gentlemen had seated themselves , she changed places , so that her back was to them now .
she was standoffish , joachim explained in a low voice , and always ate in the restaurant with just her book .
rumor had it that she had entered a tuberculosis sanatorium as a very young girl and had never lived in the outside world since .
well then , compared to her you ’ re a mere novice with your five months , and still will be with a whole year to your credit , hans castorp said to his cousin ; to which joachim merely gave his new , uncharacteristic shrug and reached for the menu .
they had taken the raised table beside a window hung with cream-colored curtains—the nicest table in the room . they sat opposite one another , their faces illumined by an electric table lamp with a red shade .
hans castorp clasped his freshly washed hands together and rubbed them in congenial expectation , a habit of his whenever he sat down to eat—perhaps because his forebears had prayed before every meal .
they were waited on by a friendly girl in a black dress and white apron , whose large face glowed with robust health and who spoke in a guttural dialect .
to his great amusement , hans castorp was instructed that waitresses here were called dining attendants .
they ordered a bottle of gruaud larose , which hans castorp sent back to be brought to room temperature .
there was asparagus soup , followed by stuffed tomatoes , a roast with several vegetables , an especially well done dessert , and a tray of cheese and fruit . hans castorp ate heartily , although with not quite the lively appetite he had expected .
but he was accustomed to eating large meals—even when he wasn ’ t hungry—purely out of self-respect . joachim did not do much credit to his meal .
he had had enough of the cooking here , he said , everyone up here had , and it was customary to disparage the food , because when you had to sit up here forever and a day .
but he did enjoy drinking , taking to the wine with something like abandon ; and while carefully avoiding all sentiment-laden phrases , he repeatedly expressed his satisfaction that at last someone was here with whom it was possible to have a rational conversation .
yes , it ’ s top-notch , your having come , he said , and there was feeling in his nonchalant voice .
first of all , just the variety of it—i mean , it ’ s an interruption , a break in the everlasting , endless monotony . but i would think time ought to pass quickly for you all , hans castorp suggested .
quickly and slowly , just as you like , joachim replied .
hans castorp drank as well , although his face was burning like fire by now .
but his body still seemed cold , and he felt a pleasurable and yet somehow annoying restlessness in his joints .
words tumbled out , he misspoke himself several times , but went right on with a dismissive wave of his hand .
joachim was likewise in a lively mood , and after the humming , drumming lady suddenly stood up and departed , their conversation turned even more candid and high-spirited . they gesticulated with their forks as they ate , tucked bites of food in their cheeks , looked important , laughed , nodded , shrugged , and went right on talking without even first swallowing their food properly .
joachim wanted to hear about hamburg and brought the conversation around to plans for making the elbe more navigable .
we ’ ve added a line in our budget for an immediate payment of fifty million , and you can be sure that we know exactly what we ’ re doing .
but then , despite the importance he attached to navigation on the elbe , he at once abandoned the topic and demanded that joachim tell him more about life up here and about the guests ; which joachim proved ready and willing to do , happy to open his heart and unburden himself . he had to repeat the part about the bodies being sent down by bobsled and once again asserted unequivocally that he knew it to be true .
and when hans castorp was taken by another fit of laughter , joachim joined in , seeming heartily to enjoy the opportunity , and then told more comic stories , just to add fuel to the general merriment . there was a lady who sat at his table , frau stöhr was her name , and quite ill by the way , the wife of a musician from cannstatt—and she was the most illiterate person he had ever met .
you had to sit there and swallow it , without a trace of a smile .
and she was a gossip , besides , as were most people up here , by the by , and she claimed that another lady , frau iltis , carried a stirletto around with her .
and throwing themselves back in their chairs , half lying , half leaning , they laughed so hard that they shook until they both began to hiccough at almost the same time .
but every now and then , joachim was reminded of his own fate and would turn gloomy .
yes , here we sit laughing , he said with a pained expression , broken by occasional spasms of his diaphragm , and yet there ’ s no telling when i ’ ll get out of here , because when behrens says another six months , that ’ s his low estimate , and you need to be prepared for even longer .
but it is hard , you must admit . it ’ s really sad , isn ’ t it ?
i had already been accepted and would have taken my officer ’ s exam next month .
and here i am lounging about with a thermometer in my mouth and counting frau stöhr ’ s illiterate howlers , and time is passing me by .
a single year plays such an important role at our age , it brings so many changes and so much progress with it when you ’ re living down below .
and here i am stagnating like an old water hole—a stinking pond , and that ’ s not too crude a comparison , either .
strangely enough , hans castorp ’ s only reply came as a question—did they serve porter here ? and when joachim looked at him in astonishment , he realized that his cousin was very near to falling asleep—was in fact already nodding . why , you ’ re asleep , joachim said .
come on , it ’ s high time we went to bed , both of us .
but he joined his cousin all the same , walking on stiff legs and bent so low that he looked like a man being dragged toward the floor by weariness . but as they moved across the now dimly lit lobby , he pulled himself together by sheer force of effort when he heard joachim say , that ’ s krokowski sitting there .
dr. krokowski was sitting in the light , close to the fireplace , just inside the sliding door opening onto one of the social rooms .
he was reading a newspaper , but stood up as the young men approached .
joachim , striking a military pose , said , might i introduce you , doctor , to my cousin castorp ?
dr. krokowski greeted the new resident with a kind of jovial , rugged , and reassuring heartiness , as if to imply that in his presence any diffidence was quite superfluous and cheerful mutual trust the only appropriate response .
he was about thirty-five years old , broad-shouldered , stout , considerably shorter than the two men across from him , so that he had to tip his head back to look them in the eye , and extraordinarily pale—there was almost a translucence , even phosphorescence , to his pallor , and it was enhanced by dark , glowing eyes , black eyebrows , and a rather long beard that already showed a few gray strands and ended in two diverging points .
he wore a black , rather worn , double-breasted business suit and black open-worked shoes , almost sandals really , over gray woolen socks ; hans castorp had seen a soft , floppy collar like that only once before—sported by a photographer in danzig—and indeed it did lend something of the artist ’ s studio to dr. krokowski ’ s general appearance . as he shook the young man ’ s hand , an effusive smile revealed yellowish teeth under his beard , and in a baritone voice betraying the drawl of a foreign accent , he said , we bid you welcome , herr castorp .
i do hope that you ’ ll make yourself comfortable and soon feel right at home here with us .
you have come as a patient , have you not—if you ’ ll pardon the question ?
it was touching to see how hans castorp struggled to be polite and master his drowsiness .
he was annoyed with himself for being in such bad shape , and with the leery self-consciousness of youth he detected traces of an indulgent smirk in the assistant director ’ s reassuring smile .
in answering , he said something about three weeks , mentioned his exams , and added that , thank god , he was perfectly healthy .
dr. krokowski replied , thrusting his head forward at a derisive slant and smiling more broadly .
in that case you are a phenomenon of greatest medical interest .
you see , i ’ ve never met a perfectly healthy person before . and what kind of exams were those , if you ’ ll pardon the question ?
i ’ m an engineer , doctor , hans castorp answered with modest dignity .
and dr. krokowski ’ s smile receded , as it were , losing something of both its energy and warmth for a moment .
and so you ’ ll not be availing yourself here of any sort of medical attention , either physical or psychological ?
no , no , thanks just the same , hans castorp said , almost stepping back .
with that , dr. krokowski broke into his triumphant smile again , and shaking the young man ’ s hand once more , he exclaimed in a loud voice , in that case , sleep well , herr castorp—in full enjoyment of your impeccable health .
and then he dismissed the young men and sat back down to his newspaper .
the elevator was no longer running , and so they used the stairs , climbing in silence , slightly bewildered by their meeting with dr. krokowski .
joachim accompanied hans castorp to room , where they found that the limping concierge had properly delivered the new guest ’ s luggage ; and they chatted for another fifteen minutes while hans castorp unpacked his nightclothes and toiletries after first lighting a thick , mild cigarette .
he never had got around to a last cigar—which struck him as odd , quite unusual , really . he does have a distinguished look about him , he said , and the inhaled smoke tumbled out with the words .
he ’ s pale as chalk .
but as for his choice of footwear , it ’ s really dreadful , i must say .
gray wool socks—and then those sandals .
was he offended there at the end ?
he ’ s a little sensitive , joachim admitted .
you shouldn ’ t have been so brusque about rejecting medical treatment , at least not the psychological part .
he doesn ’ t like for people to try to avoid it .
he ’ s not all that well disposed toward me , either , because i don ’ t confide enough in him .
but now and then i do tell him a dream , so that he ’ ll have something to dissect .
then i really did rub him the wrong way just now , hans castorp said with annoyance , for it always upset him when he offended someone ; and now weariness overcame him with renewed intensity as well .
i ’ ll come by for you for breakfast at eight , joachim said and left .
hans castorp hastily went through the motions of getting ready for bed .
no sooner had he turned out the lamp on his nightstand than sleep overwhelmed him—but he started up again when he recalled that someone had died in that very bed only two nights before .
not for the first time , either , he told himself , as if that might serve to reassure him .
it ’ s just a deathbed , an ordinary deathbed .
and he dozed off .
but as soon as he was asleep , he began to dream and kept on dreaming almost nonstop until morning .
most of the time he saw joachim ziemssen , in a strangely contorted position , riding down a steep slope on a bobsled .
he was as phosphorescently pale as dr. krokowski , and up front sat the austrian horseman , steering , although the face was very vague , like that of someone you ’ ve only heard cough .
it really doesn ’ t matter to us—to us up here , the contorted joachim said , and now it was he , and not the horseman , who was coughing in that ghastly , slimy way . and this made hans castorp weep bitterly , and he realized that he would have to run to the pharmacist to get himself some cold cream .
but frau iltis was sitting beside the road , a roguish pucker on her face , and she was holding something in her hand that was supposed to be her stirletto , but was really nothing more than a safety razor .
that only made hans castorp laugh again , and so he was tossed back and forth by waves of emotion until the dawn came to the half-open balcony door and awakened him .
hans castorp retained only faint recollections of his actual parental home ; he had hardly known his father and mother .
they had both dropped dead within the brief period between his fifth and seventh years of life . his mother had died first , quite unexpectedly , while awaiting the birth of a second child , of an arterial blockage caused by phlebitis , an embolism , dr. heidekind had called it , triggering instantaneous cardiac paralysis—she had been sitting up in bed , laughing , and it looked as if she simply toppled over in a fit of laughter , whereas in fact she did it because she was dead .
it was not something that hans hermann castorp , the father , found easy to understand , and since he had been very fond of his wife and was not the most robust man himself , he simply did not know how to get over it .
from then on , his mind was muddled , his focus narrow ; and in his befuddlement he made mistakes in his business , resulting in serious losses for the firm of castorp and son . while inspecting a harbor warehouse on a windy day the following spring , he caught pneumonia , and since , despite all the conscientious attention given him by dr. heidekind , his already agitated heart could not hold out against the high fever , he , too , was dead within five days . escorted by a quite respectable number of his fellow citizens , he joined his wife in the castorp family grave , a very beautiful plot in the cemetery of saint catherine ’ s church , with a view to the botanical gardens .
his own father , the senator , survived him , if only by a little , and during the brief period until his death—likewise caused by pneumonia , against which he struggled amid great agony , for unlike his son , hans lorenz castorp was a man rooted firmly in life , a tree hard to fell—during this brief period of a mere year and a half , then , the orphaned hans castorp lived in his grandfather ’ s house , which had been built on a narrow lot on the esplanade in the early years of the century just past . its nordic classical façade , painted a dreary , weather-beaten color , was adorned by pilasters at both sides of the front door , which was set in the center of the first floor and had five stairs leading up to it ; the main level was topped off by two more stories , both with windows reaching to the floor and ornamented with wrought-iron grills .
the first floor was taken up exclusively by formal rooms , including the bright dining room—with its ornamental plaster and three windows hung with burgundy curtains and looking out on the little back garden—where during those eighteen months the grandfather and grandson dined together daily at four in the afternoon , served by old fiete , who had rings in both ears , silver buttons on his swallowtail coat , and a batiste necktie exactly like the one worn by his master , in which , also in imitation of his master , he buried his clean-shaven chin , and whom the grandfather always addressed familiarly in plattdeutsch , not for any comical effect ( for he was a man without humor ) but quite matter-of-factly , just as he did whenever he dealt with the commonfolk—warehouse workers , messengers , coachmen , or servants .
the old man understood and nodded and went on eating , sitting very erect between the high mahogany back of his chair and the table , barely bending forward to his plate ; and his grandson , seated opposite , would watch with silent , profound , and unconscious attention as his grandfather ’ s hands—beautiful , white , gaunt , aged hands , with rounded , sharply tapered fingernails and a green signet ring on the right forefinger—arranged a bite of meat , vegetable , and potato on the tip of the fork with a few practiced motions and guided it to the mouth with just the least forward tip of the head .
hans castorp enjoyed listening to the dialect , and also enjoyed fiete ’ s answers , likewise in plattdeutsch , delivered while serving from the left and bending around behind his master to speak into his right ear , out of which the senator heard considerably better than the left .
hans castorp looked down at his own still awkward hands and sensed stored within them the possibility that one day he would hold and use his knife and fork as adeptly as his grandfather .
it was quite a different matter whether he would ever be able to bury his chin in such a necktie , tied so that it filled the wide opening created by his grandfather ’ s peculiarly shaped collar , whose pointed tips brushed the old man ’ s cheeks .
because for that you would have to be as old as he was , and even in those days no one , far and wide , wore such collars and neckties , except him and his old fiete .
what a shame that was , because little hans castorp was delighted by the way his grandfather could rest his chin in the high , snow-white necktie ; and even as an adult , the memory of it pleased him no end—there was something about it that found approval in the very depth of his soul .
when they were finished eating and had folded their napkins , rolling them up and pushing them through their silver rings—a procedure that hans castorp managed only with difficulty , because the napkins were as large as small tablecloths—the senator would rise from his chair while fiete pulled it back and then walk , shuffling his feet as he went , to the den to fetch a cigar .
sometimes his grandson would follow him .
this den was the result of the dining room ’ s having been designed with three windows , so that it extended across the full width of the house , thus leaving no space for three drawing rooms , as was usual with this style of house , but for only two , one of which , placed at right angles to the dining room , would have been disproportionately deep , with only one window to the street . this was why one quarter of its length had been partitioned off , forming the den , a dim , narrow room lit by a skylight and furnished with only a few items : a whatnot stand for the senator ’ s cigar cabinet , a card table with a drawer full of enticing objects—a deck of whist cards , game tokens , scorecards with little hinged stands , a slate and chalk styluses , paper cigar holders , and other things , too—and finally , set back in one corner , a rococo china cabinet made of rosewood , with yellow silk curtains pulled across the inside of its window-panes .
grampa , little hans castorp might say once they were in the den , raising himself up on tiptoe and stretching to reach the old man ’ s ear , please show me the baptismal bowl . and his grandfather , who had already pushed back the long , soft flap of his frock coat and pulled a bundle of keys from his trouser pocket , now opened the china cabinet , from whose interior rose a fragrance the boy found both strange and pleasant .
all sorts of objects that had fallen out of use , which made them all the more captivating , were kept inside : a pair of sinuous silver candlesticks ; a broken barometer , its wooden case carved with figures ; an album of daguerreotypes ; a cedar chest for liqueurs ; a little turk in a bright silk costume , whose body was rigid to the touch but contained a mechanism that , though it had long since fallen into disrepair , had once enabled him to run across the table ; a model of an old-fashioned ship ; and way at the bottom , a rattrap no less .
but from the middle shelf , the old man took a heavily tarnished , round silver bowl set on a silver plate and showed the boy both pieces , separating them and turning them both about in his hands , all the while reciting a story he had told many times before . the bowl and the plate were not originally a set , as one could plainly see and as the boy was now instructed yet again ; but they had been used together , his grandfather said , for around a hundred years now , ever since the bowl had been acquired . the bowl was beautiful , its lines simple and elegant , fashioned according to the austere taste of the early years of the last century .
smooth and massive , it rested on round feet , its interior lined with gold , though the yellow luster had faded with the years .
the only ornamentation was an embossed wreath of roses and serrated leaves around its rim . as for the plate , one could read its much greater age right on its surface . there stood in ornate numbers , and framing the date were all sorts of curlicued engraved lines , done in the modern fashion of the period , bombastic and capricious arabesques and crests that were half stars , half flowers .
the underside , however , was inscribed in a variety of ever-changing scripts with the names of those heads of the household who had been its owners over the course of time . there were seven names in all now , each rounded out with the date of inheritance , and the old man in the white necktie pointed with his ringed forefinger as he read off each of them to his grandson .
his father ’ s name was there , as was in fact his grandfather ’ s , and his great-grandfather ’ s ; and now that syllable came doubled , tripled , and quadrupled from the storyteller ’ s mouth ; and the boy would lay his head to one side , his eyes fixed and full of thought , yet somehow dreamily thoughtless , his lips parted in drowsy devotion , and he would listen to the great-great-great-great—that somber sound of the crypt and buried time , which nevertheless both expressed a reverently preserved connection of his own life in the present to things now sunk deep beneath the earth and simultaneously had a curious effect on him : the same effect visible in the look on his face .
the sound made him feel as if he were breathing the moldy , cool air of saint catherine ’ s church or the crypt in saint michael ’ s , as if he could sense the gentle draft of places where as you walked , hat in hand , you fell into a certain reverential , forward rocking motion , your heels never touching the ground ; and he also thought he could hear the remote , cloistered silence of those reverberating spaces . at the sound of those somber syllables , religious feelings got mixed up with a sense of death and history , and all of it together somehow left the boy with a pleasant sensation—indeed , it may well have been that it was solely for the sake of that sound , just to hear it and join in reciting it , that he had once again asked to be allowed to see the baptismal bowl .
then his grandfather would put the basin back on its tray and let the boy look into its smooth , soft golden hollow , which began to shimmer as it caught the light falling from above .
and it will soon be eight years now , he said , since we held you over it and the water with which you were baptized trickled down into it .
lassen , the sexton from saint jacob ’ s , poured it into the cupped hands of our good pastor bugenhagen , and then it ran down over your hair and into the bowl here .
but we had warmed it first , so that you wouldn ’ t be frightened and start crying , and you didn ’ t , either , quite the contrary , you had been bawling beforehand , making it difficult for bugenhagen to give his homily , but then came the water , and you fell silent , and that was out of respect for the holy sacrament , let us hope .
and in a very few days now , it will be forty-four years since your dear departed father was the baby being baptized , and water ran down from his head into this same bowl .
that happened here , in his parents ’ home , across the way in the drawing room , in front of the middle window , and it was old pastor hesekiel who baptized him , the same one who almost got himself shot by the french when he was a young man , for preaching against their looting and burning—he ’ s been resting in the lord for a long , long time now .
but seventy-five years ago , it was me they baptized , that was in the drawing room , too , and they held my head over this same bowl sitting on its tray here , and the pastor spoke the same words that were spoken over you and your father , and warm , clear water ran down over my hair , too—there wasn ’ t much more of it in those days than i have on my head now—and flowed into this golden basin .
the boy looked up at his grandfather ’ s narrow gray head which was bent over the bowl again , just as it had been in that long-vanished hour he was talking about , and a familiar feeling stole over him—a strange , half-dreamy , half-scary sense of standing there and yet being tugged away at the same time , a kind of fluctuating permanence , that meant both a return to something and a dizzying , everlasting sameness , a feeling that he knew well from previous occasions and that he had been waiting for , hoping it would touch him again .
when considering it later , as a young man , he realized that the image of his grandfather was imprinted much more deeply , clearly , and significantly in his memory than that of his parents—and this may possibly have had its basis both in mutual sympathy and a special physical affinity , because the grandson did look like his grandfather , to the extent that a lad with down on his rosy cheeks can resemble a sallow and stiff septuagenarian . probably the most significant factor , however , was that without question the old man had been the central figure in the family , its picturesque personality . from the viewpoint of the outside world , time had made hans lorenz castorp ’ s character and convictions obsolete long before his passing .
he was a most christian gentleman , a member of a reformed parish , with strict traditional opinions , so stubborn an advocate of restricting qualifications for those who govern to the aristocracy that it was as if he were living in the fourteenth century , when , against the dogged resistance of the old free patricians , tradesmen had first begun to win seats and voices in the town council—in sum , a man who opposed anything new .
his active years had come during decades of violent expansion and numerous upheavals , decades of progress at a forced march , all of which constantly demanded great public courage and sacrifice . but it had not been old castorp ’ s fault , god knows , that the modern spirit had enjoyed its celebrated , brilliant victories . he had held the customs of his forefathers and their old institutions in far higher regard than any expansion of the harbor at breakneck speed or the godless tomfooleries of a great city , had impeded and tempered wherever he could .
and had it been up to him , the city administration nowadays would look just as old-fashioned and idyllic as his office had looked when he was in his prime .
and this was how the old man was viewed , both during his lifetime and after , by his fellow citizens ; and even though little hans castorp understood nothing about the affairs of government , the perceptions gained by his own calm , alert child ’ s eye were much the same—unspoken and therefore uncritical perceptions , though enthusiastic for all that , which when they later became conscious memories retained their exclusively positive stamp , immune to all discussion or analysis . as noted , mutual sympathy was at work here , the kind of family affection and affinity of personality that not infrequently leaps a generation .
senator castorp was tall and gaunt .
the years had bent his back and neck , but he attempted to compensate for this by pressing against the curvature , which pulled down the corners of his mouth in a kind of painful dignity , while the lips , with no supporting teeth behind them , rested on bare gums—he wore his dentures only to eat—and this counterpressure , which presumably also helped him steady his head ( because it had begun to shake of late ) , was probably what caused him to carry himself with an austere , forward tilt and to prop his chin in the way that so pleased little hans .
he loved his snuff ; he had a longish tortoiseshell box inlaid with gold , and snuff was also the reason he carried red handkerchiefs , the tip of one usually visible dangling from the back pocket of his frock coat .
and although this harmless vice added a jaunty touch to his appearance , the ultimate effect was much more that of the license of old age , the kind of carelessness that age either consciously and merrily permits itself or brings with it , cloaked in dignified oblivion ; in any case , it was the only such carelessness in his grandfather ’ s appearance that little hans castorp ’ s sharp eye ever observed .
both to the mind of the seven-year-old and in the memories of the adult , the everyday appearance of the old man was not what was essential and real about him . his essential reality was quite different , much more handsome and authentic than his everyday appearance . that reality , you see , was to be found in a painting—a life-size portrait that at one time had hung in the living room of hans castorp ’ s parents and had been transported along with the boy to the house on the esplanade , where it had been given a spot above the large red silk sofa in the parlor .
it showed hans lorenz castorp in his official dress as a town councillor—the sober , even godly attire of citizens from a vanished century , a costume that later citizens , whether staid or dashing , had carried with them through the years , continuing to wear it on pompous occasions in order ceremoniously to make the past present , and the present past , and to proclaim the permanent continuity of all things and the venerable trustworthiness of their official signatures .
there , large as life , senator castorp stood on a red-tiled floor , against a perspective of columns and gothic arches .
there he stood , his chin lowered , his mouth drawn down , his blue , thoughtful eyes , the bags heavy beneath them , directed into the distance ; he was clad in a robelike black jacket , hanging open at the front , edged in fur along the hem and lapels , and reaching well below his knees . emerging from under its wide , braid-trimmed , puffy sleeves was a second set of tight-fitting sleeves of simpler fabric , ending in lace cuffs that covered the hands to the knuckles .
he had pulled black silk stockings over his skinny old-man ’ s legs , and on his feet he wore shoes with silver buckles . around his neck , however , lay a wide , starched , heavily pleated ruff , slanted forward , but sloping upward on both sides , beneath which , to top it all , could be seen a pleated batiste jabot and a vest .
under one arm he carried an old-fashioned , broad-brimmed hat that tapered to a point .
it was a splendid portrait , painted by a renowned artist , executed tastefully in the style—as suggested by its subject—of the old masters and awakening in the observer all sorts of images of the late middle ages in the spanish netherlands .
little hans castorp had often studied it , not with any artistic acumen of course , but with a certain more general , even penetrating understanding ; and although he had only once seen his grandfather in real life in the fashion pictured there on canvas—just for a brief moment as part of a dignified procession into the town hall—he could not help , as we have said , regarding this pictorial presence as his authentic and real grandfather , seeing in the everyday one a temporary , imperfectly adapted improvisation , so to speak .
from that perspective , the lapses and eccentricities in his everyday appearance were apparently mere imperfections , or inept adaptations , were the vestiges or hints of a pure and true nature that could not be totally eradicated .
granted , his stiff collar and high , white necktie were old-fashioned ; but such a term could never be applied to that marvelous article of clothing—he meant the spanish ruff—of which the former were merely present-day traces .
and it was the same with the peculiar rounded top hat that his grandfather wore in public , which on some higher plane of reality corresponded to the broad-brimmed felt hat in the picture—or the long , pleated frock coat , whose genuine prototype little hans castorp found in the fur- and braid-trimmed robe . and so when the day came to say farewell , in his heart of hearts little hans castorp was relieved to see his grandfather decked out in his authentic perfection . it was in the dining room , the same room where they had so often sat across the table from one another ; in the middle of the room hans lorenz castorp now lay in a silver-trimmed coffin , atop a bier surrounded and besieged with wreaths .
he had battled pneumonia to the end , had battled long and obstinately , even though , to all appearances , he had accommodated himself only in part to contemporary life ; but now here he lay in state—one could not be sure whether triumphant or vanquished , but in any case , with a stern , satisfied look on his face , though it was greatly changed , his nose looking pinched after his struggles ; his lower body shrouded under a coverlet , on which lay a palm frond ; his head propped up on the silk pillow so that his chin rested most handsomely in the indentation at the front of the ceremonial ruff .
and in his hands—half hidden by lace cuffs , the fingers looking cold and inanimate despite their artificially natural pose—someone had placed an ivory cross , upon which his eyes , beneath their lowered lids , seemed to be fixed .
hans castorp had seen his grandfather several times in the early stages of his last illness , but then no more toward the end .
he had been spared any sight of the struggle , which had taken place primarily at night , and had been touched by it only indirectly—the anxious atmosphere in the house , old fiete ’ s reddened eyes , the comings and goings of doctors . but from its outcome , which he now found displayed before him in the dining room , he gathered that his grandfather had now received solemn dispensation from his interim stage and had finally returned to the form appropriate to him—an event of which he could only approve , though old fiete wept and constantly shook his head , even though hans castorp himself wept , just as he had wept at the sight of his unexpectedly deceased mother and , a short time later , of his father lying there equally serene and strange .
for this was now the third time within so few months and at such a young age that little hans castorp ’ s mind and senses had been affected by death—his senses in particular .
the sight of it , the impression it left , was no longer new to him , but really quite familiar , and just as on the first two occasions he had behaved responsibly and kept his composure—with no sign of nervous weakness , although much distressed , as is only natural—he did so now as well , but to an even greater degree . unaware of the practical implications of these events on his life , or perhaps regarding them with childish indifference while trusting that the world would take care of him one way or the other , he betrayed a similarly childish reserve and businesslike attentiveness when viewing coffins , which on this third occasion took on nuances of precociousness , both in his emotional reaction and the look of knowledgeable experience on his face—it being unnecessary likewise to describe his natural reaction of being caught up in the frequent tearful outbursts of others .
within three or four months after his father died , he had forgotten death ; now he remembered it , and all the impressions from before reemerged simultaneously—in every precise , piercing , and incomparable detail .
analyzed and put into words , his feelings might have been expressed as follows : there was something religious , gripping , and sadly beautiful , which was to say , spiritual about death and at the same time something that was the direct opposite , something very material , physical , which one could not really describe as beautiful , or gripping , or religious , or even as sad .
the religious , spiritual side was expressed by the pretentious lying-in-state , by the pomp of flowers and palm fronds—which he knew signified heavenly peace—and also , and more to the point , by the cross between the dead fingers of what had been his grandfather , by the blessings a copy of thorvaldsen ’ s christ extended from the head of the coffin , and by two towering candelabra on either side , which on an occasion like this also took on an ecclesiastical character . the explicit and well-intended purpose of all these arrangements was apparently to show that grandfather had now passed on forever to his authentic and true form .
but they also served another purpose—one that little hans castorp likewise noted , if not admitting it to himself in so many words ; in particular , the masses of flowers and more especially the very well represented tuberoses were there for a more sobering reason—and that was to gloss over the other side of death , the one that is neither beautiful nor sad , but almost indecent in its base physicality , to make people forget it or at least not be reminded of it .
it was this aspect of death that made his dead grandfather look so strange , not really like his grandfather at all , but like a life-size wax doll that death had slipped into the coffin in his place and for which this whole solemn show was being put on . the man who lay there , or better , what lay there , was not grandfather himself , but a shell—which , as hans castorp knew , was not made of wax , but of its own material . it was just stuff , and that was what was indecent , and so not really even sad—no sadder than things that have to do with the body , and only with it , are sad .
little hans castorp gazed at the stuff out of which this life-size dead figure was made , at this waxy , yellow , smooth stuff with the consistency of cheese , gazed at the face and hands of what had been his grandfather .
and just then a fly settled on the inert forehead and began to move its proboscis up and down .
old fiete circumspectly shooed it off , though avoiding actually touching the forehead ; a shadow of respectability darkened his face , as if he should not know , and did not want to know , what he was doing—an expression of propriety , which apparently was related to grandfather ’ s being only a body and nothing more .
all the same , after a long , looping flight , the fly came to rest again on grandfather ’ s fingers , sitting up pertly very close to the ivory cross .
and while all this was going on , hans castorp thought he could smell more clearly than before those faint , but very peculiar and persistent fumes that he knew from before , and which , to his shame , always reminded him of a school chum who suffered from an offensive affliction that made everyone avoid him , the same odor that the tuberose scent was supposed to cover up on the sly , but was unable to do , for all its lovely , austere richness .
he returned several times to stand by the body : one time all alone , except for old fiete ; a second time together with his great-uncle tienappel , the wine merchant , and his two uncles james and peter ; and then a third time as well , when a group of workmen from the harbor in their sunday best stood for a few moments beside the coffin to take leave of the former head of the house of castorp and son .
then came the funeral and a dining room full of people ; dressed in his spanish ruff , pastor bugenhagen from saint michael ’ s , the man who had baptized hans castorp , performed the service , and afterward he spoke to little hans castorp in very friendly tones as they sat together in the coach , the one right behind the hearse and the first in a long , long procession . and with that , this part of hans castorp ’ s life came to an end as well , and a very short time later he changed homes and neighborhoods—for the second time now in his young life .
the change did not work to his detriment , because he moved in with consul tienappel , his legal guardian , and lacked for nothing—certainly not in any personal sense , or for that matter , as regarded the supervision of his larger interests , about which he still knew nothing .
consul tienappel , an uncle of little hans ’ s late mother , acted as executor for the castorp estate , putting the property up for sale , taking charge of liquidating the firm castorp and son , imports and exports , realizing from these transactions some four hundred thousand marks—hans castorp ’ s inheritance , which the consul then invested in gilt-edged securities . at the beginning of each quarter , he deducted from the interest earned—without any prejudice to his sense of family ties—a commission of percent . set well back from harvestehuder weg , the tienappel home was fronted by a large garden ; to the rear it looked out on a lawn where not the tiniest weed was permitted , a public promenade with roses , and beyond it , the river .
although he owned a fine coach , the consul walked to work in the old city every morning , just to get a little exercise , because he sometimes suffered from congestion of the blood in his head ; and he returned home by the same route at five each evening , when , in most civilized fashion , the tienappels sat down to dinner . he was a heavyset man who always dressed in the best english fabrics . his watery-blue eyes were bulgy behind gold-rimmed spectacles , he had a ruddy nose , a gray seaman ’ s beard , and he wore a sparkling diamond on the stubby little finger of his left hand .
his wife had been dead for years .
he had two sons , peter and james—the one in the navy and seldom at home , the other an employee in the family wine business and the designated heir of the firm .
the house had been kept for many years now by schalleen , the daughter of a goldsmith in altona , who always wore white starched ruffles at her thick , cylindrical wrists . she was responsible for laying out an extensive cold buffet at breakfast and supper : shrimp and salmon , eel , goose breast and roast beef with tomato ketchup ; she kept a vigilant eye on the extra servants hired when consul tienappel gave a formal dinner ; and she was also the person who , as best she could , acted as a mother to little hans castorp .
he grew—despite miserable weather , despite wind and fog—grew up , one might say , in his yellow mackintosh , and on the whole was a quite cheerful lad .
he was probably a little anemic from the start , or so dr. heidekind said , prescribing for him a nice daily glass of porter , to be drunk with his snack when he returned from school—a robust brew , as everyone knows , which dr. heidekind believed helped build the blood and which , however that might be , hans castorp discovered , much to his satisfaction , had a calming effect on his spirits and pleasantly assisted him in his proclivity to doze—as his uncle tienappel put it—when he would sit with his mouth slightly open , dreaming away without a single firm thought in his head .
but otherwise he was a regular , healthy lad , a passable tennis-player and oarsman , although on summer evenings , instead of manning an oar , he preferred sitting on the terrace of the uhlenhorst boathouse , a refreshing drink in hand , listening to music and watching the boats as they drifted among the swans , their lights reflected in the bright , smooth water . and if you were to hear him talking—in his nonchalant , reasonable way , his voice a little hollow and monotone , with just a hint of platt—or even if you just saw him there , so blondly correct , his hair nicely trimmed , his head with the stamp of something classic about it , his air cool and languid , suggesting an inherited , unconscious arrogance , then you could not doubt that this hans castorp was an honest , unadulterated product of the local soil , superbly at home in it—even he himself , had he ever actually considered the matter , would not have doubted it for a moment .
the atmosphere of the metropolitan seaport , the damp atmosphere of global shopkeeping and prosperity , had been the air of life itself for his forefathers , and with great gusto he breathed it now as a matter of course and found it profoundly satisfying . his nose took in the fumes of the harbor , of coal and tar , the pungent odors of the world ’ s produce piled high , and his eyes watched the huge steam cranes on the docks—so calm , wise , and monumentally strong that they looked like hardworking elephants—as they transferred tons of sacks , bales , crates , barrels , and carboys from the bowels of idle seagoing vessels to railroad cars and sheds . he watched the merchants in yellow mackintoshes , like the one he himself was wearing , as they streamed at noon toward the exchange , where things could get quite fierce , as he well knew , and someone might very suddenly be motivated to hand out invitations to a grand dinner , in hopes of prolonging his credit .
he watched—and this would later prove to be his special area of interest—the teeming dry docks , the towering , mammoth cadavers of ships that had sailed to asia and africa , but now lay braced on strutbeams thick as trees , looking monstrous and clumsy on dry land , their keels and screws naked , swarmed over by hosts of midget laborers—hammering , scouring , whitewashing . he gazed at the roofed-over slips , which were wrapped in webs of smoky fog and from which the ribs of ships under construction protruded , while engineers , blueprints and pump-charts in hand , gave orders to the workers .
from boyhood on , these were all familiar sights to hans castorp , awakening in him a warm sense of belonging , a feeling that reached its zenith , perhaps , on those occasions when he would join james tienappel or his cousin ziemssen—joachim ziemssen—in the pavilion on the alster for a sunday breakfast of warm rolls and smoked beef , washed down by a glass of old port , then lean back in his chair and puff devotedly on his cigar . for in this he was true to type : that he dearly and truly loved living well , and despite his thin-blooded , refined appearance , he clung to the cruder pleasures of life as a gluttonous baby clings to its mother ’ s breast .
the upper class of this commercial and democratic city-state bequeaths its children the burden of higher civilization , and hans castorp bore it on his shoulders with a certain easy dignity . he was bathed spotless as a baby , and he had his clothes made by a tailor who enjoyed the trust of the young men in his circle .
schalleen took splendid care of his little treasure of neatly monogrammed underwear and shirts , which were tucked away in the english-style drawers of his wardrobe . even when hans castorp left home to study , he regularly sent his things home to be laundered and mended—for it was his maxim that no one in the empire except residents of hamburg knew how to iron—and a badly creased cuff on one of his pretty pastel shirts filled him with a terrible unease .
although the shape of his hands was not particularly aristocratic , he took good care of them , keeping the skin supple and setting them off with a simple platinum band and his grandfather ’ s signet ring ; his teeth , which were rather soft and subject to damage , had been repaired with gold inlays .
both when standing and walking , he thrust his lower body forward somewhat , which left the impression of a certain slackness ; but his posture at the dinner table was excellent . he would politely turn his erect upper body toward his neighbor for small talk ( always reasonable , with a hint of platt ) , would rest his elbows easily at his sides when cutting a piece of fowl or deftly extracting the pink meat of a lobster claw with the appropriate utensils . when a meal was over , his first requirement was a finger bowl of perfumed water , his second a russian cigarette , on which he paid no customs duties , since he had found a way to obtain them with a few well-placed , casual bribes .
this was a prelude to his cigar , a maria mancini , a very tasty brand from bremen—we shall come to speak about that again—whose spicy toxins blended so satisfyingly with those of his coffee .
hans castorp kept his tobacco away from the deleterious effects of the house ’ s steam heat by storing it in the cellar , and every morning he would descend to provide his cigar case with its daily ration . only reluctantly would he have eaten butter served in pats rather than in fluted little balls . as is apparent , we are attempting to include anything that can be said in hans castorp ’ s favor , and we offer our judgments without exaggeration , intending to make him no better or worse than he was .
hans castorp was neither a genius nor an idiot , and if we refrain from applying the word mediocre to him , we do so for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with his intelligence and little or nothing to do with his prosaic personality , but rather out of deference to his fate , to which we are inclined to attribute a more general significance . he was bright enough to meet the demands of a modern secondary school without overtaxing himself ; in fact , under no conceivable circumstances would he have been willing to do that , no matter what the goal—not so much out of fear that it might be painful as because he saw absolutely no reason why he should , or to put it better : no unequivocal reason . but perhaps that is why we do not call him mediocre—precisely because he felt that in some way or other such an unequivocal reason was lacking .
a human being lives out not only his personal life as an individual , but also , consciously or subconsciously , the lives of his epoch and contemporaries ; and although he may regard the general and impersonal foundations of his existence as unequivocal givens and take them for granted , having as little intention of ever subjecting them to critique as our good hans castorp himself had , it is nevertheless quite possible that he senses his own moral well-being to be somehow impaired by the lack of critique .
all sorts of personal goals , purposes , hopes , prospects may float before the eyes of a given individual , from which he may then glean the impulse for exerting himself for great deeds ; if the impersonal world around him , however , if the times themselves , despite all their hustle and bustle , provide him with neither hopes nor prospects , if they secretly supply him with evidence that things are in fact hopeless , without prospect or remedy , if the times respond with hollow silence to every conscious or subconscious question , however it may be posed , about the ultimate , unequivocal meaning of all exertions and deeds that are more than exclusively personal—then it is almost inevitable , particularly if the person involved is a more honest sort , that the situation will have a crippling effect , which , following moral and spiritual paths , may even spread to that individual ’ s physical and organic life . for a person to be disposed to more significant deeds that go beyond what is simply required of him—even when his own times may provide no satisfactory answer to the question of why—he needs either a rare , heroic personality that exists in a kind of moral isolation and immediacy , or one characterized by exceptionally robust vitality . neither the former nor the latter was the case with hans castorp , and so he probably was mediocre after all , though in a very honorable sense of that word .
in saying this , we are speaking here of the young man ’ s innermost state not only during his years in school , but also during the period that followed , when he had already chosen his profession .
as to his career at school , he did indeed have to repeat a class or two .
but for the most part , his background , his urbane manners , and ultimately a pretty , if rather dispassionate talent for mathematics helped him move ahead ; and after receiving his report card in his freshman year , he concluded he would finish school—primarily , truth to tell , because that allowed him to extend a familiar , provisional , indecisive state of affairs and to win time for reflection as to what hans castorp would most like to do , because he was not even close to deciding that , not even as a senior , and when it finally was decided ( to say he decided would be saying almost too much ) , he was quite aware that the decision could just as easily have been otherwise .
but this much was true—he had always taken great delight in ships .
as a small boy he had filled his notebooks with penciled drawings of fishing cutters , vegetable barges , and five-masters .
and when at age fifteen he had the chance to watch from a front-row seat as the hansa , a new double-screw mail-steamer , was launched from the docks of blohm and voss , he painted a strikingly good watercolor of the trim ship , exact down to almost the last detail , which consul tienappel had hung in his private office . and he had so lovingly and deftly captured the transparent , glassy-green , rolling sea that someone had said to consul tienappel that the lad had talent and would make a good painter of seascapes—a pronouncement that the consul had no qualms repeating to his ward , because hans castorp simply laughed amiably at the idea and gave not a moment ’ s thought to a life of eccentricity and starving for art .
you don ’ t have much , his uncle tienappel would remind him .
james and peter will get the lion ’ s share of my money , that is to say , it stays in the business and peter will draw an annuity .
what belongs to you is invested quite nicely and will yield a secure return .
but it ’ s no fun nowadays trying to live off interest unless one has at least five times as much as you have , and if you fancy living a nice life here in the city , like the one to which you ’ re accustomed , then you ’ ll have to earn a tidy sum yourself—take note of that , my boy .
hans castorp took note and looked around for a profession in which he could prove himself—both to himself and others .
but he thought quite highly of his profession once he had chosen it—at the suggestion of old wilms , of the firm of tunder and wilms , who said to consul tienappel over a game of whist one sunday evening that hans castorp should study shipbuilding , that was the ticket , and join his firm , where he would certainly keep his eye on him .
although damned complicated and demanding , it was nevertheless an excellent , important , splendid profession and far preferable , given his peaceable nature at any rate , to that of his cousin ziemssen , who was the son of his late mother ’ s half sister and determined to become an officer .
joachim ziemssen wasn ’ t exactly strong in the lungs , of course , but that was precisely the reason why a profession in the open air , one that could hardly be said to involve serious brainwork or stress , was probably just the thing for him—as hans castorp had remarked rather patronizingly .
for he had the greatest respect for work , although , for his part , he found that he did tire easily .
which brings us back to our previous suggestion , which proposed that the damage inflicted by the times on someone ’ s personal life can have a direct influence on that person ’ s physical organism . how could hans castorp not have held work in high esteem ?
that would have been unnatural .
as things stood , work had to be regarded as unconditionally the most estimable thing in the world—ultimately there was nothing one could esteem more , it was the principle by which one stood or fell , the absolute of the age , the answer , so to speak , to its own question .
his respect for work was , in its way , religious and , so far as he knew , unquestioning .
but it was another matter to love it . and as much as he respected it , he could not love it—for one simple reason : it did not agree with him .
the exertion of hard work was a strain on his nerves , tiring him quickly , and he quite candidly admitted that he much preferred his leisure—when time passed easily , unencumbered by the leaden weight of toil , and lay open before you , instead of being divided into a series of hurdles that you had to grit your teeth and take . strictly speaking , the contradictions in his attitude toward work needed to be resolved . if he had been able to believe at the foundations of his soul ( there where he himself did not know what was what ) that work has unconditional value , is a principle that answers its own question , might not both body and mind—first his mind , and through it , his body—have been more amenable to work and exhibited more stamina ?
which brings us back to our previous question about his mediocrity or more-than-mediocrity , to which we do not wish to give a conclusive answer .
for we do not see ourselves as hans castorp ’ s eulogist and want to leave room for the suggestion that , for him , work was simply something that stood in the way of the unencumbered enjoyment of a maria mancini .
he was not attracted to military service himself .
something deep within him resisted the idea , and he knew how to avoid it .
it may also be that dr. eberding , the staff surgeon , who was a regular on harvestehuder weg , had heard in casual conversation with consul tienappel that young castorp , having just left for the university , would regard being forced to bear arms as a serious disruption in his studies .
his brain , which worked calmly and slowly—particularly since hans castorp retained the habit of drinking porter with his morning snack—gradually filled up with analytical geometry , differential equations , mechanics , projective geometry , and graphical statics .
he calculated displacements—with full cargo and empty—stabilities , shifts in trim , and metacenters , though it was drudgery at times . his technical drawings , all the sketches of ribbing , waterlines , and full-length projections , were not quite as good as his watercolor depiction of the hansa on the high sea , but when the abstract graphics required the sensual addition of a wash for shading or lively colors for various materials in a cross section , hans castorp proved more skillful than most .
when he came home on vacations—very neat , very well dressed , sporting a little reddish-blond moustache in the middle of his sleepy , young , patrician face , looking for all the world like a young man on his way to a respectable place in life—the people who concerned themselves with the affairs of the community , who kept themselves well informed about various families and the staffing of municipal offices ( and that means most people in a self-governing city-state ) , his fellow citizens , then , looked him over and asked themselves what public role young castorp might one day grow into .
he had tradition behind him , his was a good , old name , and it was almost inevitable that someday he would have to be reckoned with as a political factor .
by then he would be sitting in the assembly or on the committee of burghers , making laws , would hold an honorable post where he would participate in the concerns of government , as an administrator , perhaps as director of the finance or building committees .
his voice would be listened to and his vote would count .
people were curious about which party young castorp would one day embrace .
appearances were deceiving , but he looked exactly like someone democrats would not be able to count on , and the resemblance to his grandfather was undeniable .
perhaps he would take after him , become a conservative , a brake on other elements .
that was quite possible—but so was the opposite .
for he was an engineer after all , a shipbuilder in the making , a man of global commerce and technology .
so that it might well be that hans castorp would join up with the radicals , turn out to be a go-getter , a profane destroyer of old buildings and beautiful landscapes , as footloose as a jew , as irreverent as an american , a man likely to prefer a ruthless break with venerable traditions to cautious development of natural resources , a man who would plunge the state into reckless experiments—that was conceivable , too .
was it in his blood to regard their excellencies , the men for whom the sentries at the town hall presented arms , as elders who knew best—or would he be inclined to support the opposition in the assembly ?
his curious fellow citizens could find no answer to such questions in those blue eyes under their reddish-blond brows ; and hans castorp , being an unwritten page , would probably have had no answer , either .
when he set out on the journey where we met him , he was twenty-three years old . he had four semesters of study at danzig polytechnic behind him , plus four more spent at technical colleges in braunschweig and karlsruhe , had recently put his first final exams behind him , passing them with no trouble , though without fanfare or drum roll , and was about to join the firm of tunder and wilms as an unsalaried engineer-in-training in order to gain practical experience on the docks .
and at that point , his life took the following turn .
his exams had meant a long period of concentrated work , and upon returning home he looked paler than he ought—even given his general type .
dr. heidekind scolded whenever he saw him and insisted on a change of air , and he meant a radical change . norderney or wyk on the island of föhr , he said , would not do it this time , and if you were to ask him , what hans castorp needed was a few weeks in the alps before going to work on the docks . that was fine , consul tienappel told his nephew and ward , but then their paths would have to part for the summer , because wild horses couldn ’ t drag him , consul tienappel , to the alps .
that was not for him , he required sensible barometric pressure or he would have another attack . hans castorp could go right ahead and take a trip to the alps . why not pay joachim ziemssen a visit ?
that was a logical suggestion . joachim ziemssen was ill in fact—not ill like hans castorp , but really , dangerously ill , had even given them all quite a scare .
he had always been susceptible to bronchitis and fevers , and then one day he actually coughed up red , and joachim was shipped off posthaste to davos—much to his great regret and dismay , because he was very close to seeing his ambition fulfilled . bowing to the will of his family , he had first spent a couple of semesters studying law , but then , following an irresistible urge , he had changed horses and volunteered as an ensign , and had been accepted .
and for the last five months he had been sitting in the international sanatorium berghof ( dr. behrens , supervising physician ) , and was bored half to death , as he wrote in a postcard .
and so if hans castorp was to treat himself to a little vacation before taking up his job with tunder and wilms , nothing could be more sensible than to provide his poor cousin with company up there in the mountains—it was the most pleasant solution for both parties .
it was the height of summer when he decided to take the trip—already the last week of july . he planned to stay three weeks .
hans castorp had been afraid he would oversleep , he had been so thoroughly exhausted , but he was up and about earlier than necessary and had plenty of time leisurely to pursue his usual , highly civilized morning routine—its chief utensils included a rubber basin , a wooden bowl of green , lavender-scented soap , and a straw-colored brush—and was able not only to tend to matters of personal hygiene but also to unpack and put his things away . and as he passed the silver-plated blade across the perfumed foam on his cheeks , he recalled his muddled dreams and smiled an indulgent smile at such nonsense , shaking his head with the superiority of a man shaving by the light of reasonable day .
he did not feel all that well rested , but fresh enough to meet the morning .
he powdered his cheeks and slipped into his plaid undershorts and red morocco-leather slippers , and still drying his hands , he stepped out onto the balcony , which , although private , was connected to those adjoining and separated from them only by an opaque glass partition that extended almost to the railing .
the morning was cool and cloudy .
long banks of fog lay motionless along the hills to both sides , while masses of clouds , white and gray , were draped on the more distant mountains .
patches and streaks of blue sky were visible here and there , and when a ray of sun broke through , the village in the valley below glistened white against the dark forests of pine on the slopes .
somewhere morning music was playing ; presumably it came from the same hotel where the concert had been held the evening before .
muted chords of a chorale drifted toward him ; a march followed after a brief pause .
hans castorp loved music with all his heart , its effect being much like that of the porter he drank with his morning snack—profoundly calming , numbing , and doze-inducing—and he listened now with pleasure , his head tilted to one side , mouth open , eyes slightly bloodshot .
he looked down at the winding road they had followed up to the sanatorium the evening before .
short-stemmed , starlike gentians were blooming in the moist grass of the slope .
next to a metal-roofed arcade , open to the south and filled with lounge chairs , stood a flagpole , painted reddish brown and displaying a banner that fluttered full now and then—a fantasy flag , green and white , with a snake-entwined caduceus , the symbol of healing , at its center .
a woman was walking in the garden , an older lady with a gloomy , even tragic look .
clad completely in black , with a black veil wound round her disheveled grayish-black hair , she wandered restlessly along the paths , keeping an even but quick pace , her knees slightly bent , her arms hanging stiffly at an angle in front of her .
her aging face , with its pale mediterranean complexion and large , careworn mouth turned down at one corner , reminded hans castorp of a picture he had once seen of a famous tragedian ; and it was eerie to watch how this pale woman dressed in black matched her long , somber strides , apparently without realizing it , to the rhythm of march music in the distance .
hans castorp gazed down at her in thoughtful sympathy , and it seemed as if her sad appearance darkened the morning sun .
simultaneously , however , he perceived something else , something audible , coming from the adjoining room on his left , the room with the russian couple , so joachim had said—noises that were likewise ill suited to this cheerful , fresh morning , that tainted it , making it seem sultry somehow .
giggles , gasps , grapplings—there was no disguising the indelicate nature of the sound , although in his kindheartedness the young man at first tried hard to give it a harmless interpretation . one could use other terms for his kindheartedness—an insipid phrase like purity of soul , for instance , or a more serious and beautiful word like modesty , or disparaging words such as avoidance of the truth and hypocrisy , or even a phrase about the mystic piety of shyness—and hans castorp ’ s reaction to the sounds from the adjoining room combined something of them all and was visible now as a shadow of respectability that darkened his face , as if he should not know and did not want to know anything about what he heard there .
and with this look on his face he returned to his room to avoid having to listen any longer to the proceedings , which despite the giggles sounded terribly serious , disconcertingly so . but the events on the far side of the wall were even more audible from his room . an apparent chase around the furniture , the crash of an upturned chair , a grab , an embrace , slaps and kisses—and then , of all things to accompany the invisible scene , a waltz was struck up in the distance , the tired melody of a popular ballad .
hans castorp stood , towel in hand , and listened against his best intentions .
and suddenly a blush rose up under his talcum , because what he had clearly seen coming had now arrived , and beyond any doubt , the game had turned bestial .
he thought , turning away to finish dressing with as much noise as he could manage .
well , they ’ re married , for heaven ’ s sake , that ’ s as it should be at least .
but in broad daylight , that is a bit much .
after all , they are ill , that ’ s why they ’ re here , or one of them is at least , and a little self-control wouldn ’ t be out of place .
but of course , he realized angrily , the real scandal is that the walls are so thin and that you can hear everything so clearly , and that ’ s simply intolerable !
i wonder if i shall see these people later , or even be introduced to them ?
but now hans castorp realized to his amazement that the flush that had come to his freshly shaven cheeks had not subsided , or at least the warmth that had come with it was not about to depart—the same hot , dry face that had bothered him yesterday evening , and that had disappeared while he slept , was back now in full force . this did not make him feel any friendlier toward the married couple next door , indeed he pouted his lips and muttered something very disparaging about them ; and now he made the mistake of splashing his face with water again to cool it , which only made matters worse .
and so he was feeling cross and at loose ends when he heard his cousin knock on the wall and call out to him . his expression , as joachim entered the room , was not that of a man refreshed by sleep and ready to greet the morning .
so that was your first night up here .
are you well satisfied ? he was ready for a walk , dressed in sporty clothes and sturdy , tooled boots , his ulster flung over his arm , the outline of the flat bottle clearly visible in one pocket .
he wasn ’ t wearing a hat today , either .
thanks , hans castorp replied , well enough .
who was the woman in black out in the garden ?
joachim knew at once whom he meant .
that ’ s what we all call her at least , because those are the only words you ever hear out of her .
she ’ s mexican , you see , and knows not a word of german and almost no french , either , just a few scraps .
she ’ s been here with her eldest son for five weeks now , a perfectly hopeless case , who ’ ll be making his exit soon enough—it ’ s all through him , his whole body ’ s poisoned with it , you could say , and at that stage it looks a lot like typhoid fever , behrens says—gruesome for all involved , at any rate .
and two weeks ago , now , her second son arrived up here , because he wanted to see his brother one last time—handsome young fellow , by the way , but then so is the other—both of them pretty as pictures , with those glowing eyes that drive the ladies crazy . well , the younger one already had a little bit of a cough down below , but was otherwise in quite good shape .
and no sooner does he arrive than he has a temperature—and i mean a high fever , a hundred and three right away—he takes to his bed , and if he ever gets up again , behrens says , he ’ ll have more luck than sense .
but in any case , it was high time , and then some , for him to come up here . yes , and since then the mother just wanders about , when she ’ s not sitting with them , and the only thing she ever says to anyone she meets is : tous les deux ! because that ’ s all she knows how to say , and there ’ s no one here who understands spanish .
so that ’ s her problem , hans castorp said .
i wonder if she ’ ll say the same thing to me when i get to know her ?
that would be so strange—i mean , it would be comical and weird at the same time , he said , and his eyes took on yesterday ’ s look—seemed too hot and heavy , as if he had been weeping for a long time , and shone with the same glint that the austrian horseman ’ s novel cough had enkindled in them .
in fact , he felt as if he had only just now reestablished a connection with yesterday , as if he were taking in the whole picture again , as it were , which had not really been the case since he awoke .
he was ready , by the way , he declared , shaking a few drops of lavender water on his handkerchief so that he could dab at his brow and under his eyes .
if it ’ s all right with you , we can go to breakfast—tous les deux , he added as a joke , in a burst of high spirits .
joachim cast him a gentle glance and smiled a curious smile—melancholy and slightly mocking , it seemed—but why , he kept to himself .
after making sure that he had cigars to smoke , hans castorp picked up his walking stick , coat , and hat—the last out of obstinacy , because he was all too definite in his own civilized habits to change them lightly and adopt strange new ones for a mere three weeks . and so they left , taking the stairs , and as they passed one door or another , joachim would name its occupant—german names , but also all sorts of odd-sounding ones—adding brief remarks about the person ’ s character and the severity of the case .
they also met people already returning from breakfast , and whenever joachim said good morning to anyone , hans castorp would politely tip his hat .
he was tense and nervous , like a young man about to introduce himself to a host of strangers , all the while plagued by the distinct feeling that his eyes and face are red—which was only partly true , because he was actually rather pale .
before i forget , he suddenly said rather impulsively , you can go ahead and introduce me to the lady in the garden if we happen to meet her , i have no objections .
she can repeat her tous les deux ’ to me , it won ’ t matter . i ’ m ready for it now and understand what it means and will know how to put on the proper face .
but i don ’ t want to make the acquaintance of the russian couple , do you hear ?
i definitely don ’ t want that .
they are people devoid of all manners , and although i am going to have to live next door to them for three weeks because there was no other way to arrange things , i do not wish to know them .
yes , just him , joachim said , obviously preoccupied .
did they disturb you all that much ? yes , they are barbarians , so to speak—uncivilized , to put a word on it—i did warn you . he always comes to meals in a leather jacket—quite shabby , let me tell you .
and she ’ s not all that well groomed herself , despite the plumed hat .
but in any case , you needn ’ t worry , they sit a good distance away , at the bad russian table—because there ’ s also a good russian table , where the more refined russians sit . so there ’ s hardly any possibility you ’ d meet them , even if you wanted to .
it ’ s not at all easy to make acquaintances here , if only because there are so many foreigners among the guests .
i personally have got to know only a few myself in all my months here .
which of them is ill ?
he is , i think .
they hung their coats on the stands outside the dining hall , and entered it , a bright , low-vaulted room , where voices buzzed , dishes clattered , and dining attendants scurried about with steaming pots of coffee .
there were seven tables in the dining hall , five placed lengthwise , only two crosswise .
they took only a few steps diagonally across the room , and hans castorp found that he was already at the place set for him , at the end of the middle table toward the front of the room , halfway between the two crosswise tables .
standing erect behind his chair , hans castorp bowed stiffly and cordially to his tablemates as joachim formally introduced them , although he barely looked at them , let alone made a conscious note of their names .
the only face and name he put together was frau stöhr , noticing her red face and oily , ash-blond hair , and an expression of such willful ignorance that it was easy to believe her guilty of howling gaffes .
there were pots of marmalade and honey , bowls of oatmeal and creamed rice , plates of scrambled eggs and cold meats ; they had been generous with the butter . someone lifted the glass bell from a soft swiss cheese and cut off a piece ; what was more , a bowl of fruit , both fresh and dried , stood in the middle of the table .
a dining attendant in black and white asked hans castorp what he wanted to drink—cocoa , coffee , or tea ?
she was as small as a child , with an old , long face—a dwarf , he realized with a shock .
he looked at his cousin , who merely shrugged and lifted an eyebrow as if to say , right , what else is new ?
and so hans castorp simply accepted the fact and , since it was a dwarf , asked for his tea with special courtesy .
he began with some creamed rice topped with sugar and cinnamon , meanwhile letting his eyes wander over the other items he intended to sample and across the seven tables of assembled guests—joachim ’ s colleagues , his companions in misfortune , all with the same illness deep inside , all chatting and breakfasting . the room was done in the kind of modern decor that combines the most efficient simplicity with just a dash of fantasy .
it was not deep in relation to its width , and on all four sides was a kind of passageway where the sideboards stood and that opened as a series of arches onto the central dining area .
its columns were paneled with a sandalwood finish , but only partway up ; the top of each was painted white , like the upper half of the walls and the ceiling , but colorfully trimmed with simple , cheerful stenciled stripes , which then continued along the broad arches of the low ceiling . the hall was also decorated with several shiny brass chandeliers , all electric , each a series of three stacked rings joined by delicate filigree , with bells of milk glass set like little moons on the lowest circle .
there were four glass doors—two on the long wall opposite , opening onto a veranda outside ; a third up front to the left , leading directly into the front lobby ; and finally the one through which hans castorp had entered and that opened off a different hallway , because joachim had not used the same set of stairs as the night before .
to his right was a homely creature in black , with a dull , flushed complexion and fuzzy cheeks ; he took her to be a seamstress or dressmaker , chiefly because her breakfast consisted of nothing but coffee and buttered rolls—and for some reason he had always associated dressmakers with coffee and buttered rolls .
on his left sat an english maiden lady—likewise well on in years , very ugly , with skinny , frigid fingers , who was drinking tea the color of blood and reading letters from home , written in a full , rounded hand .
next to her came joachim , and then frau stöhr in a scotchplaid woolen blouse . she kept the balled fist of her left hand pressed to her cheek while she ate and took obvious pains to make a refined impression when she talked , primarily by pulling her upper lip back to expose her long , narrow , rabbitlike teeth .
a young man with a sparse moustache and an expression on his face as if he had something foul-tasting in his mouth sat down next to her and ate his breakfast in total silence . hans castorp had already taken his seat when the fellow entered , his chin sunk against his chest as he walked , and took his place without a glance at anyone , showing by his demeanor that he absolutely did not wish to be introduced to the new guest .
perhaps he was too ill to value or see any point in mere formalities , or even to take any interest in his surroundings .
seated across from him , very briefly , was an extraordinarily gaunt , very blond young woman , who emptied a bottle of yogurt onto her plate , spooned down this dairy product , and promptly departed .
the table conversation was not exactly lively .
joachim chatted politely with frau stöhr , inquiring after her health and expressing gentlemanly regrets that it left something to be desired .
she complained of her listlessness .
degrees when she got up , and what would it be by afternoon ? the dressmaker admitted to a temperature equally as high , but declared the effect was just the opposite with her , that she felt quite excitable , nervous and restless inside , as if some special , decisive event were about to happen , which was not the case at all , this being simply a physical excitation with no psychological basis . she was probably not a dressmaker after all , because she spoke correctly , almost pedantically .
all the same , hans castorp found her excitability , or at least her discussion of it , somehow inappropriate , almost indecent for such a nondescript , insignificant creature . he asked them , first the dressmaker and then frau stöhr , how long they had been up here—the former had been a resident for five months , the latter for seven ; he marshaled his english to ask his neighbor on the left what sort of tea that was she was drinking—rose-hip , he learned—and whether it tasted good , to which she responded almost stormily in the affirmative . he now gazed out across the room where people were coming and going : early breakfast was not a strictly communal affair .
he had been a little afraid of the dreadful effect all this might have on him , but found himself disappointed in that—the dining hall atmosphere was quite congenial , one had no sense of being in a place of misery .
well-tanned young people of both sexes entered humming a tune , spoke with the dining attendants , and weighed into breakfast with a robust appetite .
there were more mature people as well , married couples , a whole family with children , including teenage boys , all speaking russian .
almost all the women wore close-fitting jackets of wool or silk , called sweaters , in white or bright colors , with shawl collars and side pockets ; it looked very pretty when they just stood there chatting , both hands buried in their sweater pockets .
photographs were passed around at several tables—recent shots they had taken themselves , no doubt ; at one table they were trading postage stamps .
the talk was of the weather , of how one had slept and what one ’ s oral measurement had been that morning .
most of them were cheerful—for no particular reason presumably , but simply because they had no immediate cares and were assembled in considerable numbers .
a few people , to be sure , sat at the table with heads propped in their hands , staring straight ahead .
people let them stare and paid them no attention .
a door , the one to his left that led to the lobby , had banged shut—someone had simply let it slam , or perhaps even slammed it intentionally , and that was a noise that hans castorp absolutely could not tolerate , he had always hated it .
perhaps it was a learned dislike , perhaps an inborn idiosyncrasy—whatever it was , he abhorred banging doors and could have slapped anyone guilty of slamming one within earshot .
in this case , the door was divided into little glass panes , which only heightened the shock : it was a bang and a rattle .
damn it , hans castorp thought angrily , what kind of sloppiness is that ?
since the seamstress had said something to him at the same moment , he had no chance to determine who the malefactor was . but as he answered the seamstress , there were deep furrows between his blond eyebrows and his face was wrenched with distress .
joachim asked whether the doctors had been through yet .
yes , they had been there once already , someone replied , but had left the dining hall at almost the same moment the cousins arrived . then they might as well not wait , joachim said .
there would be an opportunity in the course of the day to make the introductions .
but at the door they almost collided with director behrens , who came striding through it at high speed , followed by dr. krokowski .
that could have meant some badly trodden corns for all parties .
he spoke with a strong lower saxon accent , chewing his words broadly .
so , you ’ re the fellow , he said to hans castorp , after joachim clicked his heels together and made the introductions .
and he extended a hand as big as a shovel .
he was a bony man , a good three heads taller than dr. krokowski , with a shock of white hair ; his neck vertebrae stuck out , and his watery , bloodshot blue eyes protruded ; he had a snub nose above a little short-cropped moustache , which sat slightly askew because his upper lip was turned up at one corner .
what joachim had said about his cheeks proved to be the absolute truth—they were purple , making his head look that much more colorful against his belted , white surgical smock , which fell just below the knees , revealing striped trousers and colossal feet in a pair of yellow , rather worn , laced boots . dr. krokowski was in professional uniform as well , except that his smock was more shirtlike , with elastic at the wrists , and of a black , shiny fabric that only emphasized his pallor .
he played the role of the perfect assistant , taking no part whatever in the exchanged greetings—although the tense , critical way he held his mouth suggested that he found his subordinate position a little absurd . the director asked , gesturing with his hand , pointing now at one , now at the other , and looking down out of bloodshot blue eyes .
well , is he going to march to the pipe and drum like you ?
he asked joachim , nodding his head toward hans castorp .
ha , god forbid—right ? i spotted it at once . and now he spoke directly to hans castorp : there ’ s something so civilian , so comfortable about you—no rattling sabers like our corporal here .
you would be a better patient than he , i ’ d lay odds on that .
i can tell right off whether someone will make a competent patient or not , because that takes talent , everything takes talent , and this myrmidon here hasn ’ t the least talent for it .
for military drill , maybe , i can ’ t say as to that , but none for being ill. he constantly wants to leave , can you believe it ?
forever asking to leave , pesters and badgers me and simply can ’ t wait to live a life of drudgery down below .
won ’ t give us six months of his time .
well , your good cousin will know better how to appreciate us , he ’ ll be able to amuse himself .
there ’ s no shortage of ladies—we have the most adorable ladies here .
many of them quite picturesque—viewed externally , at least . but you ’ ll have to improve your color somewhat , too , otherwise the ladies will give you the cold shoulder .
the golden tree of life is green , true , but a green face is really not quite the thing .
totally anemic , of course , he said , and mechanically stepped up to hans castorp , extended two fingers , and pulled an eyelid down . no doubt of it , totally anemic , just as i said .
it was not all that stupid of you to leave your hamburg to fend for itself for a while .
but if i might use this opportunity to give you some modest advice—quite sine pecunia , of course—as long as you ’ re here with us , why don ’ t you do just what your cousin does ? in a case like yours , there ’ s no wiser course than to live for a while as if it were a slight tuberculosis pulmonum , and build up your protein a little . it ’ s very curious , you see , the way protein is metabolized up here .
but now , do get on with your promenade ! but no more than half an hour .
and make sure you stick the old mercury cigar in your mouth afterward . and always jot down the results , right , ziemssen ? conscientiously doing one ’ s duty .
i ’ ll want to see your chart come saturday .
and your good cousin should measure , too .
have a good time . and dr. krokowski joined him as he sailed off , swinging his arms , palms turned clear around to the back , tossing his question right and left as to whether people had slept well , which was universally answered in the affirmative .
very nice man , hans castorp said as they walked out the front door , with a friendly nod to the limping concierge , who was sitting in his office sorting letters .
the main door was on the southeast side of the large white building , whose middle section rose one story higher than the two wings and was crowned by a clock tower roofed with slate-colored sheet iron .
leaving the building by this exit , you did not approach the garden , but came out facing directly onto an open slope of mountain meadows , dotted with a few tallish firs and several low mountain pines that hugged the ground . the path they took—actually it was the only one available other than the main road that descended to the valley—led them gently up the rise to their left , past the rear of the sanatorium , where the kitchens and offices were located and steel garbage cans lined the railing beside the cellar stairs , and held to that direction for a good distance , then made a sharp hairpin to the right and began a steeper ascent up the sparsely wooded hill .
it was a firm earthen path , reddish in color and a little damp , with boulders here and there along the edge .
the cousins quickly learned that they were not alone on their walk . guests who had finished breakfast shortly after them followed on their heels , and coming toward them were whole groups of people on their way back , stomping the way people tend to do walking downhill .
very nice man , hans castorp repeated .
has such an easy way with words , it ’ s fun just to listen to him .
but i ’ m going to light a real one now , he said , coming to a halt . i can ’ t stand it any longer .
i ’ ve not had a decent smoke since yesterday noon .
excuse me a moment .
and from a buff leather etui monogrammed in silver , he extracted one of his maria mancinis—a lovely specimen from the top of the box , flattened on just one side the way he especially liked it—trimmed the tip squarely with a small tool that hung from his watch chain , produced a flame from his pocket lighter , and after a bit of concentrated puffing managed to light the rather long , blunt-ended cigar .
now we can get on with our promenade , for all i care .
i ’ ve never smoked , joachim replied . why should i start up here , of all places ?
i don ’ t understand , hans castorp said .
i don ’ t understand how someone can not be a smoker—why it ’ s like robbing oneself of the best part of life , so to speak , or at least of an absolutely first-rate pleasure . when i wake up i look forward to being able to smoke all day , and when i eat , i look forward to it again , in fact i can honestly say that i actually only eat so that i can smoke , although that ’ s an exaggeration , of course .
but a day without tobacco—that would be absolutely insipid , a dull , totally wasted day . and if some morning i had to tell myself : there ’ s nothing left to smoke today , why i don ’ t think i ’ d find courage to get up , i swear i ’ d stay in bed .
you see , if a man has a cigar that burns well—and obviously it can ’ t have any breaks or draw badly , that ’ s really terribly annoying—what i ’ m saying is , that if a man has a good cigar , then he ’ s home safe , nothing , literally nothing , can happen to him .
it ’ s the same as when you ’ re lying on the beach , because there you lie on the beach , you know ? and you don ’ t need anything else—no work , no other amusements . thank god , people smoke all over the world , there ’ s nowhere you could possibly end up , as far as i know , where tobacco ’ s unknown .
even polar explorers lay in a good supply of smokes to get them over their hardships—that ’ s always struck a sympathetic chord in me whenever i ’ ve read about it .
all the same , it ’ s a sign of a rather weak will , joachim said , to be so dependent on tobacco . behrens is quite right—you ’ re a civilian .
he meant it more in praise , to be sure , but you are an incurable civilian , that ’ s the point .
and besides , you ’ re healthy and can do what you like , he said , and a weary look came into his eyes .
yes , healthy except for anemia , hans castorp said .
that was a bit much , though , when he told me that i look green .
but he ’ s right , it ’ s even obvious to me that in comparison to you folks up here i ’ m downright green—whereas i never really noticed it at home .
and that really was very nice of him to just go ahead and offer some advice , quite sine pecunia as he put it .
i ’ ll be happy to do as he says , and i hereby resolve to adapt my habits to yours—what else can i do as long as i ’ m up here with all of you ?
and it can ’ t hurt me , for heaven ’ s sake , to build up my protein , although that does sound disgusting , you must admit . joachim coughed a couple of times as they walked—the climb was taxing for him , it seemed .
when he started coughing a third time , he stopped and scowled .
go on ahead , he said .
hans castorp first hurried on without looking back .
then he slowed his pace and almost came to a stop , assuming that by now he had a considerable lead on joachim .
but he did not look back .
a party of guests of both sexes was coming toward him—he had noticed them moving along a level stretch of path about halfway up the slope , and now they were tramping downhill , moving directly toward him , and he could hear the babble of voices .
there were six or seven people of various ages , from very young things to a few who were somewhat further along in years . still thinking about joachim , he tilted his head and looked them over . they were all bareheaded and tanned , the ladies in colorful sweaters , the gentlemen without overcoats for the most part , even without walking sticks—they looked as if they had just stepped out the door for a breath of air , hands in their pockets .
since walking downhill is not a matter of strenuous exertion but more a sport , where you brace your legs and apply the brakes to keep from tripping or running—nothing more than helping yourself fall , really—there was a kind of nimble frivolity to their gait , which spread even to their faces , until the whole effect might very well have made you want to join their party . they were just ahead of him now , and hans castorp took a close look at their faces .
they were not all tanned , two of the ladies were conspicuously pale : the one thin as a rail , with an ivory complexion ; the other shorter and plump , her face blemished by moles and freckles . they all looked at him , all smiling the same cheeky smile .
a tall young girl in a green sweater , her hair in untidy disarray and with doltish , half-closed eyes , brushed past hans castorp , so close that she almost touched him with her arm .
she whistled at him , but not with her mouth ; her lips weren ’ t puckered at all , were tightly closed in fact .
an extraordinarily unpleasant whistle , harsh , intense , and yet somehow hollow , an extended tone , emerging inexplicably from somewhere in her chest and falling off toward the end—it reminded him of the music you get from those inflatable rubber pigs you buy at a carnival , the way they wail mournfully when you squeeze the air out .
and then she and the rest of her party had moved on . hans castorp stood there aghast , staring straight ahead .
then he quickly turned around and decided that the horrid sound must have been a joke , a prearranged prank—that much at least was clear now , because as they moved off he saw their shoulders jiggling with laughter , and one stocky lad with thick lips , his hands stuck in his pants pockets , hitching his jacket up in a rather unbecoming way , blatantly turned to look back—and laughed . joachim had caught up by now . he greeted the party in his usual chivalrous way , bowing and clicking his heels , almost standing at attention , and there was a gentle look in his eye as he joined his cousin .
the whistle came from inside , and all the while she stared at him , with her doltish , half-closed eyes .
she whistled from her stomach as she passed me by .
would you kindly explain that to me ?
oh , joachim said , laughing dismissively .
that was the kleefeld girl , hermine kleefeld , who can whistle with her pneumothorax .
he was terribly agitated , but he didn ’ t quite know in what sense .
wavering between laughter and tears , he added , you can ’ t expect me to understand your jargon .
let ’ s move on , joachim said .
i can just as easily explain it while we walk .
as you might guess , it has to do with surgery , an operation that they perform up here .
behrens is quite an expert at it .
when one lung has been badly ravaged , you see , but the other is healthy or relatively healthy , the infected one is relieved of its duties for a while , given a rest .
which means that they make an incision here , somewhere along the side here—i don ’ t know precisely where they cut , but behrens has it down perfectly .
and then they let gas in , nitrogen , you see , and that way the caseated lobes of the lung are put out of commission .
the gas doesn ’ t last that long , of course , and has to be replaced twice a month or so—they more or less pump you up , that ’ s how you have to picture it .
and after they ’ ve done that for a year or so , if all goes well , the lung will have rested long enough to heal .
not always , of course , it ’ s really rather risky business .
but they say they ’ ve had some nice successes with their pneumothorax .
all the people you just saw have had it done .
frau iltis was with them—the one with the freckles—and fräulein levi , the skinny one , if you recall—she was confined to bed for a long time .
they ’ ve formed a group—something like pneumothorax brings people together , naturally—and call themselves the half-lung club , that ’ s the name everyone knows them by . but the pride of the club is hermine kleefeld , because she can whistle with her pneumothorax—it ’ s her special talent , it ’ s certainly not something everyone can do .
not that i can tell you how she manages it , she can ’ t explain it clearly herself . but if she ’ s been walking rapidly , then she can whistle from inside , and of course she uses it then to startle people , especially newly arrived patients . i presume , by the way , that she ’ s wasting nitrogen by doing it , because she has to get a refill every week .
and hans castorp was laughing now ; during joachim ’ s explanation , his agitation had resolved into mirth , and as he walked along , bent forward and shading his eyes with his hand , his shoulders were convulsed by his soft , rapid giggles . has the club been registered ?
he asked , though he found it hard to speak , and it sounded more like a whine or whimper from suppressed laughter . do they have bylaws ?
you should ask behrens to put you temporarily out of commission . maybe you ’ d be able to whistle , too , if you really set your mind to it , after all it must be something you can learn . that ’ s the funniest thing i ’ ve ever heard in my life , he said , taking a deep breath .
tweeet ’ she whistles at me—what a harum-scarum !
you ’ ll have to forgive me , really , for talking like this , but they were in a merry mood themselves , your pneumatic friends . here they come walking up . and to think that it was the half-lung club !
and i ’ m sure you can tell me just why they ’ re so devil-may-care , can ’ t you ?
joachim searched for an answer .
i mean , they ’ re young and time plays no role in their lives , and they may very well die . why should they go around with long faces ? i sometimes think that illness and death aren ’ t really serious matters , that it ’ s all more like loafing around , and that , strictly speaking , things are serious only down below in real life .
i think maybe you ’ ll come to understand that in due time , after you ’ ve been up here with us a little longer .
certainly , hans castorp said , i ’ m certain i shall .
i ’ m already taking a great deal of interest in all of you up here , and once one is interested , why then understanding follows as a matter of course , doesn ’ t it ? but what ’ s wrong with me—this doesn ’ t taste good , he said , looking at his cigar . i ’ ve been asking myself the whole time what was the matter , and now i realize that my maria is the problem .
i swear to you , it tastes like papier-mâché , exactly as if i had a terribly upset stomach .
it ’ s really quite incredible ! i did eat an unusually large breakfast , but that can ’ t be the reason , because when you eat a lot , it always tastes especially good at first . do you think it can be because i slept so restlessly ?
no , i ’ m simply going to have to toss it away , he said after trying once more .
every puff is a disappointment ; there ’ s no point in forcing it . he hesitated for a moment and then flicked the cigar down the slope among the wet pines . do you know what i ’ m convinced is to blame ?
i am thoroughly convinced that it has something to do with this damned flushed face of mine—it ’ s been bothering me again ever since i got up .
damned if it doesn ’ t feel as if i ’ m constantly blushing in embarrassment .
was it the same with you , too , when you first arrived ? yes , joachim said , i felt rather strange , too , at first .
don ’ t worry about it . i told you , if you remember , that it ’ s not all that easy to get used to our life up here .
but you ’ ll soon be back on track .
look there , that bench has a nice view . let ’ s sit down for a bit and then head home—i need to take my rest cure .
they were now about a third of the way up the hill , but the path had leveled out , heading now in the direction of davos-platz .
the rudely fashioned bench on which they sat had its back to the steep slope . water fell in an open wooden trough beside them , gurgling and splashing on its way to the valley .
pointing with the tip of his alpenstock , joachim set about teaching his cousin the names of the cloud-topped peaks that appeared to close off the valley to the south . but hans castorp was bent forward , glancing up only fleetingly while drawing figures in the sand with the silver-trimmed knob of his citified cane .
what i wanted to ask you— he began . the case in my room expired just before i arrived , you said . have there been a lot of other deaths since you ’ ve been up here ?
several , certainly , joachim replied .
but they deal with them discreetly , you see , so you don ’ t hear about them , or only occasionally , later on . when someone dies it ’ s kept a strict secret , out of consideration for the other patients , in particular the ladies , who might easily go to pieces .
if someone dies right next door , you don ’ t even notice it . the coffin is brought in early in the morning while you ’ re still sleeping , and then the party in question is removed only at another more suitable time—during meals , for instance . hmm , hans castorp said and went on drawing .
yes , you can put it that way . but recently—it must have been , wait a moment—probably eight weeks ago— then you can ’ t call it recently , an alert hans castorp remarked dryly .
well then , not so recently . you ’ re so precise . i was just guessing at the date .
but anyway , some time ago , i had a peek backstage myself , purely by accident , but it ’ s as real as if it had happened today . it was the little hujus girl , barbara hujus—she was catholic—when they brought her the viaticum , the sacrament for the dying , you know , extreme unction . she was still up and about when i arrived here , and could be so playfully funny , so downright silly , a real teenager .
he came one afternoon , when everyone was at tea , with nobody in the halls . but you have to picture it—i had overslept , had fallen asleep during my rest cure and hadn ’ t heard the gong and was a quarter hour late . and so at the decisive moment i happened not to be where everyone else was , but had wandered backstage , as you put it , and as i ’ m walking down the corridor , i see them coming toward me , in lace shirts , a cross leading the way , a gold cross with little lanterns , one of them carrying it up front like the glockenspiel in a turkish-style military band .
that ’ s a poor comparison , hans castorp said rather sternly .
it automatically reminded me of it . they ’ re coming toward me , left right left , double-time , three of them if i ’ m not mistaken , the man with the cross first , then the priest , spectacles perched on his nose , and then a boy with a censer . the priest was carrying the sacrament against his chest , it had a cover over it , and holding his head very devoutly to one side—it ’ s their holy of holies , after all .
that ’ s precisely it , hans castorp said . that ’ s the reason why i was astounded when you said what you did about the glockenspiel . but just wait , if you had been there , you wouldn ’ t know what kind of face to put on , either , thinking back on it .
it was like something you might see in a dream—
let me tell you . so there i am , asking myself how i ought to act under the circumstances .
i didn ’ t have a hat to take off—
hans castorp quickly interrupted yet again .
you see , a man should always wear a hat .
i ’ ve noticed , of course , that you people up here never wear one . but you should , so that you can tip it whenever the occasion demands .
but now what happened ?
i stood back against the wall , joachim said , taking up a respectful pose , and made a little bow as they came even with me—it was right in front of the little hujus girl ’ s room , number twenty-eight .
the priest was glad to see my response , i think , and returned my greeting very politely , doffing his cap .
but by this time they have all come to a halt , and the altar boy with the censer knocks on the door , then lifts the latch , and lets his supervisor step ahead into the room .
the moment the priest sets a foot over the threshold , a hue and cry starts up inside , first a shriek like nothing you ’ ve ever heard , three or four times in a row , and then just screaming without a pause or break , like a mouth gaping wide open , i suppose , ahhh— ’ and with such misery and terror and defiance in it that i can ’ t describe it , and such ghastly pleading mixed in , too , and then all of a sudden it turns hollow and muffled , as if it has sunk down into the earth or is coming from a deep cellar .
hans castorp had turned abruptly to face his cousin .
and was that the hujus girl ?
but why from a deep cellar ’ ?
she had crawled under her blanket , joachim said .
just imagine how i felt .
the priest was standing just on the far side of the threshold , speaking soothing words—i can still see him—the way he constantly thrust his head forward and then jerked it back .
the cross-bearer and the altar boy were stuck there at the door and couldn ’ t get in .
but i could see between them into the room .
it ’ s a room just like yours or mine , with the bed to the left of the door along one side , and there were people standing at its head , her family of course , her parents , directing comforting words down at the bed , where you could only see a formless mass , begging and protesting hideously and kicking its legs .
are you saying she was kicking with her legs ?
but it didn ’ t help , she had to be given the sacrament of the dying . the pastor walked over to her and the other two stepped inside as well , and then the door was closed .
but just before that , i saw the hujus girl ’ s head emerge for a mere second , her light blond hair , and her pale eyes , no color to them at all , gaping wide , staring at the priest—and then she ducked under the sheets again with a loud wail . and you ’ re telling me only now ?
hans castorp said after a pause .
i can ’ t understand how you didn ’ t bring it up yesterday evening .
but , my god , she must have had a lot of strength left to fight back like that .
you shouldn ’ t send for a priest until they ’ re very weak .
but she was weak , joachim replied .
she was already weak—it was fear that gave her so much strength . she was terribly frightened , because she realized she was going to die . she was just a young girl , so it is excusable , after all .
but even grown men carry on like that sometimes , which is , of course , inexcusably weak-willed of them .
behrens knows how to deal with them , he can strike just the right tone for such cases .
what sort of tone ?
hans castorp asked with a scowl .
don ’ t make such a fuss ! he says , joachim replied .
at least that ’ s what he said to one fellow recently—we heard about it from the head nurse who was present to help restrain the dying man .
he was one of those types who makes a dreadful scene right at the end and absolutely refuses to die .
and so behrens simply dressed him down : would you please not make such a fuss , he said , and the patient quieted down at once and died quite peaceably .
hans castorp slapped his thigh with one hand , threw himself back against the bench , and stared at the sky .
listen here , that ’ s weighty stuff , he cried .
snaps his head off and says , don ’ t make such a fuss !
to a dying man .
a dying man deserves a certain amount of respect .
there ’ s something holy about a dying man , as it were—in my opinion .
i won ’ t deny that , joachim said .
no , hans castorp insisted with a ferocity not at all appropriate to the mild objection joachim had offered . i ’ ll not let you talk me out of it . a dying man has something nobler about him than your average rascal strolling about , laughing and making money and stuffing his belly .
but now his words were swallowed in a fit of laughter that suddenly overwhelmed him , the same laughter as yesterday , welling up from deep inside—convulsive , unbounded laughter , until he had to close his eyes for the tears .
he whispered and gave his cousin , still laughing uncontrollably , a silent poke in the ribs .
hans castorp looked up through his tears .
a stranger was coming up the path on their left , a delicate man with brown hair and a black moustache twirled at the ends ; he was wearing pastel checked trousers and exchanged a good-morning with joachim as he came up to them—his greeting was precise and melodious .
it would have been difficult to guess his age , but it surely had to be somewhere between thirty and forty , because , although the general impression was youthful , he was already silvering at the temples and his hair was thinning noticeably , receding toward the part in two wide arcs , making the brow even higher .
his outfit—loose trousers in a pastel yellow check and a wide-lapelled , double-breasted coat that was made of something like petersham and hung much too long—was far from laying any claim to elegance . the edges of his rounded high collar were rough from frequent laundering , his black tie was threadbare , and he apparently didn ’ t even bother with cuffs—hans castorp could tell from the limp way the coat sleeves draped around his wrists .
all the same , he could definitely see that he had a gentleman before him—the refined expression on the stranger ’ s face , his easy , even handsome pose left no doubt of that .
this mixture of shabbiness and charm , plus the black eyes and a handlebar moustache , immediately reminded hans castorp of certain foreign musicians who would appear in his hometown at christmastime and strike up a tune , then gaze up with velvet eyes and hold out their slouch hats to catch the coins you threw them from the window .
and so he was not surprised by the name he now heard as joachim got up from the bench somewhat flustered and introduced him , castorp , my cousin—herr settembrini . hans castorp had also stood up by way of greeting , traces of excess merriment still on his face .
but the italian politely remarked that he did not wish to disturb them and urged them to take their seats , whereas he remained standing in his becoming pose . he stood there , smiling and observing the cousins , particularly hans castorp , and the delicate line at one corner of his mouth , the mocking curl of the lip just below where his full moustache swept handsomely upward , had a peculiar effect—somehow it exhorted one to be alert and clearheaded , and in a flash so sobered the inebriated hans castorp that he felt ashamed of himself .
and with an easy , felicitous wave of his arm he lifted his little , yellowish hand toward the heavens and simultaneously cast an oblique glance in the same upward direction . one could in fact forget completely just where one is .
he spoke without any accent—at most one might have recognized him as a foreigner from the precision in the way he shaped his sounds .
his lips took a certain delight in forming the words .
it was a pleasure to listen to him .
and your journey , sir , to join us here was pleasant , i hope ?
he asked , turning to hans castorp .
i mean—has the gloomy ceremony of the first examination taken place yet ?
had he cared for an answer , he would have fallen silent and waited—for he had asked a question and hans castorp was about to reply .
but the stranger went right on with his inquiries : and did it go well ?
given your hilarity—he fell silent for a moment and the furrowed curl at the corner of his mouth deepened—one could draw contradictory conclusions .
how many months have our minos and rhadamanthus saddled you with ?
the phrase saddled you with sounded particularly droll coming from him .
hans castorp laughed in surprise—meanwhile trying to recall who minos and rhadamanthus were , exactly .
he answered , how do you mean ? no , you ’ re mistaken , herr septem— settembrini , the italian corrected him with particular verve , accompanied by a facetious bow .
herr settembrini—beg your pardon .
no , you are mistaken .
i am not sick at all . i ’ m merely visiting my cousin ziemssen for a few weeks and using the occasion for a little relaxation myself . you are not one of us ?
you don ’ t say ?
and so let us depart .
the prince ’ s scandalous behavior was still the talk of the valley , but rhadamanthus had simply winked an eye , both eyes—every inch a hofrat .
and so he continued , while good-natured hans castorp laughed heartily at this torrent of glib slander .
each one emerged taut , neat , and brand-new from his mobile lips ; he savored every educated , biting , nimble turn of phrase that he used , taking obvious , effusive , and exhilarating enjoyment even in grammatical inflections and conjugations , and seemed to have far too much clear presence of mind ever to misspeak himself .
ah , behold her flashing eye in the slippery light , he quoted—god only knew from what—and turned to blow a kiss at the embarrassed girl ’ s back .
i don ’ t really know how to put it .
you have such a droll way of speaking , herr settembrini , hans castorp said .
we are taking the same path— ’ to the right , which leads to the walls of mightiest dis . ah , virgil , virgil , gentlemen , he is unsurpassed . i believe in progress , certainly .
and all of a sudden he began to speak about petrarch , whom he called the father of modernity .
ah , krokowski , settembrini exclaimed .
the italian responded , fanning himself with his handkerchief , although the air was actually rather cool .
the literary man , who had underscored all his words with charming gestures , rounded his thoughts off now with a flourish in joachim ’ s direction and said , our lieutenant is pressing us into service .
tut , tut , tut , he clicked his tongue .
he glided on rubber soles , so salzmann said , to keep the dying from hearing his approach .
there was something curiously agreeable in the flow of the italian ’ s words , spoken as they were in pure and precise german , free of every trace of dialect .
the man has but one thought in his head , and it is a filthy one . my good engineer , how is it that we have not yet spoken of the man ?
that is extraordinary—von mylendonk and adriatica , to boot .
have you made his acquaintance ?
have you made his acquaintance ?
hans castorp said he had .
i am beginning to surmise that you liked him as well .
i really don ’ t know , herr settembrini .
i look at people and think : so that ’ s how you are ?
you remarked that i speak maliciously , but if i have done so , then it was not without a pedagogic purpose .
we humanists all have a pedagogic streak .
gentlemen , the historical connection between humanism and pedagogy only proves the psychological basis of that connection . one should not deny the humanist his position as an educator—indeed it can not be denied to him , for he alone preserves the tradition of man ’ s dignity and beauty .
there came a time when he took over from the priest , who in murky and misanthropic eras of the past was permitted to arrogate the education of youth to himself .
schools based on humanistic education—you may call me backward if you like , sir , but on principle and in abstracto , do understand me correctly , i beg you—i remain their firm supporter .
he was still arguing his case in the elevator and fell silent only when the cousins got off at last on the third floor .
he rode it on up to the fourth , where , as joachim explained , he had a small room with a view to the rear .
he hasn ’ t much money , i suppose ? hans castorp asked as they entered joachim ’ s room . it looked exactly like his own next door .
no , joachim said , probably not . or just enough so that he can pay for his stay here . his father was a literary type himself , you know , and i believe the grandfather was , too .
well , you see , hans castorp said .
is he seriously ill , then ?
it ’ s not dangerous , as far as i know , but a stubborn case and it keeps recurring .
he ’ s had it for years and has left off and on , but always returns .
especially since he seems to be such an enthusiast for work .
he ’ s certainly a fantastic talker , just slips easily from one topic to the other .
he was really a little fresh with that girl , i was mortified there for a moment . but then what he said about human dignity , afterward , sounded so spiffing , like formal oratory .
do you often spend time with him ?
a red leather case lined in velvet lay open on the table ; from it he had extracted a little thermometer and stuck the end filled with mercury into his mouth . he held it tightly under his tongue so that the glass tube jutted up at an angle from one corner . then he made himself comfortable , pulling on his house shoes and a tuniclike jacket , picked up a chart and a pencil from the table , plus a book of russian grammar—he was learning russian because , as he said , he hoped it would be of use in his career—and thus equipped , he stretched out on the balcony lounge chair , tossing the camel-hair blanket lightly over his feet .
he hardly needed it , because in the last quarter hour the layer of clouds had grown thinner and thinner , and the summer sun was breaking through—so warm and dazzling now that joachim had to screen his face with a white canvas sunshade ingeniously fixed to one arm of the chair and adjustable to the angle of the glare .
hans castorp praised the contraption .
he wanted to wait until joachim had finished measuring , and so in the meantime he watched how things were done , examined the fur-lined sleeping bag stored in one corner of the balcony—joachim used it on cold days—and propping his elbows on the railing , gazed down into the garden , where the common lounging area had now filled up with recumbent patients—reading , writing , chatting . only a small portion of the inside of the arcade , about five lounge chairs , was visible .
and how long does that take ?
hans castorp turned around to ask .
joachim raised seven fingers .
seven minutes must be up by now .
joachim shook his head .
after a while he took the thermometer out of his mouth , looked at it , and said , yes , when you pay close attention to it—time , i mean—it goes very slowly .
i truly like measuring my temperature four times a day , because it makes you notice what one minute , or even seven , actually means—especially since the seven days of a week hang so dreadfully heavy on your hands here . but actually ’ doesn ’ t apply , hans castorp responded . he was sitting with one thigh hiked up on the railing ; the whites of his eyes were bloodshot .
if it seems long to you , then it is long , and if it seems to pass quickly , then it ’ s short .
but how long or how short it is in actuality , no one knows .
he was not at all used to philosophizing , and yet felt some urge to do so .
we do measure it .
we have clocks and calendars , and when a month has passed , then it ’ s passed—for you and me and everyone . but wait , hans castorp said , holding up a forefinger next to one bloodshot eye .
you said that a minute is as long as it seems to you while you ’ re measuring your temperature , correct ?
a minute is as long as . it lasts , as long as it takes a second hand to complete a circle .
but how long that takes can vary greatly—according to how we feel it !
and in point of fact . i repeat , in point of fact , hans castorp said , pressing his forefinger so firmly against his nose that its tip was folded to one side , that ’ s a matter of motion , of motion in space , correct ?
and so we measure time with space . but that is the same thing as trying to measure space with time—the way uneducated people do .
it ’ s twenty hours from hamburg to davos—true , by train . but on foot , how far is it then ?
and in our minds—not even a second ! listen here , joachim said , what ’ s wrong with you ?
i think being up here with us is getting to you . my mind is very clear today .
so then , what is time ?
hans castorp asked , bending the tip of his nose so forcefully to one side that it turned white and bloodless .
will you please tell me that ?
we perceive space with our senses , with vision and touch .
but what is the organ for our sense of time ? would you please tell me that ? you see , you ’ re stuck .
but how are we ever going to measure something about which , precisely speaking , we know nothing at all— can not list a single one of its properties . we say time passes .
but in order to measure it . in order for it to be measurable , it would have to flow evenly , but where is it written that it does that ?
it doesn ’ t do that for our conscious minds , we simply assume it does , just for the sake of convenience . and so all our measurements are merely conventions , if you please .
fine , joachim said , then it ’ s probably also just a convention that my thermometer has risen four and a half lines above normal .
are you at ninety-nine point five ? it ’ s already going back down . and joachim entered it on his chart .
but that ’ s a good thing , really .
and i ’ ll go now , hans castorp said .
my head is full of all kinds of ideas about time—a whole complex of thoughts , let me tell you .
i ’ ll keep it all in mind , and we can talk about it later then , after second breakfast perhaps .
you will call me when it ’ s time to eat ?
i ’ ll go take my rest cure now , too—it can ’ t hurt , thank goodness .
and with that he slipped past the glass divider across to his own balcony , where someone had placed an unfolded lounge chair and a table .
he fetched his ocean steamships and his traveling blanket , a lovely plaid of dark reds and greens , and noticed that his room had been nicely tidied up .
but he soon had to put up his sunshade , the blazing glare was unbearable the moment you lay down .
the frame , a little old-fashioned in design—but that was only a stylish touch , really , since the chair was obviously new—was made of polished reddish-brown wood , and the mattress , covered with a soft cottonlike fabric , actually consisted of three thick cushions that reached from the foot of the chair up over the back .
and then , attached to a string and slipped into an embroidered linen case was a roll for your neck , neither too firm nor too soft , and it simply worked wonders .
hans castorp propped one elbow on the broad , smooth surface of the chair arm , and lay there blinking , not even bothering to entertain himself with ocean steamships .
seen through the arches of the balcony , the hard , barren landscape lay under the bright sun like a framed painting .
hans castorp regarded it pensively .
suddenly it came to him—and he said aloud into the silence , that was a dwarf who served us at breakfast .
just that we hadn ’ t spoken about it .
it was already ten o ’ clock when he lay down .
it was an ordinary hour , neither long nor short .
and when it was over , a gong rang out in the building and across the garden—first distant , then nearer , then distant again .
breakfast , joachim said , and you could hear him getting up .
hans castorp ended his rest cure for now , too , and went back into the room to get ready .
the cousins met in the corridor and went downstairs .
hans castorp said , well , that felt marvelous just lying there .
what sort of chairs are those ?
if they ’ re for sale up here , i ’ ll take one with me back to hamburg , they ’ re simply heavenly .
or do you think that behrens has them made up according to his own specifications ?
joachim did not know .
they hung up their coats and for the second time today they entered the dining hall , where the meal was in full swing . the room glistened with white from all the milk—a large glass at every place , a good pint of it at least . no , hans castorp said , taking his seat again at the end of the table between the seamstress and the englishwoman and conscientiously unfolding his napkin—although he was still weighed down by his first breakfast .
is there some porter , perhaps ?
and he turned to ask this question politely and gently of the dwarf . there was no porter , unfortunately . but she promised him some kulmbach beer , and indeed she brought it .
it was thick and black , with a foamy brown head , and was an excellent substitute for porter . hans castorp drank thirstily from the tall pint glass . he ate cold cuts on toast .
there was more oatmeal on the table and lots of butter and fruit again .
he at least let his eyes pass over it all , since he was incapable of helping himself to any of it . and he observed the other guests , too—the crowd was beginning to sort itself out for him and individuals were emerging . his own table was full , except for the seat at the head opposite him , which , as he was told , was reserved for the doctors .
because whenever their schedules allowed , the physicians took part in communal meals , but at a different table every time—and a place was kept free for them at the head of each one . neither of them was present at the moment ; word was that they were operating . the young man with the moustache entered again , his chin pressed to his chest , and sat down with a worried , self-absorbed look on his face .
the very blond , gaunt young woman took her seat and spooned down her yogurt again , as if this were the only thing she ever ate .
next to her this time was a chipper little old lady , who spoke to the silent young man in a steady flow of russian , to which his only reply was a worried expression and a nod of the head—and that same look on his face as if he had something foul-tasting in his mouth .
across from him , on the other side of the old lady , yet another young girl was seated—she was pretty , with a rosy complexion , prominent breasts , chestnut hair nicely coiffed and waved , round , brown , childlike eyes , and a little ruby on her pretty hand .
she laughed a great deal and likewise spoke russian , only russian .
her name was marusya , hans castorp heard someone say .
he also happened to notice that joachim would lower his eyes with a stern look whenever she laughed or spoke . settembrini came in by way of the side entrance , and twirling his moustache all the while , he strode to his seat , which was catercorner from hans castorp ’ s .
his tablemates broke into peals of laughter as he sat down—presumably he had made one of his malicious remarks .
and hans castorp also recognized the members of the half-lung club .
doltish-eyed hermine kleefeld shoved her way to her table , over near one of the doors opening onto the veranda , and greeted the thick-lipped lad who had hitched his jacket up so unbecomingly .
at the table set crosswise on his right sat fräulein levi with the ivory complexion and , next to her , plump , freckled frau iltis and a group of others whom hans castorp did not know .
those are your neighbors , joachim said softly to his cousin and bent his head forward .
passing very close to hans castorp was a couple making for the last table on the right—the bad russian table , that was—where a family with an ugly boy was already seated , all of them wolfing down great mounds of oatmeal .
the man was slightly built and had gray , hollow cheeks .
he wore a brown leather jacket , and on his feet were boxy felt boots with clasp buckles .
his wife , likewise small and slim , wore a hat with a bouncing feather and minced ahead on tiny , high-heeled boots of red russia leather ; around her neck was draped a shabby feather boa .
hans castorp stared at the two of them with a tactlessness that was quite foreign to him and that even he found brutal—although what was really brutal about it was the sudden pleasure he took in it .
and when at that same moment the glass door on his left slammed shut with a bang and a rattle , just as it had at first breakfast , he did not flinch as he had earlier that morning , but merely grimaced languidly . and just as he was about to turn his head to look in that direction , he suddenly found that it was simply too much trouble and not worth the effort . and so he did not determine this time , either , who it was that was so sloppy about the door .
the fact was that his breakfast beer , which normally had only a slightly befuddling effect on the young man , had completely stupefied and lamed him—it was as if he had been struck a blow across his brow .
his eyelids were leaden ; his tongue simply would not obey the simplest thoughts when he tried out of courtesy to chat with the englishwoman ; even shifting the direction of his eyes demanded a great struggle with himself . added to all of which , the ghastly flush he had experienced yesterday had returned to his face in full force—his cheeks felt puffy from the heat , he was breathing heavily , his heart was pounding like a hammer wrapped in cloth .
but despite it all , he was not suffering particularly—primarily because his head felt as if he had just taken two or three deep breaths of chloroform . dr. krokowski had appeared for breakfast and taken the seat opposite him at the head of the table ; but , as if in a dream , he barely noticed the fact , although the doctor looked him in the eye , repeatedly and sharply , while carrying on a conversation in russian with the ladies on his right , during which the younger ones—that is , marusya with her rosy complexion and the gaunt yogurt-eater—kept their eyes cast down in meek embarrassment .
it goes without saying that hans castorp kept his dignity , preferring to say not a word once his tongue had proved refractory and handling his knife and fork with special decorum .
when his cousin nodded to him and stood up , he did the same ; after bowing blindly to his tablemates , he followed joachim , taking deliberate , careful steps as he went . when is the next rest cure ?
he asked as they left the building .
that ’ s the best thing here , as far as i can see .
i wish i were lying in my splendid lounge chair again right now .
are we going to walk far ?
around this time i always take just a short walk down through davos-dorf and on into platz , if i have time .
you can window-shop and watch people and buy whatever you need .
not to worry , we ’ ll lie down for an hour before dinner , and then again till four .
they walked down the drive in the sunshine and crossed the brook and the narrow-gauge tracks ; the line of mountains above the valley ’ s western slope rose directly ahead of them , and joachim supplied their names : little schiahorn , the green towers , and dorfberg . across the way , a little distance up the hill , was the walled cemetery of davos-dorf—and joachim pointed it out as well with his walking stick .
and now they were on the main road , which was set one terrace-level above the valley floor .
one could not really call dorf a village ; at least , nothing except the name itself was left now .
it had been devoured by the resort spreading relentlessly toward the entrance to the valley , and that part of the settlement called davos-dorf merged imperceptibly , without transition , into what was called davos-platz .
hotels and boardinghouses , all of them amply equipped with covered verandas , balconies , and rest-cure arcades , lay on both sides , as well as private homes with rooms for rent .
here and there new buildings were under construction , but sometimes the line of houses was broken by an open space that allowed a view of the valley ’ s green meadows .
in his desire for his customary and cherished stimulant , hans castorp had lit another cigar ; and , thanks apparently to the beer he had drunk and much to his indescribable satisfaction , now and then he was able to whiff something of the aroma he craved—but only rarely and faintly , to be sure . it was a strain on his nerves just to try to detect a hint of his usual enjoyment—and that repulsive leathery taste predominated .
unwilling to accommodate himself to such failure , he struggled for a while to find a pleasure that either was totally denied him or simply teased him with a distant inkling of itself , and finally out of weary disgust he tossed the cigar aside . despite his dazed state , he felt courtesy demanded that he carry on a conversation , and for that purpose he tried to recall the excellent things he had wanted to say about time earlier . except it turned out that he had forgotten every bit of the whole complex—not one single thought about time still resided in any corner of his brain .
and so instead he began to speak about bodily functions , although in a rather strange fashion .
when do you take your temperature again ?
yes , that ’ s a good idea .
the organism is at the height of its activity , so it would register then .
why , settembrini laughed his head off at the notion . there would be absolutely no point in it . i don ’ t even own a thermometer .
well , joachim said , that ’ s no problem whatever . you need only to buy one . there are thermometers for sale here everywhere , in almost any shop .
but keeping track of my temperature would be too much for a visitor , i ’ ll leave that to the rest of you up here .
if i only knew , hans castorp continued , pressing his hands to his breast like a man in love , why my heart keeps pounding the whole time—it ’ s so disconcerting . i ’ ve been thinking about it for quite a while now .
because , you see , your heart pounds when you ’ re looking forward to some joyous event or if you ’ re afraid—when your emotions are stirred up , isn ’ t that right ?
but if your heart starts pounding all by itself , for no earthly reason , of its own accord , so to speak , i find that downright bizarre , if you see what i mean ? it ’ s as if the body were going off on its own and no longer had any connection to your soul , more or less like a dead body that is not really dead—even though there is no such thing—and goes on living a very active life , but all of its own accord .
what sort of an expression is that , joachim reprimanded him discreetly .
and perhaps he was revenging himself a little for the rebuke he had received earlier today for his glockenspiel . but it ’ s true !
why are you so offended by that ?
and anyway , i only mentioned it incidentally . all i was trying to say is that it ’ s bizarre and upsetting when the body goes off on its own accord , living with no connection to one ’ s soul and putting on airs—like a heart pounding for no purpose whatever . one literally searches for some reason for it , some emotional stimulus , a feeling of joy or fear , that could justify it , so to speak—at least that ’ s how it is with me , i can only speak for myself .
yes , yes , joachim said with a sigh , it ’ s probably much like having a high fever .
but we ’ re talking about such unpleasant things , he said in a quivering voice and then broke off . to which hans castorp merely gave a shrug—in perfect imitation of the shrug he had first seen joachim give the evening before .
they walked along in silence for a while . then joachim asked , well , how do you like the people here ?
i mean the ones at our table ?
oh , lord , he said , they don ’ t seem very interesting to me . there are more interesting people sitting at some of the other tables , i think , but maybe i ’ m just imagining that .
frau stöhr should get her hair washed , it ’ s so greasy . and little mazurka , or whatever her name is , seems pretty silly to me .
she keeps stuffing her handkerchief in her mouth because she ’ s constantly giggling .
joachim laughed out loud at the bungled name . mazurka ’ —that ’ s splendid !
her name ’ s marusya , if you please—it ’ s about the same as our marie .
yes , she really is too enthusiastic , he said . when she has every reason to be more sedate , because she ’ s more than a little ill .
she ’ s in such good shape .
you ’ d never take her for someone with a weak chest .
and he tried to catch his cousin ’ s eye , but discovered that joachim ’ s tanned face looked all blotchy , the way tanned faces do when the blood rushes out of them , and that he had wrenched his mouth into a peculiar , woeful expression that gave hans castorp a vague fright and caused him immediately to change the subject .
he asked about certain other people and tried to forget both marusya and joachim ’ s expression—and was totally successful at it .
the englishwoman with the rose-hip tea was named miss robinson .
the seamstress was not a seamstress , but a teacher at a public school for well-bred young ladies in königsberg , and that was why she chose her words so precisely .
her name was fräulein engelhart .
as for the chipper old lady , joachim had never learned her name in all the time he had been there .
in any case , she was the great-aunt of the yogurt-eating girl , and both were permanent residents of the sanatorium .
the sickest person at the table was dr. blumenkohl , leo blumenkohl from odessa—the young man with the moustache and the worried , self-absorbed look . he had been up here for years now .
they were now walking on a city sidewalk—it was immediately apparent that this was the main street of an international resort .
the strolling tourists they met were mostly young people , the gentlemen in sport coats and without hats , the ladies in white skirts and also without hats .
you heard russian and english spoken ; to both left and right were rows of shops with elegant displays in the windows . hans castorp ’ s curiosity was now seriously battling his flushed exhaustion , and forcing his eyes to take it all in , he lingered awhile outside a men ’ s clothing shore , just to make sure that his own wardrobe was up to snuff .
then came a rotunda with a covered gallery where a little band was playing .
this was the kurhaus , the spa hotel .
several games were in progress on the tennis courts . long-legged , clean-shaven young men wearing freshly pressed flannels and rubber-soled shoes had rolled up their shirtsleeves to play opposite tanned young ladies in white , who kept reaching boldly up toward the sun in order to hit the chalk-white ball out of the air .
a kind of floury dust drifted over the well-kept courts .
the cousins sat down on an unoccupied bench to watch and critique the play .
you ’ ve not been playing up here , i take it ?
i ’ m not allowed to , joachim answered . we have to rest , always lying at rest .
settembrini says we live horizontally—we ’ re the horizontals , he says , it ’ s another one of his rotten jokes .
those are healthy people playing there , or they ’ re disobeying their doctors ’ orders .
anyway , they ’ re not playing serious tennis—it ’ s more for the outfits .
and as far as not obeying orders goes , lots of forbidden games are played here—poker , you know , and petits chevaux in certain hotels .
but there are plenty of people who sneak past the guards in the evening and come down here to gamble .
they say the prince who gave behrens his title of hofrat did it constantly .
hans castorp was hardly listening .
his mouth was hanging open , because he couldn ’ t breathe through his nose right , although he didn ’ t have a cold . he dimly noticed the disconcerting effect of his heart ’ s pounding out of time to the music . and feeling confused and at odds with himself , he was just dozing off when joachim suggested they needed to start back .
they covered the distance in almost total silence . hans castorp stumbled a few times on the level pavement , at which he merely shook his head and smiled wistfully .
the elevator operator who took them up to their floor was the man with the limp . exchanging a brief till later , they parted outside room number . hans castorp steered his way across the room and out to the balcony , where he let himself fall into his lounge chair , just as he was , and without changing his position once , he fell into a dull semistupor , broken now and then by the annoyance of his rapidly beating heart .
how long that lasted he didn ’ t know . at the appropriate time , the gong rang out .
but , as hans castorp was aware , it was not the call for dinner itself , merely the warning to get ready for it ; and so he lay there for a while until the metallic rumble swelled and fell away a second time . when joachim came through the room to fetch him , hans castorp wanted to change first , but joachim said it was too late and wouldn ’ t let him .
he was right , of course , and hans castorp could only point out that he wasn ’ t the one who was sick , although he certainly was incredibly sleepy .
he just washed his hands quickly ; and they walked down to the dining hall , for the third time . the guests were streaming in through both entrances . some were even coming through the veranda doors that stood open opposite , and soon they were all sitting around the seven tables as if they had never left them .
that at least was hans castorp ’ s impression , a purely dreamy , irrational impression of course , which he could not get out of his befuddled brain for the moment and which even gave him a certain pleasure—such pleasure , in fact , that he tried to recapture it several times during the course of the meal and , indeed , was able to recreate the illusion perfectly .
the chipper old lady was once again keeping up a steady stream of blurry russian directed diagonally toward dr. blumenkohl , who listened with a careworn face . her skinny grandniece finally ate something other than yogurt : the gooey cream of barley soup that the dining attendants had served in large plates—but only a few spoonfuls , and then she let it stand .
pretty marusya kept pressing her little handkerchief , fragrant with orange perfume , to her mouth to stifle her giggles .
miss robinson was reading the same letter in the same rounded hand that she had been reading that morning .
apparently she could speak not a word of german and did not wish to .
joachim struck a chivalrous pose and said something to her in english about the weather , to which , while still chewing , she gave a monosyllabic reply and then fell silent again .
as for frau stöhr in her scotch-plaid woolen blouse , she had had her checkup that morning and reported about it in her affected , uneducated way , drawing her upper lip back from her rabbitlike teeth .
she complained of a rattle on the upper right , and her breathing was reduced just under her left shoulder blade , and the boss had told her she would have to stay another five months .
moreover , she declared her outrage that the boss was not sitting at their table again today . the retardation schedule ( she apparently meant rotation ) demanded that the boss should be sitting at their table for dinner today , whereas the boss was once again sitting at the table on their left ( and indeed there sat director behrens , his gigantic hands folded in front of his plate ) .
though to be sure , that was also where fat frau salomon from amsterdam was seated , and she came to dinner every day of the week in a low-cut dress , apparently quite to the boss ’ s liking , although she , frau stöhr , could not understand it , because , after all , he could see however much of frau salomon he wanted at every checkup .
a little later she told them in an excited whisper that yesterday evening the lights had been turned out in the upper common lounging area—the one on the roof—for purposes that frau stöhr described as transparent .
the boss had noticed it and gone into such a rage that you could hear him all over the building .
but of course once again he had not located the guilty party , although one didn ’ t have to have a university degree to guess that , of course , it had been captain miklosich from bucharest , for whom it could never be dark enough when he was in the company of ladies—a man lacking in every refinement , although he did wear a corset , and who was no better than a beast of prey—yes , a beast of prey , frau stöhr repeated in a smothered whisper as beads of sweat appeared on her brow and upper lip .
why , all of dorf and platz , too , knew the nature of his relationship with frau wurmbrandt from vienna , the general consul ’ s wife—one could hardly call it clandestine anymore .
it wasn ’ t enough that the captain frequently paid morning visits to frau wurmbrandt in her room , with her still lying in bed , and stayed there the whole time she dressed , but last tuesday he had not left wurmbrandt ’ s room until four o ’ clock the next morning—the nurse looking after franz in room , the boy whose recent pneumothorax operation had turned out so badly , had run into him in the hall , and had been so embarrassed that she got her doors mixed up and found herself in the room of prosecutor paravant from dortmund .
and finally frau stöhr held forth at length about a cosmological salon down in town , where she bought her mouthwash . joachim stared down at his plate .
the dinner was as splendidly prepared as it was lavish .
including the nourishing soup , it consisted of no fewer than six courses .
the fish was followed by a superb roast with vegetables , which was followed by a salad , then roast fowl , a dumpling dessert in no way inferior to the one hans had eaten the night before , and , finally , cheese and fruit .
people filled their plates at all seven tables—they ate with the appetites of lions here in these vaulted spaces . theirs was a hot hunger that it would have been a joy to observe , if its effect had not at the same time seemed somehow eerie , even repulsive .
not only the more lively among them displayed such hunger as they chatted and pelted one another with little pills of bread—no , but also the silent , gloomy ones , who between courses would put their heads in their hands and stare into space . at the next table on their left was an adolescent boy—still of school age , to judge by his appearance—whose coat sleeves were too short , and who wore thick , circular glasses ; he chopped up everything heaped on his plate until it was a pasty hodgepodge , then bent over it and wolfed it down , now and then pushing his napkin up behind his glasses to dry his eyes—it was unclear whether this was to wipe away sweat or tears .
during this major meal of the day , two incidents occurred to attract hans castorp ’ s attention , insofar as his condition allowed .
first , the glass door slammed shut again—just as the fish course was being served .
hans castorp flinched in irritation and told himself indignantly that this time he really must find out who the culprit was .
he didn ’ t merely think it—he was so in earnest that he spoke it out loud .
he whispered with exaggerated fervor , so that both miss robinson and the teacher glanced at him in amazement .
and turning his whole upper body to the left , he opened his bloodshot eyes wide .
it was a lady who crossed the hall now , a young woman , a girl really , of only average height , in a white sweater and brightly colored skirt , with reddish-blond hair , which she wore in a simple braid wound up on her head . hans castorp saw only a little of her profile—almost nothing , in fact . in quite marvelous contrast to her noisy entrance , she walked soundlessly , with a peculiar slinking gait , her head thrust slightly forward , and proceeded to the farthest table on the left , set perpendicular to the veranda doors—the good russian table .
as she walked she kept one hand in the pocket of her close-fitting wool jacket , while the other was busy at the back of her head , tucking and arranging her hair .
hans castorp looked at that hand—he had a good eye and a fine critical sense for hands , and it was his habit always first to direct his gaze at them whenever he made a new acquaintance . the hand tucking up her hair was not particularly ladylike , not refined or well cared for , not in the way the ladies in young hans castorp ’ s social circle cared for theirs .
it was rather broad , with stubby fingers ; there was something primitive and childish about it , rather like the hand of a schoolgirl .
her nails had clearly never seen a manicure , and had been trimmed carelessly—again , like a schoolgirl ’ s ; and the cuticles had a jagged look , almost as if she were guilty of the minor vice of nail-chewing .
her tablemates greeted the latecomer with nods ; as she took her seat on the near side of the table—her back to the room and right beside dr. krokowski , who was presiding—she turned , her hand still at her hair , and looked back over her shoulder at the assembly .
and hans castorp caught a fleeting glance of her broad cheekbones and narrow eyes—and at the sight , a vague memory of something or somebody brushed over him .
but of course—a female !
hans castorp thought , and again muttered it so emphatically to himself that the teacher , fräulein engelhart , understood what he had said .
the shriveled old maid smiled in sympathy .
that is madame chauchat , she said .
she ’ s so careless .
and fräulein engelhart ’ s fuzzy cheeks turned a shade rosier—which was the case , actually , whenever she opened her mouth .
hans castorp asked sternly .
no , she ’ s russian , said the teacher .
perhaps her husband is french , or of french extraction , i can ’ t say for sure .
still incensed , hans castorp asked if that was her husband there , and pointed to a gentleman with hunched shoulders sitting at the good russian table .
he ’ s never been here even once , he ’ s quite unknown to us .
she should learn to close a door properly , hans castorp said .
she always lets it slam .
but since the teacher meekly accepted his rebuke as if she were the guilty party , nothing more was said about madame chauchat . the second incident consisted of dr. blumenkohl ’ s leaving the room—it was no more than that .
then he slid his chair back in one decisive motion and left the room .
at this juncture , however , frau stöhr displayed her poor upbringing in the most garish light , because—apparently out of some crude satisfaction that she was less ill than blumenkohl—she accompanied his departure with a few half-sympathetic , half-contemptuous remarks .
the poor man , she said .
he ’ s on his last legs .
he ’ s off to have a talk with his blue henry again .
with a stubborn , obtuse look on her face , she uttered the grotesque term blue henry without the least hesitancy , and hans castorp felt an urge both to laugh and to shudder as she said it .
dr. blumenkohl , by the way , returned after a few minutes , carrying himself in the same diffident fashion as when he left , took his seat again , and went on eating .
then dinner was over ; but thanks to the capable service—and their dwarf in particular was marvelously fleet of foot—it had lasted only a little more than an hour . breathing heavily and not rightly knowing how he had got there , hans castorp found himself lying in the splendid lounge chair on his balcony—because there was a rest cure between dinner and tea , the most important of the day , in fact , and rigorously enforced .
he lay there between the opaque glass walls that separated him from joachim on one side and the russian couple on the other ; his heart pounded as he dozed , and he drew air in through his mouth .
when he used his handkerchief , he found red traces of blood , but he did not have the energy to think much about it , although he was easily inclined to worry about himself and tended by nature to play the hypochondriac . he had lit another maria mancini and smoked it to the end this time , despite the taste .
feeling dizzy , anxious , and dreamy , he thought how very strangely things were going for him up here .
two or three times he felt his chest shaken by suppressed laughter at the gruesome term that frau stöhr had used in her ignorance .
down in the garden the fantasy flag with the caduceus lifted now and then in a light breeze .
the sky had clouded over completely again . the sun was gone , and there was an almost inhospitable chill in the air .
he , too , ate a great deal , and with a worried , self-absorbed look on his face mutely took a second helping from each course .
i beg you , herr albin , do put that knife away , put it in your pocket before there ’ s an accident ! a high , wavering female voice fretted .
my dear herr albin , spare our nerves and remove that dreadful lethal object from view ! a second voice chimed in .
and then a blond young man , sitting sideways on a lounge chair clear at the front , a cigarette dangling from his mouth , replied in a flippant voice , wouldn ’ t think of it .
i bought it in calcutta from a blind magician .
he would swallow it , and then his boy would immediately dig it up some fifty paces away .
it ’ s much sharper than a razor .
you only have to just touch the blade , and it goes right into the flesh as if it were butter . wait a moment , let me show you up close .
and herr albin stood up .
no , i think i ’ ll go fetch my revolver , herr albin said .
herr albin , don ’ t do it !
but herr albin was already emerging from the arcade , heading for his room—very young , with a shambling gait , a rosy childlike face , and narrow sideburns at his ears . herr albin , a woman called after him , you ’ d do better to get your coat—put it on as a favor to me . you lay bedridden with pneumonia for six weeks , and here you are sitting without an overcoat , without even a blanket , and smoking cigarettes .
that ’ s tempting providence , herr albin , i swear it is .
but he only laughed derisively as he walked away , and within a few minutes he returned with his revolver . this aroused even more silly shrieks than before , and you could hear several ladies stumble as they tried to jump up from their chairs and got tangled in their blankets . look how small and shiny it is , herr albin said , but if i press right here—it will bite .
it ’ s loaded with live ammunition , of course , herr albin continued . there are six cartridges in this cylinder here , which moves ahead one chamber with every shot .
and by the by , i don ’ t keep this thing just for fun , he said , noticing that the effect was wearing off .
he slipped the revolver back into his breast pocket , sat back down on his chair , crossed his legs , and lit another cigarette .
definitely not just for fun , he repeated , pressing his lips together .
several trembling voices asked with foreboding .
one voice suddenly cried—and herr albin nodded .
i see you ’ re beginning to understand , he said .
and in fact , that is why i keep it handy , he went on lightly , after first inhaling and then exhaling a great quantity of smoke , despite his recent bout with pneumonia . i keep it at the ready for the day when all this malarkey here gets too boring and i shall have the honor of paying my final regards .
it really is very simple .
i ’ ve studied the matter at some length , and i have a very clear idea about how best to pull it off .
the region of the heart is out of the question—it ’ s rather awkward to aim there .
and besides , i prefer snuffing out the conscious mind on the spot , and can do so by applying one of these pretty little foreign objects to this interesting organ . and herr albin pointed with his index finger to his close-cropped blond head .
one aims here—herr albin pulled the nickel-plated revolver from his pocket again and tapped the barrel against one temple—here , just above the artery . slick as a whistle , even without a mirror . several voices of pleading protest , including one sobbing violently : herr albin , herr albin , put that revolver away , take it away from your temple , i can ’ t even watch !
herr albin , you ’ re young , you ’ ll get well again , you ’ ll enjoy life again in a circle of friends who love you , i swear you will !
put on your coat now , lie down here and pull a blanket over you , it ’ s time for your rest cure .
and don ’ t chase the bath attendant away again when he comes by and offers to rub you down with alcohol .
we implore you , for your own sake , for the sake of your young , precious life !
but herr albin was implacable .
