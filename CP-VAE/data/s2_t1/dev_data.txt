0	parking is ok now that baseball is over .
0	but the place is suddenly filthy .
0	pictures of the dirty machines are attached .
0	hair , dust , sweat accumulating for weeks .
0	lifetime ca n't open soon enough !
0	all this time was spent with the pa , leanna peterson .
0	the dr. came in for about 2 minutes at that appointment .
0	horribly rude and very unhelpful staff made for a terrible night in the er .
0	avoid at all costs !
0	these people do not care about patients at all !
0	meanwhile , she could barely hold her head up nor speak .
0	i walked away and saw her get on her cell phone .
0	do not come here they do not care for patients !
0	horribly dirty , careless physicians , completely unacceptable service !
0	the wait times are way too long !
0	very inconsiderate of health and pain levels .
0	please fix the tv sets on the stair machines upstairs .
0	they have not worked since those machines were put in 4 months ago .
0	they turn on but have no stations .
0	unacceptable when there are a total of 4 stair machines .
0	half do n't have working tvs .
0	less expensive gyms have working tvs .
0	this is not a luxury .
0	i am forced to watch tv on my phone .
0	have to use my own data plan .
0	again , reliable wifi is not difficult to provide .
0	i like the staff at this location .
0	unbelievably bad customer service .
0	they 'll take your money and give you product but that 's it .
0	no real coaching , counseling or follow up .
0	thank god i am out of that hellhole !
0	some were fired although some left on their own .
0	please keep in mind this was my experiance .
0	the one major con is the food bar .
0	the selection is mediocre , and the chefs do n't really change it up .
0	i was in phoenix for about 2.5 weeks .
0	i usually get food from whole foods when i 'm on business trips .
0	however , this time it was a challenge .
0	the server was awesome .
0	super knowledgeable about wine .
0	terrible place in general !
0	enter this place at your own risk !
0	forces new patients to give a credit card # or pay up front .
0	dentist herself is not family oriented but , somewhat friendly .
0	do n't think she has kids .
0	dental work is fairly expensive and average at best .
0	if it 's not an inconvienace i would work with someone else .
0	do not go here , they do not take care of you at all .
0	if i could give this place a zero rating i would !
0	then , they finally get me a room .
0	this place is a pathetic excuse for an urgent caresmall hospital .
0	wrong diagnosis and poor , poor care for their patients .
0	gave us hardly any information .
0	why would n't they just tell me over the phone .
0	my sister and i presented today for lip injections having purchased vouchers on groupon .
0	i 'm very sad to have to update my previously positive review .
0	all of the other d backs employees park off site .
0	not sure why he gets the closest spot to the club .
0	not sure why that had n't been done from day one .
0	so people from other clubs are parking and going to the game .
0	other cars had no permit and no note .
0	there were five people in the gym and 16 cars in the lot .
0	i came to dr anantuni for a 2nd opinion .
0	she hardly spoke to me and was exceptionally rude .
0	anantuni 's demeanor was no better .
0	no explanation of what was happening to me was given .
0	i gagged twice from dry mouth while sandi ignored and continued suctioning & probing .
0	i was offended nearly to the point of tears during the first appointment .
0	to my horror , the 2nd visit was even worse .
0	my crown did not fit even remotely , as sandi forced it on .
0	sandi told me not to move when i shifted out of pain .
0	she attempted for force the crown on with floss 3x .
0	eventually she gives up and anantuni fits my crown .
0	when i left my gums were still bleeding and bruised .
0	do not come here .
0	i 've confirmed the similiar experiences with sandi from 2 other patients .
0	meaning you have to grab all groceries and transfer .
0	nasty workers should get fired in my opinion .
0	thanks for your vote !
0	talk about a total lack of transparency with pricing !
0	and , there is no mention of pricing on their website either .
0	felt like we were dealing with a used car salesman with a hidden agenda .
0	needless to say we took our business elsewhere .
0	only go here as a last resort .
0	if you can get to henderson or vegas do it .
0	less than 2 hours .
0	they are very hard to communicate with and quickly attack your credit .
0	st. rose is so much better you cant compare them .
0	these guys may be good to give staples or stitches
0	do not rent here .
0	you are better off in an all age community .
0	keep your sanity and stay away .
0	the negligence is blatant .
0	the process and the system in place fails every patient .
0	this is an sos signal .
0	someone save me ! ! !
0	a different dentist came in and apologized .
0	needless to say , i will not be returning .
0	this was a sloppy mistake that could have easily been prevented .
0	i purchased a voucher to visit the rest nest float club on groupon .
0	this was not the case at all .
0	when i went back to the lobby , there was no one there .
0	shortly thereafter , he was back in the lobby .
0	he had gone to a neighbouring business to discuss a leaky roof situation .
0	i wish there was an option for zero or minus 10 stars .
0	sadly , i think the deplorable customer service issues are a corporate-wide quest problem .
0	why is it so impossible to get your test results ?
0	it does not work .
0	i had labs drawn seven days ago .
0	today , the doctor says they have no results from sonora quest .
0	my lab results were just going to sit there in nowhere land ?
0	they were n't going to bother following the instructions on my lab requisition ?
0	it took my calling them to get them to do their job ?
0	getting your labs drawn is not the problem .
0	getting you results , that is consistently a nightmare .
0	i absolutely despise this company !
0	snappy , argumentative and ghetto .
0	she kept the phone to her hear while talking to me .
0	are n't there hippa regulations ?
0	he seemed annoyed and angry to be there .
0	the visit only got better when the doctor and melissa came in .
0	will think twice before coming here again
0	second i would choose zero or negative ten stars if i could .
0	do not leave your loved ones here ! ! !
0	no one cared what happened to him .
0	i would n't allow a dog to be in this facility .
0	dr bilski does the hard sell on tooth implant and probably other services .
0	which i did n't know at the time .
0	save yourself a lot of money and grief and go to a specialist .
0	my jaw is still in pain from his work three years later .
0	best of luck to you all ... way overpriced
0	one of the most unprofessional pharmacies i have ever encountered .
0	today i called in to see if a prescription was ready to pick up .
0	a script that the doctor called in 3 days ago !
0	i was told that it was not ready and still being worked on .
0	no apologies or explanations were given .
0	when i asked for an eta the tech hung up on me .
0	all my business is going else where !
0	after two years of seeing dr. davis , we will not be returning .
0	they need to slow down and properly care for children 's teeth .
0	on our first visit , davis recommended my two children get sealants .
0	one year later , it was recommended several get replaced .
0	two days after they were replaced again , an entire sealant had popped off !
0	monday came , no call .
0	tuesday came , no call .
0	they refused to remove the sealants saying they would have to drill them off .
0	i do n't know if that 's true .
0	no amount of brushing will be able to prevent that cavity from forming .
0	i will not be returning to this office .
0	this is not okay .
0	the absolute most awful receptionists i 've ever dealt with .
0	we had absolutely disappointing experience with new you spa .
0	their accounting department avoided any contacts with us .
0	dr. ghodsi from lasting smiles dental care is a joke !
0	... . he slick , polished , and full of bs !
0	my wife and i went there to inquire about their $ 695 dental implants .
0	i wanted to know what the grand total was .
0	at this point , we were done !
0	the person that makes the copies had gone home for the night .
0	in our opinion , dr. ghodsi is an embarrassment to the medical community .
0	this review is for dr. blake goodbar : a condescending young physician .
0	he is part of the `` everybody gets a trophy '' generation .
0	has absolutely no personality and hideous skills dealing with individuals .
0	my dogs veterinarian is more qualified than this clown .
0	we have til sunday to know if he will make it .
0	ive used this business off and on for years .
0	i 'm appalled at how this company treats their patients .
0	i went to this business solely based on yelp reviews .
0	the whole session was just kinda rushed and rash .
0	dr. wickman is knowledgeable but too difficult to contact or schedule an appt .
0	when i first visited - on a friday - everything went well .
0	too difficult to contact the dr. or her nurse .
0	the entire scheduling process is much too corporate .
0	i 'm looking for another , smaller , practice to serve my needs .
0	this one just is n't worth the effort .
0	a sheep in wolves clothing !
0	at first glance this place seemed wonderful .
0	my husband and i got a cleaning and x-rays .
0	my husband was told he needed 12 fillings ...
0	this coming from 2 adults who get 2-3 cleanings per year .
0	their ploy did n't work .
0	this is n't his area of expertise at all .
0	i believed dr. ditesheim was truly the best cosmetic surgeon i found .
0	i felt so comfortable with him and his staff .
0	i had a breast augmentation 8 months ago and my results are unacceptable .
0	all totaling over double what i originally paid for the initial surgery .
0	i sent a letter voicing my concerns and received no response .
0	i requested my records and received no response .
0	i will now be searching for a more competent surgeon to do my revision .
0	what do you want me to do ?
0	make it again or do you want something different ? ''
0	i appreciated the offer , but her attitude was less than desirable .
0	and the frozen fruit to top it off !
0	was i supposed to gnaw on it ?
0	: ) add the vanilla whey protein powder for an extra boost !
0	i will no longer be a patient for the following reasons .
0	prior to visit versus during my visit ) .
0	as you may be aware of , blood work requires preparation such as fasting .
0	i have never met a more incompetent staff than at nevada eye and ear .
0	was not satisfied at all !
0	i will be going elsewhere from now on .
0	i will also let my friends know about my experience here .
0	well it never did .
0	unfortunately a very underwhelming experience !
0	my first appointment was awful , she was a terrible listener .
0	making judgements about my lifestyle that simply were not true .
0	i pleaded , argued , and begged for the referral .
0	and that i should contact him immediately next time symptoms arise .
0	i have no clue why this woman is a family doctor .
0	health department should be involved in mandating grocery stores to have power backup .
0	if not the hd then at least good business sense .
0	i think years ago this may have been a great place .
0	now , it is a cattle call .
0	totally my fault , i missed it .
0	do n't expect much personal attention .
0	every appointment i have had was over an hour late .
0	i have been given results for someone else on more than one occasion .
0	so i do n't see how they thought i was someone else .
0	i went in for just a sonogram and was there for over 3 hours .
0	this has happened at every appointment .
0	i have switched to the scottsdale office ... much much better experience ... .
0	today there were five people in the gym .
0	two of them are a couple and drive together .
0	the parking lot was almost full .
0	gym management has still not gotten the proper signage to actually tow cars .
0	the gym opened in 2012. it 's clearly not happening .
0	the man who checks for permits is useless .
0	he had no answer .
0	he also parks illegally in the lot .
0	he has quite possibly the easiest job in the world and is completely ineffective .
0	problem would be solved if mountainside actually towed cars .
0	some of the repeat offenders work inside the stadium and park there each game .
0	i 'm done with mountainside .
0	a lifetime is opening up in 2019 near the biltmore .
0	i can hardly wait .
0	i 'm going to encourage my gym friends to check out lifetime .
0	who cares about hippa violation ! !
0	i was a patient of dr. patel for over a year .
0	it is very apparent that it is all about the money in this office .
0	beware of this doctor and his unlicensed staff treating patients ! !
0	you are just a dollar sign to them ! !
0	be aware of this place !
0	not to mention his teeth are only a few years old .
0	long story short i got a second opinion and guess what ? ? ?
0	no cavities , no decay ! ! !
0	so why the immediate need to fill at 4 yrs old is beyond me .
0	i 'm not writing this review to bash the place .
0	i just do n't want parents/children to go through unnecessary procedures .
0	apart from the money scamming , the place is good .
0	i will not be returning because of this !
0	the other reviewers obviously have deep pockets .
0	not very bright service .
0	asked for ingredients for something and nobody knew .
0	got 3 salads , a falafel app and 2 drinks .
0	$ 93 ! ! !
0	i heard it was pricey but that is insane mixed with grandiose entitlement .
0	sad cause i was looking forward to a juice/raw restaurant on the east side .
0	i do love pulp kitchen and will go there from now on .
0	it can be smelly and dirty .
0	let 's just say the help do their best .
0	it seems to be cultural .
0	garbage in ... garbage out !
0	it takes learning about healthcare to get great healthcare .
0	that is true in all aspects if healthcare .
0	the internet make it easy .
0	especially if you study natural , holistic health options !
0	so within 20 minutes i was at the store to purchase it .
0	however , when i got there it was nowhere to found .
0	i 've never been spoken to like that regarding my plate on meatless monday .
0	in fact , other cashiers have just rubber banded my plate .
0	i understand policy and such but there 's nicer ways to go about things .
0	worse than a walk-in clinic .
0	treated like a revolving door or just an ohip/insurance card to be billed .
0	learn from my mistakes if you actually choose to go here for care .
0	do not pay up front .
0	check your own insurance benefits .
0	the problem is , they refused to refund me any money .
0	the final heaping load of salt in the wound ?
0	the $ 600 back brace is on amazon for $ 150 .
0	no one has bothered to talk to me .
0	apologize for the delay.. nothing .
0	this is the worst medical office i 've been in
0	i think the purpose of her doing that was for her to get tips ?
0	she did n't say during the session and was not very welcoming or friendly .
0	i would never go back there !
0	if there can be zero star rated , i would 've given them that !
0	i was sent from honor health hospital for physical rehabilitation .
0	as soon as i get there , i notice how filthy the place is .
0	the woman at the front desk as i came in ignored me .
0	i went to the room and it was even more disgusting .
0	the woman at he desk finally noticed me !
0	the staff and management followed me out begging me to stay .
0	literally , the staff and management were begging me to stay .
0	if you are going for physical rehab , go somewhere else .
0	worst doctors experience i have ever encountered .
0	avoid at all costs ! ! ! !
0	it only took me two appointments to flee from this place .
0	the technicians are not meticulous and they are not friendly at all .
0	yeah machines are alright ( not a single squat rack ) and somewhat clean .
0	i already knew in that moment that this is not going to be easy .
0	i ended up paying 135 because of course they want more money from me .
0	it is not even about the money , they are bunch of greedy liars .
0	even la fitness has an easier cancellation process !
0	extremely hot in the uncomfortable , loud waiting room .
0	bud room was nicely air conditioned , but very crowded and very loud .
0	**nurse review** so grateful to this dispensary for providing a cannabis r.n .
0	for consultations ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	we give her more stars than offered here .
0	definitely worth the time if you need questions answered .
0	i also know they up-sell ; fact ; my husband does n't have insurance .
0	why not just give him the regular cleaning ? ! ? !
0	it was a total waste of time .
0	i 'm headed elsewhere ... and taking my entire family with !
0	this is the worst establishment .
0	they dont gove 1 fuck about their patients .
0	dont recommend save time & money go somewhere else .
0	please dont here ! ! ! ! ! !
0	dr. young is fine , however , the staff is not .
0	after that , it went down hill .
0	she then left me a vm a few min .
0	because i owe them money .
0	then , cancel my appt .
0	because i am late ? ! ? !
0	glad i am done with this office .
0	sorry dr. young , your staff has made you look unprofessional and quite embarrassing .
0	sandy in the pharmacy gives a new meaning to the word ' rude ' .
0	i let her know how i felt .
0	calling the cvs main manager .
0	this place was a complete waste of time .
0	it 's extremely rare for me to leave a 1 star review .
0	no thank you , will never return here .
0	this is the worst place anyone can go for any type of therapy .
0	now the only thing that tells me is it 's all about the money !
0	please if you can avoid it go somewhere else .
0	je n'ai vraiment pas aimé ce gym .
0	je le trouve déjà mal disposé .
0	on se sent vite confiné .
0	il y a quand même pas mal d'appareils de muscu au 1er étage .
0	des casiers inutilisables et des miroirs cassés dans les salles d'entrainement .
0	des horaires pas très larges .
0	vraiment dommage surtout pour le prix .
0	yeah if i you id go elsewhere .
0	the dog is allowed on the beds and pillows that are used for treatment .
0	the equipment is old .
0	it 's not a professional medical facility .
0	if i could put 0 stars i would .
0	i went there almost 3 years ago and got all my mouth work done .
0	the dentist obviously does not know what she is doing .
0	its fallen out twice .
0	im very disappointed and i will not be returning .
0	i do not recommend dc dental on 19th ave and bell rd .
0	unless you like shitty work and wasting money .
0	ridiculous to wait that long with an appointment .
0	the first time i went it was wonderful .
0	the massage and facial were both great .
0	second time around the massage was wonderful , but the facial was awful .
0	approx 30 minutes of the girl rubbing my face and head .
0	it sure was relaxing but i wanted a facial not a head rub .
0	i will never go back there again .
0	terrible service and ridiculous prices .
0	my review in one word = rip-off !
0	this `` court appointed '' pc does n't deserve a single star .
0	be warned and do what you must to get his recusal !
0	no family is safe here .
0	you guys are literally never open .
0	super upsetting , because i love all the juices and products .
0	but i feel that the public should be notified .
0	my entire family had appointments with this dentist .
0	so the 5 star reviews are extremely misleading .
0	by the time i was leaving , i was almost in panic attack mode .
0	almost $ 20,000 in dental work was prescribed .
0	crowns on almost every molar needed , inlays on most others .
0	this is not for cosmetic purposes .
0	he said my teeth were full of cavities .
0	i had no idea how this could 've happened in 6 months .
0	my husband was also prescribed near $ 15000 in work .
0	! and this new dentist has been in the community 30 yrs .
0	so you tell me , out of three dentists .
0	who do you believe ? ? ?
0	once again , beware of the 5 star reviews .
0	they give you a discount if you write them .
0	and there is n't a phone number listed !
0	do n't feed me bullshit .
0	i would n't recommend anyone to go here .
0	was n't a horrible experience , but could have been better .
0	the office space is clean and modern .
0	my injections did turn out nicely though .
0	very hard to get an appointment .
0	i have gone to this clinic for both iui 's and an ivf cycle .
0	they have too many patients and you feel like a number .
0	we are know paying for that mistake .
0	definitely look elsewhere for someplace that is more organized if you have to option .
0	not the best place to seek medical care .
0	i would never risk another pregnancy with this practice .
0	the ultrasound given there showed incompetent cervix and bulging membranes .
0	he decided to do his own ultrasound .
0	when that showed an acceptable length of cervix .
0	terrible experience all around .
0	i would n't wish it on my worst enemy .
0	my father was admitted here after extensive back surgery .
0	his mind is completely foggy and he 's more incoherent as time moves forward .
0	do not see dr. michael schlaack !
0	he was smiling and mocking me the whole time .
0	he made me feel like i was there to get `` narcotics '' .
0	that was back in april .
0	the nurse told me `` we do n't do that .
0	we are pro-life here . ''
0	it is fda-approved to prevent pregnancy and will not harm an existing pregnancy .
0	if i could give this place negative stars i would .
0	do n't go to the gi department ! ! !
0	when i called to complain i was dismissed again .
0	they are just trying to get insurance money .
0	hate to say i saw this coming , but there you go .
0	mixing non-profit management with a retail establishment is recipe for disaster .
0	all amf locations are terrible .
0	high prices , old equipment , no or little tv 's .
0	just because i 've only wrote a couple of reviews mine was not posted .
0	omg~ generally i like massage envys .
0	but i decided i would still be pleasant and pay for the massage .
0	i had to go back to get my card .
0	horrible experience nearly every time i had to go here during my pregnancy .
0	she should not be allowed to interact with patients .
0	it felt like a cattle call when you get in there .
0	they want you in and out as quickly as possible .
0	they are irritated when you ask questions .
0	if you are looking for a caring dr this is not the place to go
0	overall , bad experience .
0	the receptionist was fine , standard customer service .
0	barely asked any questions and diagnosed me .
0	the level of competence here is very concerning .
0	i wrote a review in 2015 when my mom was in sante of mesa .
0	even calling does n't get results .
0	staff are under educated .
0	look beyond the decor and eating anytime you want in their restaurant and bistro .
0	just because they have carpet instead of tile how clean is that ?
0	as i said she was neglected and wasted away .
0	this spa has an arrogant , dictator running the men 's spa .
0	i sure hope someone sues these guys .
0	yesterday , i get a call asking to reschedule .
0	today , hrs before my appt , i get another call .
0	this time they said that their machine started acting up today .
0	seems they ca n't get their story straight .
0	( they did offer an appointment today at a location across town .
0	this place has excuse after excuse and nothing runs efficiently .
0	there are so many places you can go for an mri in vegas .
0	do n't go here .
0	i went to this establishment because i had a contact stuck in my eye .
0	i was charged almost $ 200 for the doctor to remove the contact .
0	she acted like she was afraid to touch me .
0	she treated me like i had the plague .
0	she was the most aloof and unfriendly doctor i have ever been to !
0	very dissatisfied with how she treated me .
0	do n't go here if you have an issue .
0	they 're all about the money !
0	based off my insurance , i had a deductible , as many others do .
0	plus , their obgyn 's are on par with dr. luh .
0	they sent me to collections over missing one payment .
0	they sit there with bitch faces and bad eyebrows .
0	i was always nice , too .
0	what can you do .
0	i went in for an infection .
0	i was paying out of pocket .
0	i let both the front office and the pa who was treating me know .
0	those two bills worth almost $ 3,000 were for a 30 minutes visit .
0	this was by far the most unprofessional and worst care i have ever experienced .
0	i regret ever going .
0	fairview hospitals birthing center is very mediocre .
0	i ca n't put negative stars ?
0	i should be able to .
0	what an effing joke .
0	why is this place open ?
0	went here with my wife .
0	i have bronchitis and my wife is showing symptoms of it .
0	she went in and was treated like dirt .
0	you guys are unprofessional and should be ashamed .
0	people , trust yelp reviews and move on to a different urgent care .
0	there is a reason this office has bad reviews
0	only choice is to leave a message .
0	reminded me of the bureaucracy at the government level .
0	dental clinic is terrible .
0	their excuse `` we are a teaching clinic '' .
0	great way to teach your students .
0	do n't even think of making a suggestion .
0	they will `` dismiss '' you as a patient .
0	on the plus side it hurt less than previous waxings .
0	i 'll try the other salons in the area .
0	they do not value repeat business i still feel ripped off !
0	look , a good optometrist is n't hard to find .
0	this is my second year going and they let me down .
0	i looked online and found the same glasses for an average of $ 60 .
0	this was my second time seeing her .
0	i ask if i could exchange these glasses for another pair .
0	not because the glasses were marked up , because they agreed they were n't .
0	their policy is 30 days .
0	group classes wo n't answer your individual needs .
0	they 'll always refer you to the individual therapist you 're to maintain .
0	16 week 4 part module you 'll go 4 weeks then off 1 week .
0	cuz guess what ? ! ?
0	kids in another room 4 ) doctors lead the group sessions .
0	7 ) water , pens and candy pieces are available upon entry .
0	it 's the smallest available .
0	a 1 '' inch is most apropos .
0	10 ) they accept all credit cards .
0	11 ) help yourself and get an electronic copy of the receipt .
0	enter ... get lectured ... review the homework .
0	17 ) no hard data or empirical data .
0	fair enough but at a minimum # surveys seeking confidential input could be provided .
0	**we need gradual steps down nothing definitively final like it is offered here .
0	a few sips in and i start to have a severe reaction ! ! !
0	i have been to other places and never had this problem ! !
0	being i work next door i frequented this place .
0	however i promise i will never return to a place with such negligence .
0	believe me , i get there 's a risk .
0	otherwise this may have ended a lot worse ! ! !
0	i set up an appointment which was fairly convenient .
0	or go somewhere else .
0	it may have been on their website , but i did n't see it .
0	right now i am just frustrated that i wasted over an hour on this .
0	the worst patient service i have ever encountered !
0	better business bureau and my insurance company will be hearing from me .
0	this is a scam , do not sign up with this company !
0	seriously , save your money .
0	it 's not even a real clinic once you walk in there .
0	the only machine that i 've seen in that place was the weight scale .
0	very nice staff , very professional and clean office .
0	more than ones they ran over one hour behind .
0	what 's the purpose to have an appointment then ?
0	i recommend this place , if you have extra time to waste !
0	it makes it feel like a chore shopping here !
0	definitely prefer other locations .
0	the space is so small and you are literally bumping into things .
0	i will definitely not be going back .
0	i 'd rather spend my money elsewhere .
0	i went here with my fiance because we purchased the 80 minute groupon massages .
0	first of all , we walked in and were n't greeted .
0	he was picking at his face and was very socially awkward .
0	the water they serve is terrible .
0	my therapist had really dry hands and did n't seem very experienced .
0	he talked the whole time and was n't professional at all .
0	my fiance 's therapist was alright .
0	it was awkward and not organized .
0	the entire appointment was not enjoyable .
0	i would not recommend going here for anything .
0	that 's about it .
0	had a positive ana lab result with my gp .
0	he recommended dr. peters at aara .
0	( in hindsight , i kind of have to agree with her there ! )
0	( why , if i had nothing wrong with me ? )
0	it turned out a few of my levels were above range , slightly .
0	since she is a specialist , my co-pay was $ 60 .
0	i might as well have flushed my $ down the toilet .
0	never again ! ! !
0	the place is pretty new .
0	i was out of there in less then 5minutes !
0	this amount was just for seeing the dr. not anything else .
0	make sure before you go to this place that you really have an emergency !
0	try your local clinic or ask friends what to do .
0	unbelievable that even with insurance this is what i have to pay !
0	all together $ 990.00 .
0	this was the worst hospital i 've ever been to .
0	we had the pleasure of having nurse jaqueline .
0	other patients having pain needing help they yelled at and told them to wait .
0	please if you have another option for care go there .
0	anyways i hope this helps others in the future .
0	he is condescending and short to say the least .
0	incessantly checked his watch during my short 10 minute appointment .
0	i will never return to this doctor for care !
0	i am just now getting correctly diagnosed with a rheumatologist .
0	they do not take insurance as they run as a chiropractic clinic .
0	please save your money .
0	he even interacted with my daughter ( 8mo ) .
0	he made me feel very comfortable .
0	we asked questions & we received answers .
0	on this note , it has been 3 weeks since i was seen .
0	she is also now on nystatin syrup taken by mouth 3-4x a day .
0	so on the safe side we need to treat her too .
0	i was seen ( not really ) by dr. timothy eichenlaub .
0	he seriously walked in our room .
0	he did neither ! !
0	that was seriously the last of seeing him .
0	we were so shocked !
0	could n't believe it .
0	that 's it ? ! ? ! ? !
0	but we were pissed !
0	are you freaking kidding me right now , ring worm !
0	first of all how can you diagnosis someone without even examining them ?
0	he prescribed me another fu**ing cream !
0	ketoconazole cream ( antifungal ) .
0	same as the nystatin !
0	so great just another cream to put on my damn nipples !
0	we were in & out within 30minutes .
0	the patients before us were in and out so quick too !
0	if you do n't like your job , go do something else .
0	no examination & false diagnosis !
0	the wait times , however , are horrendous .
0	this nationwide vision center store is horrible !
0	they do n't do that at this store .
0	... ..'scuse me ? ? ? ?
0	was *i* supposed to audit the order ?
0	hmmmmm , well i sure could n't agree more !
0	no offer to be seated was forthcoming either .
0	the glasses `` fitter '' adjusted them and if anything , they were worse .
0	they lie in their notes and purposely turn away patients .
0	i was referred to the tempe location for medication .
0	after a very lengthy argument i was rescheduled .
0	in the notes they wrote that i was a no show .
0	the next 2 visits both included rude staff and a less than satisfactory .
0	the following 3 visits matched my experience of the first visit .
0	as the scottsdale location is now able to offer medications i have transferred .
0	i highly advise that no one visit the tempe location .
0	did n't even look at me he just told his assistant .
0	i have never been treated so poorly by any person in the medical profession .
0	do not use this office .
0	i scheduled an apointment 2 weeks ago for may 1st at 2pm .
0	today being the absolute worst .
0	originally posted on fb in june .
0	update at the bottom .
0	so , where do i begin ? ? ?
0	they never did , so i called back and made another appointment for today .
0	i mean , are u kidding me ?
0	they did this to another patient today as well .
0	i 've never been to an office so unprofessional and unorganized .
0	why not tell me that when i asked about having these two things checked ?
0	we ended up walking out after i said a few choice words !
0	now we know why there was n't a wait !
0	so this is your warning !
0	do n't become a patient .
0	ummmmm ... ... .no !
0	you charged our insurance over $ 100 for bloodwork i never had !
0	you actually owe our insurance company money !
0	i will be calling them about that now !
0	i 'll laugh when she shuts down***
0	the hygienist pushes extra dental work and cleanings .
0	i got the deep-cleaning 2 months ago and my gums feel worse than before .
0	she barely smiled or made eye contact .
0	i am now looking for a new dentist .
0	beware ! ! ! ! ! !
0	this office is a rip off !
0	i called dr. inga 's office because i was referred to him .
0	all five of us went in for cleanings and x-rays .
0	four of us were told that we needed work done .
0	only my 4 year old was clear .
0	i told them i had to wait on his .
0	i ask her why is it so much ?
0	she proceeds to tell me that we have crappy insurance .
0	fast forward a few weeks .
0	are you kidding me ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	after all i should have checked myself ... right ?
0	then i received a bill in the mail for an additional $ 630 .
0	i defiantly was not going back to that office .
0	but the story gets worse ! ! !
0	to my surprise my son did not have any cavities .
0	he did additional x-rays and nothing !
0	you have 10,000 patients ahead of you .
0	women be warned ! ! ! !
0	i work in the area and my feet ache as a general rule .
0	so i finally decided to treat myself to some reflexology .
0	after i asked for just foot reflexology only !
0	the girl offered a service including head and arms .
0	`` no '' again `` just feet please '' i said .
0	the positioning was awkward and not at all relaxing .
0	i could barely feel it .
0	i said `` ummm no i do not think so '' .
0	currently , i am in contact with az massage board regarding this .
0	enter at your own risk !
0	i was referred by my dr. for a skin check .
0	i called to set up an appointment .
0	13 minutes later , i decided to hang up .
0	he has ignored all my pleas to help me and resolve this .
0	shame on you alexander villares m.d .
0	the medical board is investigating .
0	this dr. prabhu is expanding the business at the cost of their patients !
0	beware and use this center at your own risk !
0	this the worst hospital i have ever been in .
0	it was so bad , that my family was bringing in all my meals .
0	you have to constantly check with the staff about outside appointments .
0	often they forget to schedule them or schedule them at the wrong time .
0	twice i was late being transported back to a hospital for treatment .
0	once i was so late i had to reschedule .
0	ten percent ofthe nursing staff actually care .
0	i have a food allergy to eggs and kept being serve redeggs .
0	i finally just asked for toast which was usually burned and cold .
0	most meals were served with canned fruit which never ferried .
0	this usually happened on weekend nights .
0	if you or your family need rehap care , do not go to kindred .
0	this used to be a good facility , but not any more .
0	they need to change the management .
0	until then , avoid this place at all costs .
0	omg , warning , do not buy a computer from this place .
0	i had several issues and they would n't help me at all .
0	there response was well there is nothing we can do .
0	i ask all the right questions before buying an expensive refurbished computer .
0	slowest computer i ever owned and constantly freezing .
0	no microsoft word either !
0	waited 3 days and still no call back .
0	they also were aware that i was moving to california the next day .
0	i did call them back to see what they could do to help me .
0	they simply said there 's nothing we can do .
0	they got their money and i 'm left with a crappy computer .
0	what computer does n't have microsoft word or excel ?
0	you 've been warned !
0	stay away from this place !
0	my first ( and only ) visit was surprisingly awful .
0	this visit took 2 1/2 hours without receiving any relief ( an adjustment ) .
0	would never ever return .
0	but this facility is a slum .
0	stained , dirty chairs in waiting room .
0	dirty , worn carpet .
0	place needs major updating and renovation .
0	it ca n't be they do n't have the money ... .
0	no sign posted saying lane 2 is not functioning .
0	convenience of location outweighed by hassle of doing business .
0	will drive past to walgreens next time .
0	they over book ! ! ! !
0	horrible staff and consideration to their patients !
0	had to come in for drug screen for employment .
0	got here @ 5:15 .
0	3 people in waiting room , one before and one after us .
0	nobody has come from the back .
0	that means that they must all be having dinner .
0	i guess that 's why this place is empty !
0	first availability is 7:30 p.m .
0	there is no one here ! !
0	will never come here again ! !
0	guess i should take that 7:30 appointment ... this is truly absurd !
0	i had the worst experience at this establishment today .
0	i 'm very disappointed , i was made to feel unwanted as a patient .
0	i will not return .
0	it really sucks that pre-employment physicals require you to go to concentra locations .
0	still horrible long wait times .
0	physical exam done in 5 minutes .
0	i added time to because of waiting for your paperwork at the end .
0	i created a yelp account specifically for this review .
0	again , she got a reading of 97.x .
0	yes , i know , not high enough to be considered a fever .
0	but as we told the med .
0	assistant , hes been having fevers on and off .
0	point is , i know the way she took his temp .
0	was not done properly .
0	he asked basic questions like `` does he have a cough ?
0	how do you , as a pa prescribe medication on no diagnosis ?
0	we said thanks and went on our way .
0	i would not suggest this place to anyone .
0	they need to staff at nellis omg sucks sucks
0	the best descriptor that rises to the top of my experience is just weird .
0	it was not really a reading .
0	i 've had several .
0	i do n't think she really knows how to use the tarot cards either .
0	i can say that everyone here is very nice , incredibly sweet .
0	i do n't have the sense that she is gifted at all though .
0	this type of thing is not for everyone .
0	maternity care : ladies and husbands , save your sanity .
0	( there was a woman in transition in the waiting room screaming ! !
0	not in my abdomen ! !
0	they continually dismissed me like i had no idea about life .
0	i told them i need ultrasound of my stomach organ .
0	so i get wheeled down and they take my vitals .
0	my mom was tired and i was fed up so we left .
0	ooh and btw , i did not have a uti .
0	my overall experience was one star , by default .
0	my daughter has been going here for past 2 years .
0	the dentist has always been friendly and professional .
0	unfortunately it is extremely difficult to schedule a cleaning .
0	every time i call i receive their voicemail .
0	i have been trying to make an appointment since february .
0	i said i was not interested and that was just not acceptable .
0	i hope others do n't have to go through what i went through .
0	please , stay away from ideal image ... what a rip off they are .
0	okay , i guess i 've vented enough .
0	my doctor is fine .
0	but getting a call back is the worst .
0	i 've been trying to get my test results for 2 days now .
0	the message says any calls after 4pm will be returned the next day .
0	now i have to wait until monday to review my test results .
0	i 've been calling for 2 days now ... the worst !
0	i 'm writing this for my wife who does n't really do yelp .
0	well , it was a good recommendation because we both loved her .
0	very intelligent and straight forward .
0	that 's fine with us .
0	i 'm sad we 're not using her anymore .
0	she is 100 % type-a personality and we liked her to .
0	i legit did not know this many people would be in the room .
0	definitely not a movie set .
0	again , she commanded that delivery room like a boss .
0	i was very impressed ... she was very `` movie set '' good .
0	complete rip off ! !
0	i found her on groupon and bought 30 units .
0	i have had over 20 botox treatments from approximately six different technicians .
0	i 've never been able to furrow my brow after a treatment , ever .
0	she either waters down her formula or completely missed my muscles .
0	dont waste your money ! !
0	gee thanks for the call .
0	the customer service is terrible and unacceptable !
0	would not recommend this company !
0	i have been to arizona natural selections four times .
0	i bought four different strains of what they said were heavy indicas .
0	they all were trash except for larry og which was okay .
0	i also bought two grams of bubble hash that was trash and tasted horrible .
0	i smoked that whole 1/8 last night and did n't feel anything .
0	i will be making the drive to another dispensary .
0	do n't waste your time here they sell low quality everything .
0	please do not get any work done by him ! ..
0	he has no standards bad job all around !
0	she talked down to me like if i could not afford any procedure .
0	after speaking to his staff i will most def not go there ever.. !
0	? , when before it used to be free .
0	not only that but what if you do not choose to get anything done.. ?
0	they are most certainly going to lose patients with there new protocol .
0	my experience was very bad .
0	who charge more not necessarily is the best .
0	it was an experience to forget .
0	this facility was awful !
0	only one or two nurses and cnas met his needs .
0	i shopped at this store even before it was renovated a few years ago .
0	the response was `` well i ordered it and it did n't come '' .
0	hmmmm , does that mean the markham store does n't have knowledgeable staff ?
0	i stopped in later that day and sure enough it was on the shelf .
0	she answered `` oh '' .
0	cashiers are not friendly , not sure they even know what a smile is .
0	not the case at healthy planet .
0	really high turn around of staff too .
0	takes so long to find someone to help .
0	i never see more than 2-3 people working there .
0	the worst experience in my life .
0	i have never been treated so rude .
0	if i could give 0 stars , i would .
0	i should have picked a different location even if it was further away .
0	she kept saying , `` oh , you 're doing so well !
0	the blood is coming out so fast ! ''
0	minutes after leaving , the big bruise is already visible .
0	i wo n't be coming back to this location at all .
0	the phlebotomist should quit her job .
0	i thought i had found the most amazing site ever !
0	and we will most likely return it .
0	you cant run a business with this crappy of a return policy .
0	just awful primary care experience .
0	first off , it 's impossible to get an appointment .
0	secondly , they only place you with midlevels , no doctors .
0	well , that was a complete lie .
0	my new pcp does it without issue !
0	( note , i have been taking vyvanse for 14 years . )
0	we had dad here for rehab again .
0	the leadership is not as solid as it was at our last stay .
0	we 've used the same companies for years .
0	call lights are never answered .
0	my dad had to wait over two hours for his pain meds .
0	no one answered the call light on several occasions until sometimes 30-60 mins later .
0	not what we experienced before !
0	the service here is not so exceptional .
0	which is kudos for them .
0	they also have good deals every now and then !
0	up to 50 % off of items .
0	after i rejected making an account there , she turned very unfriendly and cold .
0	send me my damn popeye 's dollars to my address .
0	pros : their pa , erica , is nice with no nonsense .
0	i 've been a customer at this whole foods location for over 5 years .
0	it used to be the best , especially prior to amazon taking over .
0	it is depressing most of the time to even come to the store .
0	another issue i 've noticed is food quality .
0	the quality standard has absolutely gone downhill from what it used to be .
0	but the issue continues and has been ongoing for over a year .
0	see list item # 3 under `` safe shopping '' here : https : //www.wholefoodsmarket.com/handling-meat-poultry
0	the wait times here are horrid .
0	had to switch to a different doc .
0	i 've been to high-end salons and this did not even come close .
0	i was in and out in less than 20 minutes .
0	unfortunately someone went into my locker and stole money out of it .
0	i wo n't be coming back .
0	if you come here do n't trust the lockers cause you may get robbed
0	no alternative were offered .
0	only pay us and we might help you .
0	had an appt yesterday for my son .
0	she stated that it 's against their policy and we could not be seen .
0	it 's easier just to say `` no , that 's the policy '' .
0	i checked in and sat down .
0	maybe 3 people ahead of me .
0	that 's not what i wanted to do .
0	i was sick and did n't want to drive somewhere else .
0	what kind of urgent care does n't have a doctor available ?
0	i left and went to med post .
0	got in right away .
0	i went to perfect image last summer with a groupon and i told them .
0	i was n't sure if i wanted to purchase a package .
0	of course , she ran a credit check and the next time i returned .
0	i was told , i could n't get my money back .
0	i was n't able to finish my treatments last year .
0	so , i started again this summer .
0	the treatments never lasted an hour .
0	they never took track of measurements , to see if they were working .
0	i received a call from the owner ( kevin ) asking to reschedule .
0	i declined , and i asked for a refund .
0	this maybe one of the worse stores in the valley .
0	along with bad attitudes comes with the staffs sporting very poor tattoos !
0	fish , all frozen nothing fresh .
0	candy section is good .
0	kleven , and van hamm are actually quite good .
0	in the meantime we spent our own money to go to one .
0	worst urgent care i 've been to .
0	the second worst massage i 've ever had .
0	it was an exceptionally unrelaxing way to finish a lousy , expensive massage experience .
0	i was going with christy kutz and my appointments with her felt rushed .
0	no good customer service , no drs follow ups .
0	taking my business elsewhere .
0	you literally ca n't talk to anyone with the ability to make billing decisions .
0	please do n't take your loved ones there .
0	they lack compassion and urgency .
0	they did n't try to help her recover .
0	it 's very difficult to communicate with anyone .
0	they ca n't tell you what days or times they 'll be there .
0	do your research ! ! ! ! !
0	i would tip the guys anyway before this cook prep fee started .
0	this review is for the rest of the huntersville practice .
0	two weeks later i get a letter from a collection agency for that amount .
0	well it is fast .
0	and the people are nice .
0	the test itself however is inaccurate .
0	of course they wont tell the company what it was i tested positive for .
0	just a sheet that says positive/negative .
0	maybe they just decided to flip a coin .
0	my 95-year-old mother was sent here for rehab after a minor fall .
0	ca n't wait to get her out of this place .
0	had an appointment at 3pm .
0	arrived at 2:45 pm taken me in the back .
0	checked vitals at 3:05 pm .
0	that was at 3:15pm came back to see me at 4:40pm poor service !
0	really no stars should be given to this hospital
0	she said that calls had been made earlier in the morning .
0	however , there was no offer made .
0	instead , i scheduled an appointment with another pediatric ophthalmologist .
0	these are the reasons why i 'll return .
0	very disappointed with cheese department .
0	out of everything we like or do n't carry it .
0	san diego store is small but puts this whole food store to shame .
0	wo n't be going back here .
0	total waste of time .
0	for the most part it was a pleasant experience .
0	she left me with three nearly bald spots .
0	i told her please do n't leave three more bald spots .
0	she told me she did n't need that much .
0	i then asked why did angela take such a huge sample .
0	she could n't explain her action .
0	patty was so much nicer than angela .
0	not only that i left with most of my hair on my head .
0	it 's not stated online .
0	it 's taped half ass on the door .
0	bottom line , put more information on your stupid website !
0	i loved my sons doctor and this place .
0	ca n't believe this .
0	i finally had enough because i had never encountered anything like that before .
0	i cancelled my appointments , got a second opinion and guess what ? ? ?
0	my children 's teeth are fine ! ! ! ! !
0	this office should be ashamed of themselves ! ! !
0	i went here a few times and found that dr were n't very experienced .
0	she ended up doing a biopsy in the wrong spot !
0	on top of it all , you have to wait 2-3 weeks for results .
0	i had to call them to get my results both times ! !
0	does anyone recommend a really good and experienced dermatologist ?
0	this is by far the worst place i have ever been to !
0	so i waited for about 25-30 mins still nobody ! ! !
0	at this point i was so confused !
0	i 've gone many times .
0	but what did i get in the mail ?
0	a bill stating i owed money for that visit !
0	where do i start ?
0	she then left the room .
0	unfortunately i missed my appointment , which has never happened before .
0	i never got a call back .
0	are these people serious ? !
0	like i would ever do business with an office or doctor that they refer ?
0	glad i left them months ago .
0	i now realize that when i researched dr. vas sabeeh , d.o .
0	my consultation for breast implants was a complete waste of time .
0	i do n't think this surgeon has much experience .
0	he did not and perhaps could not answer my questions fully .
0	the guy actually creeped me out .
0	check out where he went to medical school - midwestern university .
0	it rates really low .
0	lastly he is a d.o .
0	there are so many better trained surgeons out there .
0	i was just there .
0	i felt like i wasted 67 $ .
0	i got the deal from social media .
0	$ 37 for assessment n $ 30 for xray .
0	i needed to know if i go regularly how much i pay .
0	they want u to go back again before the answer .
0	i basically just wasted money and my time .
0	why make it so complicated n waste my time .
0	just tell me everything on the same day .
0	wasted 2 hours of my life i could never take back .
0	i could have done something more productive .
0	this place has absolutely no regard for my time .
0	and i got home and the nurse did n't even start the pump .
0	i had to call them and start it myself .
0	what if i had n't noticed ?
0	i could have been seriously hurt from that !
0	oh - and my scheduler has messed up my appointments a few times .
0	it felt like i was talking to a collector .
0	she started laying into me for not bringing in proof of income yet .
0	the first person i talked to said nothing even remotely close to that .
0	it 's a joke .
1	i 'm a pretty picky hair person considering i do n't have amazing hair .
1	lauren is amazing and the salon is well-run .
1	i love coming here .
1	the customer service is amazing .
1	they know my name when i walk in .
1	the lather lounge with hand massage ( which is complimentary ) is amazing .
1	oh my goodness so worth it !
1	feel like a new person .
1	dr. thomas nagy was my surgeon and he was absolutely fantastic .
1	and just like that it was over and i was recovering .
1	all of the instruction for post op are easy to follow and straightforward .
1	however , it is tax deductible , so that 's a bonus .
1	i just honestly ca n't recommend these guys enough .

1	i admit that i was skeptical at first .
1	it all sounded too good to be true .
1	but i trusted in her method .
1	the weight loss would come , i was assured .
1	still , she did not give up .
1	in the last year , everything that karen said during our first visit happened !
1	sometimes so slowly that i barely noticed .
1	initially , it was reduced inflammation and very little weight loss .

1	i have lost 50 lbs .
