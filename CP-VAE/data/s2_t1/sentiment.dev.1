i was transported here and well taken care of .
i had half my skull taken out to help with the bleeding/swelling .
it 's now been about 4 weeks and i 'm so very happy .
if it was n't for them i may not be here right now ...
staff is very friendly and courteous in person and over the phone .
the amount of paperwork i had to fill out was very reasonable .
i will be going back .
my brother is at present in this hospital .
i am normally very critical and a patient 's advocate .
my brother was airlifted here from bullhead city .
he has had very good care .
his doctors are friendly , informative , they explain things to him and us .
he is now on the 3rd floor for rehab .
after having a pretty mean stroke .
he has a great team that inspire and work him .
he is doing very well .
first went to a `` groupon '' deal at pearl vision .
waste of time and money !
decided to try sunset vision inside the henderson costco .
the front office and prep personnel are friendly , patient and awesome !
and , what can i say about the doctor of optometry ?
( was it dr .
he was professional and he listened ( and responded appropriately ) to my concerns .
what a world of difference from the `` doctor '' at pearl vision !
sunset vision ( inside the henderson costco ) is well worth the $ 89 .
i 'll go back again next year .
dr stephens is amazing , our whole family has been with her for years !
she truly cares and takes her time when we need to see her !
i would n't go anywhere else !
went to this urgent care last week because i was sick ( obviously ) .
i even arrived as the front receptionist was getting ready to go to lunch .
the staff is the reason i will be going back .
friendly , knowledgeable , and genuine .
i was checked on several times to see if i was okay .
i was constantly updated about what was going to be happening next .
the facility is well kept , clean , and very nice .
my experience as a whole was above par .
a favorite place of ours .
the value is extremely good as is the service .
the treatments are also very good .
more relaxing than therapeutic but very good nevertheless .
dr. chon and his staff have been amazing during every visit .
i had quite a few problems .
i almost wanted to pull out the tooth myself .
i do n't know what it is .
maybe he has light hands .
i did n't feel anything !
you guys are awesome .
i really love dr. le and the staff at eyesite of anthem .
i also did n't care for his office staff .

i was unable to even locate the spice channel .
i only hesitate to give a fifth star for two reasons .

accompanied my husband to get his night doses of sleep aid .
also , they check your photo id to make sure your legal .
then you pick out what you need .
purchase was a smooth process .
about a year ago i found karen after doing some research online .
i signed up for three sessions as part of a weight loss program .
according to karen , eliminating these foods would lead to many improvements .
karen told me that many things would change .
she told me not to expect overnight results .
this was not a quick fix .
i admit that i was skeptical at first .
it all sounded too good to be true .
but i trusted in her method .
the weight loss would come , i was assured .
still , she did not give up .
in the last year , everything that karen said during our first visit happened !
sometimes so slowly that i barely noticed .
initially , it was reduced inflammation and very little weight loss .
however , as karen had told me , the weight came off .
looking back , it is amazing how far i 've come .
i have lost 50 lbs .
in as many weeks .
i sleep more soundly and do not feel tired when i wake up anymore .
i feel happier , clearer and more energized mentally .
i am glad that i did .
dr. pasetti was extremely helpful in offering great advice and options moving forward .
the staff was exceptional , friendly and top notch .

and they are all well deserved !
stocked up on goodies for new years .
this place is pretty spacious and have a huge selection of alcohol .

dr. joseph candela is the best ! !
i have never experienced a doctor that cares so much for his patients .
i usually am seen without 5 to 15 minutes of my appointed time .
his pa , kelly , is also wonderful .
i ca n't say enough about how wonderful they are .
they both truly care ... and that 's not easily found anymore .
since august we have experienced nothing but excellent and friendly healthcare .

the staff that monitor the parking are d-backs employees .
there are two different men that work in the parking lot .
the lot will be full but there are only three people in the gym .

it was a technology i was looking for all my life .
i did the teacher training in 2018 in order to dive deeper .
through the teachings , i gathered so much information that was n't available elsewhere .
but what was more valuable was how much it changed me for the better .
i was able to shed so many layers that was no longer serving me .
i was able to reprogram patterns that were destructive and outdated .
kundalini yoga is the perfect tool to do just do and more .
fabulous nicole and crew capture the essence of yoga each saturday .
i find myself saying at the end of the session must i go now ?
truly a wonderful way to end a week or ease into a monday .
great people and service .
