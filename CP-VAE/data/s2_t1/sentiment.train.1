cut and dried - dr. goth was outstanding .

they really know their stuff .
beyond knowing their stuff is their continual dialogue with patients .
then we would get into planning for that day and going forward .
i was involved in the therapy .
and we continued in this joint planning over a month of treatments .
good resource for most all of us .
she is a great technician to boot !
i needed a quick appointment and did n't want to wait several weeks .
i took a gamble and picked first available , which was dr. chuang .
i could n't have disagreed more on the negative reviews .

two seconds of adjustments and bam it 's fixed !

i have n't had a workout yet that i walked away feeling unchallenged .
what i do like is that the workouts vary from class to class .
i hate cursing and the disparaging comments that often come along with it .
being vulgar does n't make me feel more like a fighter .
my only con is this .
i would like them to offer another option for their classes .
it seems it 's just one deal with $ 99 for unlimited classes .
dr. gawley is the best .

his staff is friendly , yet professional .
the staff is also knowledgeable and discreet which is greatly appreciated .
what is n't awesome about this store ? ! ? ! ? !

after every session with her , i feel like a whole new me .
the spa was cozy & the massage therapists were very professional and courteous .

the paid staff ( docs , nurses , med assistants , etc . )
overall though , it 's a decent er .
what a huge relief .
but , it made a big difference for my dad and my family .
you ca n't buy moments like that - thanks easy medical store .
i also liked hearing that she is more into non-surgical solutions than surgery .
i left with many good ideas to think about .
so far so good .
i have been coming to this dentist for years and have felt comfortable here .
these doctors and pas are amazing .
first , you 'll notice that there 's no reception window .
the receptionists sit in the waiting room with ipads to check you in .
there are lots of local offices for this practice .

personally , i 've found the doctors to be better than the pas .
my last visit was actually with dr. partridge .

i did not get the milk tea .
i came for the curry fish/beef balls .
it worked out , so that was all fine and dandy .
the curry here is surprisingly aromatic .
i would not liken this to chinese curry .
it smells more like a malaysian or indian curry ?
it 's spicy , in a leaves-your-tongue-tingly-after-eating kinda way .
they 've got a nice texture while being soft .
that was kinda cool .
this place is wonderful !
the staff are helpful and friendly .

the staff showed me a demonstration how the crowns are made .
overall i had a good experience and will be returning for cleanings .
this is my 'go to ' pharmacy .
it 's so easy to get in/out , i love it .
i come here to buy greeting cards during special occasions and holidays .
for couponers , they give you immediate rewards with coupons as you checkout .
unfortunately , i rarely use them because i only buy what i need .
great place to shop though .
i find it hilarious .
return factor - 100 %
all in all though .
the office seems also to run very efficiently .

been wanting to get my teeth whitened for a while now .
tried strips in the past but it did n't work all that well .

the best part is you feel full but not heavy nor bloated .
definitely worth going back over and over again
had my hair dyed by april recently and she did an amazing job !
definitely my go-to spot for hair and spa services .
the procedure itself was totally painfree .
i am not exaggerating .
i was not even aware when the molar was removed .
it all boiled down to not stretching properly .
i was first seen by a d.o .
( doctor of osteopathic medicine ) who is a medical doctor ( m.d . )
which made me much more comfortable and confident .
i was examined by the d.o .
if you 're not familiar , a radiologist is also an m.d .
( medical doctor ) who specializes in reading and interpreting x-rays .
examined me and x-rays were completed , i was seen by dr. madejek .

2016 yelp review # 38
this doctor is a truly remarkable human being .
it was a miracle that we asked for a second opinion .
his experience and charity work are surely a blessing to encounter under any circumstances .
i wish you nothing but the best .
1st visit : i was greeted by kyli and jill both were very nice .
i watched an information video .
she was so kind and courteous !
i was so happy and relieved !
customer service is of utmost importance to this office and to me .
they are truly top notch !
i adore coming here , especially for their fabulously priced plant proteins !
i needed my annual eye exam and decided to try focused on eyes .
i 'm happy i did !
it was a pleasant experience .
thanks to dr. lucas and her team !
pospisil dentistry is the best !
thanks pospisil team for always making my visits the best they can be ! !
awesome front office staff , great doctors and incredible treatment .
i could n't ask for more !
i am rarely trendy but straight hair lacking frizz tempted me like the devil !
after researching the price throughout the area , i made an appointment .
rina was so pleasant and so far i am very pleased with the service .
i will definitely return when i need a hair affair .
so i started with doing b-12 mic shots .
you would buy 4 shots & do them every week .
i did n't feel sluggish at all .
hcg changed my life !
there is a strict diet you need to go on for 24 days .

it asked `` are you bored of your regular workout routine ? ''
i always do get bored easily ! ''
the energy level of the trainers here is incredible .
the theme is , `` never give up . ''
today was just a taste of what their boxing classes are actually like .
there were grimaces , sweat flying everywhere , groans , and then also laughter .

that 's what makes this place unique .

they do accept most insurances but have great low-cost options if you do n't .
dr. van and dr. unger are great !
you can tell they like what they do .
the location is ugly though .
the service is beautiful .
it is wierd though that they have cookies in their lobby .

douglas started off nice touches and started to hit all my pressure points .
he did my shoulder and back really well .
no facial ( thats separate ) i do feel much better .
a little sore but a good kind of sore .
my bf says it was okay .
at the end of our session they waited outside until we got dressed .
they were waiting with a cup of water .
then we paid and asked for a receipt .
and they do n't give out receipt .
oh wells no biggie .
then our shuttle took us back to the hotel .
now i 'm soft , smooth , and less sore !

the services were amazing ( massages ) and very good ( pedicures ) .
i had elizabeth a perform my massage .
hunny ... her 30+ years of experience truly showed .
my attendant was very good and was very complimentary of my dry feet .
y'all there were no snacks in the spa .
they had water and i swear two pitiful looking oranges in the bowl .
i was like wth .
every spa must have snacks .
now i know to ask from here on out !
i 'm going to add one more vote of support to the chorus .
essence of life has so many great products and the pricing is great .
in my opinion , dr. schroeder is the best !
i should also note that his staff has been wonderful as well ! !
great place cheap prices friendly staff .
needless to say we went back multiple times while we where there .
this is an awesome shop with a wonderful selection of an eclectic assortment .
the owners are helpful on any information you might need .
the jewelry in there is even handmade by the owners .
i went to the women 's imaging for a routine mammogram .
it was that time , my doctor said and i dread these exams .
who really likes their body parts being smashed ?
i arrived at for my 11:15 am appointment about 40 minutes early .
i really love when i do n't have a long wait time .
they respected my time and glad everything went smoothly .
my thoughts on mammograms now are they are n't that bad .
thanks for making this a good experience for me and respecting my time .
this is probably the best walk in clinic i 've been to in years .
the downside is the wait times but overall the service has been exemplary .
receptionists have been courteous and efficient .
the doctors have been very professional and more thorough than my family doctor .
dr. rick is the best !
his injections do n't hurt .
he 's conservative with his treatment .
he loves what he does .
he moved his office into scottsdale and i drive from aj for him .
lilly is an amazing hygienist !
the office is so friendly , helpful , and professional .
dr. davis puts you at ease , answers all questions .
and makes you laugh .
i would n't go anywhere else .

i highly recommend brookstone dental .
judy is an excellent hygienist and very knowledgeable .
thanks to a great team !
we have been here twice now , and both experiences have been wonderful .
the staff was very nice and the wait was n't very long .
they did n't give us any grief about bringing her in at all .
they staff really knows how do handle children and comforts the parents .
i will always choose this facility .
today my daughter 's regular rmt , stacey grigsby , was unavailable .
without periodic massage , neither of us could function .
so we opted for a newly hired rmt , natalie aviles .
she knew exactly what to do to give my daughter substantial relief from pain .
now after an hour 's massage from natalie , she 's feeling much better .
you 're in good hands with these people !
dr. black was such a great person to give this exam .
he was helpful , informed and patient .
i recommend this place for your eyecare needs .
they got us in and out quickly !
on top of everything , our exam and glasses was covered 100 % ! !
i scheduled more appointments for my husband and i on the spot ! !
she did a good job and i like the result .
they may want to communicate a bit better about confirming reservations .
came here for the first time today and was very pleased .
the cooling spray for numbing was great and it helped tremendously with the pain .
the technician was knowledgable and very nice .
will be coming back here for sure !
i really appreciated how thorough they were with me as well .
the guy at check in was very friendly and helpful .
megan is very knowledgable and i 've had great results .
be sure to try the vi peel !
my wife found this place searching the internet .
the consultation was awesome and free ! ! ! !
amy , suzette , and juanita are awesome .
they are compassionate and make you feel like you 're their only patient .
our insurance is great but stopped covering fertility , of course !
we are seven weeks pregnant as of today .
their is no clinic i would choose over green valley fertility partners .
mind you this is sunday !
checked her vitals , did an ultrasound , gave her an iv .
they are the greatest !
dr lundgren is a miracle worker !

our morning weekend walks always takes us here .
great atmosphere and bakery , hot/cold foods .
place still looks bustling .
i have had a neck injury with herniations , scar tissue and the works .
this felt great and increased the range of my neck movement .

they do n't oversell you like most places !
great place , totally worth every penny .
i would definitely recommend this place to go to when u want a massage !
everyone here is so nice & comforting and welcoming !
well , she sure did !
she even gave me some stretching exercises to help improve my back problems .
you are an angel and a lifesaver !
they were very helpful in filling my prescription for my cat .
i saw dr. banfield for a root canal yesterday .
first of all he is so nice .
the money i spent for the laughing gas was well worth it .
it made 45 minutes feel like 10 although it was quite funny tasting .
i went home with ibuprofen which i took yesterday .
would recommend 5000 % .
they also call to remind you when you need cleanings .
that personal touch goes a long way .
mandana kheshtchin and navid javadi are both extremely gentle and personable .
they are down to earth and reasonable in their prices .
i had a 60 minute massage with maxfield .
it felt like a very slow , focused massage that pinpointed troubled areas .
also , the place seems very nice , comfortable , and a little fancy .
marshall the pharmacist took care of me today .
i 've been getting my teeth cleaned here for the past 3 years .
i highly recommend this office .
the staff is extremely friendly .
their services have helped prevent me from getting cavities .
so glad i found dr gombert and his fine staff a few years ago .
found dr gombert and he 's been just as great as my previous dentist .
the entire staff is awesome , from reception to the hygienists .
i love cloud nine !
i 've been going there for massage for many years .
they never keep you wait and the staff is very friendly .
i do n't think i 'll ever use another pharmacy .
she makes the entire experience informative , fun , comfortable , and easy .
you will not be disappointed !
i met the owner 's daughter upon arrival .
she was super nice and helpful shortly after we walked in .
my only disappointment was my purchase on a whisker for the matcha tea .
it was $ 20 and it did not work .
hence why it was n't working the way it was supposed to .
we thought about returning it - but change our mind on our way there .
we will order another one via amazon , no biggie .
i learned so much with just one trip .
the shoes are pricey but it 's totally worth it for the comfort !
plus they are n't cheap made in china shoes so the quality is excellent .
i only used the travel clinic here and could not be happier !
they had flexible hours that worked with my schedule ( open weekends !
can you believe that ? ! )
dr. van was so great .
i decided to come here since they had a great pedicure special going on .
( why not ? )
when i walked in , i was greeted by everyone .
hannah was my nail technician , and she was amazing .
i definitely needed a pamper , and this place just went above and beyond .
i would definitely recommend this place ! !

they do have saturdays which is helpful .
pros : - student discount !
i got 10 % off which saved me $ 500 .
- personal consultation , which you can cancel at any time .
- relaxing pill ( valium ) and massage chairs before your procedure .
cons : - dr. stein has a long waiting list !
you 'll have to wait a bit before you get an appointment .
dr. troupe and the team at polished dental do absolutely outstanding work all around .
my entire experience was easy and inviting -- it is such a friendly environment .
i am so grateful !
you wo n't be disappointed if you make an appointment with megan !
i am always happy with my results .
she is friendly , easy to talk to , and excellent at her job .
my fav place to lunch with friends .
it 's the best .
i could eat the salad bar every day
i am currently going to dr. racanelli for invisalign .
i wish most places would keep you in the waiting room so short .
they put espn on a flat screen in front of me while they worked .
dr. racanelli has good bedside manor and explains everything in great detail .
we could n't have done better ... the service is great and very personal .
we are so glad we found this family .
i love this office !
i saw dr. crum for my pregnancy and she was amazing and very knowledgeable .
the phlebotomist is best !
i will never let anyone else draw my blood .
she was always so fast and definitely knows what she is doing .
i ca n't imagine going through another pregnancy at another office !
had first appointment and really liked dr. wolfson .
he took my husband and i together .
i have lots of medical problems so he is dealing with them as needed .
easy to talk to .
had a facial and some injections today .
the staff was so friendly and knowledgeable .
i 'm so excited to go back and refer all my friends .
i 100 % recommend this place .
from the moment i walked through the doors i was at ease .
2016 is a new year so i figured a new dentist to start fresh .
once inside , it is beautiful .
it 's very dark yet tranquil and smells like relaxation .
i enjoyed my massage from shannon .
very professional , clean , and tranquil place .
i 'm glad i got to try this place out .
rubber flip flops from cvs to the rescue and i was good .
it was so needed after a morning of early morning travel .
i will definitely be back if needed when i return to vegas .
dr. k. has been my doctor for some years now .
he is located in the tall building on the children 's sunrise hospital property .
i have had nothing but terrific experiences here .
some with views and a few with none .
those get kinda claustrophobic feeling for me .
each room also has beautiful wall art .
that 's usually what i spend my time doing while waiting .
and it 's not weird having a guy gyno .
i completely recommend him to anyone and everyone for gyno services .
prompt , reasonable fee , personalized service - finally a vet i trust !
vet techs and receptionist are all very friendly and prompt .
i usually can get an appointment the same day .
we 're glad we were referred to him .
we had a toddler with a broken clavicle .
doc gave us a figure 8 brace .
x-rays are done in-office .
great service to us as parents and our little boy who was 2 .
i highly recommend him for his professionalism , kindness and beautiful office .
his staff are all so kind and helpful .
the new facility is stunning .
so clean and fresh .
the doctors are all very thorough .
dr. caplan is great .

my wife and i decided to treat ourselves to couple massages .
i was reluctant , but i am so glad we have done it .
i look very forward to our monthly couples massage .
the staff at gilbert and germanne is very attentive and nice .
my wife swears by the salt scrub foot treatment !
the therapists are top notch as well ! !
i like the staff and the wait time is always short !
i started training 4 weeks ago with seth .
the first few sessions were tough .
i began getting stronger right away , and appreciated the encouragement from seth .
thanks to seth for helping me get my body and strength back !
had my cleaning today and it was great and fast service !
i saw hieu , dr wong and zabee !
thanks for a stress free visit !
this place is as good as it gets .
-and finally ... free meal at noodles & co. with your visit receipt !
i mean what ? !
i have found my dentist !
i really loved all the help and great customer service !
yeah i guess u could say i like the place .
for a fresh change he is not that businessman only thinking of profit .
his medical knowledge is second to none .
he also exhibits an exemplary bedside manner .
he literally will hold your hand throughout the whole process .
he is also very honest about treatment .
standing next to dr. fisch is his staff .
this is honestly the best dental office i 've ever been to .
i came in with severe sinus pressure and congestion .
after a week of dealing with this i was at my breaking point !
the staff here was so nice and efficient !
they really made my whole experience here great !
i could n't believe how gracious , efficient and caring this office was !
i will definitely be back !
he was very concerned and actively involved in my treatment .
i ca n't put in words how amazing this place is .
i have always been nervous coming into the dentist for any reason .
blown away by this place and will be a customer for life !
this place is always busy .
would recommend for 2 to 4 people .
the quinoa onion rings are delicious - order it with chipotle mayo .
i also love their hot sauce .
i 'm not vegan or vegetarian and i 've enjoyed everything i 've tried .
not only is this location beautiful but the staff is very friendly and helpful !
they have definitely helped me change my opinion of dentists .
i had n't even thought of reviewing roadrunner until i saw someone else 's .
my siberian husky was diagnosed with valley fever and prescribed fluconazole .
( sometimes a toy , sometimes treats . )
and so it went for about a year .
then i moved to san diego .
apparently , valley fever is not so common there .
then i got the price for a month supply of fluconazole .
same pills , same dosage , triple the price ! !
we took our dog to the animal hospital as a last resort .
every vet who saw her x-rays said we needed to do surgery immediately .
they stood to make a great profit off of both hips .
would highly recommend if you 're looking for a professional , kind atmosphere !
i have nerve pain in my feet and the sea salt massage is wonderful .
i go there now after every work out .
the food here is really great !
i had the falafel tacos and quinoa onion rings .
the tacos are super messy .
they also have really good hot sauce .
once i got my food though , the service was pretty nonexistent .
this place also gets pretty packed .
they do have a patio to sit outside as well .
i 'll be back , and hopefully service will be better next time .
probably one of the most unique spa experiences i 've had .
i had the one hour reflexology ( whole body ) plus shampoo .
the head massage is fantastic !
ask for jenny -- she does a great job !
clean , serene atmosphere , great value and an overall relaxing , therapeutic experience !
for a ymca , the dowd is an awesome gym .
the athletic conditioning class is no joke !
you will 100 % be sore the next day .
i also go to the morning spin classes .
the instructors vary by day , but there 's a great mix .
in addition , this year they did a million dollar reno .
and once the reno is 100 % complete it will be really awesome !
i love everyone there .
the staff and dentist are very helpful and attentive to my needs .
they left me smiling and i look forward to my next cleaning .
i had a wisdom tooth removed at this office earlier this week .
dr bond and his staff were great !
they deserve the 5 stars i 'm giving them !
this is definitely one of the most comfortable offices for gynecological visits .
dr quinn is a very good dentist and i never feel any pain .
i 've been going to this dentist for over 4 years now !
thumbs up for the dr and his staff !
they also call to remind you when you need cleanings .
that personal touch goes a long way .
mandana kheshtchin and navid javadi are both extremely gentle and personable .
they are down to earth and reasonable in their prices .
i went to charles for juvederm lip injections .
i had gotten my lips injected elsewhere and was very unhappy with them .
charles is super friendly and made sure i felt comfortable during the whole experience .
at $ 29 for a single visit you ca n't beat it .
they first go over your problems so they can focus on a specific area .
i have referred several people to the joint .
i had a broken wisdom tooth with a cavity .
i was in and out in less than an hour .
everyone was friendly and professional .
i even got a shirt !
he listened , did n't rush me through anything - i was definitely satisfied !
phew ... these things are usually hit or miss .
and it was amazing ! !
this was our first visit but it wo n't be our last .
great options , prices and service , fantastic place !
i had a really great experience with affordable dentures and implants .
something you can probably only appreciate if you 've been in a similar situation .
my mom had trouble holding still and repeatedly failed to follow instructions .
carlos never stopped smiling and encouraging her .
jennifer assisted with the surgery .
she was incredibly kind , gentle , and thoughtful .
dr. athari has an amazing sense of calm about him .
he walked us through everything and talked to us throughout the procedure .
always helpful , knowledgeable , kind , and gentle .
it took a day to get a call back to schedule .
we waited a little while in the office too .
that 's worth waiting for .
overall , they work like a well-oiled machine .
we got to meet the whole team , including their on-site lab techs .
every single person met us with a smile and kind words .
i can not thank dr. athari enough for creating an environment like this .
that 's a major difference worth noting .
they also have an on-site lab , which saves costs as well .
anyway , again , sending a huge thank-you to dr. athari and his staff .
you guys are beyond awesome .
the staff at spectrum dermatology is wonderful , everyone is so kind and helpful .
thank you lauren , you 're the best !
the people who works here are very nice and helpful .
they accept most insurance as well .
thank you , lisa .
happy to give dr. rehl the 5 stars he deserves .
i would give him 10 !
i just needed to know that this was going to be addressed with laura .
i recently had an eye appointment here and had a very good experience .

i highly recommend this location as i have seen great results .
he helped and after 3 treatments the pain and knots were gone .
i would recommend him to anyone .
i 'm from portland but visit scottsdale often .
the staff from the front desk to doctors were amazing .
there is a big difference between given options and a sales pitch .
i 'll be back soon !
however , the last time they were spot on .
while i was there , the nurses and doctors were great .
i was scared and they were so reponsive and kind .
wonderful front desk staff smiled right when i walked it .
saw molly m , who was very pleasant and helpful .
beautiful office and well organized .
i was able to get an appointment last minute too !
my masseuse rebecca , was amazing !
you could tell she was very experienced .

i went in for a root canal .
dr ike hardy strikes me as knowledgeable , skilled , and trustworthy .
he really makes you feel you 're in good hands .
the staff were nice and friendly .
i had the best pedicure ever here !
the spa food i ordered was delicious and tasted pretty healthy .
one dish is enough for 2people to share .
downside : i had a chatty cathy getting a pedicure next to me .
the tea that they had tasted artificially sweetened .
i was horrified , as i stay far away from unhealthy preservatives .
i stuck with water .
the spa pool was nothing to write home about .
definitely was not relaxing at all .
lots of loud people drinking too much .
it 's easy to make an appointment and they usually run on time .
we 're able to access all medical appointment notes from home which is awesome !
we definitely recommend her !
they released my back pain .
i can walk upright again .
i will go back my next trip .
he is so personable and trustworthy .
he knows what he 's doing and makes you feel comfortable .
i 've gotten botox , dysport and juvederm with him .
he has a great eye for perfection .
i recommend everyone to him .
thank you charles for always making me feel my best !
before stepping into the doors , i have never taken a cross fit class .
i have to say , these trainers blew my mind ! !
how awesome is that ! !
the place is so clean and organized .
the instructors ... fantastic ! !
they really focus on safety and are really motivating .
everyone was so welcoming and did n't show anything they could n't do .
if you sign up , you 're getting more then your money 's worth !
these guys are really passionate about what they do and mean business !
but are also fun and are really inspiring .
my extended family and i have been going there for years .
this is a great place to get a very inexpensive facial .
i love the product lines they use , hylunia and rhonda allison .
i brought my husband here for a fever and nausea .
the front desk staff was friendly and efficient .
the entire center was very clean and well kept .
the doctors and nurses we interacted with with also very friendly and efficient .

my first time here and was very pleased with the customer service all around .
they have a really nice selection of glasses also .
staff was kind and courteous
so i 'm back yet again with worsening asthma symptoms .
their appointment system sucks ! ! !
u have to leave a message and then they 'll call you back .
and it 's always nice and cool in there which is a plus .
hence my pain ay quest labs yesterday .
it was a really quick visit but i did n't feel rushed at all .
as i exited chaos inside where the doctors gather , i mean utter chaos .
i mean really care ! ! !
visited the scottsdale office today with our daughter .
can honestly say it was the best office visit our family has ever experienced .
not to mention the quickest appointment ever ! !
everyone we had the pleasure of interacting with was very friendly and knowledgeable .

i 've come here for a prp facial , botox and fillers .
the staff is always very accommodating and friendly .
on top of that , their prices are fantastic .

she made such a difference in my tattoo after one session .
i had had four prior sessions somewhere else and the results were very different .
dr bates was very insightful and pleasant to discuss the options for my pain .
i would recommend him to others .

appointments are easy to book and waiting times are very little .
dr. burdorf has helped my neck feel much better and stronger .
we would highly recommend rescue my speech !
dr gettelman is awesome !
i have been terrified of dentists of any kind for my entire life .
he cares about your concerns and has a very calming demeanor .
ca n't say enough about this wonderful professional .
ca n't thank him enough for making my dental visit comfortable .
i had scrub wrap massage package .

the staff was there 15 minutes early .
made me very comfortable in the lobby .
i am a regular shopper , great store for prices and convenience .
my only caution , check the expiry dates on everything .

i was not sleeping and was becoming irritable , anxious and depressed .
the md recommended non-steroidals , more cortisone injections , and most likely surgery .
i was not satisfied with this plan !
paul employed cupping and acupuncture and had me out of pain in no time .
i have no numbness or tingling , am sleeping peacefully and exercising again .
i feel like i have my life back !

2 ) use no chip nail polish .

her class was a powerful experience and she even takes pictures during the birth .

not an urgent care place more like a check up place .

prices were very reasonable .
facility was new and clean .
this therapy has been integral to my recovery .
i 'm able to sleep peacefully , enjoy more flexibility and move without pain !
i had shoulder trouble for 2 years !
i could hardly move my left arm without pain .
i tried everything short of having surgery !
a friend of mine suggested acupuncture as an alternative .
well i was sooo desperate i thought what the heck ! !
dr lee was really nice and very comforting .
especially to someone who had never done acupuncture .
within 2 visits i was able to move my arm without pain ! !
after 5 visits i had full range of motion ! !
of course your mileage may vary .
in other words your results may differ .
and let me tell you i have made some doozies ! ! !
my shoulder and i can not recommend dr lee enough ! !
artistic created boutique instead of the typical clinical `` sterile '' looking optical space !
notice the displays ... nice touch !
so your insurance will be footing part of the bill !
they have plenty of great looking less typical eyewear for men !
plenty of styles for ladies too !
many brands i have heard of and a few i have not !
wish they had some they did not !
near `` al 's pizza ''
best choice i 've ever made .
i got 2 teeth extracted on my 1st visit like nothing .
the facilities are beautiful and liked that they use new technologies too .
definitely would recommend it to family and friends .
they suggested meds , ice , and `` rest until you feel better '' .
that is a band-aid , not a cure !
my teeth got 5-6 shades whiter and the process was painless .
treat yourself to a younger smile !
you 'll be glad you did !
at least i sure am !
thank you true teeth whitening !
i 'll be back for maintenance every 6-12 months because i love these results !
i discovered this place on yelp and i 'm hooked .

i immediately felt at ease once i met her .
i honestly ca n't say enough good things about her !
as far as the staff , i thought they were very efficient and friendly .
but we love dr.garcia just the same !
she is attentive , thorough , caring , and knows what she 's doing .
the staff is wonderful as well .
you wear comfortable clothing and do not undress like a typical massage .
you could n't beat it !
i normally pay one dollar per hour back in nh .
on my second visit i asked for specific areas to concentrate on .
if you are ever in the area you must give them a try !
they are a full service fertility practice conveniently located in henderson .
gvfp provided all of that and more .
you 'll love this team !
i have used dr morley for 3 years .
he has exceptional price plans and no ripoffs .
can i give this place 10 because it deserves it .

i discussed i was looking for a reflexology & body massage .
i 've been to about 8-10 foot spas in vegas as well .
give them a try !
i recently had surgery here .
and i am thoroughly impressed with there patient care .

otherwise everyone else was very kind and comforting .
overall very impressed with patient care at this hospital .
usually , i make an appointment for blood work .
the place was pretty crowed at 10:50a.m .
but , i was in and out in 28 minutes .
so , pretty quick service , imo .
my tech , anna , did a great job on taking my blood .
i hardly felt the needle go in .
also , considering we have deep vains , they find them with little effort .
my daughter had a veneer break while visiting a couple of years ago .
she called dr angel 's office .
she had issues with that veneer several times and had gone to several dentists .
dr angel was the first dentist to fix it correctly .
everyone at dr angel 's office is friendly and professional .
the waiting times are short , yet i have never felt rushed .
she also does n't try to convince you to have unnecessary procedures .
the office is comfortable , clean and conveniently located .
almost made the experience enjoyable !
they are always encouraging .

very professional and kind .
i would definitely recommend their facility for physical therapy
i have never considered doing much else as i aged .
i was dedicated to `` aging gracefully '' .

she was super informative .
i went home to give it some thought .
it was nearly painless and gail was very professional .
the office is conveniently located and very pretty .
the staff is super friendly .
spending a day here is like spending a day on vacation .

aided by dina ( who gives an excellent massage before the adjustment !
) , dr. cheree provided complete symptom relief for me within a couple appointments .
went here for my shoulder because i had surgery done on my labrum .
you learn alot in terms of posture and proper movement while performing the exercises .
it helps out big time .
i had to learn the hard way .
i 've seen other doctors in las vegas , and have felt rushed .

i need that every other day .
i had a doctor willing to prescribe but he had to know the ingredients .
he agreed it could do no harm but also needed the ingredient list .
it is at least covered under my fsa so my cost is pre-tax .
it 's made an amazing difference for me .

just the b-complex mic shots .

making your company and store look amazing !
the latter is true of dr. douglas ' staff .
thorough is the first word that comes to mind !

she 's just wonderful .
she 's sweet and knowledgeable .
from there the service continues , from quick xrays , down to the cleaning .
dr. nestlerode does the cleaning himself !
you get personal service here .
how many dentists do their own cleanings these days ?
he also does the cleanings by hand .
no ultrasonic machines , which makes most people wince .
hand scaling is more acurate .
all with a no-pressure approach .
with my busy schedule , this is a great service for me .
once you see dr. nestlerode you will wonder why you ever went anywhere else .
i 'll have to ask about that next time .

his office staff is pleasant and helpful .
top notch health care with comic relief .
i have been here twice and both experiences have been great .

pity , i wish they still had this around .
the thing i usually get when i come here are the bowls .

i 've had other bowls , but i kinda like this one the best .

fresh is one of those places that 's good for everyone .
i 've been with dr. vicuna for over a couple of years now .
she 's definitely knowledgeable and friendly .

it is always very busy .
it is a huge office with a lot of people working here .
even more patients.they seriously must see hundreds of people a day here .
even though i have now moved to another town .
i still come to this office .
they really do try to get you in as quick as possible .

your teeth are the first thing people see when they see you .
trust me- it 's worth it !
the best dentist i 've ever been to .
he really seems to care about his patients and to listen to them .
the hygienists do a great job at assessing your teeth and gums .
i would definitely recommend as opposed to some other dentists i 've been to .
absolutely recommend this place ! ! !
love the boot camp on saturday
excellent experience all the times dr. liu has completed work on me .
i feel it was my good fortune the day i walked into his office .
i would recommend him to everyone wondering where to find good health .
very nice staff , from check in to check out !
nurses were all very kind to my dad as well !
i visited solescape based on the solid reviews and they are right on .
she is an artist and your skin/muscles could be her canvas ! ! !
emily will not disappoint .
she has a gentle voice and presence but amazingly strong hands and energy .
one thing i feel like solescapes could improve upon is bedding .
regardless , i will go back .
thank you , emily !

2 hours later the wife feels great and rejuvenated .

the doctor explained everything .
overall i will be back for another .
i cant wait to see my baby !
i know dr. leah wingeart as a colleague .
i would definitely recommend her as another professional in the mental health field .
i have n't met a friendlier staff .
everyone i talked to was kind and made my experience great !
i 'm so excited i found i dentist i want to go back to .
i had a good experience here the other day .
i was assisted by darion .
he was kind , patient , and professional .
he helped to get the lens replaced in my eyeglasses and sunglasses .
all of the employees i encountered were very nice .
there were only 2 employees available to adjust the eyeglasses that were ready .
dr. pozun is great , one of the better doctors i 've had .
the only reason i give them four stars instead of five is the staff .
others do n't return phone calls promptly .
i want some ! )
but the other front desk staff are generally unfriendly if not rude .
as i wrote earlier , very much recommended .
dr bigler and his staff have been wonderful .
i 've been a patient for 2 years and have excellent service .
i would highly recommend this doctor to anyone
i received a recommendation to southview from a coworker and so glad i listened .
if that is the case , check out southview !
barely visited this store in the last couple of years .
have within the last year rediscovered the store , as prices seem more reasonable .
some items are actually the same or cheaper than longos and loblaws .
i was super shocked .
what sets it apart is the service .
there is almost always someone i 'm there you help you .
they will ask you if you need help as well !
rare for a chain grocery store !
this one time , there was n't a sample i could try .
i asked and the associate there quickly opened a bottle for me to try !
that 's customer service .
items are in stock even on weekends and weekend evenings .
check out never takes too long either .
they always open up new lanes and the cashiers are so friend .
they go above and beyond to tell you info or talk to you !
i 'm not complaining .
lace was masseuse and was just amazing .
as a world traveler and experienced spa goer do n't miss this boutique .
i 'll be back later this year on my next trip to the states .
say hi to molly !
dr. pervaiz is knowledgeable and professional .
he is now my primary care physician .
his staff at the rainbow office is pleasant :
best spa in vegas .
stay off the strip to get superb customer treatment and normal prices .
after tips less than $ 300 !
will go here every time i visit !
this example has made us dynamic eye care patients for life .
nothing bad i would say about this location .
however they did notice a fluid build up in her abdomen .
my husband was satisfied with the service he received during that visit .
she was very thorough and advised is daily about her condition .
i completely understand their reasoning .
pvsec is a fantastic state of the art facility with wonderful providers .
it 's worth every cent .
i recently moved here and have kaiser .
that being said there are no kaisers in nevada .
luckily healthcare partners of nevadas urgent care on wynn accept kaiser .
besides that great fact , they are fantastic there .
they also have great prices for the medications they prescribe .
since i do have unacceptable insurance at most places this is great news .
i would really recommend anyone go here .
i absolutely adore all staff here .
either dentist is a great choice .
my biggest fear is being judged for how bad my teeth are .
i dont like going to the dentist .
so i usually dont .
i have a habit of waiting until im in excruciating pain before caving in .
after one visit to this place , you wont ever go anywhere else .
i literally drive all the way across town .
yesterday , i went in and had a facial done with cindy hernandez .
all i can say is she was amazing and worked magic on my face !
the whole staff was nice and the place was beautiful and clean !
i am so grateful i found stephanie she is amazing and so knowledgeable .
i enjoyed the wrap process i was so relaxed and kept falling asleep .
i highly recommend dr carter !
dr. stephen is very friendly and caring .

5 out of 5 stars for this gem !
i highly recommend getting a consultation ( it 's free ! )
what a great place for spa and salon services !

the decor is so much fun !
bryanne did such a great job on my mani/pedi .
patrick is an excellent masseur !

he genuinely cares about each & every patient & strives for perfection .
the facility is spotless .
the appointments are always on time .
i can not say enough good things about dr. noorda and his staff .
i highly recommend them and would give them 100 stars if i could !
thank you dr. noorda & your out standing staff ! ! !
any negative reviews are from just generally awful people .
i was there when a patient threw a clipboard at their front desk person .
and she was pregnant .
the pas are all wonderful as well as the physicians .
it 's a busy practice .
they spend a lot of time with you compared to other places .
i wo n't go anywhere else .
dr. pack delivered our second child , which had complications .
as nervous parents , we could not have had a better experience .
i would ( and have ) absolutely recommend dr. pack !
when i got to urgent care i did not want to wait all night .
which is why i am writing this review .
i was feeling so much better just after 20 mins .
thank you micole neely and your wonderful staff !
source centre is a very welcoming and calming environment .
dr. leo took the time to explain it to me and answer any questions .
i have scoliosis and tendinitis in my hand and wrist .
my overall wellness is better for it .
i would highly recommend source centre .
i absolutely love this place , and treasure dr. kim .
she 's thorough , answers all of my questions , and is incredibly personable .
i have never been a marc 's fan .
and i was surprisingly impressed .
i visited yesterday to get my lips done & had a great experience .
everyone there was friendly .
i am sharing pictures for reference !
my lips are still slightly swollen but seem to be healing well .
music is fun to dance to .
so happy canada is open to drugs !
i highly recommend this company based on my personal experience .
dr. shelly o'connor is a great chiropractor !
her personality is another awesome feature of her service !
there 's no down-side to seeing dr. shelly !
dr gawley and his staff are incredible !
i had a mommy makeover done about 6 weeks ago .
i have had 7 kids , and my body definitely showed it .
i had a tt and ba .
my husband and i are thrilled with my results !
he went over and beyond my expectations .
we are forever thankful for dr. gawley !
in june 2013 i decided to make my health a top priority .
at that time i was a complete mess .
i could n't climb a flight of stairs without being out of breath .
i had joined 24 hour and quickly became disappointed with the trainers .
july 12 , i will be competing in my second mens masters physique competition .
stephen , seth , aaron , steven q. , jayson are the absolute best .
i have met a lot of wonderful people there .
everyone has a story to tell .
there is so much inspiration and motivation at tpt .
these guys are the real deal .
give them a try you wo n't regret it .

dr. banchik is the most amazing dentist .
the staff remembers me by name and explains everything to me .

hot stones and oil are a must .
i went to carmen today for ipl treatment and she did a wonderful job !

they are very customer oriented .
so glad i found them .
i 've been going to dr. jyoti patel for over a year now .
she is a great doctor and her pa christie is amazing as well !
everyone there is so nice and try to work with your schedule .
these people also really care about their patients .
we absolutely love healing hearts and everyone there .
natalie answered all of my questions and addressed my concerns .
she was more than great ! ! !
i do n't think we could go wrong with anyone at this office .
this is an excellent program for those seeking help with recovery .
they are doing something special here .
they a first class gym with an awesome boxing ring !
incrediblely motivating 12 step meetings ... .the best ever !
i liked the staff that really care .
helpful employees and fun place to visit .
if you have n't heard- you get all the samples of oil/vinegar/wine/liquor you want .
in fact , they are encouraged .
some of the stuff is pretty reasonable .
for example , the calamondin vinegar is amazing .
it has like a citris/lime flavor and is like nothing i have ever tasted .
also , give the pumpkin seed oil a try .
way funner than the `` oil and vinegar '' stores in the mall .
soon they will add liqueurs to their portfolio , which should be very exciting .
also , small selection of wine there .
tip : bring your own containers ( can you ? )
because those add up .
and , ask the staff for pairings .
for example : mango vinegar and chili oil .
i had my implants done at layman shirman and associates .
always a pleasure to work with dr. shirman and their staff .
if you 're in pain , dr. kevin kaldy can help .
little to no waiting usually .
he 's kind , caring and committed to helping his patients .
we went to whole foods last night for some treats .
one of those items was the rich and delicious chocolate moose pie .
i will be back to whole foods !
great service and really helped me with my tension .

he explained the procedures , made me comfortable and fixed me teeth .
i highly recommend desert springs dental care to everyone .
i have very temperamental skin ... normal to dry complection along with hormonal/cystic acne .
my coworker mentioned skin laundry and how your first time is free !
usually it 's $ 65 a treatment .
the location is very clean and professional- and they all are very informative !
ask whatever you need to feel comfortable !
the specials they have are worth it !
the process : you check-in .
you wash your face .
they bring you into their room .
cleanse your face again .
start up the treatment and discuss a routine for your skin .
10 minutes later- you 're checking out !
sure , let 's do it !

but not this time .
all the doctors at alliance are great including dr. park and dr. pierson .
the spa is off the strip and very close to the rio .
a 80 minute massage is priced right at $ 100 .

i highly recommend checking it out .
one word : heavenly .
solescape has a very welcoming and relaxing vibe .
the woman at the front desk was also very nice .
we started off by al sitting down with me and asking me any concerns .
he told me that he does ashiatsu , which i 've never had before .
he was kind , warm , and funny .
such a nice guy !
i was a little nervous ( feet ! )
but it was soooo relaxing .

made my daughter feel at ease and comfortable .
biopsy was done to make sure all was ok .
had a great experience at today nails .
foot massage was amazing as well as a gel manicure .
i would recommend this place to visitors and locals .
ask for lou , ivy , ben , or kevin .
there was no wait for services and everyone was so kind !
they go above and beyond for their customers .
i chose them because i liked the style of their eyewear .
the prices are good and they are cognizant of budgets without compromising your needs .
she had somewhat of an accent and we ca n't quit remember her name .
she was more than helpful .
when someone thanks you a simple your welcome !
or have a nice day would n't hurt !

called up and was able to get an appointment the next day .
follow up appointments were scheduled super quick .
friendly staff and great doctors !
glad they opened up in old town !
my girlfriend and i went to several consultations looking for breast augmentation .

i highly recommend dr. meger for all your cosmetic surgery needs .
second , debbie is fantastic .

i just moved close to their area and i was glad i found them .
the massage experience is amazing and consistent .
needless to say that i wake up not feeling rested .
i was able to float for the first time and truly enjoyed it .
when you hear floating in the dark for 1 hour sounds a bit daunting .
seeing is understanding : you are in control of the environment .
your pod is a private room with shower .
you control lights sound/music and can leave pod door ajar or completely open .
this establishment is very clean and organized .
i really appreciated the staff they were very informative and made feel at home .
i really look forward to floating again with true rest float spa
i think this place is amazing .
i would highly recommend kharma life center .
i 've driven by many times and finally decided to stop in .
we are very pleased with the experience especially because there is no appointment necessary .
i signed up today for the monthly family membership .
dr. roach explained the entire chiropractic process .
there was no wait time and we had the room to ourselves .
service was good and it was definitely worth the value .

the office staff people are pleasant and well trained .
the place is cram packed with tons of organic stuff .
the prices ca n't be beat .

i liked that touch .
look no further than smart dental .
dr. sifri and his staff are wonderful !

the session was painfully good , i feel 100 times better .
the pain that i was constantly feeling has subsided greatly .

some of the music selection is odd ( religious ) .

it was a very relaxing experience .
kudos to your operation and great job !
i will be back forever !
found them on groupon and i 'm so happy i did .
alan did my deep tissue massage and was absolutely amazing !
they are lucky to have him .
sometimes i feel like the therapist is rushed and not into their job .
when someone has their hands on you , you feel their energy and intentions .
i could tell that he enjoys his work .
he was n't rushed .
this is huge for me !
i cant wait to go back .
already booked my next appointment with alan .
they have great packages and do chair massages as well .
give them a try !
i got a groupon for their sauna and jade table massage .
the sauna is just great !
the missing star ... a shower for a quick refresh would be awesome !
i was iffy about it since it was a groupon .
i had kayla do my lashes she is amazing , funny and friendly !
not to mention my eyelashes look amazing !

and so cool she texted us the photos right away !
the pricing is extremely reasonable .
although they are all students , they have really good knowledge .
i get a standard facial every time .
they record and save your information for your next visit .
i would recommend them .
i use to go to to ulta and spent over $ 60+ a facial .
for the same service , $ 30+ .
i 'll definitely be back soon .
dr. roach is seriously the best .
they do a free body-fat composition with specific details .
it 's hands-down legit !
they also offer protein supplements without sugar , which is ideal .
additionally , the store is super clean and the service is top-notch .
if you ask a question , they will answer it in a friendly way .
there are no attitudes here at all .
quick and easy way to get after hours care .
- especially when you have a sick and cranky toddler in the back seat .
but it 's worth it !
dr. harouni is very kind and warm , and very , very smart .
there 's even fruit and coffee in the waiting room .
both dr tang and his staff are friendly , kind , and efficient .

she was very , very good .
this was a 90 minute massage .

the women 's locker room alone is enough to rant and rave about !
my favorite thing about this gym is the classes .
i really love this store !
i like the fact that i can purchase healthy food nearby is great .
the prices are not too high and they offer a good variety .
my only complaint is that the cashiers are so unfriendly !

its a bar inside my mouth attached to my braces that corrects my bite .

now that 's awesome !
i highly recommend santucci orthodontics !
dr. rowe is very kind and patient ... and fast !
very pain-free , stress-free experience today getting a couple of fillings .

dr. patti did an adjustment that helped me more than i thought chiropractic could .
i had a hemorrhoids banding procedure with dr. shih .
he 's the best doctor ever .
he cares about his patient so much .
before the procedure he explained everything really detail .
since one of my hemorrhoid size is too big .
i trust him and he made it .
i felt so happy and blessed .
nurses , cnas , and therapists are the most caring people .
every office visit he actually likes to have a conversation and is very compassionate .
the wait however is just crazy but that 's expected in a doctors office .
also i see jessica gdovin as well and i loooovvveee her !
i honestly will never go anywhere else unless they close down !
i 've always wanted to try an oxygen bar .
this place is a medium-sized booth with a couple people behind the counter .
there were a couple seats available with a few other people at the bar .
i was pretty stoked it included a massage as well .
it 's not an overwhelming scent but it is pleasant .
it 's an awesome combination of oxygen and a little massage .
they do try to sell you their stuff but are not pushy .
but that 's another review .
the people are so nice and the store is very clean and well arranged .
we will definitely keep this store in our repertoire .
until next time toronto ... .

this advise goes for the wine too !
( but i always get some good ol ' brie )
extremely friendly & highly professional atmosphere .
doc k is a leading expert in pain management and is fantastic !
doc jarrett makes my back feel like a million bucks ! !
unfortunately his day does n't have much `` wiggle room '' .

very approachable and explains everything in layman 's term .
i am 6 weeks post breast lift and full tummy tuck .
i am so happy with the results .
the comfort level with him was awesome .
he was very down to earth & he answered all my questions .
he was not pushy or arrogant in any way .
i was very satisfied with his excellent surgical skills & his personality .

i went to totum for the first time this morning .
i took a 7:15am spin class , and i was not disappointed !
the class finished with 5-7 minutes of pilates , and 5 minutes of stretching .
i would absolutely return to her class in a heartbeat ( pun intended ) .

she had a genuine interest in ensuring my experiencing was elevated .
i will definitely return for more butt kicking !

i always know what to expect !
i especially liked the cold shower , steam room and inhalation room .
food is pretty good that my friend and i order poolside .
here 's the cons that i recently experienced .
the pool area was dirty and needed basic maintenance and deep cleaning .

so do n't worry about it guys .
and gals , you 'll be right in your element .
jillian is an experienced lmt with a broad skillset .
then head across the parking lot for a healthy bite at mad greens .
i 'm a twenty something year old .
from the beginning i was treated like his own son .
just holding a conversation with him is intense .
one , a world renowned colon hydrotherapist and the other an independent filmmaker .
i ca n't stress enough how much of an inspiration he is .
i 've had only one other chiropractor in the past and he was great .
all of the staff are super nice and never try to up sell you .
my therapist , jason , does wonders on me .
when i left an hour later the sanitizer had been filled .

this place is hugh !

how i found andrea is quite the story in itself .
i was willing to settle for anything - it was an emergency ! ! !
from the minute you meet andrea you feel like you 're right at home .
she 's super warm and makes you feel very comfortable .
i started out with just my brow waxing then moved onto her fab facials .
andrea is honestly the best !
two weeks later the doctors performed a mid calf amputation .
after a difficult two months , she was ready for her first prosthetic .
pro care was a few blocks from our home .
first visit she carried her leg in a bag .
not a good start .
therapists do n't accept excuses .
pretty soon he was pulling the walker to make her keep up .
each visit the therapist introduced new exercises to get ready for the next steps .
now , he follows critiquing each step .
steps and curbs are a particularly terrifying obstacle .
going to be walking from now on .
success and end of professional therapy is walking with a cane .
looks like that is a week away at this rate of improvement .
it 's been a physically exhausting , a little painful but mostly terrifying journey .
miracles take work sometimes .
the therapist and staff at pro care work miracles daily .
it 's been an amazing transformation with a motivated patient and expert care .
customer service is the best .
he never rushes and is very knowledgeable .
my daughter feels comfortable and he makes her smile .
the office is always clean and the staff is always polite .
literally stop here daily !

her hands were perfect .

i 've had brookstone dental as my dentist for fifteen years .
i 've always hated going to the dentist , like most people .
i never wait more than five minutes to be seen .
dr goldring and his staff are very personable and fun to visit .
i highly recommend brookstone dental .
i have changed primary physicians 3 times in as many years .
not because of the doctors , but because of terribly incompetent staffs .
hilcrest dental really is as good as it gets !
extra kudos to dental hygienist sherlisa !
some day they might even update their website .
my mom has been a resident at scottsdale memory care for almost six years .
this memory care facility is the very best of the best ! !

now it 's my turn to get a few things worked on .
i was disfigured and miserable .
one side was partially paralyzed and the other completely .
we were amazed , but it shows just how effective this therapy is .
this laser helps the healing process exponentially .
his staff are all caring and professional .
none was able to find a reason or long term solution for my pain .
he took the time to explain in detail what was causing my pain .
that was about three years ago .
plus he 's just a real nice guy who genuinely cares about his patients .
he 's not cheap but he 's worth every penny .
his staff is great too .
i have had several treatments from him .
he is well trained with lots of positive energy to share .

my coworker mentioned skin laundry and how your first time is free !
usually it 's $ 65 a treatment .
the location is very clean and professional- and they all are very informative !
ask whatever you need to feel comfortable !
the specials they have are worth it !
the process : you check-in .
you wash your face .
they bring you into their room .
cleanse your face again .
start up the treatment and discuss a routine for your skin .
10 minutes later- you 're checking out !
sure , let 's do it !
go treat yourself to a free treatment on your next day off !
it is so worth it .
we started our infertility journey two years ago .
first , the consult was free , which was refreshing .
we appreciated how real he was with us .
we walked out of there happy , relieved and optimistic .
three feelings we had n't felt in a long time .
we were so heartbroken , but were eager to try again .
we tried a few weeks later with a frozen transfer .
we waited ... then went in for our first beta .
he called and said my numbers were low , but in the positive range .
he prepared me that it could be an early miscarriage .
i prayed that our second beta numbers would go up .
not enough for him to be certain tho .
so , i went in for a third round of blood work .
it went up significantly !
we were so relieved and over joyed .
what a beautiful sound !
they are helping us complete our family and making our dreams come true .
it 's definitely worth your time
again , 100 % spot on .

they make you feel as if they generally care .

dr. hogan herself is lovely and so kind and professional .
she does n't exude that preconceived `` scary dentist '' notion at all .

we had a hard time conceiving and decided to do ivf .
dr carter has answered all my questions and even my call on a sunday .
quick , efficient cleaning , and very friendly staff .
dr. badalmenti fixed a cavity for me in no time at all .
i am so impressed with the staff at this facility .

i could not recommend them more .
great tip from a fellow hawaii resident .
just finished a conference and hubby flew in .
very clean establishment and friendly staff .
we had the first appointment at 10am and they were waiting for us .
the foot deluxe deal was awesome and perfect for us .

i wish they would bring one closer to rock hill .
a girl can dream ca n't she .
i ca n't imagine going to a different doctor !
the scariest symptom was my loss of brain function .
it was there that i received the diagnosis of chronic lyme disease .
this level of kindness did n't stop after the first meeting .
the clinic is stunning and clean as a whistle .
the staff are so kind and become like family .
as each month passed i saw myself improving .
my symptoms were being eliminated left and right .
the pain that made it impossible to function was gone .
it was the blessing i had been praying for .
and i 'm not the only one who received a miracle after attending sunridge .
i saw cancer patients that reached remission with the help of dr. franco .
sunridge medical brought me the health that i had only dreamed of .
before attending the clinic i had all but given up hope .
great service , great offices , and much appreciated follow through .
their products and protein shakes are really good .
i drink at least 1 protein shake a day , usually chocolate or cinnabun .

i have been seeing uj ramdas at morpheus for a couple of months now .
i was actually surprised that he was able to help me .

i 'm hooked on the lemon bar soap .
they carry so many great products that i just do n't see anywhere else .
they have a great deli section .
i am obsessed with their salad bar .
dozens of fresh healthy salads at your fingertips .
the best thing is knowing the ingredients they use are healthy .
some day i 'll splurge on my friends and cater a meal from here .
martin : recently tried massage bliss and was not disappointed .
my therapist danyelle was very knowledgeable and skilled .
thanks danyelle and hope to see you again soon .

she did a wonderful job .
she 's really cool , funny and down to earth .
any way she made me really comfortable and was quite accommodating .
thank you dr. clark !
i was unaffiliated and looking for a box to do the wods at .
every class is mixed with beginners to advanced athletes .
each class is an hour long .
at the beginning of the sessions , everybody does a warm-up and stretches together .
wods can range from under 5 minutes to over 45 minutes and in between .
do n't be scared !
you go at your own pace .
you can either go all out or just take it easy .
it 's all up to you .
sure people are watching but we only want the best for you .
we know you are hurting but we all hurt together !
no pain , no gain !
ca n't forget about the infrared sauna in each of the change rooms .
i feel stronger , healthier and happier than ever before .
lifelong friendships and personal fitness goals are bound to happen at rcr .
hope to see you there !
because it was super affordable before in comparison .

i felt very relaxed and rejuvenated after !
i went to see dr kuranko on the suggestion of a friend .
i have never felt calmer and treated so kindly .
i felt safe and well taken care of .
absolutely love this place !
the only reason it does n't get 5 stars is because of the price .
this store is pricey ! ! !
but i would never be able to shop here on the regular .
i come here for unique health items i ca n't find elsewhere .
i also come here for their amazing vegan desserts and the best .
i first visited babymoon inn a year ago because a friend worked there .
i am so excited to finally be pregnant and a client at babymoon inn !
there are two birthing rooms , each with its own bathtub .
there are two bathrooms available , one with an inviting shower .
the offices are just as inviting as the birth center .
the lobby is cozy and beautifully decorated .
the midwives ' offices are comfortable and non-medical .
( belly checks are done on a massage table ! )
i can not recommend babymoon inn and its amazing staff any more highly .
hands down best staff in the valley ! !
i 've been to fresh a few times and i 've enjoyed every experience .
most of their menu items are carb heavy .
they also always have some delicious sweet treats from sweets from the earth .
make sure you save some room for dessert .
they 're also available on a bunch of delivery apps which is super convenient .
the whole team at floss dental is so caring and professional .
i highly recommend them to anyone !

ca n't wait til i get my new glasses !
dr alejandro lopez is wonderful .
dr lopez is caring and spends the time it takes to help me .

thanks spring valley dentist office !
i showed up for my appointment the next day .
the office is extremely professional in appearance .
i met with dr. liu and i think he is very sharp and friendly .
in turn when my grandma had swelling , they sent her to another hospital .
the next day we met shahera who would be my grandmas cna .
her job was to come help bathe , change and monitor my grandmother daily .
more reassurance was given to us .
she also told us what to expect .
we were given a booklet on signs the end was coming for my grandma .
when my grandma passed away , i called the hotline .
he listened to our stories of grandma while we waited .
he also hugged us when he left .
everyone we had contact with at infinity made this process easier .
they sent medications quickly .
supplies came with our cna .
kenta , the oneself therapy guru , actually deserves ten stars .
he would not give up until he identified the issue .
i left oneself today walking without pain and with a normal gait !
this was truly a therapeutic massage .
the setting is classy , comfortable , and well decorated with good music .
kenta is kind and friendly and patient and truly gifted .
our family has been going here since 1982 before dr. innes retired .
he has corrected painful problems and has performed innovative surgery with positive results .
their office is close to home and convenient for parking too !
dr. judy has been so amazing for our family .
she truly is so genuine and caring .
we are so thankful for her .
had a great experience with michelle .
i suffer from muscle pain in my back due to a snowboard accident .
so i go to massage therapists at least once a month .
since i travel i get a lot of different therapist .
michelle ranks on the top .
result : i felt way less stiff .
she really softened my muscles .
went for a heart beat check at 7 weeks , it was great .
had a great expirience .
i just wanted to say how awesome tyler is ! !
i have chronic back pain and tendonitis due to my profession as an esthetician .
tyler is very professional and a great rmt .
when i first arrived i was pretty surprised how big the dispensary actually was .
i recommend the cheesecake or the mango juice both are great choices .
placed an order for catering for a group of 8 for lunch .
i ordered lunch boxes for all .
ordered : fresh deluxe boxed lunch/wraps !
very good and the basil pesto tortellini was the favorite of all .
there are other technicians there so the environment is really nice .
great place for your eyes !
i was interested in breast augmentation .
dr. geoghegan made me feel the most comfortable .
she was very informative , caring , and honest with me .
three years later i have no regrets !
i have had no complications during surgery or after .
i am extremely pleased with the results and would highly recommend her practice .
nancy is the best dentist in the state of arizona !
go to dr. robinson and you will never look for another dentist agian !
the entire staff believes in helping each patient individually .
i was not a number and a chair here .
i was a human that received the specialized care i needed .
jennifer is beyond wonderful !
literally , after just one visit , i became hooked - so obsessed !
in fact , my mother is coming in next week !
she truly cares about her clients .
if i could , i would seriously come back every single week .
she is that amazing .
i can not recommend her enough ! !
: ) : ) : )
absolutely love the girls st skin laundry .
everyone has commented on how amazing my skin looks !
i definitely recommend checking them out and trying it for yourself !
the elite family is friendly and willing to answer any questions .
honestly the most helpful and qualified gym staff i have encountered .
i am in training club which is offered at various times of the day .
stockton dermatology is the best dermatology office in the valley !
the front office staff is extremely polite , friendly , and inviting .
their appointments are flexible and they are prompt and on time .
i would recommend them to anyone !
he made me feel very comfortable and confident i would get great results .
i would definitely recommend him to anyone wanting to look their best .

thank you charles for a wonderful experience .
love the people there so i give them 5 stars
dr. beaty was very pleasant to deal with along with her front office staff .
along with the glare reducing coating .
she pushed and she pushed .
she made me uncomfortable and while i 'd visit the office again .
i would not allow her to assist me again .
i got a 1 hour massage from brian and he was very good .
i 'll absolutely come back again .
dr frankie is the best ! ! !
2. you want the best post-natal care in the state .
the office and exam rooms are beautifully maintained and feel warm .
the colors and fabrics are a far cry from the traditional doctor 's office .
the birth center is just absolutely beautiful and cozy .
that 's how you put a diaper on !
i had no idea about the stages of labor !
( yup , all of it was news to me . )
following my birth , babymoon inn continued to be supportive .
the help i received with lactation consultation was invaluable .
what you choose , when you choose babymoon , is community .
dental office as a whole from start to finish was great .
all staff was friendly and knowledgeable !
both my children 7 year old and 3 year old loved it .
dentist was great with both kids !
i 'm always on the hunt for healthy food places !
i ordered a greenhouse bowl ( ? )
she also gave me a free drink card !
tempeh flavour and texture were spot on .
nevertheless i felt very satiated ( not bloated ) .
our food arrived quickly and i was blown away by the cornbread/soup/salad combo .
the portion size was perfect .
my split pea soup was hearty and very umami-filled .
the cornbread ( with flax i believe ? )
was excellent and it tastes 10x better than its classic butter-laden cousin .
it is my new favourite casual restaurant .
i agree with a previous reviewer saying that it 's `` unpretentious '' .
dr. plorde ( spelling may be off ) was fantastic .
i would recommend this place to anybody wanting good quality dental work .
probably the best facial i have ever had .
i first went with my daughter and then went back for myself .
she takes the time to understand your skin and offers healthful suggestions .
the only drawback is that her location is in sort of a weird complex .
i have spent more time and money here than i care to admit .
i 've even come to prefer vegan cupcakes to their more fat saturated counterparts .
i miss this place when i go home to the states .
i wish they delivered .
easiest 5 star review of my life .
megan always does such and amazing job !
i would highly recommend him for crowns .
i 'm so thankful , my smile is priceless !
i 'm highly satisfied and telling everyone to come here ! !
i truly believe there is a place for western medicine .
she spends the time to listen and to properly diagnose your issues .
i highly recommend dr. kwan to anyone seeking a sincere and caring physician .
i usually have little wait once i check in .
what an incredible experience .
her demeanor and professionalism were second to none .
this was by far the best option rather then going to the er .
i could n't recommend this service any higher - well done .
looking forward to utilizing you guys again when needed !
i highly recommend this place .
i am definitely going back .
super friendly staff and affordable : )
the staff is absolutely amazing !
i feel as though she has one on one care .
i regret not coming here sooner !
my son is 2 1/2 and his first ever dental visit went fine .
this will be my son 's dentist .
the place had a clean and nice relaxing atmosphere .
we paid $ 30 for feet and body massage ... ..totally worth it !
will definitely be coming back !
went to this store for the first time today .
it was so nice !
everyone made sure we were finding everything and it was so well put together .
best place to go for a shake after your workout ! !
staff is so nice and remembers what i get !
i was very skeptical , but 1 month later my problem is gone .
i feel grateful to have met dr. miller .
i feel like she was honest and frank with me .
i trust dr. angela miller .
she also treats my husband who is happy with her .
i came here as a kid and now i bring my 2 kids .
so worth it to see dr weiner and dr muyot is good as well .
walking into bella smiles , i came across a dental gem in the desert .
best dental office i 've been too across seven continents .
also , my experience at the reception has been good .
i have had a lot of dentists in my life .
i really like dr todd russell and his staff .
i recommend them to anyone looking for a dentist .
we are from out of state and our families loved the livestream feature online !
we are having a boy !
we will most likely be back for a 4d session in the third trimester .
i felt miserable before the massage session .
she was able to make me feel like a different person after the session .
you are the best !
i love working with dr amena deluca .
she listens carefully and provides skin care for all my family members .
including my young daughter with severe ezcema .
easy to schedule appointments and thorough exams .

they use awesome products and always have a product on sale .
i 've had an appointment canceled last minute bc a student was out sick .
i always treat my out of town visitors with a facial at swina .
excellent clinic very helpful and knowledgable .
even helped me out after hours no charge .

had a great experience at rejuvenation spa !
i got a cut and highlights .
i said just a trim and thats just what they did !
the color of my highlights matched perfectly .

( mydrnow- see review via my profile . )
tests : they could do so much on-site .
i needed blood , ultrasound , x-ray , hba1c and some other stuff .

they were just as lovely as everyone else i dealt with today .

it 's a new facility and very clean .
the atmosphere was very comfortable and my son 's experience was quite pleasant .
what can we say about this little nestled gnc store ?
he suggested these awesome little appetite suppressant/ energy boosters that i love !
i was looking into decompression therapy to help me with my low back issues .
everyone has been so helpful and friendly with me , i consider them family .
even with the pet names , al is a wonderful asset to the team .
you are not treated like a number , but as a valued patient .
quick , friendly and informative .
this clinic is amazing !
they also direct bill my insurance which is a huge bonus .
and , they 're right downtown at yonge and adelaide .
just one more thing to love about this clinic !
ca n't say enough about rebalance .
we finally changed our entire family over to skyline .
the front staff is great and always professional .
dr. kerry green is great , but so are the pa 's .
they listen , which is son nice at a medical office .
i do n't like condescending medical professionals .
we 're excited to have a place for the entire family .
my son needed a simple tooth extraction , we had never been there .
but doctor christensen was able to get him in that morning .
his staff and him included were just wonderful with him .
my friend is a patient there .
the nurses take good care of her and she is always clean .
there are a lot of nurses , aides and respiratory therapists .

i wish i could go every week .
my back , shoulders and neck would be the better for it .
i am a meat lover .
a classic hamburger is my all time fav .
so when my friend took me to this vegan restaurant i was skeptical .
i ordered the `` banquet burger '' with bean sprouts and veggie bacon .
and it was so good and super filling .
if you 're like me and love burgers gives this vegan place a try .
tastes amazing , great service and a bonus that it fills you up !
if i am in the area , i will go again !
the staff is amazing !
they are so friendly and make you feel right at home !
i love dr. krugly and dr. bradshaw .
dr. krugly works with me and dr. bradshaw works with my dog .
their entire staff are friendly and obviously love working there .
dr. krugly is excellent at explaining and treating .
i have been to several physical therapists , rolfers , massage therapists , etc .
but dr. krugly surpasses them all .
dr. bradshaw helped my dog when she fell and hurt her back .
i love dr. leverett and his staff !
jennifer is great and she really makes skin care affordable .
i can hardly go a month without a `` fix '' .
and now , she 's got a website where you can schedule your appointments .
i had an excellent dental experience at red mountain family dental .
the front desk staff were friendly and accommodating in scheduling my dental care .
i had the best cleaning and exam .
the hygienist was patient and gentle .
he provided pain free dental work and completed it fast .
everyone thinks i 'm weird because i actually enjoy going to the dentist .
it 's because i 've gone to dr. j. since i was 5 !
( i 'm 25 ! )
he is amazing and his staff is incredible too .
they are always so friendly and welcoming !
they do excellent work and dont do unnecessary things .
i 'm always nervous about x-rays and they also ease my worries .
they also have new hi-tech x-rays that are so quick and painless .
the first person you 'll meet is liz , she runs the front office .
she is such a good example of what 's to come .
very friendly and welcoming and always professional .
if you 're looking for a dentist , this is the one ! !

he emanated a warm , courteous , and professional feel .
the rest of the staff i had contact with were also caring .
i highly recommend him !
i am really happy with family doctors of green valley .
all the staff here are very friendly and compassionate .
i have n't had a long wait at any of my appointments .
i originally had beltone hearing aids and actually stared in a commercial for them .
i lost one pair of hearing aids and they replaced them very quickly .
malisa at miricle ear in henderson nevada is outstanding .
i made my appointment online .
i went in to be seen for a sore throat and possible sinus infection .
he was wonderful and very professional .
once he left the np walked in no less than 2mins later .
overall i was taken care of and had a great experience !
one of the best dentists i have ever had , very thorough and gentle .
the staff including the front desk and dental hygienist are very friendly .
! ..recommend the deluxe with hot rocks !
i had sinus and deviated septum surgery completed by dr. weingarten .
finally i can stop looking for a new dentist !
it was off a regular price that was already $ 550 less ! ! !
it includes retainers and all your visits , no hidden fees .
i can not say enough about how excited i am to have found them !
i will be recommending them to all my family and friends .
you 'll see i 'm right !
today was my very first full treatment appointment with dr. wrye .
without question dr. wrye is tremendously skilled in many treatment methods .
i had a great experience from start to finish with ttw .
when we arrived , we were the only customers .
this store is n't just about retail , it 's an experience .
the hygienist was one of the nicest i 'd ever met .
the new patient exam was thorough and included a short medical history .
he did n't believe that gum recession was caused by aggressive brushing techniques .
if you go to this location , request her you will not regret it .
i left feeling completely pain free .
so ... add $ 27 to your gel manicure or pedicure .
they never answer the phones , which can be frustrating .
however : they are nice .
they know what they are doing .
dr. hofflander was referred by my gp .
he got me in fast for a consult and scheduled surgery conveniently as well .
i was very happy with the surgical center staff and dr. hofflander was great !
great produce , good selection of healthier brands of food and health products .
employees seem happy and willing to help .
got the head and reflexology combo and the ion detox .
i absolutely loved both services .
for two hours , i was pampered beyond belief .
i felt like i was in a state of bliss .
this beats those burke williams any day .
in and out in 20 minutes with no appointment .
friendly team , clean and comfortable waiting area .
we tried a few locations before finding this one .
i 'm sure with an appointment this location would be a breeze .
one issue is no one actually monitors the front desk .
i 've been visiting this dentist for almost 10 years .
i actually go from california to las vegas to get treated every year .
i ca n't trust anyone else with my teeth .
dr. alemi is very kind and i find him to be very trustworthy .
he is always honest and communicates and educates me a lot on my teeth .
his staff is also very present and kind and the clinic is always clean .
i trust him more than i could trust anyone else with my teeth !
he tries to be very flexible and accommodating !
i was skeptical at first , but i was willing to try it out .
i am using the groupon and it 's helped so much !
the staff is so wonderful , friendly and knowledgable !
i recommend med shape to anyone who is considering it because you cant loose .
could n't ask for more ! ! ! !
this place is really great for a smaller shop !

they have the best edibles there and always have a fair price .
i would definitely tell my friends about it !
there is no one better in charlotte than prit !
she has the highest understanding of her clients and unmatched customer service .
he is very kind , caring , and attentive .
i would highly recommend him .
kevin is the best .
he focused on the issues i was having and made it so much better .
in a word - incredible !
ca n't believe all the 1 stars .
anyway , 5 stars go to both dr. andy tran and dr. camille le .
i am soooo happy today ! !
my shoulder has been giving me problems for 2 years .
i 'm open to possibilities .

i will only go here now .
great place to go i highly recommend .
i 've been a patient of dr. lawyer 's for more than 10 years .
would n't think of changing .
he and his staff are superb .
the owner made booking the appointment super easy .
next she asked us if there was anywhere we wanted them to focus on .
finally we were let into this nice little clean couples room .
the massage was really good and very relaxing .
relaxing music played the entire time which i enjoyed .
first time customers pay $ 27.99 for 1 hour .
they do prefer you tip in cash .
overall everything was amazing and definitely worth the price .
also the bathroom was very clean !
i would recommend to everybody !
great experience here ! !
the staff is great ! !
super friendly , funny and professional ! !
they have help me tremendously !

jon gave one of the best massages i 've ever had .
he 's really good at what he does .
i would recommend jon to anyone ! !
if i could give jon 6 stars instead of 5 i would !
he 's that good !
i 've been coming here for specialty prescriptions for the last 2 years .
they are always friendly and provides good customer service .
this is a truly excellent doctor but his office needs major help .
otherwise i would have had to wait months to see the doctor .
what a shame because he is truly an excellent doctor !
just got the prettiest matte black stiletto nails done by mary !
great service , clean salon and a variety of services offered !
i will def be back in the future ! !
thanks pop lash & nails !
not bad , not bad at all .
this is not a fancy spa .
and it 's open late , till 10 pm .
if you 're in the strip mall , definitely worth a visit .
after a gym class , getting a massage treatment by yang feels very refreshing .
if you have coverage , use your health insurance benefits !
physical therapy is so very helpful , the staff is awesome .
the knowledge of the staff is great ...
just got my teeth cleaned and now they feel so much better .
everyone was very nice and personable as well .
we love my left foot childrens therapy .

they are able to calm my son so quickly and help him learn .
his tantrums are calmed in seconds .

she is the best !
very fair pricing , an overall great experience .
my skin has never looked better and i appreciate her approach and technique .
jazz also does n't try to push products or other procedures not needed .
i would recommend her to everyone without hesitation .
dr. roskos has now been my dentist since the late-1990 's .
i would never consider going anywhere else .
the entire staff treats you like you 're the only patient they have .
friendly , gentle , talented people that genuinely care .

tricia did an amazing job and i left feeling very relaxed .
you wo n't be disappointed !
i know my go to spot every time we go to vegas , aloha
i had a great outcome after my total knee replacements .
i chose an excellent orthopedic surgeon - dr. sherwood duhon .
his team of anesthesiologists , pa , pt , nurses , office staff etc .
he also has a research team that gathers data from the patients ' feedback .
those information help future patients to make their recovery faster and easier .
it is less stressful when you have the knowledge of what will transpire .

considerably different than a western massage .
if you need a strong massage this is it .
i got a foot detox and a massage .
hannah was wonderfully pleasant and nice .
peter gave me my massage and i was happy to feel it .
some hands are just too soft or me , not his .
and sam was extremely polite and welcoming .
i 'll be back !
besides the madhouse that is the parking lot , this is a great store .
all tj devotees are already familiar with the great service and delicious food selections .
i only went early in the morning to avoid the crowds and the lines .
after circling the parking lot a few times , i almost gave up .
inside , the place was slammed .
i cursed myself for procrastinating on getting groceries earlier in the week .
i asked the cashier if this is a typical friday .
he told me it 's a typical everyday !
who knows what goodies i missed out on !
i would recommend him to anyone .
lindsay ( sp ? )
my daughter and i both trust her completely .
they have a hydroworx pool that is the only one in town .
we are excited to see how much further she can go .
dr. becky is an earth angel !
she has been a valuable asset to my daughter 's healing !
dr. becky is so patient , nurturing , and understanding .
she is extremely intuitive & just knows exactly what my daughter needs .
my daughter loves dr. becky !
since being under dr. becky 's care my child is a different person .
it 's night & day .
i did n't know if anything would change .

best dental experience ever !
the office is brand new and squeaky clean .
when i arrived , the staff greeted me warmly .
cleaning process went smooth .
and guess what ? !
your girl had no cavities .
highly recommend desert inn smiles !
vibe as with all 3 fresh locations : it 's busy .
but service is on the ball .
i ate anything on the menu is good .
i 'm not a vegetarian , but i love how everything has tasted .
the cookies are a nice treat at the end too .
obligatory catchy remark fresh lives up to its name .
i actually now crave vegetables !
( what is wrong with me is another conversation . )
my wife and i love this place and have never received a bad experience .
i am so happy i went to check out swina finally !
i had such a good experience with corina , my esthetician .
what a sweetheart ! .
she was knowledgeable and personable with a gentle touch .
i loved that i was offered a hand and foot massage during my facial .
the product recommendations were on point and there were no pushy sales tactics .
my skin felt hydrated , moisturized and clean when i left .
looking forward to my next facial : )
i enjoyed my donation , frankly .
every staff member i encountered had a great attitude and was friendly and polite .
the actual donating was conducted in a professional matter by friendly staff .
they all acted like they were fast food workers .

step one extraction of the 5 of the 6 broken teeth .
on 12/13 i had those teeth `` surgically extracted '' .
i was beyond impressed from the minute i got there .
i actually liked them .
preparing myself for the horror of a dental appointment , as i recall them .
i did n't feel anything at all getting the shots .
ok. i 'm impressed but we 'll see how it goes .
so , i honestly felt like i was in the chair 15-30 mins .
i was confused at the end like `` we 're done ? ''
yeah , we were done .
spoiler alert : it went great .
i felt no pain .
i felt pressure , sure but trust me that is definitely not pain .
recovery : after the anesthetic wore off i was actually fine .
the tenderness is gone and the stitches are pulling themselves out a little .
`` are you sure it 's ok for me to swallow ? ''
`` what if i sneeze ? ''
they worked seamlessly with my insurance .
i 'm excited to have a plan .
