total bill for this horrible service ?
these crooks actually had the nerve to charge us $ 69 for 3 pills .
i checked online the pills can be had for 19 cents each !
avoid hospital ers at all costs .
he promises great things them butchers your body .
i should have left my body alone .
it was not bad .
i was out to perfect it .
we often talk about how he ruined a good body .
i will never forget his dirty nasty slippers coming into the operating room .
i should have run from the room then .
i just had a terrible experience with dr. jennifer vonya-novak 's front office .
i changed my primary care to dr. novak .
l left , went home and called a 8 am , no answer .
i found her very condescending .
i have been getting monthly massages here for the past five months .
a couple of the therapists are good , and some lack experience .
yet the gentleman working the front desk clearly remembered scheduling that appointment with me .
he blamed it on glitchy new scheduling software .
i was extremely disappointed and embarrassed , since it was a gift .
but what else could we do but reschedule ?
so he again rescheduled .
this is getting ridiculous , and i 'm considering canceling my membership over it .
absolute waste of money .
the employee was very sweet , but do n't waste your money .
this place would get 1 star if the customer service sucked .
she was lacking in compassion , clarity , kindness , and professional ethics .
do not waste your time with dr. brown !
do your research people , this place is completely unprofessional .
my lips were extremely painful , swollen , bruised , and disproportioned .
choose a good md .
i believed her and had my blood drawn at their lab .
i immediately called lifescape and left a message , no one replied .
i believed them and left .
but a few weeks later i received another bill .
i called them a few more times explaining the issue .
i 'm really disappointed .
how can people trust them if they do business like that ! ! !
2. the waiting time in the clinic is too long .
i always have to wait there for 30-50 minutes passed the appointment time .
3. they do n't have xray machines .
good luck getting an appointment before you end up in the e.r .
do n't go here .
especially not for a full hour table massage .
i 'll spare the details , but i definitely do n't recommend this place .
they worry about their therapist but not their customers .
they said that 's the least they charge .
normally it 's full price of your service .
i was sent to vision source south hills for a second opinion .
however , i was incredibly displeased with how i was treated by the staff .
a month later , i received my refund along with an updated billing statement .
amongst the revised patient/insurance payment was a statement describing why the revision was necessary .
at this point , i do not see myself returning in the future .
i hate the customer service here but love the products .
maybe things are starting to look up here .
it needs to because there is never anybody in this store .
they are probably busy on saturdays .
he did n't know that by now ? ? ? ? ?
the waiting time for this location is 2hrs plus .
i would not go to this location ! ! ! !
i was told he is the best .
my daughter has multiple disabilities from a tbi .
she only has the use of that one arm/shoulder .
of course the doctor knew her condition at the first appointment .
shots in the shoulder and neck did not relieve the pain .
then she was prescribed with pain meds .
this went on another few years .
she was crying in pain everyday and in the night too .
she cried and `` begged '' me to cut off her arm several times .
we finally went back to lederman again .
then he walked out .
like he did not already know her condition from day one .
i got new glasses , lenses and a new hard lens here .
first they lost the order for my eyeglasses .
so getting my glasses took over two months .
that did n't happen so i called to ask about it .
this all again took several months .
but i 'm going back to oakland i guess .
the office staff just ca n't handle anything .
so mary and her husband came out and assembled a few pieces .
some large , some small .
all in all they did a very good job and were polite .
i think that we extended the same courtesy .
we actually asked them to come back and do another small job .
we needed fixtures attached to all our cabinets and drawers .
i told her , no problem .
i was ok. then ... ... silence .
never heard back from her again .
i know mary got my messages because i had gotten read receipts .
she just completely ignored me .
it was all very strange .
stephen w. said `` they 're real pros '' i beg to differ .
professionals who own and run their business should always respond to it 's customers .
i have never waited less than forty five minutes to see my doctor .
people go to spine specialists because they 're in pain .
please stop over booking .
biggest complaint - not one of the employees acknowledge you .
i will never recommend this place to anyone .
i had to decline her 4 times .
again , i had a miscarriage .
there is no compassion here .
if i could give less than one star i would .
i am incredibly disappointed after reading all these great reviews .
perhaps the doctor is great , but his staff is awful .
i called to say i was running late .
left a message because no one answered .
she claims she called me back but it did n't go through .
apparently she hit the call back button and it did n't go through .
that was the only attempt she made .
she did n't bother to actually dial the number i left .
she tells me she ca n't get me in until next tuesday .
she calls in a gentleman who is the only one who says halfway nice .
he steps out and sends in another woman who is also awful .
but they managed to change that .
god forbid i get any more ill ...
i always hated urgent cares .
how is that even possible ?
$ 110.35 for ten packs , vs $ 60.00 at local pharmacy .
i can guarantee you roadrunner pharmacy has gotten their last dime from me .
wow , guess my review was a bit premature .
i knew this already and was not going to choose either plan that day .
had i not gone over my charges as usual i would have missed it .
or , will you have insurance this year ? ?
this is supposed to be a dental practice helping/caring for patients .
where do i begin ?
how she has a job i will never know ! !
you may if your lucky get 25mins with a doctor a week .
clai was completely unprofessional and no way should be employed as a therapist .
she is going to get someone hurt or worse .
update**** i will never contact this dick face that commented .
got referred to this place by my hmo insurance care practitioner .
i went in there because i have pain on my arm socket and shoulder .
first visit , $ 70 co-pay .
still have the same shoulder and arm pain .
will be looking for another orthopedic doctor soon .
i went to see dr. miner for contact lenses .
i was told i needed to see dr. miner again .
i 've been growing and also a consumer of cannabis for over 20 years .
her response was that she could give me 10 % off another eighth .
all the bud was still in the container .
buyers beware : do n't let the size fool you .
this place lacks quality .
you just lost a loyal and high spending customer .
set up your game !
very cheap though and affordable .
but not for me .
i 'm used to getting a deep massage .
i will take my business elsewhere .
i mean really , this is ridiculous .
i will provide a time frame for this adventure .
current time of yelping : 6:20pm .
waiting ... ... . took picture of levine 's children 's room .
current time of yelping : 8:35pm .
current time of yelping : 8:35pm .
waiting ... ... ... . current time of yelping : 9:03pm .
waiting ... ... ... . they just called our name ... ... woo hooo .
current time of yelping : 9:23pm .
current time of yelping : 9 37pm .
waiting ... ... ... . dr came in ... ... still waiting .
when it comes down to being a doctor , they are the worst .
miss diagnosed 3 times and let alone the prices for all their treatments .
over all , my doctor now .
is not a doctor at all ! ! ! ! !
i am also trying to get my records and serum ... total nightmare !
the worst neurologist doctor in all of las vegas .
unprofessional attitude and he talked down to me as if i did something horrible .
he cut me off every time i spoke dismissing my concerns .
he actually argued with me over the meaning of paralysis .
he is very mean , rude and arrogant .
he walked off as i was ushered to the front to schedule another appointment .
i left in tears and crying uncontrollably .
he lives up to his bad reviews !
his personality is as lively as a dead flower .
this man is extremely mean and arrogant .
i 've never seen an owner on yelp `` fight '' with negative reviewers .
unfortunately , this administrative fee will prevent me from ever going back .
it 's sad b/c i feel the care was really great .
i really only shop here because of convenience .
the items they do have are often overpriced .
you really have to plan ahead and shop the weekly deals .
if you do n't , you have to pay the price ... literally .
the staff is hit or miss .
this is everything that is wrong with economies of scale .
-you will spend excessive amounts of time on hold .
-you may never actually speak to a doctor .
-no one takes any personal responsibility .
working with toca has led to nothing but half-baked information and a huge hassle .
too big for their own good .
you will feel like a commodity and not a patient .
i agreed to take an earlier appointment which took a week 1/2 to get .
which i could 've gotten everything taken care in one visit .
then i had to schedule a new appointment an additional week out .
my daughter likes the way she was treated but their scheduling sucks ! ! !
i tried to order contacts online through another company because they were so expensive .
stay very , very far away .
my husband was with me and he was so shocked he was literally speechless .
extremely rude , extremely poor customer service , not to mention extremely hurtful .
the owners/managers/whoever will be getting a letter from me shortly .
very rude over the phone when trying to get directions .
thanks for making me drive across town and getting horrible service
a patient for the past three years , with biannual check ups .
every time i leave after my appointment i ask myself why ?
without a doubt the most screwed up business i have ever seen .
their `` central '' appointment center is a disaster .
they have supposedly been scheduling same for three days now .
by far one of the worst massage places ever .
the lady answered phone calls and greeyed people at the door during my massage .
they flaunt the ability to make an appointment .
however , well good luck with that .
be sure you catch them at a good time .
i was treated for a leg wound by a wonderful pa , misty .
however , today i had some questions about the wound dressing .
that was over 5 hours ago .
they close at 6. so i called back .
and was told that he was `` too busy '' to talk to me .
i will call back and talk to misty tomorrow .
i know she will call me back .
i paid with my own funds and left .
i was throughly shocked that this happened .
what in anyone 's right mind that this was ok to say to someone ?
i 'm open to dialogue around it .
all the other doctors/dentists that have seen me have never asked .
i asked them to call and they said no .
i told them i knew my number and they said no .
some really great produce prices , which are what pulled us in .
bulk food section was small-ish , i though .
i think walnuts are more at rbn , though .
basically - do n't believe the low price claims !
i think we may go back for produce and that may be it .
parking is covered which is oh so nice .
one negative for families is no changing table in the bathrooms .
yeah , the floor was pretty clean , but still .
not a good thing for families !
do not use this lens crafters !
we paid a lot of money for prescription sunglasses and eye glasses !
we live 40 minutes away !
i received a text that my glasses are in .
my husband drove to pick them up ?
they told him they only have my sunglasses !
he leaves 10 minutes later i get a text glasses are in !
my other glasses were ther .
they never even looked !
we will never use this place again !
unfortunately the pearson eye group also will lose us as customers !
we spend over $ 1000 a year at lens crafters !
the `` quicklift '' was neither quick or a lift .
i look exactly the same and maybe even worse .
i had a similar experience that amanda f. had .
the first time here was odd because they had to stick me twice .
but eventually everything worked it ... for this first time .
this time , they stuck me and messed up .
i had to holler out for them to take care of the issue .
i have n't been back and do n't ever intend to .
this place has given me a fear of needles that i never had before .
just a couple people know what they 're doing .
they all seem to be fresh out of school or something .
i was told no , they had to keep rooms open for emergencies .
so wait , my dizzy and feel like passing out is n't emergent enough ?
a 2-hour wait with a mere 4 patients in the waiting room is ridiculous .
if i had n't felt so yucky i would have left .
unless they make some changes , i recommend finding another urgent care .
the worst receptionists are rude and unhelpful .
they do not waste a minute getting your money ! !
a disorganized rip off .
slowest and worst customer service ever .
always under staffed always slooow .
they have the monopoly for 2 reasons .
well update on the third try getting an adjustment here : 15 min wait .
defeats the concept of easy and fast adjustments totally .
i never have that problem at the charleston location .
damaging to the brand and annoying .
unfortunately that doctor was unavailable so i was paired with dr. howard .
( medication that contained an active drug that i was allergic to . )
the experience was horrible and the quality of care is non-existent .
this hospital does not care for its patients nor their well-being .
a fairly regular customer that will not be returning ever .
umm no sorry not ever returning
my unpleasant experience occurred a few years ago , and i have not returned .
i initially sought their medical advice on a recommendation from a friend .
he was wonderful , attentive , and detailed .
blood was taken and a follow-up appointment was set to go over the results .
this was the most insulting experience i ever had with a doctor .
she said all my levels were normal except for my liver enzymes .
huge red flag ! ! !
and i 'm talking about a glass of red wine .
she basically called me an alcoholic .
and on that list ... . hypothyroidism .
i have a medical background .
this was the worse experience i have ever been a victim of .
this doctor clearly did n't care about my ongoing health .
i do n't know if she is still there .
i think her name was jessica .
but that experience will keep me from ever wanting to return .
my biggest gripe was the mixing of low and high-functioning patients .
my doctor here , william bauer , was pretty nice yet very to-the-point .
a bit of an abrasive bedside manner , if you ask me .
i personally feel there are better facilities in the area .
go here only as a true last resort .
if you complain they send a letter saying they will no longer see you
sunday morning without a reservation is a 4 hour wait .
one person called every hour to fill spots vacated by no shows .
since they have nothing ready for me .
when i asked `` how can i prevent this from happening again ? ''
i called the `` hotel doctor '' last night .
told him my issue and he asked me to hold on .
the er happily took my money and helped me out .
the hotel doctor is a joke that just wants to overcharge desperate tourists .
what a horrible way to run a business !
it 's difficult scheduling an appointment .
i 'm not alone with my review .
i 'm not their only patient in need of care .
i hear the doctors at md anderson cancer center are great .
it 's the difficulty in getting an appointment scheduled .
again , the doctor i will be seeing gets outstanding reviews .
that describes 360 physical therapy in gilbert .
i was recently referred there after having knee surgery .
do you think i would schedule that very important appointment incorrectly in my records ?
i wish i could give -5 stars .
i waited an hour and 45 mins to see the doc , germaine .
he talks in circles and never explains your condition , or lack off .
i finally had enough and told him exactly what i thought of him .
horrid bedside manner , condescending , nasty , disrespectful , etc , etc .
really , no kidding !
i was so furious !
i have never been to a doctors office that actually had a freaking bouncer .
run from this office !
i was a patient of dr. lind .
looked past that and this week had terrible pain in my foot .
never heard from them again .
the park road office has terrible management and are very unprofessional .
i advise getting to a podiatrist who has his office managed well .
i have never been treated so badly by a physicians office .
this place is a complete price gouging rip off !
the environment is nice but the way they do things are almost too nice .
i went in for a cleaning and it took them 15 mins or less .
this doctor gave my phone number to a omega-3 supplement company without my permission !
where are your morals ? !
cancelling my future appointment .
will never go back .
when i asked if it was an infection , he said no .
overall , he was condescending towards me and not helpful .
hopefully my new ophthalmologist will perform the necessary tests and answer my questions respectfully .
my girlfriend had to splint it correctly ! ! ! !
i tried this place for the last time .
such a rip off .
dont go just because its convenient .
update : i have been a loyal customer for going on 8 years .
i am very pissed off , and have every right to be .
stay far away , and do not ever go here .
original : my massage therapist is jon .
i came out with just as many black heads as i did going in .
it was not worth the 70 plus tip for an hour .
what a horrible practice ! !
they schedule appointments on top of one another .
they ushered me into an exam room very shortly thereafter .
here 's where it gets ugly .
i 'm sitting in the exam room for a good 10 minutes .
i hear the door to the exam room directly next to mine open .
then i hear this : '' hello , mr. ____ , i 'm dr .
this is blatantly rude , greedy , and unkind .
i strapped my leg brace back on and crutched right out the door !
as i 'm leaving they 're yelling at my back -- - '' hey !
where are you going ? ''
so i replied -- '' i know when i 'm being played . ''
and kept thumping my way out the door .
the 2 other poor saps were still waiting in the waiting room .
with a 3 pm appointment like mine .
did i mention that someone else spoke up that had a 3:15 appointment ?
i got to the elevator at 4:15 pm .
would be the kind and polite thing to do .
dr. amon ferry needs a good wake up call .
or maybe a slap to the head or a kick to the tender area .
my appointment was ages ago , and i 'm still angry .
looks like i 'm not the only one dealing with the annoying rude receptionist .
anne marie does an excellent job , no doubt about it .
probably because the appointment i made was in a week .
she dare to accused me of not properly book the appointment online .
she said nothing was on the requested appointment .
i 'm always very thorough with my bookings .
she actually went in and changed my name to his ?
yup , what a moron , super incompetent .
she said , `` it does n't allow you to do that . ''
by the way , i checked again and screenshot the note section .
on the elements massage site breaks down by time slot and therapist .
i wanted anna marie , so i choose her time slot .
the moron started to ask me what massage pressure i want .
she told me , anna marie does n't do deep tissue .
so if i want that i have to change therapist .
anna marie does do deep tissue massage .
as you can see , super irritated with this moron .
trying to move schedule around for what ?
for her faves for have more scheduling or something ?
for sure wo n't be going back her to deal with this moron .
went there on 1/3/2014 after purchasing vouchers for myself and 2 friends .
the massage was not the best .
the pressure was inadequate .
we had to comply in order to leave .
it was very uncomfortable .
this place is an abomination .
i have had 2 showers and 1 bed bath since my check in .
the occupational therapy is pretty much a joke .
when i got to my appointment they forgot to send my x-rays with me !
the director of nursing is just as bad .
everyone i talk to here have nothing nice to say about this place .
things here seem to grow legs .
all in all , this was the most miserable medical experience of my life .
run , do n't walk from this office .
in the past 12 months alot of staff turn over .
? , is very depressing decor and colors and the place smells too .
its gone from bad to worse .
do n't chance it , skip this facility , for $ 6,000 .
+ a month , this is pure corporate greed at its worst .
what 's the point of an appointment time .
will not be rescheduling .
plan to taken hours off work if you go .
i 'm actually writing this review in regards to the x-ray tech .
could not believe how my mouth hurt for days after .
to bad the dentist has to suffer because of her techs .
i found this place via groupon and decided to give it a try .
what was not ok was an unspoken minimum $ 10 tip .
if i could give a rating for zero stars i would .
we were treated with anything but respect and dignity .
saw this pharmacy was near by and needed a prescription filled .
a cvs pharmacy on a saturday should be open , right ? !
the pharmacy closes at 6 on saturday .
i asked the cashier who was sitting on her cell phone for assistance .
should n't have even bothered .
expect a long wait .
i waited about 2 hours just to be seen .
bring a book or laptop or sleeping bag !
only good thing is , parking is easy and convenient .
are you kidding ? ? !
your stuff is already overpriced and it 's weird to ask !
i had already purchased the 3 so i wanted to finish them .
let 's just hope i do n't see these fools outside their job .
products frequently precipitate , orders are never on time , customer service is terrible
wow what a crazy first impression ! ! !
completely disrespectful of people 's time ! !
i went to this location a few months ago but forgot to leave feedback .
i was sore the next day from the spots where it was painful .
their office staff are rude as heck ! ! !
do these people ever pick up the phone ?
i need an appointment .
at this point i 'm asking the dr for someone else .
i did n't have to wait on evdi .
in ten minutes had an appointment and they where nice on the phone .
i still have nothing from natalie pyles , personal trainer .
also works out of fitness elements .
her facebook page is just as ridiculous as she is .
a group of us are getting together to present something .
it is may , 2017 , and still not one cent .
check her out on facebook , and you will see what i mean .
there i found 2 0f the three things i went out for .
i am certain that this is stomach flu not only food poisoning .
i had stomach flu in college .
i know the difference .
super bowl sunday was ruined .
i have never eaten their prepared food .
i never will eat or shop there at that location .
i am from austin .
i know and like whole foods , but this place is terrible .
first visit was quite helpful .
i will order from the soap company directly from now on .
i wo n't be back .
if you are thinking about bringing your compound pharmacy needs here - do n't !
this month i called in my refill 8 days prior to needing it .
they said it would be delivered on the 22nd ( a week away ) .
there was no delivery on the 22nd so i called on the 23rd .
the earliest they could get it done was in 7 days .
they said again , 7 days .
the doctors are limited in time and knowledge .
not to mention an average office visit is $ 175 .
the staff often seemed clueless and rude .
not sure how or if there is any regulatory organization monitoring this tragedy .
the selection is not terribly wide .
given its proximity to penmac , its tiny cheese section felt embarrassingly pathetic .
its price does n't seem to be competitve either .
one of which was a painful biopsy .
this has thus far turned out to be false .
this also has thus far turned out to be false .
the office staff blamed corporate .
corporate tried to blame the office staff .
not because it 's necessary .
they sprung a painful biopsy on me during an office visit .
as far as the biopsy , another requirement of bcbs .
i had the same screening 14 months prior .
again , they told me it had expired .
a screening that according to my age , i only need every 5 years .
they have also refused to explain why they put me through a painful biopsy .
i will also mention they use an out of network anesthesiologist .
she told me she 'd balance bill me for any co-insurance or deductibles .
that 's not balance billing !
i am fully aware it 's my responsibility to verify my own insurance benefits/requirements .
hoping other women do not end up going through a similar experience as mine .
there 's a reason this review is still posted here and elsewhere .
huge scam ! ! ! !
this place over charged me for services for my wife .
they made me feel stupid for being concerned .
i never received that explanation of benefits .
by reading the other comments it looks like they ripped off many people .
please stay away from this business .
someone should report them to the irs and the authorities .
was told i could cancel by submitting a written letter to cancel .
i told her i 'd find the number myself ( which i did ) .
she called me and left a couple of voicemails ! !
dr. zak is very unprofessional and hateful .
there is a difference between 'not sugar coating things ' and being completely inappropriate .
if i could give zero stars i would .
do not go here if you are pregnant .
i 've had three massages here over the last six years .
my 60-minute massage lasted 48 minutes and was below average .
i already paid though so i suppose i am stuck for now .
now the is n't anyone at reception at all .
i 'm leaving , this is ridiculous .
i threw up in the waiting room for an hour before being called .
the lack of knowledge displayed from the entire staff baffled me .
i then waiting for 20 minutes before anyone came in to check on me .
he never looked at me or examined to ensure i was okay .
the lack of knowledge , compassion , and assistance at this office is sick .
also.. you will wait 1 to 2 hours past your appointment time .
please do not go here .
please take a patients allergies seriously when the clearly spell them out for you .
oh and have you ever heard of hippa ?
i was seen here today by np rebecca gonzales .
she is unfriendly , uncaring and unprofessional .
i felt like she was annoyed that i was there .
she did not bother to hear/listen to me about my illness .
she had her mind made up and that was it .
the rest of the staff was professional and friendly and the facility was clean .
.. do n't think i 'll be going back anymore waste of money for sure
friends and i were looking to kill time before dinner .
it 's a little hard to see from the road .
honestly , this place did n't feel clean .
the leg/foot massage itself was not very comfortable .
like , it was painful and i usually have a high threshold for pain .
i did n't leave feeling relaxed .
i would n't recommend this place .
i was in vegas last week with three of my friends .
this was one of the worst massage experiences i 've ever had .
the employees were rude and scammed us out of our money .
we quickly argued this fee since it did not state it on the groupon .
but again the groupon did n't state anything about any additional fees .
yes , you read that correctly .
they wanted me to pay more for less service .
the massage was not great at all .
the guy i had was really rude and unpleasant .
this is a horrible establishment and people should go elsewhere .
think twice before buying this groupon ... horrible experience ...
sorry when did tips become mandatory ?
at 50.00 10.00 is 20 % why do they think they should get more ?
and if they do i have the right to decide that not them .
loved them for years now i am not returning .
plenty of places on spring mountain to try for massages .
we 'll go to another location .
this year being over eighty you would think more attentive treatment would be given .
he was given medicine that was shooting pains in his head .
he made his appointment with same complaint .
it was cancelled without notice .
he drove 30 miles to just be turned around .
nothing resolved new appointment .
i can find no reason for this type of treatment of a patient ever !
each visit i interacted with new staff members that were `` in training '' .
i would expect better from a board certified doctor 's office .
i do not recommend this facility for non invasive work performed by technicians
i was not happy at all with my experience here .
we did n't have to wait for a table and got seated right away .
the store looked really busy .
i ordered poutine and salad .
both of the were awful and the fries was cold .
the salad had no flavouring nor seasoning .
it was honestly horrible .
i would have done a better job doing a salad .
the fries for the poutine was cold but the sauce was lukewarm .
i genuinely did not like the food but thats not a major issue .
i 've been there before and i would 've just let it pass .
every restaurant had bad day .
i 've been here twice and their food last time was good .
the waiters seemed really uninterested and only came by once to change our water .
here is where my frustration is .
the bill costed me 19.78 and i give a 20 dollar bill .
she asked me change and i said no .
it makes no sense getting change for few cents .
she then looks at me and asks me that she wants tip .
i was speechless not because of the tip but because she was very rude .
my friends are there too and they were also asked for tip .
i only heard 'tip . '
and she said that there was a 15 % tip requirement .
i then ask her how much 15 % would be .
the tip was n't even going to the chefs .
which again , the food was bad .
honestly , i would have left the bad food get away .
i did tip her at the end of the day .
few bucks was really not the issue .
it was how badly i was treated that day .
i will not be visiting again .
that being said , the clinical staff at udhs is truly excellent .
all have been extremely friendly and polite .
the wait time is typically between 10 and 15 minutes .
the dentists are also wonderful .
dr. christine wankiiri-hale is exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable .
otherwise , i recommend their clinical expertise .
the customer service is poor , extremely poor .
first i have visited many foot spas .
then she said `` you want to add $ 20 tip '' ?
i said , i 'll add a tip when the massage is done .
i said , i would give a good tip if the massage was good .
she said , `` this is not a restaurant '' .
within about 2 minutes the phone rang and she ran to answer it .
then , came back and resumed the massage .
then she came back in with the phone , talking .
i asked if she could call that person back .
she said no , because it was her insurance agent .
i asked again if she could call back .
then she said to me , `` just give me 5 minutes '' .
she left the room .
i got up , got dressed and went out to the lobby .
i told her i needed a refund and i was leaving .
she told me `` you saw me hang up '' .
i said , i came to relax and you have answered the phone twice .
i really just want to get a refund .
she said she could not reverse the charge on my credit card .
so , she then reached in her wallet and gave me $ 50 .
she said she will try to refund $ 10 .
do n't go here .
plus the area is a bit sketchy !
has anyone gotten their money back from scammer natalie pyles ?
another lie from this fake .
do not sign her for personal training .
i just spent an evening with food poisining .
i had the soup/salad/cornbread combo .
soup was carrot lime .
i 'm a musician and this was my pre-show meal .
i thought i was doing something good for myself .
turns out something in the ingredients was bad or dirty .
i had to bow out of the show .
just thought if let everyone know .
might not be so `` fresh '' at fresh .
so here 's how my visit goes -- literally like 4 mins .
i need new shades and i have a aaa-membership -- win win .
i do not need a prescription , just the glasses .
husband stays in car because i am gon na be that quick .
try on a pair .
try on another pair .
have you been helped ? ''
and my response is `` no ! ''
i understand that you are going to close in 15 mins .
and that you have lives to live .
and today , you did a very bad job .
but today was bad ! !
3.25.18 4:40 pm 7700 w. arrowhead glendale , az
i get a reminder call for my appointment .
my dr. is great been visiting this practice for 15 years .
the front office needs a lot of work .
time to look for another dr .
absolutely some of the worst customer service i 've ever had .
first they repeatedly `` lost '' the credit card numbers we had on file .
avoid at all costs .
i tried to make my daughter an appointment to see the pediatrician .
i did n't even make it past the front office girls .
i guess we will just find another pediatrician that is more understanding .
unfortunately a very weird and average massage .
not relaxing therefore a low rating .
dr. brown was very cold and impersonal .
the worst experience in my entire life .
would give negative stars if i could .
try basically any other plasma center than grifols/biomat/talecris .
by far one of the worst doctor 's offices i 've ever been to .
i had no chance to ask any questions yet alone discuss my concerns .
she had the worst attitude i 've ever seen .
do n't come to this place ! !
the staff was friendly and the visit was quick .
once we got the bill though , we were extremely disappointed .
we will not be going here again .
drive just another minute south to a totally different urgent care with honest workers .
pretty disappointing sleep study .
i almost walked out as soon as i got there .
my husband has really good coverage and they where in plan $ 20 .
we wont begoing back there after that .
i 'm about ready to leave .
i 've been here since 10:00 am for a 10:15 appointment .
i 've been sitting in the examining room for a half hour .
i had hoped the waiting time issue had been resolved but it has not .
i 'm back to a one star review at this point .
i 'll find a practice that respects my time .
like any other whole foods .
atleast aj 's staff knows extensively what their product is and super friendly .
for organic produce i rather go to sprouts .
thanks but no thanks .
do n't use the on-line booking tool !
i was told to come back in 2 days .
calling my primary to use another provider .
the front desk staff are nasty , rude people !
as if we enjoyed going in !
otherwise we , would n't go in !
the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result .
i must be insane ! ! !
i 've been coming here for years and nothing has changed .
the front office staff is still just as rude as ever .
that is so sanitary ! !
the reviews are not exaggerated they are the truth .
never coming back ! ! ! !
went to there order corner near the salad bar buffet .
needless to say i wo n't be returning to this place !
i was absolutely upset with my experience today .
i went for an appointment at the chandler location , and saw dr. le .
do n't they have records for that reason ? ?
dr. le was hard to understand and did n't seem helpful at all .
doctor green is a joke .
sounds like his problem not mine !
i made an appointment with another doctor today .
i do n't see how it can get any worse .
is n't that what you 're there for ?
he ridicules people and has a really bad attitude .
just walked out after waiting two hours for a chest x-ray .
unfortunately it is the only diagnostic test you ca n't make an appointment for .
it has since been countless calls , 2 messages and 2 emails .
this `` spa '' is a scam .
wo n't ever go back there .
if you want an overpriced hack job , this soul-sucking spot might be okay .
blue please ... .thanx mom , that 's what i thought you wanted .
what ? ? ? ? ? ?
you 're the professionals - you did not ask the correct / all questions .
do not go to this walmart - they are idiots !
soo i go here based on reviews ! ! !
wish i had n't .
appt time for my daughter was 1:30pm ! !
we left at 5 mins till 5pm ? ? ?
took almost 4 hrs to extract 1 tooth .
but service was soooooo slow .
we will never come back here again for any dental work !
we were the only ones in the lobby .
i was a patient there for several years .
they have a couple great doctors who deserve better .
she began by saying i understand you do n't want to take a physical .
none of that was in the conversation .
she was one of the least personable people i have spoken to .
i found out about 3 months later that i was still without life insurance .
i wish doc mike had better help .
for the record doc mike is great , they just need better management .
dr. angel is a sweetheart and she has ( mostly ) an amazing staff .
but do n't expect any type of customer service from the girls up front .
if i could give a zero i would .
i am currently going to pick up my child from the hospital .
they have lied to us about everything .
then their story changed but i have the proof .
he made her think these drugs were the answer .
she was not following the program and they allowed it .
my daughter did n't like him either .
they told her dad that she requested to be in the outpatient program .
they were like a cult when it comes to her treatment .
there is soooo much more inconsistencies .
they gave her drugs against our requests .
but i am sure they do n't care at all about that .
so she will have to wait longer .
very bad experience..luckily i have proof of all the inconsistent stories and lies .
so , this two-star review is n't for her part .
i took my paperwork from my np and headed over there .
as i was leaving , i heard them still talking about it .
i made my boyfriend go back with me and hold my hand .
massage therapists are awesome but front desk is terrible .
sucks but it is what it is .
sad that i will have to find a new therapist .
i wanted to write a brief update of my smi experience .
doctor called in prescription on 4/18 .
told on 4/19 that i had 3 times to pick up next day .
friday partell called system down had to pick up tuesday .
tuesday told not ready will deliver thursday .
called friday said they would deliver between 6-8 pm .
what kind of service is this ?
it 's now been one week and a half !
no excuse for this bad service !
others reviews are on point .
made an appt for 4 o'clock .
was told to go in 15 mins early to do paperwork .
at 5 o'clock i was still waiting .
people ca n't get service without being loud and rude and complaining ?
if they ca n't handle their workload then do n't schedule so many patients .
it 's not rocket science .
be prepared to pay out of pocket , in addition to your co-pay .
well , apparently the pa office is hurting to get every dollar possible !
while the staff were nice the wait was ridiculous .
it 's close to the strip so it 's mostly out of towners .
avoid it if possible unless you want to be there half a day .
they stated that someone would be in contact with me shortly .
no one called me back , and they charged my card the next day .
i feel dismissed and disrespected .
i learned the hard way that dr. welker is not the practitioner for me .
i had been searching for a cpap provider .
i finally got ahold of someone .
first , i am very happy with the diagnostic services at this location .
they are good about mailing you results , which is always an appreciated follow-up .
this is unacceptable way to do business .
i still have no credit .
i was in a car accident and referred here from my chiropractor .
doctor basically told the staff to tell me to make it last .
why am i being blamed ?
oh my god are you kidding me ? ? ! ! ! ! !
i had the most rude lady today drawing my blood .
the first thing she said to me is `` whats your problem ? ''
i told her i was just nervous and i hate getting blood taken .
she told me to deal with it because nobody likes it .
what the hell ? ? ! ! !
she needs to get fired asap ! !
she bruised me pretty bad !
i do n't know why i keep going back here ... convenience i guess .
this place is the worst though .
what 's up with that ?
ugh , next time i 'm going to costco ! !
so , i stumbled in , signed in & found a seat .
the services they provide are good .
their scheduling and billing are terrible at best .
the results were outstanding ! ! !
being on time and billing though are catastrophic .
usually , you wait 15-30 minutes beyond your scheduled time to see the doctor .
unfortunately , i had another immovable appointment i had to get to .
so we ran through everything and she suggested i do the immunotherapy .
that leaves me with my billing complaints .
i have been there 4 times .
for anyone in accounting is this gaap ?
heck no it is n't .
this is irs puts you in the pokey kind of accounting .
this place is in desperate need of a coo and a cfo .
and with her care and long hair products we do n't get split ends .
sincerely ben the receptionist and the clients that heard you on speakerphone .
can i give this place zero stars ? ?
i could write a negative book on this place .
so my friend two years ago recommended this place .
but they started getting shady about 6 months ago .
a different doctor every time .
then he started treating me like an imbecile and showed no good bedside manner .
can i curse in my review ?
going on good faith as i do care about my health .
um i am not a fool , a random doing invasive work !
i walked out getting nothing done and went for a second opinion somewhere else !
glad i did as what they said was an emergency was far from it !
especially if you do care about your health !
i have been told by everyone and their mother how great redemption psychiatry is .
to compare , i 'm paying $ 2.50/month for my current meds .
unfortunately that 's not the worst part .
instead , i was interrogated to admit that my dad abused me .
that had potential to ruin one of the most important relationships in my life .
i challenge everyone to be aware of this next time .
the people are nice , but that 's about all .
but i guess that 's their version of express .
if you can find a different shop for your pedicure .
positives : my appointment began on time .
the nurse was efficient and moved with rigor , the office staff was personable .
negatives : the doctor was less than compassionate when it came to my issues .
i explained that i have chronic sinus infections that linger .
i explained that green/yellow mucus is in my throat and nose daily .
i also explained that my sense of smell seems to be deteriorating .
he did not address this concern .
i went to the desk to provide the $ 60.00 copay .
i asked for a print out of what i was seen for today .
i was told it 's not ready , but can be mailed .
i do not feel like my needs were met .
i was told its easy to find !
.. well it was not .
i tried to talk to customer care , again with the machine .. seriously ?
i have been spoiled by world class treatment at umc .
i have been a patient of dr. burns for over ten years .
i see her for my yearly women wellness check ups .
they do n't see each others patients .
i explained how this was an emergency .
which they would n't provide to me for another week .
i have never been so displeased with a physicians office .
i was about 15 minutes late because i went to the wrong location .
too bad because it used to be a pleasurable experience .
orthopedic services were average , very forgettable !
the billing is extremely disorganized and very poorly managed !
i received a bill in september for services rendered 10 months earlier !
otherwise , i would n't give this store a second thought .
their products are pretty much all overpriced .
these people seem to find it very hard to say `` hi . ''
no people skills whatsoever ! !
one guy in there is pretty douche-y .
i do n't bother to find out his name .
i do n't like her at all .
she 's real confrontational and does not care if something is bothering you whatsoever .
the appointment lasts for all of 5 minutes .
she then weighs you on a scale she bought from walmart .
does n't she have record of that ? !
she is a bit difficult to get in touch with .
she also charges md prices when she 's just a nurse practitioner .
very expensive and very rude.. would n't recommend them to anyone !
the women running the business is a very scary-looking and rude woman .
she does n't even have nice teeth herself .
groupon holders beware there are way better ways of getting whiter teeth for $ 100
this place is a scam .
i bought a $ 49 groupon , towards $ 1,500 towards an invisilign treatment .
i was dumbfounded , and left it alone .
extremely long wait before nurses to respond .
my sister is a human being and our loved one ! ! !
the casting team and physical therapists here have been very competent and personable .
others seem to appreciate him so maybe it depends on whether he likes you .
we found him to be arrogant and impatient .
other doctors had recommended surgery but we were hoping for a noninvasive second opinion .
she has been using it `` normally '' , and it hurts .
it 's been hurting since it was broken , and never really stopped .
she is not the type to complain unless it is serious .
and when she tells me something hurts , i believe her .
probably `` dr. haber '' did n't believe her .
but i suppose that comes hard to those with too much hubris .
the woman i talked to was very rude and showed no empathy .
it 's a required medicine .
who knows if i 'll be able to find someone or not .
the concept of time means nothing to this group .
have a 2pm app't ?
how about you stop booking folks in the p.m. instead ?
and it 's not just stockton , it 's the pa 's as well .
poor service culture here .
my advice to anyone reading : got a rash ?
dash off to another firm .
if i could give this place no stars i would .
this was one of the worst experiences i have received .
i contacted them in regards to my complimentary consultation .
i do not recommend this office to anyone !
i have no respect for dr. dalley and her staff .
i read the reviews .
one review brought tears to my eyes .
dr. dalley was my doctor then and thank god never again .
i remember my ( first pregnancy ) .
i was feeling strange .
i was sent to have blood work done and something else .
i took her advice she did the surgery .
years past and once again i was pregnant for the ( second time ) .
one week later i tell my mom that something does not fill right .
i said ; ( mom i think that i am still very pregnant ) .
i say to her ( what did you take out ) ?
i could have died .
please to all the women ( pay attention to your body ) .
i told her i do n't have medicaid .
she needs to get her time accurate .
i told her i never told her that nor did my mom .
she said `` oh , what did you tell me ? `` .
i was so ticked off .
i was like wtf did i just see ? ? ?
i could n't take anything he said seriously because of what i had seen .
she was so unprofessional and a straight up rude b**** .
i was also told my appointment would only take 30 mins .
well some of the other reviewers are correct .
i went here because of all the excellent ratings .
the staff was super nice and made me feel comfortable .
the computers were having issues that day and had problems with the xray .
so i never got to see why i was having tooth issues .
never gave me pain meds or anitbotics after i went twice .
so she had me reschedule again to do it again .
oh and she measured my cervix wrong .
( i always make sure my insurance covers ) they said yes etc .
the lady at ( prenatal valley ) had to edit all of my information .
they 've always told me no .
which is a lie because now i have a balance owed of $ 147 .
for the `` emergency 's `` .
thanks to this location i now owe all together roughly around $ 600 .
so thank you to all whom participated in my negative experience ! !
he then said they only sell the flavoring for the shakes .
i hope they pay close attention , as you will continue loosing patients .
the doctors that i have encountered have been uncaring , rude and unprofessional .
i will never be returning to this practice .
in addition i had two kids with me .
she barely helped me through the menu and was just unpleasant in general .
i will find another location to visit based on this experience .
***** long term patient***** be careful !
i started going to southview in 2012. polite , kind , fancy equipment .
annoying and time consuming .
there were 2 very bad experiences i had .
1 - a crown broke when i just moved to europe .
it was very hard to manage with it broken .
why do that when you know i grid my teeth ! ? !
he said because the top was protecting those teeth , i was fine .
i was n't going to get work done in europe .
only my back molars are touching .
this was not the case with southview .
i recommend seasoned dentists .
please learn from my costly error of going to this practice .
my experience with junction optometrists has always been poor .
the two optometrists i have seen were excellent ; helpful , competent and friendly .
unfortunately the pricing and the staff are way below par .
and there were a lot of forms !
it felt as though many of the questions were unnecessarily duplicitous .
again , i decided to work with them and reschedule .
turns out , they had n't .
by this point , i had given up .
they clearly do n't have a working organizational system , which concerns me .
ultimately , i decided to book with another dentist in the area .
i found the sales staff to be a bit aggressive .
maybe it 's just me .
she looked confused and in disbelief at what she was seeing .
children do not belong in a hot tub to begin with .
i wo n't be back .
outdated salon with rude , horrible customer service .
i asked for a trim and the result was an uneven mess .
save yourself , and your hair , do n't go here !
horrible customer service experience ; could n't even get past the receptionist .
refused verified insurance coverage , inaccurate cash pricing , poor attitude .
overall an underwhelming and less than positive experience .
my feet have been killing me .
i do n't know why .
now i regret it .
ok these people do n't speak english well .
she just lightly rubbed them .
see you soon healing touch !
wo n't go again .
my child needed some fillings and we found this dentist had positive reviews .
do not use them unless you have money to burn .
extremely poor commuunication and listening skills- highly suggest going elsewhere !
i never thought i 'd see the day when walgreens became classier than cvs .
this place used to develop photos , now it does n't .
once the procedure was performed , they wanted to charge me full price .
this made an already difficult day worse than we could have ever imagined .
great customer service after i called twice already .
managers came outside and rectified the situation .
they were great and apologetic .
it happened and that 's why good managers will address it .
i take back the nice things i said .
but this place would definitely not be my first choice after reading this review .
worst experience of my life !
dr. thomas redid an old filling and chipped my tooth next to it .
had to go back to fix it .
he sliced my tongue on the drill .
i ended up having to go to another dentist to fix all his mistakes .
he left a filling to high and messed my bit .
he is very rude and unprofessional .
i have a crazy confession to make ... . i hate whole foods !
i especially hate this whole foods .
i do n't get the love.. sorry people .
*their salad bar sucks .
their cottage cheese is runny and gross .
i adore menage a trois wine .
i typically buy it at smith 's for between 6.99 and 8.99 a bottle .
why does whole foods charge 16.99 a bottle ?
i hate you whole foods *prepared food is n't that good !
pizza.. sucks.. ( come on settebello is in the same parking lot !
) , pasta.. awful and inedible .
sandwiches are just ok.. just ok for these prices ?
nothing is that good or worth eating at these prices .
*i 've found expired salsa on their shelves.. expired by a freaking year .
just cancelled and move to fitness connection for $ 10 bucks a month .
serious over crowding issue .
been here for over 4 hours and still have n't seen a doctor .
they are always short staffed .
went there this weekend with my husband .
you tell them your problem before being processed.dr .
zima pakzad did absolutely nothing to help him .
an urgent care that gives no care ? ? ?
she told him to go to the hospital .
how is talking to him going to help his medical problem .
the place was dirty .
blood on the floor in the waiting room , right next to couch .
they office staff even had bad appearance .
it looked like 80 % of them rolled out of bed and came in .
do n't waste your time here .
they do n't help .
my original review was very positive i did enjoy my message from breida .
it 's they only place where my eyes came in contact with anything .
the former activity director was very attentive and helpful , not to mention business-like .
recommend all veterans to not go to this neurology center ! ! !
unhappy patient of va , who was reffered here , big mistake ! ! !
made an appointment three weeks ago to see a doctor .
i had to wait that long because he was very busy .
do not come here .
the office seems very old and creepy .
each room had a floor fan and a beat up desk .
one of the hallways did n't even have its lights on !
just completely dark , very creepy .
the place just looked completely deserted .
( at this point i was very upset and frustrated ) .
moral of the story ; do n't trust zocdoc with their recommendations .
i should 've checked yelp to see what people had to say .
this could 've all been avoided if i had seen all these reviews first !
and do n't go to this practice ! ! !
the most unprofessional and unpleasant experience i 've had the displeasure of living through .
i started treatment in november 2014 for laser hair removal on two areas .
other than that i was satisfied with the personal at this location .
now for the hair removal .
it did n't work - at all ! ! !
all of my hair is back , with a vengeance !
if that 's the case , then why did n't it work .
even the very minimal touch-ups is an understatement in my case .
very dissatisfied with the results .
they did the next morning .
the nurse practitioner i saw ( dr .
so far so good .
`` , he said .
i had him check my two moles .
he said we 'll keep an eye out on them .
again , `` what else ? ''
i showed him the skin tag by my eye .
so i wasted my pay for this place .
time to find a new eye doctor !
this place had decent yelp reviews so i went with it .
initial scheduling was a breeze but rescheduling was a nightmare .
with each call , i was asked to verify my insurance information .
`` it was n't recorded , '' was their response .
on the day of the appointment , i arrived fifteen minutes early .
what 's up hipaa ?
after the phone call she said i was not covered by vision insurance .
alas , i was covered and just in time for my appointment .
i called a week later after not hearing from the office .
`` one pair is finished , the other will be done this afternoon .
we 'll call you . ''
we 'll put that pair together today and call you for pickup . ''
meaning i was lied to the day before .
and again , no call .
i waited two more days .
i 'll call you this afternoon for pickup . ''
bummed , because they 're so close .
but i wo n't be going back .
i 'd rather have 12 unmedicated kids with add than deal with her .
i do n't have time to make notes about this '' .
if she worked for me she 'd be fired in a hot minute !
they even faxed me proof they were waiting on her !
buffy is amazing and dr. piacentine is great !
front office girls are not friendly .
probably trained by latisha .
i went to dr. rick office for general dentistry is great .
he is good and gentle .
now i had to go for oral surgery to close the pockets .
i was told no the gaurantee was cancelled when i left the practice .
one implant has cost me $ 7,421.00 which is horriable .
i do not recomend him .
dr. knirk is completely incompetent .
accuses patients of faking .
lies right to your face .
avoid at all costs .
this place is keeping itself in business by promoting weekly and monthly recurring customers .
some chiros will help you .
nice receptionist , but morally bankrupt premise that their business is built on .
dr. kotoske is terrible .
please go anywhere else .
i did a rhinoplasty a few years back and he made my nose worse .
my new nose looks swollen and it still hurts .
they did absolutely nothing but hurt .
i am more self conscious about my nose than ever .
it 's not like it 's a one time mistake .
he did the same exact thing to my sister 's nose 6 months later .
so this is a habit .
well it ca n't be a professional opinion when you make something worse .
from one civilized person to another , please do n't go to him .
it will save you money and time .
doctor-patient manners are non existent .
i was then told i could come in the next day to see someone .
dr. young was condescending and overconfident when my husband came to him for help .
this location in particular , was a huge disappointment .
think i am looking for a new office ! ! !
i 've been coming here for grocery once a week since they opened .
i buy the organic veggies fruits and chicken .
however , the meat price has gone up twice since amazon took over .
i stopped buying meat from here .
they went bad within a couple of days .
the quality of the deli is not as good as before either .
i got a 30 minutes reflexology , the massage itself was okay .
i did like the fact that the place was clean .
wow , for a $ 20 massage $ 5 tip is pretty good !
but they expect $ 15 and up !
but that 's not right !
the owner should pay them what they are entitled to .
one star , because you 're not able to give a zero .
made an appointment for a stat childrens x-ray .
came to the appt , and waited over 1.5 hours ! !
ridiculous and will never go back .
3 ) the doctors here are psychics !
they are n't very effective for eye pain !
you guys really are the absolute best in medicine !
remind me to drive right past this place if i 'm ever dying !
the staff is terrible .
they have called me twice the day of to try to get her in .
who is in charge of this place ?
my doctor recommended dr. romine .
i arrived this morning 20 minutes early to fill out paperwork .
i was told dr. romine was booked .
at this time i was told they would try to work me in .
we received none of the services that are standard with a complete physical exam .
the pa barely looked up while going through the forms we completed .
the bulk of the visit was watching her type the info into the laptop .
i still need a physical , a pelvic exam , and a breast exam .
yep , i still need all of those things .
all other concerns will be saved for another provider .
it was early but i packed up the kids and went to the hospital .
as though that were my fault .
and it 's costing me $ 175 .
forewarned , parents of young ones .
if i could do no stars i would .
had a hot stone pedicure from the owner ben .
it was the most painful non relaxing experience .
he cut me three times .
i had a prescription sent over to this pharmacy at 8:30 in the morning .
i showed up at noon my lunchtime to pick this prescription up .
the young lady helping me have no idea what workmen 's comp .
well it 's workmen 's comp .
and then i find out the prescription cost $ 35 .
the owner doesnt care of client who visit with the groupon .
totally , stay away from this so called clinic spa ! !
rude admin staff and very hard to reach .
always had to call several times and/or leave several messages .
always felt like i was bothering them .
great smoothies , terrible service .
everyone who works there is nice but sooooooo slow .
be prepared to wait 30 minutes for your smoothie .
we have visited many times , never had on complaint .
i was very disappointed & felt a waste of time and money .
all i got for my money was you 're doing a great job !
you are an ideal tmj patient .
just keep on managing it .
my oral surgeon first was one of the top at ucla .
it 's well worth it !
the hours are posted and they are never here .
they also never answer their telephones .
do n't waste your time and money on such a. u professional place .
twice what most dentists in toronto charge .
i was very happy with their service , until i shopped their price .
stay away from this place .
go to doctorcare or cholla medical instead .
i bought a 60-minute massage session from groupon .
i walked in 5 minuets before my 10 am appointment .
the massage therapist gave me some paperwork to complete .
i will never go back there again
i had a new patient appointment and wo n't be going back .
i needed a new doctor and searched online for the best female doctor .
finally a male doctor came in the room .
he was very nice but i never even found out what his name was .
the salon was empty , only one associate working -- `` amy . ''
we then promptly began the foot soak .
i closed my eyes .
i opened my eyes and saw that she was texting on her cell phone .
she looked up at me , said `` sorry ! ''
and put her phone away .
and put her phone away .
finally , two minutes later i caught her texting a fourth time .
that did it for me .
she said , `` sorry , sorry , sorry . ''
we ended at the half-hour mark .
i asked how much i should pay her for a partial hour .
she said twenty dollars .
-- -- - i did n't know whether to be angry or laugh .
gold spa foot reflexology , sorry .
i went to cdc chinook for ultrasound .
they told me to drink water an hour before which i did .
the technician was almost 40 min late .
no one called and said that it would be late .
i had to sit and be tourchered for almost an hour .
it 's unacceptable to tourcher people like this .
finally i could not wait anymore went to the bathroom .
i just do n't understand why .
for procedure like this it 's not ok to make person wait that long .
i ate the white food for 48 hours .
honestly i get a better result from the strips .
i wo n't be back or recommend this to anyone .
had an appointment at 3:30 to get my sons 15mo wellness and vaccinations .
i pride myself on this .
so this just threw me over the top .
this review is partially about the center but mostly regarding kenneth houchin , md .
my wife had a cva ( stroke ) which took part of her vision .
the last visit we had he back-peddled stating that her vision might improve .
i say `` soooo what ? ! ''
an idiot is an idiot regardless of title or position !
long story short ... do not go to dr. kenneth houchin !
i had my initial appointment to see ann marie for some postpartum troubles .
so i sat there , and sat there .
they let me into the counseling room and i sat even longer .
here ann marie was with her and said she 'd be right there .
it was not a great way to start rapport .
i never got the email to begin with .
i forgave this time .
again , i went up to the same receptionist and asked how much longer .
i replied that is was already 30 minutes past my appointment time .
but obviously she did ! ! ! !
seriously , so sad and ridiculous .
receptionist was rude , badly dressed and thought she knew everything .
blue cross blue shield is the worst health insurance company i have ever had .
when i try to go inside the door was locked .
i looked at the hours and they should be open .
a lady showed up to the door and said there was no doctor there .
i joined yelp for this one and only review !
you 're lucky my finger accidentally hit a star .
well , that happened , twice actually .
$ 1300 cash and then addition $ 47 to reattach .
very rude front office .
dishonest and unethical provider .
please do your research and follow your gut .
i wish i would have .
there were several red flags .
i would never recommend this place .
you 've been warned .
i have bruises from the classic massage - `` light to medium '' pressure .
also do not recommend the c and c scrub .
just a sugar scrub , and then you hop in the shower .
drink had no alcohol and was also pricey .
personal preference is a smaller spa .
do n't care for the forced 20 % tip either .
i will tip well for great service , but this was n't .
never have they answered my phonecalls or returned my calls .
failed to send out prescriptions multiple times .
staff is rude and lacks empathy .
doctor is a joke .
the nurses and doctor seemed more interested in bickering than helping my kid .
i 'm avoiding dignity like the plague from now on .
my dentist must have sold them his patient list before moving to illinois .
i walked in to have a crown re-attached .
my dentist ( b. costaras ) was not their .
they did have one of the dentists available to re-attach it .
also take notice the charge amount does not display in the signiture pad !
we cancelled ... and disputed the credit card transaction !
i typically enjoy my time practicing yoga .
dont waste your time ! ! !
worst experience ever i took my daughter who had been throwing up mucus .
she refused and ddnt change my prescription .
that the urine sample was no longer needed .
i called the pharmacy and was told the medicine cost over $ 170 ! !
so again why was it prescribed ?
this trip was completely worthless ! ! !
last time i will be going there .
please do n't go there
this facility is horrible .
then they have no personality when talking to you .
you can not make an appointment without waiting at least as week .
kind of ironic with how many dr and pa 's they have there .
needless to say looking for a new dr .
always understaffed , always takes at least two hours .
never went back ... . almost done coming here too .
most staff is usually kind but all are horribly slow .
so i have changed doctors and hope to have a better experience next time .
do not go here .
i then waited another 10 minutes before they had a student doctor come in .
i wait another 5 minutes and someone comes in with a swab .
talk about spreading disease , gross .
i was sooooo frustrated with my experience .
do not waste your time with this office .
the oil they used which smelled like lube made me itch afterwards .
it was just a bad experience .
i will never go back again
i am very conflicted writing this review .
this store always seems to run out of items that are in the flyer .
currently , potatoes are on sale but on monday they have run out .
same problem as some others .
these guys are flakey .
making and breaking appointments .
not returning calls and emails .
this was the most interesting restaurant i have been in .
super expensive for some really bland , boring food .
just because its vegan/vege does not mean it has to be terrible .
the decor is 100 % salvation army , pieced together from a thrift store !
and it took an hour
i adore and respect my physician , dr. koppenbrink .
the problem does not rest with him , as he recently joined this group .
when i leave the office , i always ask what my copay is .
both visits i was told there was none , as i have medicare .
i have spoken to the office to no avail .
the phones are always busy if you wish to not talk at a machine .
i had a very important meeting , and wanted to look my best .
i waited 20 minutes , and still no stylist .
that is no way to run a business .
skip this place if you really want to get your hair done .
i also paid hundreds of dollars in deductible .
when i refused to pay her extortion she put it on my credit .
i am still fighting this .
she is shady and her work is terrible ! ! !
i recently moved to madison and chose this optometrist office based on yelp reviews .
i 'll start by saying the doctor and technician were very strong .
i felt like i had a solid eye exam .
my poor review is based on the cost practices of this office .
i 've worn the same brand and strength of contacts for several years .
in this exam , they confirmed that prescription was still the right one .
they did not fit me with new contacts .
be smarter than me !
ask more questions about the price of the services before you go !
this place is horrible at so many things .
they are the supercuts of doctors offices .
it is quicker to go to a lab to get your blood taken .
i have had 2 female doctors that i have seen at the practice leave .
they push , push , push , unnecessary tests and medications .
upsell , upsell , upsell at this place .
it is a joke .
went to doctor zedek in hopes of pursuing cognitive behavior therapy for my anxiety .
unfortunately , i paid $ 150 for a less than 10 min conversation .
if you are looking to pursue actual therapy i would not recommend him .
their basic pedi does n't even include a massage .
extra $ 5 for that .
and to remove your gel polish is an extra $ 5 .
definitely not worth the pric
finally , i went in one last time , had two cavities ! ! !
never got them filled , and never went back .
she swore i was just taking it wrong .
i vomited all over myself at work .
he changed me to another medicine .
she then was condescending about the medicine the other doctor put me on .
i 'm not a doctor , i did n't choose it .
this medicine eventually made me ill also .
i emailed her about it and she did n't bother responding .
it 's like a factory line .
do yourself a favor and look for a different doctor .
i know i will be doing so .
it 's not a coincidence that she only has 1 star reviews .
they are very limited and only open one saturday a month .
after trying for six plus month i decided to just throw them away !
instead , i got someone who told me i need to relax .
at that point , i knew i was done .
i did n't know what to think of this after i left .
she canceled my next appointment due to other obligations and i was relieved .
i canceled my next appointment and opted out of future visits .
after being made a joke of , i will not return to therapy .
i 'm an extreme shrimp lover and i usually get shrimps from costco .
tiger shrimp is always not cheap even in costco .
when i peeled the shell i felt the softness of the shrimps .
the shrimps i got from costco were firm when i peeled them .
i was lucky enough that they did n't make me sick .
no more shrimps from whole foods .
i will start by saying that i have not used their dental services .
i did my research before selecting first choice .
i consulted with 7 different ortho clinics in the madison area .
dr. trent cox is great , he really is .
they have failed at every one of my last three appointments .
yes , three in a row !
luckily , i caught it this time around , having learned my lesson .
i am stuck with them for the duration , but you are not .
such an awful human being .
well , a normal person would say she was in a suite .
she is not helpful or understanding .
basically all she told me was i was wrong .
the receptionist was wonderful , she needs to gt out of that place .
guess i 'm not good enough for your help .
also , she is not board certified in psychiatry , nor a doctor .
she is a nurse practitioner .
however , i honestly fail to see the value of this .
the issue is painfully obvious .
whereas my yelp review was merely intended to share my personal experience with others .
why go to a 2 star rated hospital ? ?
i came here because i have been having severe leg cramps for several days .
if all else fails try a muscle relaxer .
no kidding dr.. i got that from google search too .
what a rip off .
if you want urgent relief do not go here !
i was admitted quickly and seen by a nurse and a doctor .
they administered multiple tests including an ekg and blood work .
the nurse on duty called the doctor on call for instructions on my treatment .
i am very disappointed in dignity health .
the dr himself seems fine & very thorough as mentioned in other review .
however the staff is what drove us out .
the wait was an hour past the appointment time .
the wait in the examination room was 10 minutes .
the dr visit was fine .
he asked plenty of good questions did examination & as i said was thorough .
wow ! ! ! !
so we left on that note .
so it is 100 % staffing issues .
so unfortunate that he 's good dr surrounded by bad staff .
bueller ... ... bueller ... ... bueller ?
seems they needed the original sleep study report to fill the order .
a week later i call vr up again , wondering what 's going on .
ok , i call banner and do as i 'm asked .
`` no , it was 8 years ago in 2005 ! ''
make it all one word , add a dotcom and you 're in business .
bottom line , valley respiratory customer service stinks .
do n't use them .
you might eventually stumble across my folder .
115 days since i first placed an order with them .
that says it all regarding their customer service .
which i 'm not !
how is this criticism a conflict of interest ?
liar and this is bad for your business .
total time twiddling my thumbs = 2 hours !
my journey of waiting started in the lobby .
time ticked by , as i tried to entertain myself .
repeated glances at my phone , looking up at the tv .
before i knew it an hour had ticked by .
`` hello '' , said the doctor after waiting an hour and a half .
i was greeted by the bill of what might be done with my teeth .
not going there again .
now i need to get the tip of another root done and finally sealed .
on the upside neither root canal hurt at all .
however years of pain made up for that .
yes you did a root canal as well as the one through the top .
this is the worse pedicure i have ever received .
the girl who did mine rushed it .
my feet are more rough than when i went in .
i came in with the flu .
he prescribed me tamiflu knowing what the side effects are .
i been in remission for 2 years ! ! ! !
with no symptoms ! ! !
so i 'm beyond pissed off .
you would think being a doctor he would be smarter than that .
but i guess not .
unfortunately i learned the hard way .
not even close to these pictures . ''
no way out on the surface , lifecenter plus seems like a decent gym .
however , prospective members should beware .
if you use the fitness area , there a some big problems .
2 ) the weight equipment is also old and very limited .
if you are looking for hammer strenth , forget it .
3 ) management does n't care what you think .
she did n't even listen to my comments .
do n't count on having evening care because they only offer 2 a week .
5 ) lifecenter plus requires a full year commitment with no back-out clause .
do n't join lifecenter plus .
impossible to make an appointment when your sick .
i will not be back .
clean facility and nice staff .
the girls at the desk are rude , and not helpful .
it felt like as if they do n't want to help you .
instead you get a `` here 's a brochure from the wall .
call these list of numbers .
they 'll help you , not us . ''
again i asked them not to contact me again .
i received another call in february then a letter i march .
this is nothing more then harassment !
if you like getting harassing phone calls i recommend this medical office .
they are unprofessional , unorganized , and flat out rude .
when friday rolled around i called back .
it was finally called in the next tuesday .
after two weeks i called back and asked to speak to dr. mody directly .
she said the appointment person only worked until noon and would handle it .
to get them to change it to the right procedure took another week !
i hope this helps steer other future patients away from this practice .
so extremeeley frustrated and dispointed .
i have been a customer for three years .
worst customer service ever , incompentant and lazy .
they never call back .
then i had them expediate the shipment .
wtf still havent sent it .
i feel like suing these a-holes .
dont trust this company with your pets livlihood they dont care anymore .
maybe it has new managment idk but its a disgrace .
this place is so unorganized it should be county .
the left hand certainly does n't know what the right hand is doing .
2 weeks later it was n't working .
now i 'm seeing a different dr. irons .
gives me now 2mg xanax .
she thinks she is not only a dr but a psychiatrist .
always she fills it and adds another medication .
next visit ( i could never see the same doctor for some reason . )
oh by now i 'm on 40mg celebs,4mg xanax and 500mg gabapentin .
which by the way is a joke .
the dumb bitch wrote me a fake script .
while in the exam room she told me she hated it .
i was too high on a dose and walks out to write my refill .
thinking nothing of it i did n't look at it till i got home .
the crazy bitch set me up .
my file is frozen .
anyway they kicked me off the program .
refusing to give me my medical records been 5 months .
and dr. snyder no longer works there .
i was extremely disappointed by this location .
i had appointments scheduled at 130 , 2 and 215 for myself and children .
i arrived at 115 to complete paperwork .
i 'm incredibly disappointed with this facility and their lack of promptness .
this office is so unorganized .
i 've been here coming here now for about 6 month .
but today was the worst .
i have to drive 45 minutes to get to this office .
so they tell me we 're sorry we are out of cards .
of course she 's like you need a card .
maybe you should do something so you do n't run out .
so she 's like i ca n't give you your shot .
so surprise surprise they ca n't do that either .
you have to make an appointment for that .
wich of course will be like a month out .
now i have to suffer .
after reading the review from the zarina i want to give them a try .
i wo n't recommend anyone to come here .
what 's the point of walk ins ? ?
i came here because i truly needed medical care and i got scammed .
it 's so sad what healthcare has turned into !
i do n't know .
not a good experience : (
on november 17 my grandmother fell ill and we visited mountain view .
she struggles with bowel obstructions and was in a lot of pain .
i told him what i knew .
he disregarded what i said .
he sent her to a bed and had nurses care for her .
let me start off by saying the massage was actually pretty good ! !
i agree with the other poster , dr. rostan has a non-existent bedside manner .
seems a little over-hyped in the community .
-their chocolate peanut butter shake is good but quite liquidy .
waited an hour or more for every single appointment .
it indeed was sears to my surprise !
it was the doctor himself !
he said `` i am trying to work too and you cancelled . ''
you never know who you are entertaining .
the owner fida is a lying , cheating , stealing bastard .
he ca n't live up to his promises and along with settling disputes properly .
very poor attitude and business professionalism .
go buy the product at a reliable company , not this one .
**please note the other review regarding his past indiscretions with the court system .
but he told me he did .
i 'm sorry i have to give this place one star .
the only deserving star is because dr garcia seems to care about her patients .
however her staff is rude , and short .
it 's unfortunate after 5 years but we will be going elsewhere .
the er has faster wait times than this office .
this store is in absolute chaos .
very hard to tell who he 's talking to .
waited over 60 minutes for a 4:00 appointment .
never even bothered to apologize .
obnoxious , incompetent and inefficient .
take your business literally anywhere else .
they should do the dignified thing and just close shop .
there is no sense of urgency what 's so ever here .
the front desk can be very slow .
some of the dr 's hate being there .
if you have a choice go elsewhere .
they have a contract with principle my dental and united ppo medical .
they never even billed the medical .
i would never go back
unprofessional business owners ! !
more interested in money than people and employees .
they do n't care about patients and fired loyal employees with no notice .
find another dental practice ! !
not great but not bad .
short : tiny cramped salon .
unfriendly techs but nails came out really good .
pretty unsanitary if you ask me .
long : i was a walk in for an acrylic full set .
they told me 10 min which was great .
vanessa was my nail tech and probably the most unfriendly i 've met .
greeted me but that was about it .
no small talk or even an attempt .
seemed like she was maybe training her ?
great color and shape is good too .
well i guess not at this place .
vanessa literally pushed my hands away and told me i was done .
honestly ca n't say i 'll be back .
this guy does the cheapest work possible and cuts corners .
i do n't know whether to blame the dr or her staff .
i got my labs drawn 7/31 .
waited 1 week , no response .
come 9/9 still nothing !
a moment of silence while she reviews it , `` oh !
do n't waste your time and money here .
i would steer clear of this office .
i showed up 4min before my appointment .
got in the room 9min after appointment time .
was finished 56min after the appointment time .
great 45min message , if you ask me .
in addition , their bedside manner is atrocious .
i encourage anyone to avoid this place at all costs .
if i could give a negative star rating i would .
at 41wks that all changed .
both delivered vaginally w/o any complications . )
the dr , on call , was dr benjamin-avery .
this turned out not to be the case .
dr avery flat out refused to induce labor .
she pressured & bullied me into a c-section .
danner also knew this .
i begged , cried & pleaded to not have the procedure .
all of my efforts fell on deaf ears .
i was hysterical going into , during , & after the procedure .
dr avery could have cared less about my fears .
they treated me like cattle instead of a human being .
and the 6 1/2 inch incision scar has left me feeling mutilated and disfigured .
i went in for what i thought was a kidney infection .
did you have one at home ? `` .
i will never go back to this place .
so i kept my mouth shut , shot him a smile and waited .
another customer asked him for a lid and made a joke .
the man behind the counter did n't think it was funny .
i said `` hold on , are you talking about me ? ''
even now i 'm shaking .
she offered free smoothies and smiles if i went and saw her .
later on that day the owner of the val vista location called me .
the girl went to the back to tell the owner i was here .
i visited dr. stowell looking for replacement hormone therapy for testosterone .
he said it was the best approach to my situation .
for seven weeks i went for weekly testosterone injections .
i immediately went to a traditional md .
foolishly , i trusted dr. stowell that he know what he was doing .
this fellow should not be dispensing drugs or writing prescriptions to patients .
clearly he should stick to being a chiropractor and dispensing vitamins .
out to lunch , closed early , at other office , etc .
stay away and go some where else .
i asked if there was an emergency or was this normal .
she said it was very normal .
i had rescheduled my business appointments to be on time for this doctor appointment .
the other patients waiting were equally frustrated .
i would n't have minded waiting if there was an emergency .
it is a matter of respect and good business .
she did n't care one bit .
do not use cardiovascular consultants , ltd !
i will never come back here this is ridiculous .
you should not come here if you have any actual plans omg .
also , people who have shown up after me are being seen before me .
they obviously triple book without any concern for their patients .
i ended up going to urgent care and then an opthamogist .
i just want to be able to see .
what a joke , i ca n't believe pearle bision stays in business .
i went in for a tooth cleaning .
they told me they had to do some `` medically necessary work . ''
not being a dentist i trusted them .
they assured me it did .
i had them double check to be sure , again they assured me .
i went home and researched what they were going to do .
i went forward with the work .
i was able to scrape the money together to pay them .
i was upset and paid in all $ 1 bills .
i am seeing a new dentist now who i enjoy much more .
wish i could rate it less then a ( 1 ) star .
blue cross blue shield will be notified next .
not happy that i can not speak with anyone when i call .
they do not call back promptly to setup appointments and follow ups .
been trying to get in all week for a med check .
i call again , i 'm put on hold indefinitely so i hang up .
i love fresh but have to say something for today .
hopefully the business will read this and do something for a loyal fresh fan !
cleaning was great but the wait was ridiculous .
do n't come on a lunch break people .
she ignored major symptoms that could have lead to serious issues .
it 's disappointing that their quality of work has deteriorated so much .
the initial psychiatry appt we booked for our son we did online .
ok , i 'm irritated but mistakes happen .
so , we reschedule .
we finally meet with the dr and she seemed great .
i book it online again per the instructions on their voicemail .
how are you already 30 minutes behind in less than two hours .
our appt was suppose to be for 1:50pm .
what the heck ? ? ? ? ?
she had us do his bloodwork weeks ago .
what if all this time , he 's had toxic levels in his system ?
i 'm so pissed .
she tells me she does n't .
how can you have proper therapy with someone in 15 minutes ?
this tells me she 's just in it to dole out meds .
so , needless to say , we 're switching doctors .
she had read the above review and felt we were blaming her unnecessarily .
i will never again go to elements massage on ft apace .
the owner is only concerned about herself and not her clients .
she would n't even call to check and find out how it happen .
i filed a complaint with the better business bureau and attorney generals office .
be careful if going here ! ! !
high prices i only wanted a soda !
fast cashier by the name of eddy though
nothing but a bunch of money grubbers .
this has gone to the point of absurd .
we have been told we owe a balance of $ 307 for no insurance .
we have insurance , we have always had insurance .
the bottom line , our end is taken care of .
they have been trained to not make appointments for people with past due accounts .
this is all according to our health care .
it 's come to the point that urgent care has become her primary place .
a prescription was called in to my pharmacy for me .
no one has ever called me with results .
i felt very upset about this place .
what i can say，service is good but too much long time to wait .
we 've been going here for a couple years now .
i get sick of the `` up selling '' that happens when we visit .
a friend recommended this doctor , 15 mins on hold before i hung up .
could n't even make an appointment .
rude , arrogant and flippant salesclerks .
this place is ridiculous .
i made an appointment for 2pm and did n't get seen until 3:30 !
because they took 3 walk-ins before me !
i was even early to fill out paperwork and everything !
all i could think was how rude she was .
the only positive to this building is dr. imani williams-vaughn .
the nurse had no idea what i was saying and barely spoke english .
the location is in the ghetto but it is very contemporary designed and clean .
they took my sierra health and life ppo insurance .
what the hell is wrong with this place .
the ma taking vitals has no bedside manner for working with children .
and this place only serves children , so that 's a huge turn off .
the receptionist clearly wanted to be elsewhere .
the doctor was too fast .
i do n't feel like he spent even 5 minutes with us .
things were dusty , the floor needed a good sweeping and mopping .
but i do not recommend good night .
do n't waste your time .
go to urgent care clinic .
this place is ridiculous .
i was given a referral to this place for my son .
( already unprofessional venting to a customer ) .
why would i be told to call back today ?
are your receptionist to incompetent to schedule an appointment ?
which is fine because they definitely wo n't ever have my business .
omg i continue to punish myself and go here .
took 6 days to get a refill done for my son .
they blamed the doctor and the doctor blamed them .
5 visits and multiple calls .
and not just me but every single woman in line .
why oh why do i go here .
oh because it is a mile from my house .
i must like to be annoyed !
good thing happy was on the radio !
this office is very incompetent .
i would n't recommend this doctors office after my first visit today .
the ultrasound tech was pleasant also .
the finances generated from a maternity patient is a lot .
i 'm not certain this doctors office will meet your expectations .
this place is a zoo .
the lobby is hot and stinks .
just feels so unsanitary !
i had to use the restroom and that was a joyful experience as well .
also there were wads of wet paper towels stuck to the walls .
after about an hour and 1/2 we get called back .
i 'm not sure if a doctor or an arnp saw my husband .
she did n't introduce herself .
took about 5 min to examine his foot and ordered x-rays .
that was fine with us .
the quicker the better .
but we sat for another 30 minutes waiting for x-rays .
my husband is finally getting them done now so we 'll see .
i ca n't imagine i need to say anymore then i have .
all i can say is this place is really unorganized and filthy .
i bought a $ 29 groupon for this place .
i will not be returning .
i was expecting a hypnosis session with an actual person .
they then play a cd with a creepy male voice for an hour .
after getting up out of the chair i felt nauseous .
the blinking lights created a motion sickness feeling .
this did not work at all .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
do not go there .
the worst service , administration and they do n't have any doctors .
they do n't care if you are dying or not .
however , the receptionist believe she is a diagnostician .
not to put down nurses but apparently she missed this .
i had already paid $ 159 for nothing .
keep away from this place you are sure to die
..this place is the worst .
then all i got was a `` sorry '' and she hung up .
i normally like marc 's but the lakewood location is godawful .
first off the parking lot here is a nightmare !
there 's several blind spots when turning out of aisles .
i believe this is one of the reason check out here is extremely slow .
i also suggest to bring your own bags .
the bags here are as thin as tissue paper .
i can only compare this store to the steel yard wal-mart .
if you are from this area you will understand the comparison .
i recommend not coming here after 4pm or around the 1st of the month .
you will regret it !
i decided to find a new dr since dr.mcghee left .
and i know many people that feel the same way : (
it is her assistant and office personnel that are very much lacking .
the ladies that check me out after a visit are great .
she has not returned my call ( or whomever should ) .
this has been going on for years .
am i expecting to much ?
is this where our system has taken us ?
i then contracted with sr. dimensions and as of now they are worthless .
i am paying more for things that i did not pay for before .
so my 1 star is for the staff at this diagnostic center of medicine .
i would never recommend going there !
i came to this ob/gyn when i was pregnant last year .
many times they had called me to reschedule .
she had told me she does a lot of c sections .
this was a hit and miss .
one specifically i do not like is connie .
do not use this place unless you want to die !
they have no clue what they are doing nor do they care .
these people should be sued for their practices or lack there of ! !
slow , un-educated , rip off artists .
stay clear of this place !
you have been warned .
i wanted so bad to demand my copayment back ! !
this place does not care about you or your illness , nor your pain .
they are the prescription police and you will be judged ! !
do yourself a favor and find somewhere else that actually cares about you !
my rating is very valid because it was my experience with your company .
as a customer , we decide where we want to spend our money .
looks bad from the outside & gets worse when you walk in .
rude employees & horrible bedside manner .
deserves a zero in my book .
if this is healthcare i 'd rather just die !
i would just like to say that dr.lee is awesome !
come to find out i receive a bill for $ 50 dollars ! ! !
to my surprise for a missed appointment .
first , she never even asked me for my name or account number .
that is when she informed me she was also the manager .
i was told that i would also be dismissed from his practice .
bu , t more so because of his very rude staff .
next came another assistant , andrea , to fit my mouth with the bridge .
she told me it would take 20 minutes to print and cool down .
an hour later they came in still cooling it off .
i refused and just powered through the pain of putting in the bridgework .
are you kidding me ?
i was there for a little over three and half hours .
this seems a bit excessive to me .
the absolute worst massage ever ! ! ! !
after our massage , the people demanded more tips ! ! !
ive never been to any massage place that does that !
do n't go here , its a rip off ! ! ! !
it 's terrible ive never been to any massage place that does that !
do n't go here , its a rip off ! ! ! !
it 's terrible ive never been to any massage place that does that !
do n't go here , its a rip off ! ! ! !
the worst urgent care office i have ever visited .
all of the employees are curt , rude , and uncaring .
they disregarded all of my concerns and are blatantly unprofessional .
there 's a reason this place is so cheap and always has openings .
i walked out without getting a massage .
big may be a big outfit but not better .
do n't go to jeffrey russ gunter at this office .
i went there and it was a horrible visit i will never go back .
he walked out so quickly that i did n't have time to stop him .
she looked as shocked as i did !
he looked at my face , zapped a couple places and left .
not sure she was even licensed to do that .
everyone should stay away from him .
i 'm no nail expert so i just went with it .
however as time went on i became more and more disappointed .
at one point she asked me `` is this wedding fancy ? ''
so i just cut my losses and went home .
i arrived here in agony , which just progressed into terrible agony !
they let me sit in agony for hours ! !
then walked away & left me crying for another two hours !
did they offer me the tylenol !
i take 60 mil morphine almost daily for severe back/leg pain .
when nurse failed yet again ( causing more pain ! )
and punch her badly ! !
after i begged i finally got some relief .
noise , bright lights every thing !
no rest at all !
hopefully i 'll get a room at some point tonight !
so i can get some actual rest .
it 's just a waiting game now ... to keep you posted .
they do not bother to call and tell you .
when you go into the store they treat you without regard or respect .
i hope they go out of business !
unfortunately the overall spa experience has gone downhill .
there were a few highlights , but overall the experience was disappointing .
we were overcharged a little bit for the treatments .
no one was around to ask .
it seems like there could be a sheet with pictures or a description .
we also had the hammam ritual treatment .
definitely not the same experience .
since we were on vacation to spend time together , i was pretty disappointed .
she did make it halfway through before having to go to her massage .
dr. westfield should be ashamed of himself .
co. lasted about 2 minutes .
but what a waste of my time and obviously yees time
i had a very terrible experience here .
i arrived the required 30mins early for my appointment .
after 15mins of waiting i checked with the other woman at reception for paperwork .
when called back the medical assistant was friendly and kind .
she was the best part of the place .
i saw the np .
there were no apologies or explanation as to why the assistant was even present .
this is the short version of my experience .
i will not be back .
do not go to them ! ! !
they charged me $ 2000 out of pocket for my surgery !
i work and go to school full-time .
my sinus have n't improved and i ca n't tell a difference !
would never go back .
i 've been ignored for almost a week .
i 've left too many messages to count .
no one has responded to any phone calls i 've been making .
that 's not right .
wholefoods is already overpriced and making the dish smaller too is not helping .
i used to have the dish for lunch and dinner on occasion .
now i refuse to pay the same price for 1/2 the product .
i saw lori hardacker .
they will not perform a wellness exam without first seeing something requiring a diagnostic .
this was the first red flag .
the entry is not welcoming at all .
it was crowded due to obvious overbooking .
her examination made me feel uncomfortable as she was clearly uncomfortable seeing a male .
i was then sent across the street for a blood test in another building .
all i wanted was a physical and to establish a primary care physician .
makes it very difficult to relax .
it was a horrible , horrible experience .
i could not believe it .
not good , especially when their were plenty of seats available .
what 's with that ?
2. the prices are not reasonable .
e.g : the salmon salad .
depending on the time of day , expect long delays .
overall , the food is n't bad , but the service is horrible .
with a few adjustments , i 'm hoping fresh can recover .
this place does n't even deserve a start .
i do n't recommend this place at all they are horrible .
this is the last time i go there !
what kind of dr. does this ?
( both her babies were in the low 7 lbs ) .
she was embarrassed and wanted to cry .
the dr. further stated she did n't need to have any more kids .
dr. kristin livingston 's , manner was very hurtful and demeaning .
my daughter will never go back there again !
i will copy my original review below , then add an update .
`` i followed my doctor to this office when he relocated .
the doctors and nurses are great , but the office support staff needs work .
except it 's not true .
healthcare in southern nevada is bad , but these clowns make it worse .
i will not suffer or waste any more with nevada orthopedic & spine center .
i saw doctor lee who sent me for an ultrasound and discovered a polyp .
we did surgery to remove it .
however , this did not help with my other symptoms .
he ran a thyroid t3 and t4 .
got an abnormal result but the retest was fine .
a goiter with 6 nodules , one as big as a golfball .
now i wait the result of my fna .
something like that does n't grow overnight .
not having my hearing aids has a very negative impact on my daily activities .
they are extremely slow in returning to emails and/or phone calls .
often two or more weeks .
their response is that they do not have enough employees .
this should not be the consumers problem .
do not waste $ 4,000+ on zounds hearing aids !
instead driver leaves with no attempt to contact .
absolute incompetence , pizza hut must not be hiring drivers .
i went to matthew serrick in pretty good condition .
i just had one ongoing issue that needed to be resolved .
after my adjustment my back was hurt .
he 's more concerned about his practice rather than his patients .
i ended up with more problems than i came in with .
i bought a groupon for a 90 minute foot reflexology massage .
there was only one person working there fri. night .
she new so little english i could n't communicate with her .
she finished the last few minutes with hot stones .
an excessive amount of oil was dumped continuously over my back .
i said fine , just keep the whole $ 20 .
crime is a problem !
my babysitter had her car broken into in the dowd parking lot as well .
both of these events took place within the last 2 months .
you eventually become a `` number '' to them and not a human patient .
i will never use the services at that facility again .
beware and stay away ! ! ! !
i have been going to forte family practice for a few years now .
i have had no bad experiences until today .
they often have long wait times but that 's expected .
he diagnosed me with bronchitis a couple days ago .
so i came back today .
he did not listen to anything i had to say .
argued with me about the fever .
i also asked for a dr note extending my time off from work .
he left the room but left the door open .
i could hear him outside the room talking unfavorably about me .
then gave me a note saying i could return to work tomorrow .
i tried to explain i needed more time .
he did not care and refused to extend my note .
he is a professional while still being approachable and open to the patient .
i would recommend dr jeppesen to anyone with foot or ankle issues !
his entire dress speaks arrogance right down to no socks with his shoes ?
please , that went out with miami vice .
the man had me dismissed a few moments after he walked into the room .
i was angry and upset because no patient should be treated like i was !
it was a very short meeting that i had the pleasure ?
of paying for what ? ? ?
i could not believe the treatment i received at the core by this person !
i will certainly not go back to see this person .
hard to title him as a doctor !
i also got my shoes stolen from the jacuzzi .
i would n't recommend it or go back based on this experience .
by far the worst doctor office i have ever encountered .
the only good part about that office is the doctor dr. garcia .
i will never go back there ever .
their scam artist who bill you for things that you do n't even own .
they make you wait 2 to 3 hours before you even see anyone .
heed my warning never go there they are awful .
i wo n't return and will find another psychiatrist to prescribe meds .
so unnecessary- just nasty .
let me start by saying that i really like dr. garcia .
there is almost zero communication .
what does she do ?
while there , i called my insurance company twice to confirm this fact .
three times i insisted my insurance be verified through my carrier .
she must of known she was full of it .
ps ... they scammed my daughter about a year ago .
do n't bother with an apology .
excuses mean nothing when it 's obviously not a true concern .
fix the core problem so fake apologies are not necessary .
coming into the clinic was not very welcoming .
the ladies did not look happy and were n't very helpful .
i waited about 2 1/2 hrs until i was called in .
i waited for about 30mins until i was called back in .
another 30min had past and she still had not return .
i never saw the doctor after that .
i would not return to this place !
if it were possible to give no stars i would ! ! !
they have the same staff that just rotate between the two offices .
after dr yee prescribe me a 3rd antibiotic , my condition worsened .
he is short answered , indignant and seemingly complacent about his work .
he is not the dr. to go to if you want answers .
do n't go to westfield eye center unless you want to go blind ! !
by far one of the worst clinic 's to go too !
like other reviews about this clinic .
the wait time is way to long !
waiting for 5 hours is unacceptable !
the staff is another issue .
most are spanish speaking and are rude .
for urgent care i keep my expectations low .
came here because it is very close to my job .
i was able to be seen quickly , i only waited about 15 minutes .
that made me a bit uncomfortable .
they need to put the care back in healthcare .
went in to get eye exam .
rushed me , and tried to pressure me with upsell .
she suggested i just use my current glasses until after i get surgery .
asked girl upfront if she could straighten glasses .
same girl that rushed me .
she grabbed the glasses , rushed again and was rough where she broke them .
i need the glasses .
i told her that they should pay for breaking my glasses .
they referred me to an eyeglass place .
it seems that they just want to get you in and out and upsell .
no customer service skills .
the absolute worst hospital experience ever !
unacceptable when you are screaming in pain ! ! ! !
who do they think they are ? ? ? ?
we called security and now there is an investigation going on .
pathetic excuse for a hospital ! ! !
on top of all this , the place is dirty .
the floors had the same dirty spots on it day in and day out .
in one room we noticed there was a red pill on the floor .
never , ever will we return to this place !
what 's ironic is that they offer an ethics class .
that would be like john wayne gacy running a pre-school .
it 's time to look for a new urgent care for my family .
the messages were great .
professionalism was just not good at all .
the lady messaging my boyfriend phone rang 5 times during our session in messaging .
cutting me short on time , as we `` finished '' both on time .
my boyfriend ended up getting them anyway as they did n't ask me .
if you are coming here for the experience i totally do not recommend it .
i 'm so very disappointed .
i 'm beyond disappointed 2 chances to wow me .
two total flops i 'm done
if i could give them zero stars i would .
never again will our family be coming here .
my advice to them is to overhaul their staff .
you need people who care in there .
att : parent 's do not bring your kids here terrible customer services .
am not bringing my children 's back to this place ever again .
however , the last few times have not been so terrific .
back in june , i brought my cat in for coughing .
i was seen fairly quickly but the whole check out process took forever .
i said to her `` you know my cat is sick , right ? ''
and she said that she thought the kitten had an uri too .
then my blood started to boil , how is that better ? !
do i think they meant to do harm ?
no , but they were extremely negligent with the life of my cat .
the best thing about fresh is definitely the location .
center if you 're a student without a car ) .
the food is very pricey and the selection is awful .
i almost never find what i 'm looking for .
will never go to this fast med again .
do not recommend her .
i do n't trust her medical opinion after everything i went through .
what was i paying them for ? ? ?
i think jude wants doulas so she does n't have to work very hard .
do not listen to her advice or recommendations !
at the end you seemed more concern .
i did contact you personally and told you how i felt and no response .
i 've never used vials so why was i given that ?
just the other day i was in the drive thru and was asking questions .
they told me there was a line and i was taking too long .
how rude is that ?
i was really impressed with the office staff while making my appointment .
the man barely spoke ten words to me .
i was to use soap and water .
they would send the results to my primary care in a few weeks .
his bedside manner really lacks on all points .
i will not go back , nor will my two friends .
i was very disappointed in the whole visit .
thank you for ruining a shirt , and thank you for wasting my time .
my pharmacy reported that they called 3 times with no response .
i am looking for a new doctor .
the office staff seems unprofessional and uncaring .
i should have changed doctors last year .
he stated `` nothing wrong with her , use eye drops ! ''
my mother fell , hit her eye on a table ! !
she is having pain , and it 's terribly red .
urgent care billing as er visits .
be careful when come here .
the female owner is not honest .
we turned off our phone but none of the workers did .
the two females constantly talking to each other while massaging .
i wo n't recommend coming here .
i find when i 'm insulted it makes the customer experience tainted .
if i could give 0 stars i would .
***but only after this email ! ! ! ! ! !
i though i was being fair .
sorry i did n't give you raving reviews .
but a three star is still good .
the only thing i did not like was the lack of privacy .
another customer ) may not accidentally walk into the room you are in !
i have actually referred people to your location .
i will do so no longer , sam .
you do know that most places do have doors right ?
not necessarily `` those '' types of places .
even lower scale places such as massage envy have them .
**folks : take note .
i was liberal and forthcoming .
as a non asian , it can be uncomfortable for some .
do not come here .
the management is insulting .
i did n't want to believe it .
in fact , i thought every other review was nit picking .
i was wrong ! ! ! !
his reply is worth reading .
this is not from me , but from the owner himself .
sam , you 'll never see green from me or anyone i know again .
unprofessional reception/front office staff .
it has that dirty grubby clinic vibe and the staff look pretty rough too .
the med care ... is ... horrible care .
the dr. misdiagnosed my 15mo .
old baby twice rsv , croup , whooping cough and pneumonia ah !
also , watch out for nurse nicole .
breastfeeding , sleep , etc . )
it 's like you are invisible .
entire rack right beside register marked with orange clearance tags .
you would think at least products near register would ring up correctly .
wait for pics then wait for refund .
i had been going to fresh since 1999 , when nothing similar existed .
also dr. requested prior copies of colonoscopies .
gave up after 2 weeks of unreturned phone calls .
never respond ! ! ! !
would not recommend this office .
hours are not conducive for the working class .
this medical group is a mess !
telephone system is horrible to reach actual human .
frequently get stuck in phone tree , voice mailboxes full or calls not returned .
i am so disgusted !
this doctor in cvs was amazing .
i 'm done with this .
all this place wants is your money .
avoid this dr and her practice .
you will be very disappointed and will end up paying more than needed .
seriously ... .anyone sharing a good experience is probably a friend of theirs .
this office does not care about helping people and are not experienced !
my boyfriend planned for a romantic couples massage for my birthday last saturday .
the day started off very rushed .
it made for a very uncomfortable experience .
upon arrival we found that there were no chairs available for us to enjoy .
they have certainly gone down hill .
what else can i say .
i set up an appt to get a nerve test done of my arms/legs .
and he said `` oh , you are having issues with your legs too ?
well we can make another appt for that '' .
we had , and it was supposed to all be done that day .
his office was unprofessional and disorganized .
i had vaginal bleeding for 8 months .
at my appointment , a pap smear and annual examination was done .
i told them i have a family history of estrogen induced breast cancer .
by the way , i 'm 36 , with no prior history or births .
at this point , my mother insisted i get a second opinion .
thank god for second opinions !
the staff is awful , does not communicate , and has no customer service .
they do not care about patients and just money .
no continuity of care here .
thanks a lot medisys .
what a waste of time and money ! !
if i could give a zero or even minus star i would .
upset and anger is all i got out of this visit !
apparently this is not an uncommon complaint which is really sad .
last chance they 'll get .
i 'm driving around the shopping center and ca n't find it !
i also feel bad for the therapist who lost the appt .
she was doing well for about four weeks and then it went downhill .
her cancer had spread and they were not upfront about that .
well that is just what happened .
my poor mother ended up having a bleeding ulcer on top of pancreatic cancer .
that was the straw that broke the camels back .
i realize that her chances of surviving with pancreatic cancer were slim .
shame on them ! !
still sore after two days .
if medium is going to leave one sore , that should be made clear .
dr. timothy came in with a `` why are you here '' attitude .
interrupted me when i was talking , talked down to me .
she said that this is what the dr ordered .
never coming back here and never recommending this place to anyone .
absolutely worst experience ever !
so many issues but space is limited .
after xrays she went over proposal .
in patient column was $ 400 .
she explained `` medicaid makes crappy/poor quality dentures . '
went in to try on prototypes for uppers only .
to my complete shock , no teeth showed !
went back to try on 2nd prototypes .
same thing , no teeth showed .
i 'm far from there !
again , i left disappointed .
no appointment was made as karen said the holidays were too near .
it scared me to death !
proposal shows 5 extractions needed , but at new dentist , only 4 showed .
the new dental office can do it all within a week .
i 've been there & have seen their work .
karen said she would talk to carol-ann .
never received a response , thus , a week later i call back .
karen said she had told carol-ann , but has not received an answer .
this time i had lumps on my throat .
their sitting on their butts while i 'm going thru dangerous mouth infections .
carol-ann came on phone saying they do n't resort to blackmail .
there is so much more that could be said .
apparently an appointment time is of no relevance .
made appt for 7:30 and lobby was full of about 20 plus people .
will be going elsewhere ... .
dr wang is really nice and listens .
it 's a shame that the front office receptionists are so awful .
absolutely zero customer service skills .
any questions you have you are treated like you are bothering them .
it 's so bad that i am switching doctors .
the staff was friendly , great doctor .
they did n't do much , regular check up .
i am used to paying $ 40 .
and they do n't tell u that in advance .
will never go back ...
this is the worst place to ever get a massage .
save your money and time .
my husband was in a car accident and i asked to reschedule .
this is the worst place .
i 'm far from relaxed .
offices like this are the reason our insurance rates are outrageous ! !
stay clear of money hungry warner family practice !
the doctor was great , the office operation is a nightmare .
never mind the endless frustration they 've caused me , they hurt my son .
the doctor prescribed a medication that required pre authorization for our insurance .
this usually takes a day or two anywhere else .
after weeks of leaving messages and even speaking to her nurse , no action .
my 4 mo old son 's pain got so bad he stopped eating .
three weeks of suffering and irreversible damage to my newborn son .
but there 's more !
we very painfully fasted my baby prior to the appointment per their instructions .
they had no record of his appointment .
needless to say we wo n't be back .
they do not prescribe pain meds as a rule .
went to the pecos office and they said i was n't scheduled .
the quality of customer service has gone down hill .
the only great staff they have is joshua and darryl .
i hope they get it together before they lose another patient .
i have been coming here off and on for eleven years .
did the med asst lie to me ?
kinda seems that way .
i 'll update my review if i ever get this pre auth approved .
after doing some research and having a consultation , i settled on laseraway .
yes , almost two months after my first appointment .
without much choice , i made the appointment switch .
basically , the answer was sorry , but yes .
after that exchange , i no longer even trust the place .
i will never go to laseraway again ... for anything .
this place has been my pc office for over 10 years .
definitely found a different place .
the bad : where to begin ?
the front staff was confused and flustered that everyone was getting impatient and leaving .
it 's the norm .
most walmarts are at least decent .
first off , no wood forest .
they have us bank .
okay ... so walk to the back to grab a snack .
found my drink , and saw a food snack .
okay , i 'm an adult , i can go to a price checker .
does north olmsted have a price checker theft issue ?
walk up front , to a speedy .
few registers open , but a short line for saturday morning .
cashier was courteous , but became too friendly .
so , i 'm almost out !
use the restroom , and both stalls are down .
my bigger complaint is the packaging taped to the door with packing tape .
really ... so wash my hands .
four sinks , one soap dispenser all the way to the left .
okay ... so no paper towels in the left dispenser .
then none in the right ... great .
it 's 39° out , so asked an associate for some .
bare essentials are there , but disappointing .
this place will try and cheat you !
do not support their shady business practices !
third flag - complete lack of medical supplies such as alcohol wipes .
glad we do not have to deal with them anymore .
do n't waste your time here .
and then melissa to try and blame her mistakes on you .
looks like you are unless you just keep your doors unlocked 24/7 .
today may my least favorite 4th of july ever .
i can not stand that places like this prey on the misfortunes of people .
not funny and you defently are n't an actor either .
i went to see dr. romo .
a week later she still had n't called .
this was n't the first time i experienced this with dr. romo .
and when i was charged she said she would try to help fix it .
could n't she have told me that 3 months ago ?
if she could n't help she should n't have said that she could .
did she even try ?
i have no idea , but i know i wo n't be going back .
i felt like they did n't care , i was n't their priority .
the ladies at the help desk were quite standoffish .
would n't recommend it .
i paid over $ 80 for the visit while in person .
nearly $ 300 for one visit ? ! ?
how can she feel comfortable with this way of making a living ?
i got pain relief , support and validation .
i would advise any pregnant woman to stay away from dr. kuty .
hours said open at 10am .
when i arrived , doors locked !
a hand written loose leaf paper says `` closed for now !
re-opening soon '' this was 10:50am !
i waited 20min ... no movement .
still closed at 11:10am .
this is the first time i have been disappointed in canna .
let 's hope this does n't continue .
extremely unprofessional front desk staff !
if i did n't already pay my copay , i would have walked out .
i came back today because another doctor said this other doctor is highly recommended .
if you 're rich .
he wo n't make it cheap ... and will make it sound dire .
it was the care that almost killed her .
did i add it was friday and pouring rain .
this was a new injury and they were going to kick her out .
only by screaming did she get admitted .
what followed was not .
which she did all over the place .
if that were it i could have not written this .
what followed almost killed her .
for the next 3 days they gave her that laxative 3 x a day .
bullying her like a middle schooler .
i had clearly told them there was nothing wrong with her mental faculties .
in addition my mom needs nitro as needed if she gets heart pain .
she is supposed to take it immediately .
i would never want to be alone in either place without an advocate .
i think the doctors are good .
just the all the rest .
i went in with a rash on my hand .
i normally have a great experience at other quest locations .
this location needs to get their act together .
i hate this place .
i go here as little as possible nowadays .
now if only i could convert my husband .
for instance , i have a huge craving for homemade spaghetti and meatballs today .
so i guess i 'm going by here today , dammit to hell .
it 's really delicious , or it used to be .
i have n't had it in awhile .
of course , all overpriced .
but i guess i 'm going to be a hypocritical asshole and go anyhow .
i 'm so ashamed .
very unfortunate professional for a management position if that .
at least have some respect and customer service mentallity .
very unfortunate organized and confused at their own job !
do not waste your time here
this was my first visit to this location .
the facility is excellent very clean and very welcoming .
the nurse was very helpful .
we were the only ones there .
the doctor sat on his lazy ass for over 30 minutes before seeing us .
sure , ahn facilities are clean but their billing is dirty .
i hate upmc but they bill your carrier once .
way to gouge the customer .
time to set sail captain tony !
wait times are incredibly long .
you 're easily looking at an hour or more with an appointment .
we 'll probably be switching pedatricians soon .
and while dr. kahane may be curt , the office staff is downright rude .
in my experience , they just do n't answer for the most part .
i waited a few days to hear back , and then called them again .
another week goes by , and finally jennifer calls me out of the blue .
i got everything else in the mail , mind you .
it 's more likely a clerical error on their part .
what does that even mean ?
why would n't they call ?
i called them again ( three times ) and they never returned my messages .
the fourth time , they picked up and hung up .
all in all , a wholly dissatisfying experience .
would not recommend this dentist to others !
so far so good .
of course it was after 5 pm when i received the message .
they were able to fit me in at 1:30 pm .
that all took about an hour .
( it had been over a year since my last cleaning ) .
i chose this dentist based on their location and the reviews on yelp .
i still love dr jianu , but someone in her office has issues .
i really loved this dr .
we were so glad .
please , save yourselves .
we feel lucky for the warning .
i used medshape a few years ago .
fast forward to now .
well , i 'd paid for it so i 'll finish the 4 weeks .
today i had a noon appointment .
when i showed up , they had probably 10 people waiting .
they 're overbooking appointments and then patients have to wait .
i do not recall that issue from my first try with medshape .
gaining the weight back was my fault entirely .
the staff is friendly and they try to be helpful .
otherwise , why bother to schedule appointments at all .
overall , lack of patient care !
the operation at body by kotoske is a complete joke .
the week postoperative appointment was also a nightmare .
i would never recommend anyone waste their money here .
the staff did n't know my insurance after being there three times .
the staff was also rude and insufficient .
the only person there that was customer friendly was jennifer
they are free of fault from any actions .
and they get snippy if you ask them to explain the form .
also paid $ 10 up-charge for what amounted to 2 minutes of hot stone massage
i made the mistake of coming here again really only out of being desperate .
it 's ridiculous ! ! ! !
they have no consideration of your time .
i can see why they are rated as they are .
i told them this but they insisted on doing the exam anyway .
and not to worry .
i sent the prescription that they gave me in , and had glasses made .
mind you i paid xx the first time .
they have a new type machine that reads it instantaneously .
i then asked them what the relevance was , getting no reasonable answer .
only that she would take it up with administration .
i got the impression that she was highly intimidated by them .
but you can rest assured , i will not let this happen again .
they are obviously more concerned about money than doing the right thing .
really how long does it take to swipe a credit card !
the pharmacy seems disorganized .
retail clerks are nearly nonexistent .
in general i like cvs , but this store is terrible .
i 'll be moving my prescriptions somewhere else as soon as i can .
an infection which was diagnosed in the emergency room .
i received 1 bag of antibiotics .
which i knew was a straight up lie .
that doctor discontinued my treatment .
now my doctor had to put me back on antibiotics .
worst experience i 've ever had with an optometrist .
administer an eye drop then wait another twenty five minutes .
wo n't be back .
best part , my kid does n't even need glasses .
she was quick , however , still time taken away from the massage .
rather a continual rubbing of scrub and lotion .
since the sign stated gratuity appreciated , it was clearly not a mandatory fee !
had i seen the sign i would have said something .
at that point i was done and knew that i would not be back .
discussing patient details without regard for who is around .
misrepresentation of clinical staff .
there are plenty of better options in the area
i would n't have given this place any stars !
well this is why .
do n't waste your time .
then after all that , the doctor wants to start from square one ? !
never ever go there .
completely rude and selfish staff and doctors .
we have been coming here for more than 2 years .
extremely disappointed in the customer service aspect of this business .
their recording advised my call would be returned within 1 hour .
it was not returned for 2 days .
any misunderstanding needs to be recognized and taken responsibility for by the representatives .
if you are going to be in partnership , you must work together .
it was not about the insurance- it was how i was treated .
very rude and condescending .
do not go to this clinic .
two doctors are very rude .
they spoke to me as if my questions were ridiculous to ask .
i was in the emergency room on monday night for 22hours before being admitted .
she was also busy and she complained to me very loudly about that .
my care shouldnt be compromised because they are busy .
the whole experience was terrible .
once i got to my room the difference in care was amazing .
the people working on the floor are so nice , friendly , and sympathetic .
the difference is night and day !
unfortunately , i have been to this e/r many times .
the thought of ever having to go back to this e/r worries me .
she also got solution in my left eye which stung very badly .
she mentioned she was unaware the chemical peel had a shelf life .
i left feeling uneasy and disappointed at spending over $ 100 .
the rest of my face is exactly how it is any other day .
there is no tightness or redness or flaking .
i picked this place based off of the reviews i found on yelp .
that 's not very authentic .
had a multitude of sub-par experiences here .
there are a lot of eye doctors to choose from in las vegas .
i 'll never go to this one again .
do yourself a favor and do the same .
all i can say is , ow .
these people do not study anatomy .
the woman was literally pressing her elbow into my spine for ten minutes .
( probably should n't have scheduled appointment the monday after a holiday weekend . )
avoid this hospital at all cost !
it 's almost like rating a restaurant just because it has food !
many of the halls are dimly lit compared to other toronto hospitals .
the hospital also does not have dedicated parking .
worst experience i ever ever ever had in my life .
this process took literally one year .
this office is very unorganized and very un-professional .
be wary of this place .
the dentist is awesome , but it ends there .
i had partials made .
the partials do not fit .
it is the middle of february and i am still waiting for their call .
at 3:05 i gave up and left .
until coming to fdgv i had always seen an md .
clearly that is not the case .
i 'm in the market for another doctor , starting now .
never trust this place ! ! !
tried to contact them through email and phone !
i really hate this experience ! !
my wonderful rn could not say enough good things about dr. crum .
i can not speak about any experience regarding paradise valley ob/gyn medial staff .
if there is such a thing as karma , it will be well served .
i can not comment on the medical staff as i never saw them .
do n't expect quality service .
i would give -4 stars if possible .
my advise is to stay well !
my experience was awful .
the staff is unpleasant and unprofessional .
made an appointment but they did n't know what i was in for .
4 hours for 2 fillers !
only one doctor that shuffles from room to room .
this place is a total joke .
if i could give it 0 stars i would have .
they have no respect for others time !
i will drive across town to avoid this place next time !
dr marcelo is kind and soft natured but often uninformative .
dr pham is more firm and comes off abrupt but is definitely well educated .
what ? ! ? !
no coo 's or giggles .
not interested in playing just sleepy and lifeless .
not to mention , still congested and coughing badly !
we are now dealing with this for almost 2 months .
i just do n't feel heard or well taken care of .
i immediately became frustrated at her tone .
there was no explanation or apology for me being told the wrong information .
i said , `` honey ?
did you just call me honey ? ''
and she said , `` yep , i sure did . ''
i said `` no , not you , but the practice .
plus i was overcharged at that .
she had me so flustered and in awe at her audacity .
she acted like a child .
not a representative i would want for my practice .
i have never been treated like this by a service provider .
this could have been avoided if they used standard billing practice .
they do n't bill , they want payment upfront even with insurance .
but they did not .
you do n't deserve to be working with the public .
wish i could get my money back , left worse than i went in .
tried 2nd time and left without any relief .
purchased a month of visits .
i have taken anxiety medication for almost 20 years .
however , it was only for 3 months .
she said `` sorry , nothing i can do '' .
now mind you , i am having an anxiety attack and am very upset .
she freaking hung up on me !
and did anyone call me back ?
i will spread the word to anyone who will listen .
do not go to phoenix medical group ! !
most unprofessional medical organization i have ever dealt with .
most tend to be a bit cold and rude .
after today 's visit i will definitely not be coming back .
completely unprofessional and gross .
updating my last review .
finally got to speak to someone in dr bradford group .
this store carries a good selection of frames .
that after two weeks of getting things fixed i decided against going back .
i wish i could personally suspend her medical license .
dr. , heal thy self !
waited 2 hours while dr. was running late in office .
needed path report on colonoscopy .
waited another 1/2 hour for them to locate it from surgery center .
bad news ... do not book with this office .
there were 30 people in the waiting area as i left .
they were waiting on appointments .
under staffed with very rude , inefficient people .
this place is horrible at appointment times .
i asked why and he replied you 'll need to fill out paperwork .
first : my son had an object lodged in his ear .
my son was in intense pain .
i stopped the efforts and went to our ent .
second : the nursing staff and doctors are all over worked and it shows .
their bedside manor tends to be terse and they seem impatient .
fifth : they never answer the phone ! !
folks this place is a factory .
then advertise your open till 7 o'clock and at 20 after six are closed .
do n't go there for a flu shot .
slow and incompetent staff .
left without getting a flu shot .
summary : sought help and then made to feel like a criminal .
first - like others this place was horrible on setting appointments .
are you kidding me ?
not that should really matter .
talk about a feeling of betrayal when you should be trusting someone .
what a horrible feeling !
i own my home , car , and practically am almost retired !
i am not selling these stupid medications ... who does this ?
so let me summarize ... redemption psychiatry first priority is protecting themselves !
i will take my business elsewhere !
if anything , i should demand a drug test from everyone there .
one of the worst pedicurist ive ever encountered .
i was one more poke in my cuticle to walking out .
i had to ask her more than three times to be gentle .
but boy was this horrible .
she left my left toe burning at the cuticle .
and he damn response was `` oh you 're sensitive huh ? ''
like no mam , be more gentle .
im never coming back .
the one star goes out to the guy who greeted us at the desk .
i 'm so confused .
is this how y'all really do it out here in vegas ?
the money gouging started before i received any services .
the employees are impersonal and could care less .
i received a free facial certificate and 125.00 gift card for mothers day .
i made the appt .
so i was charged 55.00 for the missed appt/free facial .
because i had now paid for the not so free facial .
i did n't receive a reminder call/text for either appt .
they stated they could n't get a hold of me .
instead of charging someone for a `` gift '' they have received .
short version : keep track of your sessions !
after my last review i was given two free sessions to fix my hairline .
i went in the for my appointment and the tech asked the usual questions .
the tech told me it needed to be longer more like 10 days .
so i wasted my gas and time .
i stopped the retin a all together just to be safe .
that was around the time i wrote my last review .
i have not received a call .
do not ever go to this place .
these people just want to make money.they do not care about their patients .
all they want to do is make money .
they suck ! ! !
they do n't care about their patients .
their ma staff is trashy and unprofessional .
they have no heart .
eff you cardiovascular consultants .
my experience unfortunately was not good .
i am writing this review as a word of caution .
this took almost 2 months .
no one even checked in on me until my hubby had to say something .
nine patients checked in after me and were seen within 15 min .
it seems that everything to be done is a big deal .
my mom , who 's a nurse ( !
i 'll admit , he was better , but not by much .
did she ever say why ?
it all just seemed very strange and i left feeling unhelped and uncomfortable .
so much for a pain `` specialist . ''
simple enough i figured .
so i 'm guessing it 's broken .
meaning , they do n't deal with court mandated assessment .
just wasted an hour and now they have all my personal information .
the receptionist said she did n't know !
there was no hostess and 2 waitresses who just looked at us .
our waters never came .
once the food came , she never came back to the table .
they were out of the gf vegan desert .
took forever to get our bill .
no one said goodbye to us .
it was awkward , too bad bc the food was ok .
my experience with their care was fine but their billing is a horrible mess .
this has cost me well over $ 1000 out of pocket .
i suspect the meat has expired and they change the wrap and label .
from then on , i always checked .
more of a retail operation than a medical practice .
the practice really is about which products and procedures she can sell you .
the waiting room reminds one of the cosmetic counters at a retail store .
always a bad experience , but never shopping here again .
i finally ga e in and bought it and it smelled like rotten eggs .
this is definitely the most unprofessional gnc i 've been to .
the owner is awesome and do n't worry she will tell you she is .
i found a 60 min massage with hot stones on groupon .
the worst massage of my life .
mind you this was not a deep tissue massage and it hurt .
not one part of the massage was soothing or relaxing .
and i get massages regularly .
i received a gift card as a gift for my birthday .
they stated the remaining portion was left as a tip .
a $ 38 tip seriously .
now they will not do anything about it .
this place is a scam .
do not waste your time or money
but definitly goin to call my insurance to let them know !
my one star is for the staff only .
i have no problem with either dr pierrend or dr yonan .
currently looking for another office to take my dad .
dr. gunter is very condescending .
i have been to this location several times .
never failed i always got super sick on the weekends .
my last visit here ended very poorly .
i got a pat on the back and nose spray just because .
the other 1-star reviews are not exaggerations .
i did n't appreciate being treated like a child by the doctor .
the doctor did n't even ask if i was okay .
he walked in , admonished me , and walked out .
their electronic portal is awful , too .
( about every other month . )
this place consistently makes me feel like a slab of meat .
it should not have been such a battle to have their mistake fixed .
( but it did get fixed . )
advice : do n't go here .
today , three months after service , i got another bill for $ 68.00 .
you 're kidding me right ?
i 'm not paying for their pretty little office in their pretty little building .
i was referred to westside at christmas time when my dentist office was closed .
i was in terrible pain and needed an emergency root canal .
unfortunately , i was wrong .
i will never go back here under any circumstance .
in addition they are very pushy about purchasing your contacts and glasses through them .
literally the slowest and most useless office staff i have ever experienced .
dr. singh is not very socialable and has a terrible `` bedside manner '' .
he does not show any sense of compassion or personality .
both billie baker and marie stephens however ... the pacs ... are amazing .
both are friendly , forthright and show concern and care about your health .
i will be finding another physican .
because of the limited hours baker and stephens work , i have no choice .
the operation at body by kotoske is a complete joke .
the week postoperative appointment was also a nightmare .
i would never recommend anyone waste their money here .
his tone and demeanor were unprofessional .
the test was completed and he asked her to sit up .
the technicians name was jim .
i called immediately once i got home to speak with customer service .
i spoke with danielle who was very apologetic and stated that she would address .
the people that come and see you are sick .
they do not deserve to be treated the way my mother was treated .
dr villalobos and this dental office the the rudest of all .
they only care about upcharging .
they will recommend the most expensive route of dental care .
she made no attempts to communicate with me..no email or phone calls .
i do not recommend this office or dr villalobos to anyone .
do n't go to desert dentistry located on chandler rd ! ! !
try dr. brown at c r smiles located in glendale .
for the two years i 've regularly sang praise about this clinic !
her staff , specifically stephanie is beyond slow !
such a huge waste of time .
i will never return or recommend this clinic again !
stay clear especially if you are looking for a kid friendly place .
management needs to get the sales clerks all on the same page .
my total ... $ 24.90 .
what can i buy for 10 motherfuckin cents ? ?
not accepting new patients .
why is it so hard to find mental health providers in las vegas ?
on november of 2014 , i gave him $ 1000.00 .
( dean o'connor did not perform this duty as hired . )
2. help guide valentyna through therapy to complete a good evaluation .
( dean o'connor did not perform this duty as hired . )
( dean o'connor did not perform this duty as hired . )
note : this was verbal and partly contractiual -not all wrote out .
obviously , the issues were already heard and denied .
( page3 paragraph 3 ) .
dean o'conner did not help guide valentyna through therapy to complete a good evaluation .
i chose dr. kovac specifically as a certified practitioner of art .
this is the most unprofessional company i have ever worked with .
do yourself a favor and stay away from this place .
it is horrible ! !
giving even one star is hard for me .
wish i would have read all these reviews before starting my experience with lifescape .
first appointment was to start the skyla birth control .
did n't realize as a customer i needed to do her job as well .
hoping no one has the same experience !
yet not receiving a refund !
this place is an absolute joke !
they do not assist you with job placement !
they do not offer tutoring !
we just have n't had a good experience with students from there '' .
awesome , right ? !
and if anyone is seriously considering becoming a veterinary assistant- do n't !
you are better off becoming a vet tech or an actual veterinarian .
i come here because they have my medical records .
i 'll wear it .
but this place is as bad as it gets .
i 've talked to a number of doctors and this is n't standard practice .
i would n't recommend this place to my worst enemy .
thanks for stringing me along another week guys !
guess it 's really time for a new office now .
i leave to go to college in salt lake tomorrow .
dr. yee 's mistake needs to be out there for future patients to know !
you sir should be a shamed of yourself .
the procedure was done quickly and he was done within 10-15 min .
we were told `` it 's a very simple procedure '' .
operator said he 'd have the doc call .
so we continued driving .
the nurses put pressure on his eye for 5 hours !
yes 5 hours ad having blood & blood clots pour out of his eyelid .
was treating my mother to a spa day .
# 1 : woman checking us in was very curt .
had to ask her to slow down .
# 3 the place is filthy .
good thing the lighting was low !
the bathrooms had no toilet paper with empty rolls and toilet paper strewn everywhere .
# 8 essentially demand a 20 % tip .
oh well , will not be going back .
save your money , go somewhere else !
they are awful at customer service .
this even after 2 long distance phone calls .
needless to say , i still do not have the medication .
am trying to find a compound pharmacy where i live .
shes quite the sales woman .
she wrote a few prices which seems sketchy .
i felt highly pressured to sign and get the process started .
very sad that i wasted so much on this .
i could have paid for other bills ! ! !
they all seem very nice but their motive is money .
though a few nurses are very sweet .
that day i was the only poc at the center .
i 'm just waiting .
i thought that it was normal that perhaps i needed time to heal .
hygienist rude and unprofessional !
i will not step foot in this office again !
this place is sketch .
if you need a clinic close to this location try new beginings counseling center .
the difference is night and day .
they actually care and have real life experience with addiction .
not just your 20 year old fresh outta psychology class counselor .
they even give free buss passes to those who are in need .
i wish i had started at new beginnings .
better late than never at least i found them now .
eastern ave. # 145 las vegas , nv 89169 ( 702 ) 538-7412 .
went into office for cleaning .
i have good insurance and they still wanted to charge $ 600 .
i 've been an accountant for 28 years they need to hire a knowledgeable .
person who can be polite and know simple math .
my five year old could do the job better !
definitely wo n't be back !
they consistently say one thing and then do the opposite !
last months delivery was 4 hours late and the man was really rude !
made an appointment a month in advance for urgent care .
they cancelled less than a week away knowing i am in extreme pain .
we had a big group coming in .
been going here for a year due to my limited choices through insurance plan .
if i had a choice i 'd be gone !
if it was n't for her i would not go here .
i wish i could compliment this hospital .
my mom was in the e.r .
and treated by trevelyn on 8/4/2013 around 4am .
my mom was very dissatisfied , because no information about her condition was communicated .
things just got worse when she was admitted around 3pm .
the entire staff lacked any urgency and real competency .
they could not answer simple questions or respond quickly .
her doctor was dr. achin , her demeanor is very unprofessional and derogatory .
after seeing my mom had pancreatitis she put her on a unrestricted diet .
you can die from pancreatits and are supposed to fast .
but she knew she had early pancreatitis .
we waited all night and no test .
i left my information with the nurse and was never called with any updates .
no updates from the nurse !
when i arrived at about 12pm .
my mom had just gotten done taking the mrcp .
i asked to speak to the charge nurse who was myra and patient advocacy .
mrya did not show any concern or care for my mom 's treatment .
she could not tell me anything .
( when the g.i .
she did call dr. achin who could not be reached .
is this even legal ? ? ?
she said she had no diagnosis and no plan .
myra was also present .
i asked dr. achin politely if she could slow down and clarify .
her english is a little hard to understand due to her accent .
i calmly asked her why she was getting an attitude .
she yelled and said she was n't .
i looked over at myra who rolled her eyes but remained silent .
my mom asked dr. achin when she thought she could be released .
dr. achin said if you feel better now .
dr. achin got even more defensive .
dr. achin just left the room .
i got my mom to calm down and agree to stay .
i said , `` excuse me you are blaming me ? ''
i said i wanted to speak to risk management and patient advocacy .
she called patient advocacy and got voicemail .
she said i could leave and they would call me .
i said i would not leave until i spoke to someone .
pat , a women volunteer called and got voicemail .
i told her i would wait .
about 15 minutes later barbara streyle came over .
she was very professional and listened to what happened .
she immediately knew who dr. achin was and described her beside manner as abrupt .
after running another test they still could not find anything other than pancreatits .
she was then discharged .
great job mountain view !
no problem , rescheduled .
this place has no regard for their patents time !
came in to get contacts & glasses prescription renewed .
came in a few days later ... another hour wait time .
the oakley glasses i purchased were $ 50 cheaper online .
paid the $ 25 for expedited shipping ... 4 days later the glasses arrived .
i rarely leave negative reviews , but this place deserves the 1 star rating .
if i could rate it 0 stars i would .
left on hold for 4 minutes which is considerably long nowadays .
that needs to be taken off the website . ''
asked for next available appointment , was told 2 weeks out .
asked about cancellations and immediately told none available and none for secondary office .
was sent here for and xray for my daughter .
told xrays are walk-ins .
returned the next day around the same time .
this time the wait was 30 minutes .
checked-in and proceeded to wait .
my daughter finally got her xray after waiting for an hour and a half .
that was another 20 minutes .
this clinic is a sham .
i purchased hair laser removal with groupon .
i did n't finish my last two treatments , or get a refund !
this is terrible service .
usually as a new patient they give you paperwork before entering the actual room .
so bring a 1rst time patient i arrived to see dr tanarya at 2:30 !
she gave me two prescriptions one for back pain and another for muscle relaxer !
no one 's answering the phone .
miss placed my drivers license and insurance card .
well my first impression is my last impression of that place .
lol also reported to ama
no this is not in regards to hippa .
it its in regards to unprofessional rude staffing .
hippa had nothing to do with it .
all hippa forms were filled out and on file you can check with brandon .
worst experience ever on the phone .
completely rude and had no care for a potential customer .
customer service starts from the very beginning .
i 'll drive 100 miles before i ever go to this place
in fact there are three of us going to her from the same household .
i had to cancel an appointment in february due to illness .
but ok i said i will pay it .
i 'm calling my insurance company to see exactly what they paid .
this place was more than awful .
i arrived early for my 2:40 appointment .
the woman also included all kinds of unnecessary charges into my price .
this was an overall horrible experience .
save your time , energy and money .
which is a real bummer because this was so convenient for me .
they did n't charge me my copay at the door but remembered weeks later .
overall , the lack of consistency and good customer service is annoying .
lets see , what am i in the mood for tonight ?
i think i 'll start with a run .
oops , all the treadmills are occupied .
no problem , i 'll just do the stair-stepper .
alright , hmmm , then i 'll hit some nautilus equipment .
ride a bike then ?
do sit-ups on the mats ?
free weight room literally dangerously crowded .
fine , i 'll just swim then .
i spoke to the doctor for maybe 2 minutes .
so minus another star for inconsistent billing and communication .
i 've had problems with ingrown toenails my entire life .
i finally decided to go to a podiatrist and see what my options were .
my first appointment was with dr. garza and he was amazing ! !
my left toe looks perfect .
my second appointment was with dr. brewer who was less than stellar .
he was very personable , but my toe looks like crap .
i was also told it would take a year to grow out .
5 stars for dr. garza , but only 1 star for dr. brewer .
i was so disappointed in my treatment .
complete waste of money .
my kids currently go to pediatrix but i am trying to find something different .
i think what is killing me is they are trying to automate appointments .
i also filled out the online appt request an no one called me back .
my first daughter passed away so i am really protective of my kids .
another time my son had an allergic reaction to a prescription .
i was told within hours it would clear .
then it got worse .
well why did you say to call if it got worse ?
i moved here a year ago .
my last pediatrician office was amazing ( as i realize now ) .
it was just nice to know she actually cared .
someone answering the phone to make an appt would be nice too !
no customer service and humanity at all .
save you time and money and find someone more helpful and care .
this is my first and last time visiting this urgent care .
the girl at the front desk was rude .
there was also a power outage for a few minutes .
do n't go there .
first off , i visited rc of nv .
this was at the sienna office .
the office staff is not friendly except for the hispanic girls .
the black girls and the white girls are very rude and condescending .
they show little concern for their patients .
never wants to talk about anything .
will not answer your questions .
again , dr. loo is your best bet .
but overall , i would not recommend this place to anyone .
i went in for an exam and buying a pair of glasses .
i selected a frame .
i looked as though they did not want to do business with me .
everybody 's time is precious
honestly i called 4 times this week have n't gotten a call back .
they seen me once and no follow up .
i 've requested several appts on the stupid portal and still nothing .
now i am 5 days without a refill .
do you guys realize how dangerous it is to stop taking medicine cold turkey .
so crazy because i seen all the bad reviews i should 've known .
hopefully i can find a new place .
he was texting and scrolling on instagram the whole time .
however , i found it incredibly rude and unprofessional .
run , do n't walk away from this clinic .
in the waiting room for 2-1/2 hours .
there 's no excuse for that .
office staff rude and unprofessional .
good for their bottom line but dangerous for patients .
was scheduled for a procedure .
i told her that i would not be going off any blood thinners .
she replied `` you have to '' .
at this point i should have cut and run .
what was i thinking continuing with this farce .
this procedure was a joke .
this happens as a result of improper technique used when giving im injections .
the procedure was rushed to say the least .
there was no test for retention done .
i vowed to never return but inexplicably discontinued the medication .
i know , what was i thinking ?
i just can not say enough about how poorly this clinic conducts its business .
they could 've cared less .
this place sucks , they cant even get their billing right .
you 'll see , go there .
i will never go there or ever recommend this place .
my mom & i came in for mani pedis .
all of the workers were very nice and welcoming .
we got our pedicures first .
a few days later the gel began to lift on the sides .
now a week later and they look terrible .
things get stuck under because they are lifting .
i 'm very disappointed in the quality .
staff are asleep at the wheel .
receptionists socialize at the expense of patients waiting to be seen .
be prepared to wait .
found this out the hard way .
still waited for over an hour after my set check in time .
she treated me as if i was the dumbest person she has ever met .
hopefully she does n't last long or they will lose customers .
i rarely go to the doctor and visiting this practice reminded me why .
i came in because i 've been having trouble sleeping .
i made an appointment with kate montgomery , rn , cs , fnp .
she was down right rude !
i will finding another doctor that is not so judgmental .
if i were you , i would pass on this facility .
i came in for some pain in my ear .
not take your time ...
i have been doing keto for over 6 months and having a stall .
my husband recommended a doctors review of my current situation .
i had an appointment booked almost a month out .
i was brought back before finishing the paperwork and met with kylie kersten fnp .
she was friendly , concerned and listen to my story .
asked a few questions and ran blood work .
did not mention or ask one keto related question .
neither negative or positive about this way of life .
i left feeling defeated and like i wasted my time .
the f/o staff did not have an opening for over three weeks .
i now have to wait 3 weeks to review my blood work .
not impressed with this office for my specific concerns .
this is not a keto/low carb option .
this place was absolutely the worst dental experience i 've ever had .
i have been going to the office for 4years .
i have never been treated so bad and with complete disrespect .
i had setup an appointment for may 21st , 2016 @ 1130am .
i could not believe how unprofessional and insensitive she was being .
i never said anything about my medication or what i was taking or needing .
she has no business working with the public .
she is an evil , cruel , no remorse having person .
mostly when dealing with peoples personal medical health .
i would never trust her with access to my medical records .
she is beyond untrusting and should never be allowed to over see other people .
the only plus to this place was the front desk 2as super friendly .
it wasnt anything serious so i didnt mind going to a nurse .
but his nurse didnt have very good bedside manners .
and she wasnt very warm when she entered the room .
i like a doctor/nurse to make me feel welcomed into their office .
i didnt get that feeling at all while in there .
i 'm going to try and find another doctor to go to .
we do n't know how long she was on both screaming for help .
however , i do n't believe that i did receive that .
i could have read that myself !
be aware of what can happen .
this is what happened to me .
i 've been there maybe four times .
each time i noticed my anxiety level would get higher .
the front staff are not terribly professional and had some attitude .
the hygienist christine is terrifying !
i am already nervous at the dentists .
all i wanted was my 6 month cleaning .
she tried to up sell me so hard i got up and walked out .
she kept walking in and out , turning the tv off .
she talked way to much and did everything but clean my teeth .
she 'd cleaned my teeth once before and was incredibly rough .
i was glad i walked .
there are several dentists in my area that take culinary ins .
dentists like tlc dental with very good reviews .
i 'll not be seen at happy dental again .
it sucks that my future employer uses this company for fingerprinting .
as if i interrupted her cellphone usage time with such an unimportant need .
i am 32 weeks pregnant with dr. tyre as my doctor .
this office is so disorganized .
i get to the office ... bladder full of water .
apparently they do n't tell you when they are running 45 mi nutes late .
the latest news came at this weeks check up .
anyway , the store was kind of dirty and sad to begin with .
i get my things , go thru the check-out line .
a modern supermarket that wo n't take my debit card .
silliest thing i 've ever heard in my life ... i walked out .
save yourself the trouble and go to a real store .
the staff is awesome , caring and very friendly .
the doctors are great , but the staff is horrible !
i had 2 appointments one in the morning and another one in the afternoon .
yet the dr. insisted on re-doing all of the same tests already performed .
great way to run up the bill ` ~~ ! !
the good : * you 'll be motivated to work out and eat right .
* some of the trainers are really cool .
* classes in the am or pm .
if this sounds good to you , you should definitely sign up here .
if not , there are dozens of training centers around town .
at first , they told me not to worry about it .
also , i never received an invite to take the program 's final assessment .
it 's worth it .
your insurance provider may offer nutritional counseling as part of your coverage as well .
the majority of your post is a lie .
integrity clearly is not a value of yours .
our culture at real results is better off without clients like you . ''
do n't waste your time ! ! !
patients treated like cattle ! !
i was there for 2 months ... saw dr tyre and her pa-c jessica .
tyre and jessica the pac very incompetent , ,informative .
wtf says that ? ! ? ! ?
then she left the room ! !
i was sitting there in my paper toga ! ! !
i was treated like cattle ! ! !
i ordered all of my records immediately and found another ob .
so please read yelp ! !
please do n't waste your time here .
the one star given was only to post ! !
wow and tyre and her pa jessica were arranging surgery for me ! !
i made an appointment online last week .
i showed up today and the appointment had not been scheduled .
i could have stayed , but there were fifteen people ahead of me .
i went to labcorp 's website and signed up for an appointment .
i called them to confirm my appointment and they confirmed it .
i was not impressed with my visit to stockton dermatology .
she was so rushed in my session it was over before it began .
they act like a smile would damage the face muscles .
read this for a true professional evaluation .
i was originally referred to the office to see dr. herrera .
this office will not treat multiple issues willingly .
in conclusion , this office does not work for me .
it 's like a honeycomb pattern of hyper and hypo pigmentation .
thank you guys for ruining my legs
he left off the line of what my vision is for both eyes .
trip and time wasted .
my prescription is n't right - things are blurry - bad .
i understand it might take a couple of tries .
i sure hope my file was n't sitting on the desk for two weeks .
as far as i know - they never found my file .
it was pointless since the doctor was gone .
does she have medical training ?
no option of negative rating unfortunately ! ! !
i bought a stair master on line , back in november .
paid by credit card .
had to call a few times to get a receipt .
i specifically asked and was guaranteed a home delivery .
i explicitly said that i can pay more just for home delivery .
we got into a she said/he said situation .
2 stars for falling out in 2 days !
i would never recommend this place to anyone .
this is the worst clinic i 've ever been ! ! ! ! !
because you still wait for almost 2 hours ! ! ! ! ! !
i dont think this is something that they should be doing .
there is no sense of urgency .
loosing documents that are supposed to be confidential and kept secured ? ? ? ?
is something that worry me as a parent .
if dr garcia will be reading this , please !
dont accept a lot of patients if you cant handle it .
*****keep the appointments on time*******
very difficult with a baby only few weeks old !
not boy that but waiting room is so tiny and always so full !
2. place is filthy !
i needed to make a bottle in exam room after waiting 2 hours .
so unacceptable for an exam room ! !
wish i had taken a picture , but new born was screaming mad !
4. staff over codes your visit to the insurance .
hubby needed underwear and insisted on penneys ( no idea why ! )
went up to the counter in the men 's department to pay .
the clerk seemed openly hostile .
husband asked , `` did we interrupt something ? ''
she said , `` no. ``
we wo n't be back ... .
the dr determine that i only needed steroids and cough syrup .
i knew i needed antibiotics but he did not prescribe them .
i am leaving this practice .
the epitome was when my pa said that he has problems too .
i tried and tried - longer than i should have to make this work .
i feel as though they are just a money mill .
if you go here be ready for long wait times and pointless appointments .
they only care about a copay here .
warner family practice is the most disorganized practice i have ever been to .
bad doctors , bad pt staff .
the doctors are a mob that want to make money .
dr. zoltan was curt and weird .
dr. armendariz was a jerk , period .
the pt staff does not do astem .
astem is a physical approach to fixing an ankle .
instead , all i did was strengthen to no avail .
so we set my appointment with her for the following friday .
there are tons of real spas in town , avoid this one .
i can see why this facility has a 2.5 out of 5 rating !
i called twice in one day to try and schedule a mammogram .
i arrive at 1:00 , was asks to sign in and take a seat .
five minutes later i inquired again .
she went in back and same story .
finally a woman approached the counter where i was now standing .
she said `` oh well we 're covering lunches right now '' .
that does n't sound like something that should become your patients ' problem !
they can do all sorts of things with computers these days !
i will not be returning .
there are too many other places in the valley that offer this test .
stephanie smith is a thief with horrific customer service skills .
i filed a better business bureau complaint , to which she never responded .
go elsewhere ... .please .
and when you are dissatisfied , please write to the bbb .
she does not deserve a positive rating .
horrible place to work ! !
should change their name to incomplete care medicine !
the medical assistant who did the lavage was terrible .
i guess it was 2 for 1 , an ear wash and a shower .
not only that i informed both the m.a .
can tell me this , but your pa ca n't ?
how can an emergency room visit take over 6 hours .
i have a 75 year old mother that fell and broke her ankle .
i have been in the emergency room since 5:30 it is now midnight .
how many rooms does a hospital have and why would it take 6 hours .
i got a standard size buddha bowl with rice .
there was nothing special at all about the bowl .
just fresh vegetables diced and marinated tofu .
when i get one it is just that , a splurge .
i work hard for my money and expect to get what i pay for .
my limbs received less than a minute of attention .
my feet and hands were 5-6 seconds each .
yes , i counted because my first arm felt very fast .
i figured it would get better when i was supine .
now , i used to do massage so i know this is n't correct .
i 've had them before and also know it 's not typical .
this was the worst i ever had .
again , i did not ask for that .
i know my back is bad .
please listen to me .
i opted for additional treatment on my feet , which was n't explained .
i thought it was a massage .
i did n't want that .
$ 20 down the drain .
not sure this will be it .
these services are too expensive to not get quality .
and the woman dealing with the lockers was so rude and less than helpful .
i feel it went downhill after that experience .
the hold time to schedule an appointment is beyond unacceptable .
i 've tried calling all different times and its the same thing .
i am certain you can throw down money to properly staff your call centers .
i will not be using simonmed going forward because of this .
i would give a 0 if i could !
i had to constantly follow up on my labs and request a call back .
i had labs done weeks ago and barely heard from their office yesterday .
only for them to refer me to urgent care .
the lab commented that this happens alot from derosa medical .
they were not real confident in handling this situation !
this is so dangerous !
they gave him very little information !
i had an appointment in march for some ear problems .
`` , she said , `` it 's for acid reflux . ''
ear issues are now acid reflux ? ?
you are kidding me ! ! !
i walked out of the office after 1 1/2 hours !
i then reported it to my insurance for fraud !
so that is our fault .
i have never received her call .
i would not refer anyone to derosa medica .
we are both looking forward to visiting with our new dr .
very uncaring and not loving .
your visit are less than 10 min .
pregnancy is a special time and you want to be treated with care .
i just found another doctor but at least client manage called me out of concern
this time it was extremely frustrating .
the techs are pleasant and did n't resolve my problem .
the office staff is incompetent in my experience .
i called 5-7-18 and left a message .
yeah , well bye dr scott lamprecht .
i will never know if you are a good doctor or not .
i ca n't even get mad at these people !
their office is run like a sitcom .
the receptionist was extremely unorganized - she forgot to place my order .
no apologies were made .
bad attitude and terrible customer service .
i 'm taking my business somewhere else .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
may 4th i went in at 12:30pm for a physical and ekg appointment .
i paid $ 125 up front and got half the service i paid for .
3 people in lobby and 2 hours have already elapsed .
i advise another urgent care .
what 's that ? !
clearly we were not in need of veyo 's services .
i hope veyo in arizona is contacted and this issue is discussed .
thank you for your time and attention with this manner .
do not bring your loved ones here unless you want them to die .
my children lost their father senselessly .
i would not send your loved ones here ! !
hours are advertised as 8am to 8pm , monday through friday .
this is the last time we will try to take business to doctors care .
worst cvs i have ever walked into .
looks like i 'll have to take my business back to walgreens .
learn some basic customer service skills .
this is the worst eye doctor i have ever been too .
every single employee is so rude except for the young man named damon .
i finish and place packet in front of her .
5 minutes passed by and she did n't even touch it .
like as if my appointment was such an inconvenience to her .
they call me back and doctor is super nice !
do n't they want my business ? ? ?
i would never recommend this place to anyone seriously .
off putting staff is one of the worst things in a business .
i was n't impressed.the service was terrible .
she was 100 % correct .
just beware if you do decide to see her .
i have been here twice and they just rush you in the appt .
i asked if i can have a monday appt .
she said we do n't have any .
and her response was i do n't have any mondays .
i said i thought you were open mondays ?
just overall rude customer service and not helpful at all .
going to another place .
she had no idea what she was doing ! !
and had an attitude with me for it ! !
this place does n't get that idea ! !
very disappointed in the customer service here today .
the staff member then warned me to not wake up the ferrets , etc .
just a very strange interaction that made me feel like a complete moron !
this dentist advertises $ 39 x-ray and exam for first time patients without insurance .
i was quoted 99 dollars and that included the full x-ray and exam .
the front office completed the appointment card including writing down the price .
i completed the forms the day prior .
i will update this after i hear from the dr .
a request was sent to him to contact me via his web site .
some staff members seem to have difficulty acknowledging the patient .
this office is so disorganized and just unprofessional .
i have an auto-immune disease which requires monthly blood tests and daily meds .
new ownership is terrible ( north ) .
my son and i returned and she was eating a cob of corn .
she asked to walk on my son 's back .
never have i asked for a refund on a massage , but i did .
unfortunately , the owner would not even return my emails or phone calls .
sadly , no one is left from the original ownership .
i didnt see the doctor i came in for labs .
office visit and labs .
she also has an attitude !
that black lady should not be even working up front !
she did n't offer my arm like these other reviews .
i 'm not kidding when i say extension size pieces of hair .
my best friend immediately saw the chunks on my head .
this was completely intentional .
she should be hit by a truck .
i do n't really recommend this clinic at least for hair removal .
this place is the worst .
i dread my visits .
came in for an x-ray of my sons neck that was ordered stat .
office was not busy and was told it would be 20 minutes tops .
we waited over an hour before finally being called back for the xray .
made it very clear they do n't really care about business or customer care .
i have had better and faster service in a busy ed .
would recommend avoiding this office and choosing another location .
and insisted i stay for ten more minutes for the foot massage .
do not go there ! !
definitely would not recommend dr. kaplan .
all in all , this left me with a very bad experience .
they committed to do some work for us and then would n't return calls .
once they finally agreed to a start date they never showed .
we then set another date for the work and they did n't show again .
no advance notice that they would n't be able to keep their commitment .
on top of that , the quality of service here is pathetic .
i would n't come here again .
you have to leave a message each and every time ... and wait .
the morning of the appt .
no one attempted to show they cared .
stating that his appt .
needed to be rescheduled .
my dad received no such communication .
we were patients with pearl stein for a few years maybe like 3 years .
needless to say mothers instincts should mean something .
we have had the best care now with our new doctors .
or getting a second opinion go find the top doctors in town .
there are many peds that do see their own kids in at hospitals
do n't even waste your time using his service .
he never showed up and then stopped answering calls and texts .
nurses do not have basic skills of being able to communicate effectively .
came in at about 6pm on sunday evening .
they were the trays to refill and replace foods in the food bar .
the food bar also did n't have but a few of the dishes labeled .
it seemed no nicer than any other grocery store .
the check out stands were not neatly organized or clean .
it should be several notches above a normal grocery store in terms of presentation .
that cart of food i mentioned at the beginning ?
the ma takes me to the back , ask me why am i here .
i say chest pain , dizziness and issues with sleep .
she says and i kid you not , can you pick one reason ?
you have to make other appts for all the diff reasons .
i said but those are my symptoms ! !
appt over ! ! ! ! !
what the heck was that ? ? ?
i told her she was a horrible person and left crying .
i went there and got the full body massage .
we will never be back .
it 's a great classes !
but ! ! ! !
they will ask from you only $ 77 dollars for unlimited 28 days workout .
it does n't say that it 's only first month or for new clients !
this is the worst that i 've ever been to .
they should have at least put the shade down .
i left there feeling as stressed as i was walking in .
terrible service , all they wanted was a tip .
not worth the groupon i purchased .
they did n't even explain the detox process .
do n't waste your money here..
`` because the doctors were swapping systems . ''
they never even looked at the reason why were visiting either .
it was `` oh you 're wife is fat . ''
but we 're here about a boil on her leg ...
okay about my bill `` diabetes ! ! ! ! ''
and this ingrown toenail `` diabetes ! ! ! ! ''
or this weird hair `` diabetes ! ! ! ! ''
no they never actually looked at anything .
never saw jurani either it was always some backwards ass nurse practicioner .
so here 's the real question ?
why am i charged for only half the year ?
well you know the answer i got ... .
i have never really had issues here .
but the last two times i came here it was just terrible .
2 ) i just received probably the worst massages ever !
i am a member there and this was terrible !
if they can fix my issue that would be great !
do n't call them !
they ca n't even see if your insurance is covered .
they make you do all the work .
what a disappointment ! ! !
please do n't spend your money where they are so very un- generous .
the owner , he is not gracious .
support somewhere led by someone who cares for you while taking cash only .
our experience was extremely negative .
firstly , throughout the entire consultation we were exposed to observing medical students .
this is fine if one is asked first and then consents .
we were n't asked and did n't consent .
dr christensen essentially bullied us , insisting that they be present .
the patient did n't feel respected as a client .
but here 's the reason i decided i would absolutely submit a negative review .
the patient had suffered needlessly for months .
in fact we were quite seriously misled .
one star feels generous .
i have a problem with liars and not being showed respect .
i left their office shortly after as did my brother and grandparents .
do n't go here if you have a job ... or a life .
atrocious front office staff .
extremely unprofessional and need training .
no message to be found .
they could care less .
please please please avoid this place at all cost ! !
no problem with dr.hamburg 's care .
when i complained to the office manager , she was extremely rude ! !
because of her anti-patient attitude , i will not be back .
why will they not honor something i already paid for ?
i take sublingual allergy drops which require a number of special requirements .
i asked to be treated via this method because of my busy travel schedule .
however , it has proved to be nothing but trouble for me .
i was told by the lab it is a legal requirement to do so .
many of the site 's instructions and forms require a medical office membership .
i have not managed to find any such legal requirement .
neither seem to exist .
i would not advise anyone go here .
this place is the worst place to get scrubs ! !
the gentleman working was clueless and very inconsiderate ! !
this customer service is awful ! !
thanks for ripping me off !
i 'm just not a fan of marc 's .
whenever i go the queues are so long .
the `` new '' conveyor belts they got are old .
they need a self-check out lane and i might consider trying the place again .
i agree with corey , the office is very disorganized .
neither the doctor nor the nurse seemed to know what they were doing .
based on my results they prescribe you certain medication .
it was way 2 expensive but i agreed on getting it anyways .
the medication is shipped to u from out of town .
you do not even want to know how much medication costs .
its not like i have them lined up ready to go to his office .
that is his job ! !
the blood work is about $ 2000 and with insurance i paid $ 200 .
they just left me hanging .
i do n't know .
maybe cause i was n't doing his job ( promoting his business ) .
again , i do n't know .
i highly suggest to stay away from this place as far as possible .
they are very professional and have been doing this for a long time .
insurance is accepted ( unlike lifexmd shadyville ) .
this office has horrible customer service .
first off i had a appointment at 4pm .
they schedule 15 kids at the same time .
my name , which i wrote 30 minutes ago , is not there .
but wait i was never called .
omg i almost exploded .
how ridiculous and incompetent .
you can also expect the billing department to get it wrong too .
i recently had a baby and am not impressed with their care for newborns/babies .
i do n't recommend palo verde pediatrics .
everything they 've assembled is coming undone .
upon leaving my review , i was called by the owner and threatened .
we will be seeking damages for monetary loss .
months after we completed work and you may have asked for more .
please do n't makecthis hard on everyone . ''
he called me a crybaby bitch , a fuckin pussy , a woman .
all he wanted to do was fight me .
i told him i 'm not about that .
i think they have some major drug issues .
again , if stay away .
trampoline assembly and furniture assembly .
both owned by joe .
joseph eafrate is so rude and condescending .
he is not a good medical provider .
he does not listen to you when you are trying to explain something .
he is always in a rush and does not care about the patient .
in fact , shai/ shy ( spelling ? )
the negative attitude and competence here is shocking .
i would never recommend this place to anyone .
i would give them a zero star if that was an option .
do not waste your money here .
they also charge for a contact lense fitting like seriously ? ?
i 've been wearing contacts for several years .
nearly takes 3 weeks to get in .
not coming here again .
i never write bad reviews but man was i unlucky here .
this place is so slow !
it 's ridiculous how long the wait is ! !
how is it possible to run so far behind !
i have better things to do with my time away from work than wait .
worst customer service ever .
we regularly get $ 20 massages at other foot spas .
never again will we come back for luke warm water and dirty towels !
at the end the man at the counter asked , `` together ? ''
and my friend said , `` no , separate . ''
though she insisted on $ 18 , she ended up agreeing to $ 20 .
the massages were fine but not worth the frustrating experience of being overcharged .
did i already say that we will never again return to this place ?
use a different company if you can .
i also told them to ship it to my vet .
i was also told that the order would be sent out the same day .
i gave them the credit card billing information and thought i was good .
needless to say , this place needs help ! ! ! !
only gets 1 star because i ca n't leave 0 stars !
what a waste of time on my part .
i remember something like this happening before and i tell cigna this .
i explain that i do n't understand why they do n't receive these requests .
they do almost everywhere else !
anyway , this is totally a first world problem and i get that .
this is a patient mill .
i brought my girlfriend here because she was having complications after having a surgery .
i liked how friendly the staff was .
they took the time to remember my name and the scheduling was very easy .
i remember why i do n't typically have someone wax my body for me .
i got the extended bikini wax .
i will just continue to buy the in-store waxing kits and do it myself .
pros : -lovely spa interior and exterior .
-lovely front desk employees .
-experience was not worth the price .
and that 's why it get 's two stars from me .
this is how they take your hard earned money from you .
so my friend had to pay the office visit by herself in cash .
this is the new clinic inside walmart .
the quality of service is hit or miss .
just because you saw an episode of house m.d .
over the weekend , does n't mean you should apply it to your life .
according to my provider the image was not taken from the requested angle .
overall , not impressed .
we paid for expedited shipping and paid for the order via pay-pal .
that was five days ago and i have never heard back from them .
i am now trying to get a refund from liftchair.com .
do not order anything from this company .
this policy was never communicated to me as a customer either in-person or otherwise .
doctor was very nice though .
very dirty facilities , rude staff , horrible management . !
there 's even mold in the patient rooms.. !
please dont go here , dont send anyone you care about to this hell hole..
may be he should be practicing in hollywood or at the white house .
it is easy to pass the bucket .
you are still getting 0 stars from me .
i will not go back here and be treated this way again .
stay away if you can
this places employs people that prescribe medication for children that do not need it .
this place should be out of business .
i was really bothered by this practice .
she made me extremely uncomfortable and the entire appointment felt weird .
that being said , i will be looking elsewhere for my healthcare needs .
do n't bother making an appointment .
that to me is a little absurd !
the lobby is run down .
i 've been coming here for years .
i might have to give up soon
i 'll keep this short .
they also never answer their phone .
it would ring 10-15 times every time i called .
this is not a place to trust with your medical needs .
update 5/30/2016 : received a bill for $ 2.24 this week .
my bill also said 120+ days overdue .
refused to fix 1 nail .
broke a nail traveling and they refused to fix it .
never seen anything like it .
stay away from this establishment ! !
this place is worthless .
office manager is brainless and incompetent .
just the worst experience ever .
i cracked my tooth and he stabbed the numbing in me like a nightmare .
pulled my front tooth out so brutally .
i thought to myself this is how it should be .
he attempted to do a `` shallow '' implant .
? ? ? what ?
then his booking secretary ! ! !
i will never return and i will not refer anyone to his office ever .
i have to make a follow up appt .
you have no idea how this was a horrible experience for me .
very very rude staff ! ! !
i called to make an appointment and the receptionist was horrible !
i was told i would receive emails with information i needed .
if i could give zero stars , i would .
apparently whoever i scheduled with did n't really make my appointment .
they had a girl od ing in the bathroom .
i just want to speak with a doctor .
i would give her all 5 stars , she tries to get us seen .
do n't waste your time and money like i did .
look up mark fugit orthodics .
he custom makes them for your feet at less than 200 !
they would rather laugh and talk amongst themselves .
i was there one night and the fire alarm went off .
it was very loud , super disturbing and completely ruined my massage .
they took my name and number and i was told they would call me .
i was cancelling my membership because i was moving overseas .
i 'm so furious .
this makes me feel like the manager told me that on purpose .
the therapists are also very inconsistent .
find another establishment for massage .
this place will give you more headaches than it will take care of .
update : a manager called me and gave me 2 hours of massage credits .
this place is a complete money grabbing setup .
avoid at all cost .
i 've never had a worst dental experience .
tried twice at 8pm and 9pm and no bother to call back .
would never recommend this place
i was told a scheduler would call me to make an appointment .
remember , i have extreme abdominal pain .
they said they would have the scheduler call me right away .
i did ask for her name and number before hanging up .
her excuse is she does n't have a phone by her computer ! ! !
have you seen that multimillion dollar building ?
that was a line of crap .
this is unacceptable ! !
i ca n't believe how unorganized they are .
they were so limited compared to the ones i am used to in california .
i wish we had a better whole food close by .
even with the green and brown phlegm .
he prescribed me a steroidal nasal spray .
i knew something was n't right due to me coughing all night .
that 's why i 've been coughing so much .
it 's always unreliable .
also they had a child working at the front answering phone calls .
never going back again .
i would give 0 stars if i could .
i would give it 0 stars if i could .
they can barely handle making appointments .
i got a groupon for reiki .
the minute clinic is absolutely worthless .
she did n't even turn on the check-in kiosk until 10:10am .
first patient was seen at 10:25. wtf cvs , get your act together .
this place f***king sucks ! !
if i could give them a 0 i would .
they advertise themselves as urgent care yet they are n't .
i went there because i thought i had a bladder infection .
they told me i did n't .
i took my daughter there also and just got the same bill for her .
front office staff is very unprofessional .
i have had 3 appointments there .
i then explained my frustration from previous visits and the wait time .
i left the office and will not return .
it 's a shame ... .i really like the doctors .
dr. sharma has charged my insurance anyway ) .
my wife has almost lost her life due to inexperience of dr. sharma .
i am going to report her to authorities as well .
incompetent , and dishonest .
not in my case .
i am glad i got 2nd opinion from a professional periodontist .

my wife has almost lost her life due to inexperience of dr. sharma .
i am going to report her to authorities as well .
incompetent , and dishonest .
not in my case .
i am glad i got 2nd opinion from a professional periodontist .
i went in for the drug test & was unfortunate to get her .
i have long black hair .
it was n't even a clean cut .
before cutting my hair she kept telling me how beautiful my hair was .
i was so upset & i made sure she knew it .
her response was , `` i 'm sorry honey . ''
i find this very unprofessional .
i ca n't even get an appointment with these people !
my daughter 's pediatrician referred us here .
i 've been calling for 5 days .
i 'm getting a new referral .
i was told i needed lab work and needed to be fasting .
a half an hour went by , still sitting there waiting .
so i went to the front desk , asking `` how much longer ?
`` ... i had to get back to work ! !
do n't think they even noticed to be honest .
terrible customer service ! ! !
never going back there again !
extremely rude and condescending .
i have always had a great experience here in the past .
the reception was not only rude but uninformed .
had been seeing dr. kim , who is always prompt .
answered the assistant 's questions and given a gown to change into .
she left saying dr. r `` would be in in a few minutes '' .
okay , clearly i was n't the next person to be seen .
i 've had better experience in the other locations .
worst dr ever just wanted to do injections never even looked at my records .
follow up -- just got paperwork from my insurance company .
original price was set as an `` estimate price '' of care .
( while we no longer even live in the state . )
a bill from a professional is for services rendered .
i can not imagine we are the only family he has done this to .
sorry but i 'm done .
i 'll go somewhere else where they appreciate my business .
i would give this place a negative star if i could .
i went there for a simple medical visit , medication refill .
one of my medication requires prior authorization before the pharmacy can fill it .
it has been about 8 weeks since my visit .
save yourself the frustration , do n't go there !
no apology , no explanation .
went in again yesterday just to get labs .
the massage itself consisted of the few same movements over and over again .
most of which consisted of my butt area which was quite uncomfortable .
i will not be coming back !
i have had a surgery scheduled for over a month .
the billing person called to tell me i needed to pay up front .
i tried calling back repeatedly but only got voice mail .
who leaves work at 1:30 in the afternoon ? ? ?
it 's clear my time means nothing to them .
i 'll find another doctor who respects me , my time and her commitments .
complete waste of money !
i had close to no privacy ( second red flag ) .
this ended up being the worst part of all .
i was so confused .
shit , still am !
the worse in nevada as i have been there three times and no results .
i 'm giving 1 star for bad business practices .
i brought 2 daughters and myself for 1 hr massages .
i decided to stay anyway , as it would be the same price elsewhere .
if i could give zero stars , i would .
no one answers the phone .
they might call you back , if they get around to it .
but usually not , because they 're so busy .
the front office is the worst bunch of women i 've ever dealt with .
i put my total faith in doctor lundgren , that was a huge mistake .
i advise anybody , be careful what you sign , read it completely .
my first question was are you accepting new patient ?
response : hmm yeah with a not so nice tone .
second question do you accept cigna ?
uhhh yeah , hold on a minute .
before i could say anything i was placed on hold .
no no no ! !
i will not be scheduling a appointment here .
first encounter is front desk , the young ladies were very pleasant .
now it was a wait over an hour from our schedule appointment .
we watched as people coming in after us were immediately called back .
when she came to the room and asked why was she being seen ? .
wow , this place is awful .
this is a good store with good food .
the prices high and the manager is not friendly .
as a parent i showed up when instructed to by the staff .
i had to pay $ 100 for the third visit .
i openly expressed that i would need a cavity refilled when making the appointment .
i am only available on saturday 's .
when i went back to the chair , they took x-rays .
finally , the dentist came over and explained what i already knew .
for a cavity filling ! ! !
turns out , she does n't fill cavities on saturdays !
also , $ 250 to fill a cavity is crazy !
do not see dr freeman at this office !
the way i was treated in this office was worst experience ever .
it seems apparent now why they have to advertise so much .
i 've not shopped at wal-mart in about two years .
and what a chore that was .
she asked me to call back the following day .
the next day , my experience getting ahold of someone was about the same .
after all of this , i was getting pretty livid .
the following day i called wal-mart and demanded to speak with a manager .
i finally got one on the line .
she never called me back .
the next day was a nearly identical repeat performance .
i told her that a manager yesterday failed to get back to me .
she told me , `` i 'm going to take care of this . ''
she never got back to me .
i do n't recall her name .
so , there you have it .
for a lost bookcase .
i 'd still be waiting for the thing if i did nothing .
i 'll never make another purchase from wal-mart again .
very disappointed and short sighted .
i saw him once , after i registered as a new patient .
yes i believe he would probably be a great physician to have .
sadly , i ca n't make an appointment to see him again .
as a former patient at ctca , i know what dignified cancer treatment entails .
this is n't it .
mayo clinic here i come .
farida rassiwala was unprofessional and rude .
she ought to be reeducated about the patient 's bill of rights .
first line states , `` be treated with dignity and respect '' .
she disregarded that with me .
she just wanted her day to be over with .
tis all i can say .
the spa itself is a gross tired looking lavender colour .
front desk is beyond unorganized .
they all need to get on one system !
they are so unorganized ! ! !
i really hate this location .
i wish i was treated with more respect .
further , phone calls to ask questions about treatment were not returned .
the whole place is a big mill organized to make money for the practice .
stay away from westfield .
poor poor slow service today .
this place is horrible ..why ?
i 'm so mad at this place and would never return .
done and done -- happy to shop at more socially progressive grocery stores .
i will not be returning .
i wasted enough time , energy , gas , & paid time off already .
love whole foods , but not the people that go to this one .
trader joe 's has less stuck up people that think you owe them something !
love everything in here though !
my appt was at 330pm , and its 440pm , this is ridiculous .
something needs to change , maybe try not double book patients ...
ca n't get past the receptionist - she 's terrible .
call 2 : forwarded her the xrays .
i said i 'd get back to her once i checked with my insurance .
call 3 : just moved here , so got my insurance card from hr .
told the receptionist where i work , etc .
told her my health information .
she told me it was wrong .
... and continues to actively make fun of me on the phone .
it is literally traumatic to speak to her .
simply the worst service i 've ever had anywhere in any industry .
dr. richard lieber is fantastic and my review has nothing to do with him .
he clearly has too many patients already .
not to long ago , i was referred to dr. santucci .
my four front teeth had braces when i came here .
my front teeth had been straight and closed together .
i really did n't want oral surgery !
a few weeks after that we noticed my teeth separating from one another .
he then left with no explanation of what will happen next .
the entire staff was awkward and unfriendly .
i really feel like i wasted an hour of my life .
i just feel like the service is inconsistent .
all i got was an excuse that they lost a good employee .
im not angry just very very very unsatisfied .
go at your own risk .
my experience with this store was awful .
i will never go to this store again .
do not trust them .
they would probably give you the wrong prescription .
my compliant is in regards to greedy , unethical practices regarding that exam .
i called my insurance and confirmed this service was covered at 100 % .
i called wfp and scheduled `` my free wellness physical '' .
during the exam my doctor ordered multiple tests based on our conversation .
later i saw wfp had charged my card for hundreds of dollars !
that week i also receive another $ 200 bill for that one postponed test .
in total my free wellness examination cost me $ 600+ .
i had been going to this office for years .
until my dentist suddenly left and i was n't told .
no letter of introduction .
why am i to trust my care to someone i do n't know ?
the front office is a complete disaster !
their sensitivity to a patient undergoing 3 hours of dental procedures was abysmal .
then they charged me for something and it was incorrect .
willing to be accommodating , i said no problem just credit my card .
i was told they can not refund to a credit card !
i have never heard of that with any business !
i will never use this dental practice again .
ummm ... .no i 'm not .
i have no missed calls on any of my 3 phone numbers .
the '' office manager '' was the one that was saying all this too .
why would so show up late ?
their customer service has always been an issue with me from day one .
that was just the beginning !
so did retainer he have me that was supposed to be invisalign .
i do n't want to play that game .
i do n't understand how their staff ca n't answer the phone .
this place should be shut down .
the staff is horrible .
they are rude and do n't care about anyone .
the doctors barely speak english and make you feel uncomfortable .
do not go here if you care about your health .
the decor is beautiful but my experience was not that relaxed .
it was supposed to be a introduction .
she did n't even ask me if the bright light could be turned down .
i felt distracted by the other clientele coming in the room .
i did not feel like my belongings would be safe in the locker .
they are over priced and not very honest .
what a waste of my money .
( and no i did n't get there close to closing time ) .
ummm , seriously ? ? ?
get off my back !
i 'm paying you , so i can take as long as i like !
oh , & of course they rushed the paint job which looked atrocious .
it 's been 4 days and have had issues seeing .
thus place sucks and they are soooooo rude .
i 'd rather pay full price than go there for insurance !
this was not a good decision .
we then reiterated our desire for only materials that were covered by insurance .
we were ultimately given the option to reorder the glasses with the requested materials .
we agreed , and are currently waiting for the remade lenses .
needless to say , we will not be going back .
after being a patient here for years and years it was time to leave .
getting ahold of anyone in that office is an absolute joke .
communication is unbelievably low in this office .
i have been reasonably satisfied until today .
i will never visit this urgent care again .
the online `` reservation '' system is the biggest joke of all time .
a reservation that means nothing !
but does n't fully enter the room .
no apology , no nothing .
it was a bizarre experience !
the physical exam was very cursory - maybe 90 seconds .
and no answers to the symptoms .
the directions listed on the website were good and i found it quite easily .
i will not make this mistake again .
they do not have any cell phone reception in that building .
they discontinued their guest wifi to save money obviously .
is that the best place they have to refer ?
they have such old equipment .
i wonder if they give a kickback to the center for their referrals .
it makes me wonder .
the doctors do not care about the patients .
they do n't look too hard for any real issues you may have .
they are content to take your money .
that is the feeling i get .
the place is one big cash register .
go and see for yourself .
i personally will be switching to another office .
money , money , money .
they will not work with you and their payment plans are unreasonable .
me and my cancer will have to go someplace cheaper .
docs seem to be good and staff , but too expensive for me
i have received a promotional free class for a month .
i had to call in to register for a class .
i left a message explaining that i have a voucher for a free class .
have not received a call back .
why give out free passes if you can not honor them .
yes , said kirsten ... glycolic peels are wonderful for my condition .
i filled out all the paperwork and consent forms for glycolic peels .
she is a brilliant saleswoman , i will give her that .
approximately 3 weeks later it was time for another peel .
she exclaimed that my face was looking so much better !
was her memory about my particular skin condition that good ?
i said : `` i do n't know ! ''
**feeling especially naked without any make up on** .
he said : `` do you know you have a bacterial infection ? ''
me : `` whaaat ? ? ? `` .
like i said , she 's a wonderful salesperson , and she hooked me .
however , kirsten does not give refunds .
she has never given refunds in the history of her business .
i was mad at her attitude .
anyways , kirsten she hung up on me .
so , with kirstens math , i had 200 dollars left .
4 peels + 1 cleanser = $ 680 .
my friends in town who used to go to her wo n't go anymore .
beware of sales tactics , and what you 're signing .
this drastically delayed every process .
will the regional management step in ?
just went to this location for my son .
we got in quickly , waited awhile between nurses , doctor and x-rays .
overall , that part of my visit was a typical urgent care experience .
it was what came next that i felt was unprofessional .
we where misinformed while trying to get my sons records to our family doctor .
so i made many phone calls to figure out the problem .
the one star is for taylor , he was helpful and polite .
otherwise avoid this place .
they overcharge and never file the insurance correctly .
do not go here .
i ca n't believe they would tell me such a thing !
i would rather give zero stars .
this is the third time coming to this location .
the biggest mistake was choosing this place .
i signed up to yelp just so i can write this .
i left the office in tears this morning .
the receptionists are the worst .
the woman who answered was pretty rude .
i was shocked and i said well everything really .
she keeps leaving ! `` ...
please save yourself some pain/trouble and do not come here .
changed dermatologists , asked that all records be transferred .
much room for improvement in the services rendered .
tip is given for good service !
the masseuse did n't do a good job either .
she seemed new and inexperienced .
dr. jenny h. kim is the worst eye doctor ever .
if you have an appointment .
you can forget about being seen at your appointment time .
this will be the last time my family of 6 ate coming here .
my previous 4 visits over the past four months have been frustrating .
they can not keep up with their stock .
i think it 's time to take a break from shopping at trader joes .
i see internet based posting noting problems with infections - judge for yourself .
in my case he placed an implant which caused all sorts of problems .
nothing about the work brannon did worked out for me .
some of the other dentists , such as dr. bravara i would recommend highly .
she says think of sativa as a cup of coffee .
hybrid as lunch and indica a little heavier like dinner .
what does that tell me ?
not impressed at all .
i will stay on my side of town to shop .
every time it 's a horrible experience ( illness aside ) .
that said , i liked our doctor there .
i believe he 's retired now .
urgent care reception staff could use a morale boost .
but they do n't hide it well at all .
they are greedy and only look out to line their own pockets .
he wants the insurance money .
the receptionist went to ask him again and again he said no .
my recommendation for someone looking for a dermatologist who cares and is n't greedy ?
5 lawsuits in 2 years !
http : //www.superiorcourt.maricopa.gov/docket/civilcourtcases/casesearchresults.asp ? lastname= & firstname= & bname=global+pharmedica .
i would never come back here .
i feel rip off .
one guy said $ 40 and the other said $ 60 an hour .
i end up paid $ 60 an hour .
i have to agree with joanna .
we were not impressed with this office or dr. syms .
dr dao is rude and wo n't listen to any concerns you have .
he refused to read previous reffering ophthalmologist notes .
he checked my daughter eye and said it looks fine beside inflammation .
now let me remind you he checked her eyes in less than one minute .
uncaring doctors please pay someone else that truly care !
stay away from this place
for the most part the staff is not very friendly .
they act like you are interrupting their visiting time .
the only positive about this office is there is a large selection of glasses .
a bride 's worst nightmare .
this is my pretty middle finger in your face , joya .
i will tell everyone i know what a joke you are .
the products are marked up .
and the poor quality of services is awful .
you want to hear some drama ?
it 's crazy that all the notes from my reassuring phone conversations when amiss .
my facial was terrible .
when you come here you are truly just a number .
the lady never asked what skin regimen or products i use .
she just gestured to settle in and just started poking my face .
she was so rough and rushed .
oh really little girl ?
do n't go asking for bridezilla .
oh no you did n't .
you are damn right i 'm pissed .
the front office woman was nice and seemed quite competent .
she observed me from a distance with her arms folded .
their hours start at 7am .
the 5 people waiting by then , one tech .
then appointments started to show up too .
so another hour wait .
do n't use them without an appointment .
the lady said i had an ingrown toenail and ripped it out .
the next day my toe is infected and pussing like crazy .
this place is unclean .
wish i could upload pic .
i waited for a long time to see the doctor .
i wo n't be coming back again .
never go to this place .
not professional , not kind , poor knowledge .
we tried to contact them for the bill , but nobody answered .
at that point i told them to keep the watermelon .
never again will i be purchasing rotten fruit from whole foods .
there are two identical suite addresses within the same complex .
go to sprouts market first then angle south from their parking lot .
unbelievably ignorant location address conflict .
when you find the place , plan on insensitive , unisex service .
of course he 's fully dressed .
i backed up , shut the door and vowed i 'd never be back .
i told the female tech to get that man out now .
by this time i 'm really angry .
the insensitivity of these people shocks me .
you 're not running a car wash for god 's sake .
i have no idea how this place is in business !
i 've never been to a salon that wo n't accommodate their customers !
took a uber here and was turned away !
so not only did this place waste my time , but my money too !
`` we do n't do just 1 nail '' .
`` we can do , $ 45 '' ... .
they charge to remove color ?
what was unbelievable was they were not busy at all !
just sitting around watching tv .
just do n't go here !
this business is run very poorly .
i have no idea what has happened here since last year in er .
i was there 7 hours .
did not even get my medicines right tried to give me duplicate xrays .
did not see a dr for 3 hours .
guess what now they want her to fax a copy .
explained what i was looking for sold me the wrong thing .
explained why i was looking for it .
the sales rep still teied to sell me something else !
the sales reo told me thay what i was buying could be refilled .
it was only a refill itself .
ten min aftwr leaving i found out and called .
manager insisted he watched entire tramsaction and was there the whole time .
no one was near us at all !
i tried to explaon it had been ten min i needed to exchange .
he told me i could come in and buy a pen .
im not sure why !
manager ignored my requests .
manager kept insisting his employee gave me good info .
i was completely disgusted !
i wasted $ 30 !
wo n't be back !
a `` wellness '' plan does not consist of making me mad and tense !
this office has so much turnover of dentists and hygienists and i know why .
very unprofessional , long wait times and they are constantly messing up insurance .
i really suggest-go somewhere else ! !
i was referred here by my general dentist for my daughter for cavities .
2 hours after the dentist initially looked in her mouth to get the fillings .
at the second appointment we waited 40 minutes past our scheduled time .
if i could leave a comment without a star i would .
i was in pain for 3-5 days after my cleaning .
used to be an awesome practice when he first opened !
i was one of his first customers in those early months .
yeah i did n't love the quote system ... it was high pressure .
free whitening gimmick was n't really free .
they go through hygienists like tissues ... one you like disappears .
i think i need to look around for someone new .
we are leaving the practice .
they told me there was no one i could see until the following morning .
we did and she did in fact have an infection .
it took 5 min at an urgent care and a $ 300 bill later .
she would have had someone see her- really ?
it takes no time to run urine .
he ruined the entire unit worth $ 30k .
no remorse and no acceptance of responsibility .
i urge any and all to stay clear of this incompetent doctor .
it 's all about him , not his patients .
worst er ever ! ! !
if i could give this hospital zero stars i definitely would .
dr. miyake greeted me and listened to my heartbeat .
i am the patient .
i am in pain .
the staff was completely unresponsive until i repeated my request .
he handed me discharge papers and pointed me to the door .
not one staff member came to see how i was doing while i waited .
i am extremely disappointed in the lack of service and medical attention i received .
i think dr. ruggieri is an excellent doctor .
the issue i would comment on is his staff .
i found many of them to be rude or unprofessional .
the whole office seemed to have subtle contempt for the patients .
then there were a few incidents that pushed the envelope of professionalism .
i was left in an examination room for at least a half hour .
they were actually telling jokes about it and laughing .
i went to get the stitches out last wednesday .
when i said no , he fished around some more & found another one .
all the time he was wheezing up close to my face and coughing .
it was really uncomfortable .
not impressive , & these are just examples .
i have to say that the experience after visiting the facility was horrendous .
went in for consultation and treatment .
left unimpressed with dr david smith .
its good to raise your standards , but never lower .
the experience was well below sub-par to say the least .
i had a groupon with fk laser .
i agree with the other comments about dr. f 's communication skills .
also , the high pressure sales at the 1st appointment were definitely not appreciated .
however , all this would be manageable if the treatment was great .
it certainly was not the soprano one i 've experienced at other places .
i can recommend it either .
worst ever ! ! !
i had my eyeglasses ordered here last year .
unfortunately , the lenses were too thick and not the super-thin lenses i ordered .
i brought it back to have them replace the lens , which they did .
i went home and went to my former optometrist .
( my left eye needs a higher grade than the right . )
if i had not seen another optometrist , i would not have known this .
please be careful with the glasses you order from this shop .
i would recommend getting your glasses made elsewhere .
have been going to lenscrafters for years but will not be returning .
i would have expected this to be de rigeur !
slow , old , unclean .
this place.demonstrates the need for competition in imaging .
i will not come back .
small loud waiting area with a tv for extra noise .
i 'm sure i 'll get some cursory response from someone at the company .
we deserve better than this crudhole .
then she says he sees 60-80 patients a day .
whatever you do make sure to never have him as a doctor .
it 's been a mess .
to be fair i can not speak on any other dr in this establishment .
i hope this saves someone from a mess .
so i spent thousands of dollars on hair removal from brazilian to face .
every time i came here they tried to sell me something else .
it never did work better .
the employees are awesome , however the product is n't .
i went to valley pain and wellness center because they offered allergy drops .
now i know why .
i even discontinued my outdoor runs/walks because i thought i had bad allergies outside .
very nice staff but i 'm super angry i was so misled .
they no longer do reflexology type massages .
prices are similar to full body massages you can get at strip hotels .
too bad it was very nice here .
the customer service at this place is absolutely horrendous .
now i have to cancel my appointment and reschedule all due to their inefficiency .
if you can avoid this place , please do .
please whatever you do do not go to goodman and partridge !
are you kidding me ? ? ? ? ?
guess the drivers kept cancelling for a reason ? really ?
this is what you guys do to special needs teens ?
and no wonder the dispatchers would not tell me what was going on .
shady practices & people ! !
went here because they were highly rated .
they took x-rays did the 360 degree x-ray also .
$ 250 outta pocket that the insurance could have covered !
karma on these people .
****update had the owner of the business make contact .
would not recommend this business to anyone !
: ( wish i never messed with my veins ... ...
i joined my sister to celebrate her birthday at the joya spa .
when we arrived at the facility , there was immediate confusion .
i then ended up entering the yoga class late , which was awkward .
the yoga class was a little frustrating .
the instructor talked a lot .
the locker room was also very crowded .
she did n't even say excuse me !
slightly relaxing but i would n't say it was a `` good '' massage .
definitely not worth the money i paid for it .
i never did get my tour .
never got to do the crystal/rock thing that i read about online .
even the whisper room was full of super chatty women .
i would suggest joya spa amps up their customer service and overall customer experience .
the front desk personal should at least attempt to be cordial to the patients .
my fist 4 sessions were a waste of time and money .
they set the treatment too low to be effective .
it took 4 sessions of my complaining before they adjusted the treatment .
i would give this place -5stars .
the staff is rude and clueless .
she told me that they were already looking into it .
the last time i called to schedule she hung up on me twice .
their communication is very very poor .
i went in and all he could do was confirm that i did .
he gave me paperwork for another blood test and an ultrasound .
i do not even understand how this would be possible .
i left without any answers and even more confusion .
this place is a scam .
she just kept rubbing the same spot on my feet and arms .
i kept cringing because the repetitive rubbing just ended up irritating my skin .
on the wall , they suggest $ 10 for a `` happy experience '' .
as in `` i 'm dead tired ! `` .
oh and all these 5 star reviews you see on this page ?
people got $ 3 off to write them .
that 's $ 45 and 60 minutes i 'm never getting back .
my experience is extremely similar to michele h. 's below .
she was very rude and condescending and forced me to make an appointment immediately .
they immediately got defensive and questioned why i would want a second opinion .
they eventually agreed to send the xrays , but they never actually sent them .
luckily , i ended up cancelling my appointment and never had these procedures done .
please no one else go to this corrupt , unprofessional office !
they should be shut down !
your office needs to show some compassion dr. bartholomew !
i went in today for the first time .
i stopped giving my social to medical offices long ago with no problem .
this is by far the worst obgyn you can go to in vegas !
well things have changed for this doctor .
first of all , she is no longer with box canyon .
she now is with calderon medical on south valley view .
it 's very run down around that area .
the staff is rude and uncaring .
in fact one just seemed mean to one of the patients .
i had to wait for 4 hours and 15 minutes to see an assistant .
to see the doctor i would 've had to have waited another hour .
i seriously needed medication , but i ended up leaving , in tears .
i will never go there again .
this waiting room is by far the worst i 've ever been to .
waiting times are extremely long .
never ever ever go to becky gonzales .
switched to dr knapp-so far other than the aforementioned she has been ok .
the doctors used to be good .
lately , you can never get your doctor , always someone new .
random doctors you get do n't seem to be knowledgeable or care .
several times we 've gotten wrong diagnosis , including this week .
it is sad that this originally a very good office gotten so bad .
the place is understaffed and over crowded with patients .
we wo n't go back and wo n't recommend this place to anyone .
appointments : they wo n't answer the phone .
finally got the 2nd lab form !
lunch was at 1200-1 on the door .
i guess they do n't need the money ! !
unethical practices this pertains to some of their suppliers as well .
they continually sell moldy berries .
old wilted produce kept on shelve too long .
they will even say it is the suppliers fault for such item conditions .
stop selling stuff that you would n't take home to your mother .
i brought all 3 of my kids there at the same time .
two of my kids were scared and not being very cooperative .
because of her i am not sure we will be back .
today i learned why i 've taken that road .
yep , i ca n't even imagine how hard your job is .
what do i know .
i will be seeking out a new gynecologist , if it makes any difference .
i doubt they even know cpr .
they wash your linens , hand out meds , and wake you up .
on to the next explosive mess .
dr. horne , 190 years old and uses 100 year old techniques and remedies .
he prescribes the same medications for everyone !
it 's actually quite weird .
how can every patient need the same medications at pretty much the same doses ?
they ended up turning that shit on me .
like all other rehabs this place is an insurance mill ! !
they beat the same shit into your head every single day .
i am in disbelief that they are able to continue the way they do .
my boyfriend was in extreme pain and the customer service was atrocious .
this whole foods needs serious help with management .
i was here today with my 2 little ones .
i by honest mistake stood in the express lane .
then she started to mumble that how i could n't read the sign .
i asked her if there was a bigger problem .
she got really upset and called the manager .
you would think that manager will have some sense in calming her down ! !
manager started to yell at me .
my little one started crying and i was just left in complete shock !
all this for not reading a stupid sign !
mind you i have 3 graduate degrees and i can read .
one star for this place for many reasons .
i arrived and had a stylist work on my nails .
i needed two nails replaced while away at work ( thumb and index ) .
i requested sns dip powder .
i was n't happy with them when i left .
sns does n't peel .
manager was 20 minutes late opening due to his tardiness .
i 'm a flight attendant .
5. he said they did not refund , only fix .
i needed to head back to the hotel .
she said she could not refund .
7. the manager did nothing and ignored me .
8. no one would provide me with the owners information .
i am very disappointed with the way this turned out .
not turn the other way and refuse to listen .
one star because overall annie was nice .
and the place was clean and nice .
they also had quite a few options .
i called as a new patient to make an appt for july 7 .
i got a call that morning the dr beck was out sick .
i told them forget it i will find a different doctor
if you decide to use this location , do not see dr. syers .
i 'm 39 weeks .
and she would n't do it because my contractions were n't close enough together .
so they kept me 2 days and sent me home .
but there are mitigating circumstances that should change that .
much safer than sending a mother with epilepsy home .
if i were n't due in a week , i would change practices .
luckily , there are 2 amazing doctors in that office .
see dr. falcone or dr. freeman .
because this doctor has no clue what she 's doing .
and i will be contacting management regarding her ignorance .
it is cold and flu season , a particularly horrible one at that .
each time was a different random number .
invariably terrible customer service .
avella is a compound pharmacy , which makes prescriptions to order from a physician .
this is the most frustrating place ! ! !
i 've been getting compound prescriptions for about 10 years .
their customer service is abysmal .
typical wait time on hold is 20 minutes .
their compound content is good .
but the aggravation and delay when you need a prescription is inexcusable .
there are too many options out there , and i 'm moving on .
did n't even want it !
rip off report off .
against she had no footstool .
she continue to say things like i did n't give her a chance .
but she just kept insisting .
having been introduced to the bloor street fresh location , i expected great things .
what i got was a little less than that .
first off , the place did not appear to be air conditioned .
i got a wrap , not bad , but nothing special .
i 'm all about finding some good vegetarian restaurants .
on the occasion i visited this french location , it definitely did not deliver .
this practice 's front office has great customer service .
they require unnecessary visits and blood draws .
i guess no one told him part of medicine was helping people .
staff were very rude .
rude on the phone and im not sure if ive registered or not .
i have been a patient here for scheduled services and that has been ok .
but coming into the er is a nightmare .
i could n't i was severely dehydrated and in extreme pain .
it was beyond my choice .
ride or die , i choose to ride somewhere that could help me .
discrimination against doing work on a pregnant woman .
they wasted my time .
it would have been nice to get it done before my baby is born .
it is a very inconsiderate office .
they rather follow the their protocol than a patient in pain .
i come here for heel pain .
my doctor ordered an insole for my shoes to elevate the pain .
i would never recommend this office to anyone
awful on so many levels .
went in for the first time for an ear infection .
a simple ear infection turned into an hour and forty-five minute appointment .
not sure how they are still in business .
this place is ridiculous !
the office staff is borderline incompetent !
( the phlebotomist/front desk )
doctors are gteat , but the support staff and scheduling staff lack organization .
constantly making a mess of things .
it is impossible to call and actually talk to a person .
leave a message and 10 percent of the time they will call you back
i went for a pregnancy test after two positive pregnancy tests at home .
the wait is not worth it .
average 2 hours + wait time for scheduled appointments ! ! !
office staff was incredibly rude .
i just fired the doctor as my care giver .
place does n't even deserve 1 star .
i 've been a patient here for a few years .
unfortunately some policy change is putting people at risk .
i called today because i have a bad cough and am having trouble breathing .
she said it is the patients responsibility to remember to schedule it not hers .
and if i 'm worried about my cough i can go to urgent care .
i will never go back to skyline and i will transfer my care .
what an absurd policy that puts the health of people at risk .
what a huge sign that they do n't care about people at all .
just maximizing the amount of appointments they can get you in for .
i never write bad reviews .
upon reading other reviews it appears they 've done this to others as well .
had a pretty disappointing appointment with dr. tamm .
i 'm seeking help with chronic migraines , dramatic fatigue , and ear ringing .
he then proceeded to tell me `` you 're fine .
if it was something dangerous , you 'd already know . ''
which , by the way , is almost exactly what dr. tamm said .
i will not be returning to this practice .
i have been going to dr. cunningham and dr. karius for almost 10 years .
over the last year to 18 months it is gone downhill very very quickly .
they never even bothered to call me back .
the credentialing staff in provider enrollment that they have are very immature and unprofessional .
they would make insults calling our staff stupid , worhtless etc .
i went in to be checked on an emergency i was having .
he then told me i thought you were a tough girl .
has nothing to do with being tough .
turns out i am in agonizing pain for days to come .
days went by no relief .
he tells me there is no way that is possible .
i explain to the doctor that i was still in pain .
he told me there is no way that i can be in pain .
he did not give me an update on the status of my infection .
he did not tell me what to do next .
i asked him should i go to the emergency room .
he then said i think you need to find a new opthamologist .
he then said no comment .
and ran out of the office into his personal office and slammed his door .
i highly suggest avoiding this ophthalmology practice if at all possible .
doctor did not thoroughly assess issue with foot .
woo child where to begin .
called gave them the information .
did not hear back from them .
walked in on monday , they still had not verified my insurance .
ok so i 'm taking deep breaths , am trying not to be angry .
i 'm like but i did n't even get my cleaning .
she looks at the schedule and says ok the 9 am did not confirm .
come in tomorrow and we will get it done .
thanks i leave come back the next morning and jesus be a fence .
there are three people on the office .
and she says that i can reschedule .
i about lost it .
i just say thank you and leave because the nerve and audacity .
that is the only reason for the 2 stars .
they could n't even set up an appointment right .
my husband was spared from a visit .
we found a better dentist .
if the massage is good .
do n't complaint about the price .
**folks : takes note , i 'm also liberal and forthcoming .
any sexual solicitations are not tolerated and will be reported to authorities .
as we cleared state on website .
we are helping a customer find relief from anxieties and chronic ailments .
my uncle paid for the groupon .
that was paid with money .
that gives you no reason to be rude to customers or former customers .
you should have been happy with the review .
so i 'll forgive your misunderstanding .
i hope your business goes bankrupt due to your behavior on this site .
been with this office for 3 years and officially done .
1. get ready to wait for your appointment .
poor management leads to poor time management .
but god forbid you to show up in office later than appointment time .
they will refuse to see you completely .
i had a surgery performed by dr sikand .
i got ear infection , unrelated to my original surgery .
what a service ! !
walking extra mile to work with a patient lol no never heard of it .
i had last two weeks of previous insurance and was getting a new one .
never any other medical facility would not check .
no , it never happened to me before .
only in ent of nevada .
speaking of `` professionalism '' .
4. dr sikand will spend precisely 3 minutes of his time with you .
$ 700 honestly earned .
receptionist will make you feel completely unwelcomed .
i and my insurance paid thousands of dollars to this office throughout 3 years .
was very unimpressed with this place .
they kept switching doctors on me which i did n't like .
i was put on different antibiotics which also did n't work .
finally they referred me to an ent .
surgery took about two hours as expected .
i was told that they have a `` no visitor '' policy in recovery .
although both of my parents have had multiple surgeries at mt .
view and family was able to visit almost immediately after surgery .
i was not the only one that was furious with this policy .
this will be the last time mt .
view will treat any of my family !
i will never go back .
these people are heartless crooks who will overcharge like you crazy .
however , i would strongly encourage you to shop around for better prices .
stop using that type of sells tactic ... does not work
i have been coming here twice a week for several months now .
in the last two months , my average time spent per visit has doubled .
it seems like i see a smaller staff every time i come in .
the kiosk is the first thing you do .
if you forget something you 're screwed .
the system is also inefficient .
you have three things doing the job of one thing .
how on earth does it take 10 hours to be discharged from a hospital .
worst one stop location there is .
extremely rude manager , awful customer service .
a 5-10 min procedure took 30 minutes .
i was in tears and dr freeman was irritated with me .
i was like no , just so what you have to do right now .
why would i possibly want to endure this again .
she had not even looked at my chart .
i left in tears again .
i would not recommend her .
my np at mountain vista location is awesome .
if you think fruit-in-a-bag is fresh .
at home in seattle , they 'd be shuttered in a week .
warning : do n't go to this place .
they still scheduled me for next follow up .
the end : i went to the other doctor'office who is my insurance provider .
same number of donors , but now it takes over an hour at least .
there are usually at least 4 employees wondering around aimelessly while 2 actually work .
this was n't a 1 off issue , it 's constant .
mom & i were looking for roman shades .
i understand they are expensive , but i am looking for standard fitted ones .
jc penneys charges more for blackout or room-darkening blinds & shades .
i took pepcid and that did n't help at all .
then i took some tums , still nothing .
tried to go to bed and was tossing and turning all night .
finally woke up the next morning feeling a little better .
mani-pedi day at the spa for mommy and daughter this past sunday .
when we got there were greeted in a chilly manner .
the services were set up wrong with the wrong products .
the two ladies delivered the services like robots .
not what i expected ... not one bit .
you need to use the call ahead check in option if you go here .
that way you can wait at home until they can see you .
the staff is nice though .
they just need way more doctors available for busy times
i wish the appointment people would answer the phone .
left 8 messages and no one has called back yet .
unfortunately this is where my insurance wants me to go .
i love dr scott connell and tina !
this is why i wait to review .
i would n't believe anything that comes out of their mouth .
thanks for nothing summerhills dental ! ! !
the absolute worst experience i have received at a gyno .
ok , have a great day . ''
during my visits at absolute dental i never seen the same dr twice .
i was only aware of this once i did my annual credit check .
dr. c. gidwani was rude and abrupt in a saccharin sweet way .
and i still do n't know why i need a specialist .
4. now to tooth # 2/3 .
she then drills the tooth , slightly , and asks me to check it .
at that point , i just left .
thank you dr. gidwani for such a horrible experience !
i 'm sure my boys wo n't mind starting school without new clothes !
beware of this office !
actually.. beware of the office manager jc !
she literally was talking over me and not answering any of my questions directly !
how are u able to bill someone for service that was never completed ?
the best way to describe this place is `` ghetto '' .
this is at the eastern location .
i assume the others are just the same .
they gave me a little pat-on-the back and sent me on my way .
i just called to make an appointment .
i 'm already on the verge of breaking .
he wo n't see me because i take medication for my neropathy .
way to make me feel even worse .
i do n't even want to bother anymore .
some lady who walked in w/a cold went right in .
-- -- update after 2hrs finally got in .
the pa , alexandra leguire , was awesome .
would give her 5 stars .
very nice , professional , & thorough .
if you must go to this urgent care hopefully you can see her .
rest of this place , disorganized .
i 'm very disappointed with a final result .
i spent about $ 1800 and there is no difference at all .
i bought 2 voluma fillers and no results at all .
i 've been taking my son to .
mendoza for 8 months .
i kept giving dr. mendoza a shot .
this last visit i walked out .
i never walk out of appointments because i 'm in the medical field .
i understand things happen , you fall behind on your schedule .
but they are always behind .
schedule things better or hire an np to help .
i waited nearly 2 hours .
not to mention there office is dirty and outdated .
i brush it off .
fine , i 've ran behind on my mornings before too .
visit after visit , i knew appointments would last hours .
this last one pushed me over .
so my baby is behind on vaccines .
they rescheduled me because dr. mendoza wanted to leave early on my appt day .
it was st. patrick 's day .
you work hard , you should enjoy a green beer or whatever .
they said to come in wednesday .
it 's good to be early .
someone who came in after me was seen before me !
they call me back finally at 3:20. and i wait .
go to the scale at 3:30. and i wait .
it 's 4 and i 'm still waiting .
the poor medical assistant is running around like crazy .
i just lose it .
that means i wo n't be seen until 4:30 ? !
this is every single appointment people .
there offices are dirty , they need better paint .
from recommendation of all my mom friends i am going to dr. tenby now .
do not do business with this company !
run away fast from using this company !
it never hurts to price match ... even for the dentist .
they quoted me $ 300 for nitrous oxide .
i ca n't believe that i have already paid this to this office once .
both times they refused to contact my insurance for prescriptions .
have also never had any challenges ever in having a pharmacy call to verify .
they refuse to apply your insurance if you do not have your card .
both times i asked them to check with someone .
at $ 50 a month for my prescription this adds up .
i will take my business elsewhere .
the awesome lady chiro who used to work here is not here anymore .
how can they have this guy seeing patients ?
he paid no attention to me or why i was there .
told me i hav a cold .
how and why did i have to pay 60 $ to listen to that ?
this was the worst rmt massage i 've ever had in my life .
so both my sides can hurt ?
so i cut my one hour to 45 minutes .
i do not recommend this place .
lying face down was not comfortable .
so why only 2 stars ?
when i started , our classes were ran by a young woman name amy .
he was present and attentive .
justin stopped working there and it was back to amy .
perhaps the same thing happened with justin .
anyway , i did n't stay to find out .
i called 15 minutes after appt .
i have record of it on my phone .
i forgo a session so you do n't have to honor your session .
this is not good customer service !
just my two cents .
they delivered our baby and her sister 's baby .
unfortunately what prompted me to write this review is their office staff .
to say they are grossly incompetent is an understatement .
ya , that was n't going to fly .
she wo n't be going back .
they are killing your business reputation .
oh how do i do rate and review bright now dental ? ? ?
5 stars for that !
their over booking appointments and time delay brings the stars down .
the mass confusion my account also brings the stars down .
the confusion with my dental plan also brought it down .
i really appreciate that .
this being said , she brings the stars up !
i hope its a good ending .
i asked the receptionist if it was ok and she said yes .
again , is said no to her great idea .
we got into the room and she sat down and left me standing there .
i let her know that i did listen to it .
her main response was `` really '' to most of what i said .
she seemed to have a lot of negative comments and expressions .
i was shocked and did not fill the rx .
i would not recommend this doctor to anyone .
he was rude , pompous and egotistical .
he sure was n't interested in anything i had to say .
the results of the biopsy - inconclusive !
i have an appointment there in early january .
if they had my number they should have called well before now .
not the week of telling me i have until 2pm to pay .
i have never missed any payments whatsoever .
$ 40 are you kidding me !
if you had my number you should have called sooner .
lord knows they do n't call you until after 90 days .
not a fan at all .
but this is nothing in comparison to what came later .
i do n't get blood drawn well and it was always a huge deal .
what a great visit .
all around , not a great place to be .
that was the last straw .
no respect at all .
whether i am 21 or 35 , i deserve respect .
especially after reading other reviews , i am so glad i 've left .
my new doctor is sweet , excited , and takes her time with us .
skip ob pv if you really care about your treatment .
they are fancy and high-end but really not worth the hassle at all .
the clinic also seems nice and clean .
however , the clinic 's practises and policies have been incredibly enraging .
i even got a blood test once because i 'm paranoid .
i did n't notice until i got to the pharmacy .
i literally begged for at least six months , but walked away with three .
have not had a problem with any department except for the vein surgery dept .
due to care concerns , i moved my parent out of the facility recently .
bbq burger was pretty good with a great combo of texture and flavour .
was disappointed when i got the bill and saw the quick-pick tip amounts here .
her response was a dismissive `` well that 's standard '' .
this was easily the worst massage experience i 've ever had .
on the bright side , i guess my skin is quite hydrated .
at times , it seemed like the staff did n't know what to do .
maybe i got a rookie , or someone that just did n't care .
whatever the case is , i 'm definitely not coming back here again .
never again , made an appointment , got in , saw jen .
seemed nice enough , a bit rushed but okay .
so i tell the assistant ?
what my questions are , he scribbles them down .
so i 'm left sitting in limbo .
while i was there i got a prescription .
that was a few weeks ago .
i call today to find out that she did nothing with it .
so now i 'm almost out of pills and do n't have any coming .
i was promptly hung up on .
i can only assume that they cancelled it since i obviously ruffled someones feathers .
i really think this is an 'all about the money ' practice .
i will say that the nurses & doctors are very friendly & helpful though !
they really listen to your problem & do their best to access it .
that being said , the actual service here is ridiculous !
i did n't get seen until almost 1am !
aside from that , the waiting room is freezing !
multiple people waiting to be seen asked for blankets .
below i have shown emails from ms. perez .
amber perez warner family practice billing department ( 480 ) 831-8457opt .
4 -- -- thank you for your prompt response .
the policy number remains the same as i provided .
amber perez warner family practice billing department ( 480 ) 831-8457opt .
it 's hard to relax when doors are slamming and walls are shaking .
first time i went last year everything was good .
this year upon returning and totally regret it .
i wonder how many comments on groupon are really are from customers .
we really wanted to enjoy it like last year what a bummer .
the staff is friendly but the doctors are ridiculously cautious .
if you need meds for a cough or cold , this is your place .
parents - this is not the place to take your kids .
i do not like the service i 've gotten from this location .
the service is abrupt and abrasive .
there are no smiles , understanding or good service .
it 's quite obvious that their patients are not top priority .
it 's one extreme or the other .
but i plan to before my next physical .
this office as a whole is very unaccommodating and just rude to patients overall .
please save yourself the stress and do not go here .
this type of care is egregious and extremely disheartening .
at first dr. cotton will get you .
she seems nice and sympathetic and kind .
thousands in unnecessary `` treatments '' .
the work my daughter got done at dr cotton 's was subpar .
i 'm a student here currently enrolled this is what i have to say .
the school director is a joke he 's disrespectful and clearly hates his job .
i can continue with this but i think i got my point across .
idea of this place is great , but services are not .
i went with my mom and her massage therapist was amazing .
his cellphone kept going off and he rushed the services .
i ended up leaving the place in pain rather than relaxed .
also they do n't thank you for giving them a tip .
be prepared to spend hours here though .
the front office staff is n't very friendly though .
when all was said and done i had spent almost 4 hours here .
i am not sure that i will be returning .
my wife is now being seen at 5:45 and no one has an explanation .
this is n't the first time we have waited forever at this office .
the worst doctor ever .
he only gives you prescription and get you out the door .
i am very suspicious of all those good ratings about him .
went in 2015 for an exam and the staff was ok. dr was great .
the staff was n't so nice then .
they insisted i try using bausch and lomb again .
since my prescription changed , i was at their mercy .
i said i 'd purchase another sample set just to try them again .
i just want to see clearly !
dr. torres was absolutely awful to me .
i was so shocked i could n't say anything .
and then stood up and left .
seriously one of the worst manners ever .
i felt scared and confused and he made it so much worse .
i went home in tears .
i will never go back to him .
i love the convenience of marc 's in avon but i must change stores .
it 's just filthy .
the building is new - why is your store so dirty ?
garbage everywhere - floors dirty , produce awful .
it has the appearance of little to no maintenance .
seems like it would be an easy fix but alas not to be .
you 're convenience will be missed but i just ca n't do it anymore .
terrible communication amongst staff .
i think its telling that there are numerous similar complaints that wfp responds to .
my experience is similar to many other individuals who posted here .
my insurance covers routine exams at 100 % .
please be wary of this office and their practices .
my doctor sent over a referral for a procedure on 6/21/17 .
i called to make an appointment .
whoever does the referrals was n't available .
also , they did n't do the procedure , modified barium swallow test there .
they could n't get me in until august 14th at the earliest .
they would call when the referral came in .
well , it 's august 17th , so i thought i call .
this person was so nasty it was unbelievable ! !
i asked about what was happening and off she went .
telling me that she called me and spoke to me .
which she did n't .
i keep extremely detailed notes , plus i am not senile !
well he never received any notification .
i 've seen him several times since june !
she calls me a liar and was just unbelievably rude for no reason !
it 's not like i called screaming !
she really needs to find another line of work .
hopefully , one that has no contact with people !
it was great when i saw dr amy sparks for the 1st time .
imagine my surprise when i received a bill a year after that 1st visit .
the most i should 've been charged is the $ 14 copay .
? what about the patients who can not dispute ? ? ?
i argued with them for weeks until they told me to just ignore it .
that 's it , i 'm switching doctors
very rude and acts like she hates her job .
she forgets the meds she has you on .
worst psychiatrist ever with the worst attitude ever and she makes you feel uncomfortable .
run far away from this `` doctor . ''
the service levels are simply ho-hum to disappointing .
i do not recommend .
i should have read all the reviews before making an appointment .
their system said i had been called and i was not .
save your money ! ! !
totally not concerned about your needs .
it 's a facade .
nothing special at all with these ppl .
they mandatory want to keep you at least 21 days .
but it 's totally not worth the money or insurance cost .
this is the worst place for treatment .
i 'm a local and for this place to be called luxury is joke !
total fraud ! ! !
i will never get help here nor recommend this place to anyone .
dr nakhle is great but unfortunately the wait time to see him is hours .
in january i had an initial consultation with dr. mckenna .
i was fine with this initial delay .
especially because they were switching physicians due to their own scheduling issues .
sorry dr. richardson but your office staff cost you money .
bottom line - do not use valley ent .
lady booking appointments was very unaccommodating .
she said , `` well that 's what everyone wants . ''
there are now appointments from now until whenever , first thing in the morning ?
i would give this place no stars if i could .
we have been going to dr. steve since my son was 2 years old .
never any problems with him .
i went in expecting to schedule the root canal .
this is the only cavity he has ever had .
i left the office in complete shock !
just seemed a bit excessive to us .
my dentist was in utter disbelief .
he could n't believe the `` treatment plan '' that dr. parsa provided .
my dentist found 1 problem .
you read that correctly - 1 problem .
here we go again - for a 3rd opinion ! ! !
both my dentist and children 's dental village said that nitrous would be sufficient .
sure makes $ 637 seem like a `` good deal '' !
that is still $ 1,154.25 more than children 's dental village .
now , do n't get me wrong .
but why would we want to put him through more than is necessary ?
why would anyone want to do that ?
they really pushed hard for that .
i am so torn with this place as another poster has said .
last night was a different story .
he was walking out the door as i was still talking .
i could n't believe it .
and they were n't busy , like at all .
we got in and into a room in less than 10 minutes .
hence why we are here !
he 's violently coughing and complaining his chest hurts .
idk if i will come back to this location .
i did my research on dr. layton before going .
he has great reviews - all over the web , not just on yelp .
my appointment went well .
when did it get bad ?
the next day i got a call from evdi for my mammogram .
well - that 's news to me ! !
no , `` we should have called you . ''
that 's kind of a frightening call to get , for one .
and for two , what if i had gone and gotten a mammo ! ?
today was my second appointment after not hearing anything .
when i did n't go i expected a call .
that 's quite a big error .
maybe he does - but his shared office staff does n't .
( i 'll save that for another review ) .
so , i chose this dentist .
there 's no dental assistant , helping the dentist ! ! ! !
his equipment is outdated to the max .
ughhhhhhh ! ! ! ! ! !
what is with people and wanting what i asked for ! ? ! ?
good thing my friend is a dental assistant !
went to see angela derosa a few years back in the scottsdale office .
i do not personally recommend this woman .
pizza bar is disgraceful .
2 people ignored my family and i today .
i mean burnedwe order pizzas at a minimum of once per week .
lately , the people in this department have had poor attitudes .
lazy and ignoring customers .
but now it 's ridiculous .
also , veganaise and refrigerated sections are seriously out of stock .
only the basics we ca n't get anywhere else from now on for us .
and another voice responded `` no , probably just someone leaving . ''
all i get is `` sorry , we 're closed . ''
this time i get one word - `` sorry . ''
i look up to see faces of stone .
i get a short reply , `` 5 pm . ''
i then ask if they know when phoenix children 's urgent care opens .
it was like it wasnt the same doctor .
this er is horrible !
i 'd give it negative 5 stars if i could .
i brought her at 8pm on a monday night .
it took 4 and 1/2 hours before a doctor saw her .
the staff was unfriendly , not helpful & just horrible .
i would n't come here again if my life depended on it ... literally !
i took the day off work and arrived at the appointment .
incompetent staff just cost me a day off work .
took my best friend here for tonsillitis , absolutely horrible service ! ! !
waited over 3 hours and still never got put in a room !
the two nurses lindsey and amy were very rude ! ! ! !
evidently , the two other reviewers had a good experience with the office staff .
therefore , i quit going .
it did not matter that i had other serious health problems .
the staff reacted quite like bullies on the playground with sarcasm and hostility .
went in with aches and pains and left with the same aches and pains .
she would start to work a muscle , then stop .
one or two passes around a muscle is n't working it .
nothing got worked out , some areas like shoulders did n't get touched .
i feel like i did n't have a massage at all .
i suggest trying elements in summerlin for a completely different experience .
mmm , i do n't know about this place .
this was the regular diet meal , not a special diet .
several of the staff looked like they were on drugs themselves .
not much of any kind of activities for the residents to do .
however the tour of the inside was a different story .
nothing was said about not accepting them .
i said ok , but asked how much my secondary insurance would cover .
she said `` i have no way of knowing that . ''
i said ok , i 'd like to cancel my appointment .
bad experience and did n't even see the doctor !
today my wife wanted to change her appt .
maria 's conversation was harsh , rude and unprofessional .
i hope the manager will do more than just `` talk to her ! ''
maria needs to find another job !
what is my dentis going to do with those besides have a good laugh ?
steer clear of any dentist with low pricing .
it 's never a good sign .
it 's already 2am there 's still 2 patient still .
and she told us it 's also the same here .
so she said we 'd rather stay .
and i told her why do n't you hire more doctors .
and she answered me in a rude way that nobody wants to works nights .
this is the worts urgent care crew and staff that i ever encounter .
my second complaint is with the office staff .
even just calling for an appointment is a nightmare .
this is probably the absolute worst part about going here , in my opinion .
the staff is horrible .
my third complaint is with connie knapp , apn , and dr. torres .
connie is just unfriendly , and has a rushed , uncaring bedside manner .
but the real problem is dr. torres .
i saw him through my first pregnancy .
i ended up with a c-section .
i was so shocked i did n't know what to say or do .
the store definitely had the chain , mass-produced feeling .
how dare you ! ! ! ! ! ! ! inconvenience ? ? ? ?
my call was only returned 1/23 after leaving a long message .
imagine a mother hearing that ! !
told me to call him anytime i needed more assistance .
doctor said may take up to a year of using the eye drops .
how dare you just tell me `` sorry for the inconvenience '' ! ! !
up to now , i have not heard from dr nelson !
showed up for appointment where they photocopied my insurance card paid my copay etc .
if you go here call your insurance 1st .
this is by far the worst run medical practice in the state of nevada .
whoever answered the phone at 1953hours today , november 6,2015.. shame on you !
this place is not at all what they say it will be !
they say it 's free but i knew that would n't be the case .
i lost my weight but never got my money back .
simonmed must hire anyone with a heartbeat .
my doctor could n't even use the info from the ct scan .
that was a week ago ! !
will never use simonmed again !
for me.like many.rather die.before seeing him agsin
the office is huge and only 1 young dentist works there .
private practice is the only way to go .
i 've always loved banner facilities but my experience here was horrible .
i went in with a sore throat.the front desk process was pleasant .
i gave it one star as i had a decent parking spot .
i have used this location about 6 times as it 's very convenient .
each time they are rude and incompetent at best .
my bad for continuing to try every now and then .
i do really try to give people the benefit of doubt .
my daughter was fasting for her test as well .
patronize this location at your own risk .
you have a child become so upset and agitated ?
purely pathetic and insensitive .
i have spinal stenosis and arthritis in my knees .
i have been going to the henderson facility for almost three years .
today was the last straw .
please avoid this hospice company , and instead choose hospice of the valley .
the nurses seemed like lovely people and seemed very concerned for my dad .
he was aware of this and did not object to it .
i understand that hospice provides end of life care and makes patients comfortable .
as soon as he was stable enough to leave serenity house .
i called elizabeth myself to clarify what she 'd told mom .
i had to leave a message .
elizabeth-there 's a thing called number blocking .
your vacation is not my problem .
you might deal with people dying every day ; i do n't .
now they 'd downgraded themselves to really tacky people in my opinion .
having a loved one die is a naturally stressful time .
go with hospice of the valley .
my kids loved it .
i decided to schedule my regular cleaning here and i was very disappointed .
the hygienist named barb i believe was very rude and unfriendly .
i was very offended and ca n't believe how unprofessional that was .
i was so irritated that i just left and told them to call me .
i probably will not go back here .
worse doctor visit ever .
the receptionist mixed up my daughter 's chart with someone else 's .
like i sed worse doctor office ever !
i paid $ 40 for dr. arvin tounian to check me .
i waited for 6 weeks ( ! ! ! )
t. nguyen could see me , and she put the new retainer on .
she did sloppy work , and only 3 weeks later my retainer fell down .
i was n't even eating , it just fell down by itself .
in real life , it lasted 3 days and the retainer fell again .
this time dr. tounian referred me to another clinic - cheyenne dental group .
they did n't had my retainer ready , and not even my teeth impressions .
there has to be better places .
i have been going here off and on for over a year now .
tried 7 or 8 therapists .
therapist quality here is very hit and miss .
i laid on the table getting more and more frustrated .
i do acknowledge that the location is convenient and the premises is clean .
i was proffered a disingenuous and cursory apology .
i paid for the massage and left .
i will forget these loss-leader discount places that hire neophyte therapists .
the cost is just too high .
i was told that amy , the team leader , would call me .
what is the point of having team leaders if they do n't follow up ?
i 'm cancelling my account .
i do n't want to deal with this company again .
this place is so unorganized .
we moved from florida 18 months ago .
what is needed for public school should n't be out of the ordinary .
each visit was met with the same lecture and often double teamed .
it was beyond exasperating .
constantly told what i was doing wrong and my concerns fell on deaf ears .
worst urgent care ever .
was told and given paperwork by them for my high blood pressure .
waiting over a month for my results and still nothing .
these people are idiots !
horrible service do not go here ! !
that was three years ago .
fast forward to today .
i have been given anti-anxiety pills .
tynara is absolutely the worst pa i 've ever been to see .
courtney was awesome but left .
other pa 's have been great and have moved on .
i love dr. ram , he is excellent and very well-trained .
i think josh is good but overworked .
at least i know my care will be consistent .
i hate to leave after 15 years .
it is scary to wait much longer .
not worth the hassle !
way better staff and service !
will never use this urgent care facility again !
huge mistake coming to this urgent care !
it was n't busy and very few people were in the waiting area .
groupon promises that medication is included & it is not included !
i will take my business elsewhere , this place is completely dishonest .
oh this month is a guaranteed win it 's tax month .
its a revolving door of of practitioners coming and going .
the only positive experience i had was my initial visit .
since then , it 's been a nightmare .
i would never recommend anyone going here .
there are many fine , qualified physicians in the area .
robert newman , md , an ob gyn should not be your choice .
the lady that answered the phone when i called was horrible !
i will never go to this nationwide again !
they do n't even deserve 1 star !
i will not return .
the woman went outside .
secondly i was informed i needed an mri .
after one week i called back .
nothing had been sent .
then next day i called .
they claimed they sent it to a different diagnostic center .
this was not a new prescription !
i had left so many voice mail messages to so many different people there .
i do n't think they ever listen to them ! !
finally , i needed my mri results but my doctor was out of town !
i was assured i would be contacted .
it 's like a bad dream dealing with that office !
a few days ago i got a rash of some sort .
so really they just wan na keep making money off of me .
brcause they just want my money !
i will not be returning to this practice .
and i was the only one on the schedule .
this place gave me the creeps for a medical clinic .
even if it is a abortion clinic they should give you a comfortable feeling .
i 'd rather have my miscarriage at home than a creepy place like this .
i would not recommend this office for your children 's pediatric care .
this was at a 6 month appointment !
you guys i ca n't make this stuff up !
do n't do it .
it was possible that the teeth supporting the bridge could rot if not cleaned .
first of all , dr rowe has her desk sitting behind the receptionist .
yes , this all boils down to the bottom line , money .
i most certainly wanted to find a trusting dentist .
one that i felt comfortable with .
unfortunately , this was not the case in the office of dr rowe .
the dental assistant , super friendly and sweet .
i do hope she gets a degree and gets paid what she is worth .
actually the rudest staff i have ever witnessed .
you do n't have privacy .
your in a room full of people .
the `` vip '' room is a stupid little room .
would never go back .
i didnt want to leave a tip .
then , without going into details , dr vesna violated patient confidentiality .
so we left and are now seeing another doctor we trust .
i purchased a groupon for a couples massage .
i found that odd , but we proceeded with the massage anyway .
once we entered the room we were asked to undress in preparation .
my massage was n't horrible but felt rushed and awkward .
at one point they massaged our legs with rocks .
she kept hitting my ankle bone with the rocks .
at one point she lifted and dropped my legs ?
i do n't know if she thought that would loosen me up ?
please tell me what part of that would be relaxing ?
as she continued on to my back it was the same thing .
as she rubbed my back her stomach was hitting my head , repeatedly !
this was the worst massage i 've ever had unfortunately .
both masseuse 's completely ignored massaging our thighs .
my husband specified some problem areas which was completely ignored .
on my sheet i wrote all areas as i had no target areas .
once again here they were shoving those intro papers into our face .
now i knew what the preset tips were about .
they have you `` rate '' your experience .
i did n't want to be rude and planned to tip regardless .
obviously i would n't rate my experience great by any means .
to me this tactic is very tacky !
my husband tipped them $ 25 and we left !
unfortunately our search continues for a really good spa ...
this was an extremely negative experience .
i am a banner employee .
i waited and then the girl cam out and said the nurse said no .
after $ 9000 paid i was told my son needed braces again .
they accused him of not wearing his retainer which he always did .
and , then they said he needed braces for another $ 3k .
well , let me see , it was n't my son making the payments .
2 stars are for fantastic nurses .
hospital gets no stars .
wife arrived by ambulance at 5 on thursday with broken ankle .
emergency room doctor saw her and put in a splint for surgery on friday .
did n't get into surgery until 5 pm , full 24 hours after admittance .
in pain the full time .
no way to run a hospital .
go to centennial or summerlin .
i did not feel well and was not ready to go home .
we will not return .
this place is by far the worst !
they make sure to collect your copayment before hand .
unbelievably the worst customer service .
the selection of clothes is not very good and the staff ignores you .
she replied that it would be extra $ 150 for a nice full set .
that is on top of the $ 50 i had already spent on groupon .
now i have to call american express cancel my charges an informant groupon .
i would just beware .
what if you needed a fill ?
i wish i had read reviews before i wasted my money going here !
i was assured i would .
i went and lo and behold she was n't .
she was a nurse practitioner ! !
she had a kind if all attitude which i was not impressed with .
i 'll never go there again !
i am a senior citizen with a bad right knee .
shame on you for such poor customer service and caring !
seeing dr. paige was an extremely disappointing experience .
it was n't until then that dr. paige finally came into the room .
not a call , text ... nothing .
not very friendly not very helpful .
yes they did answer my questions and they do have some great products .
sorry folks i ca n't give you a good rating on this one .
i would rate in the negative range if i could .
andrew was super nice but the hypnosis was more like a relaxation meditation .
i felt kind of nice afterwards because it was relaxing .
just left about 4 hours ago .
the doctor did not exam me in a way that i most doctors would .
i got vitals taken by a nurse who were really awesome .
he asked a lot of questions for 5 min .
i paid $ 85 since it was my first visit .
he did not explain how to use my prescription .
so i called their office and asked how .
the doctor we not willing to speak on the phone w me .
i do n't recommend this place to anyone .
for the sake of your health and finances please avoid
i went yesterday for mothersday and took my mom for the first time .
read some reviews seemed like it would be a nice relaxing time .
i was very disappointed .
their massage techniques were terrible the worst i 've felt .
we both need another massage .
i 've definitely been to better spas .
the pa and medical assistant were terrible .
it 's so upsetting .
also the bathroom was filthy and the trash was overflowing in the room .
horrible ! ! ! ! ! ! !
rude ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
and only $ 20/hr !
this dentist is way too busy working on too many patients at one time .
the dentist seemed bored with the whole procedure .
i can understand being busy , but honestly they have no excuse .
there was 1 person in front of me .
there were no patients besides myself & the other person .
this is n't the first time this has happened either ... .
was 20 minutes early for appointment .
waited another hour after appointment time to see dr toth .
dr too busy to see me .
i would not recomnend this practice .
do not think they really care about patients , especially after surgery .
staff did n't even tell me my doctor was running behind .
this made me late for work .
doctors charge us if we are late the same should apply to them .
what i did n't know was : 1. the dr. is n't really available .
it felt like i was visiting some sort of high school work program .
pa is physicians asst which is a nurse with some advanced training & licensing .
i do n't have any reason to go back .
not helpful at all , do n't come here .
do not go here ! ! !
i do n't think that she knew what she was doing .
she did n't even look at my tongue .
i have had a lot of acupuncture .
what kind of customer service is this ?
we 've been going to them since moving into the city 6 years ago .
this place is terrible .
dirty , unsanitary place with rude people who half ass do their jobs .
he has fallen out of his bed easily at least 15 times a week .
this place is done .
patients beware this is day light robbery
went in late around midnight - they are open until 4am .
everything was going decently until he stopped to answer his phone .
will never go back ! ! !
deeply disappointed with this practice and medical advice .
i had double pneumonia for 2 months that they did n't diagnose .
i will find a new primary care physician
scheduled a massage for my elderly father .
he could not find the location .
he did not have the number to inform them .
getting a person on the phone is almost impossible at sw kidney institute .
i am trying to pay my bills and ca n't seem to get anyone .
i ended up leaving a message for call back .
seki should install an on- line payment system like some.of the other medical organizations .
i am receiving invoices when i paid in full on my visit ! ! !
so annoying ... ... and the prescription is the worst i have ever had .
they tried fixing it and still not right !
dont go there ! !
do not go to this place .
it takes three to four weeks to get your glasses .
and the prescription was not right .
i paid over $ 700 and the prescription is not right .
i 'm 61 years old and have worn glasses for over 20 years .
this is the worst prescription i have ever had .
pros : friendly staff , state-of-the-art equipment and gadgets .
cons : everything else !
thanks but no thanks !
i rest my case : http : //www.smartmoney.com/plan/health-care/dentists-drill-for-dollars/
when asked why , '' well i can guarantee it 's fine `` .
with him being the only doc i 've seen/primary care for about a month .
i have had my glasses for about 2 years .
they look more like some film is coming off .
i had to beg them to replace them the last time .
now it 's doing it again .
they said there is no film on them .
she will not give you a straight answer for price .
she is a con artist .
she will keep on calling you honey and honey that with broken english .
she will also try to use her broken english to cheat you with price .
what a shame because frank was very good .
find a different place to work for frank .
i got there and the receptionist was very nice and accommodating .
i expect to see a chiropractor 2-3 times a week for my current issue .
i 'm not going to wait this long each time .
came here with my husband who has neck pain from a car accident .
this dr is clearly about the money , not about the injury .
he should be there to treat your injury , not push attorneys .
walked out and wo n't look back .
$ 275 in copays equals to zero functioning glasses at optic gallery .
i visited the office to request a pair of prescription sunglasses back in may .
they recommended single vision glasses with eyezen and polarized .
when these glasses arrived i could n't even see thru them .
it was like everything was fluid .
they repeated the lens order just to have the same effect .
the doctor double checked the prescription and recommended progressive lenses .
when i returned to optic gallery after struggling with the glasses for a week .
do n't go here if you 're paying cash .
that 89 dollar coupon is a scam .
they told me i needed a `` deep cleaning '' .
`` how much is it ? ''
`` that 'll be shown in your treatment plan . ''
i laughed at it , and then walked out .
did the work in one cleaning .
cost : $ 95 .
we found a tiny table .
the server asked for my cc i gave it to him .
where 's the card ? ``
asked me this so rudely ! ! !
he eventually finds my card and charged me for someone else 's food .
nobody has yet to call me and i still have charges on my card .
she made me feel like i was a bother to her .
i gave her my work order then she said you fasting ?
she need to learn more on how customer service works very unfriendly .
everyone there was polite and good with my 2 year old son .
my problem rested in the cost .
it was $ 162 for a `` cleaning , exam and flouride . ''
we were in the exam room for maybe 8 minutes .
went there on 12-4-2017 due to severe pain in my left elbow .
could not bend my arm under any circumstances .
so he just took `` straight away '' shots of the elbow .
2 1/2 hours wasted .
`` never again ! ''
i was guided to this practice when my usual doctor retired from medicine .
the woman i spoke to on the phone was terry .
terry 's attitude through the entire phone call was snappy .
she cut me off every time i started to speak .
i signed in and was given the usual paperwork .
it made it extremely hard to hear what terry was saying .
oh yeah , god forbid you have to explain something twice .
you do not know the specific circumstances surrounding my situation .
her lecturing me made me feel even more anxious .
i was so glad it was over .
when i went to pay i had to go to terry .
funny , when she was taking my payment she was remarkably pleasant .
this place just made me feel so uncomfortable .
***went to pick up my prescription today , dr. stephens prescribed the wrong pill .
do not go here , it 's an utter disgrace .
did not provide adequate instructions pre-surgery .
had to wait 2+ hours after scheduled start time to start the surgery .
i scored a groupon for i think $ 39 for a hour .
the facility is clean , very new and well appointed .
walking out was just like walking in , just a bit cleaner .
the receptionist was unfriendly , and very short in her answers .
really did not seem to care about anything .
went back to see the doctor , very impersonal .
i 've never felt so used before .
worst of all , i feel like i 'm in worse pain than before .
i only went to them because they were close to me at the time .
next time i will travel to what i see as the better location .
i really wanted to like this place .
i went to the dentist and they took an xray .
my husband specifically informed them on the phone to look for an abscess .
this all happened last week .
well flash forward to this week and my pain is increasing .
i was unhappy about this but i trusted them .
i thought wow , this must be tmj possibly .
i was in severe , severe pain .
how did your dentist miss this ?
you need to find a new one immediately . '
he then got me into a dentist to perform an emergency root canal .
how cherrington saw none of this is beyond me .
stay away ! ! !
i have never in my life heard of such nonsense !
i was waiting for my pedicure as this was going on .
this is so wrong and cruel .
stay far away from this office
we had to tell her this & avoid re-filling patient information .
i went last year and the girls were incredibly rude and unhelpful .
i ignored them and did n't complain .
i also wo n't be going back .
i thought `` sure why not '' and this place had good reviews .
no foot included which was weird considering it was a reflexology specialized place .
dropped two more dollars and got out of there .
i will not recommend this place .
their appointment system is sham .
they never keep to their appointment time .
you wait like 40-45 minutes before you are called in .
then they will make you wait at the dentists chair for another 20-30 mins .
my wife went twice and it was same story of long wait times .
dentists are no good either on both bedside manners and medical treatment .
they are rude , start treatment without telling you what they are doing .
we had to go in again to get the same problem fixed .
lilly , .. the makeup tattooing lady was very unprofessional .
it was painful as well and she said it would not be .
i 'm very very dissappointed in my experience with lilly .
and she was rude and also very argumentitive .
not ones that are rude and money hungry .
we were seated immediately , no menu .
we looked at the girl and made eye contact .
we watched the other girl make 3 smoothies .
we looked at other people looking back at us knowingly .
eye contact again with the hostess , waitress , whatever -- nothing .
17 minutes later we left .
we never even saw a menu .
they dont have a separate table for body massage .
only foot massage chair that lies down .
not what im used to from cali .
the front lady was also very rude with her attitude .
came in to see a pa , she was fine .
peggy at the front desk however has grown quite unpleasant .
she said , `` no , there will be no switching .
she was 12 and they cancelled her .
i felt badly for her .
if you do n't care , do n't do patient care !
i also had another time when i had a diagnostic mammogram to be ordered .
i called back for 3 months before the radiology center finally received it .
i ended up needing surgery !
do n't waste your time seeing dr. nahkle .
he might be knowledgeable but i never saw it .
his bedside manner is deplorable .
i waited 2 weeks for nothing .
worst experience with a doctor .
i hate that this information is not updated .
yelp , can you be taking businesses down that are not around any more ?
i 've gotten an mri before and paid a small copay .
these people do n't care either they are just paid to take your money .
go somewhere else before you visit this corporation .
a few weeks ago i stroll into whole foods looking for some supplements .
not a head nod , no eye contact , nothing .
perhaps my expectations are too high for this establishment .
so i wander around looking at items and looking for my supplement .
i 'm asking too much are n't i ?
i need to become a whole foods snob , right ?
well the cashier was n't the nicest .
the wait at this office is the worst .
i waited over 1.5 hours to get in and i had an appt .
i made appointment for beyond fabulous facial .
came on time and confirmed with the front desk .
i needed to get cash since everything fell out of my wallet at home .
a big fee upfront and then an additional fee that your bank charges you .
i had a cornea transplant done by dr. dow 3 years ago .
he also did a cataract in my eyes at the same time .
he managed to well my iris to the lens with the laser .
he did seem to think this was an issue .
his answer to everything was just get a contact lens .
i was recommended by an optometrist to go see another doctor for a consultation .
i would let dr. dow lance a boil on my dog 's ass .
probably my fourth time going there .
still contemplating whether i give them a second chance or just move on .
my husband found his massage satisfactory and it was still a good price .
this place is a joke .
they have one person in the office .
she is trying to check everyone in and do all the testing .
if you have time on your hands this is your place
the fees they charge is a complete rip-off .
this is a scam .
these guys are crooks .
dr. damian is inconsiderate and unprofessional .
my first appointment i waited 4 hours to be seen .
the staff was not very pleasant either .
if you complain they make you feel like you did something wrong .
if i could i 'd give no star i would .
supervisor was rude when returning an item .
threw my groceries i was purchasing around .
worst pharmacy ever ! !
my doctor sent a prescription for an antiobiotic to this pharmacy on thursday .
when that pharmacy tried to fill the prescription , guess what ? ? ? ?
they could n't because cvs had already filled it on friday .
i 'm only thankful that the prescription was not life or death !
do not go here .
deceptive business practices in place .
do not sign up for trial or sign any contracts .
i repeat do not do business here !
expect to pay a ton if you go here .
i 've never paid so much after insurance for an xray .
we went there for suspected hip dysplasia .
my daughter is fine but my bank account is not .
we will not be going back , unless i want to go bankrupt .
she used way too much lotion .
very sloppy and seemed like their routine could use some straightening up .
the gilbert office was booked so we were referred to the chandler office .
two things that i would assume to be common since .
2.5 hours total time out for 1 newborn doctors appointment .
be prepared to wait an hour after your appointment time before you get in .
also , everyone in the waiting room was complaining about waiting so long .
office staff is rude as well .
i really should 've looked at the reviews before coming here .
all the other complaints are very similar to mine .
i was one of those people .
i came in they were extremely nice and took care of me .
i had a tooth that needed to be pulled that was very loose .
so i told them i would start there .
let 's get my tooth pulled and see how i feel after .
the only problem i had was my loose tooth .
i just left it alone .
i controlled what would happen and i 'm okay now .
but just today my wife went in to have two teeth pulled .
for 3 teeth ( implants ) they were charging 10,000 with insurance .
everything is always put on the screen for us to see .
with a final number of almost 3,000 for 3 plastic teeth .
when asked how the number jumped so high .
they should try to be more understanding to what the client is going through .
they clearly have a problem with customer service as well as ripping customers off .
they are very nice as long you pay what ever they ask .
we will never come back here again .
i hope this helps others .
just pay attention and ask questions .
it 's not fair to over price and take advantage of customers .
the staff said that there was not an appointment available for 2 months .
she was absolutely horrible .
i had a horrible experience with this office .
i wanted to try their another flavor but they would not honor their coupon .
what poor customer service .
pinching penny 's just to loose a good customer .
got one filling fixed at the new place for 150 bucks .
and if you have kids , do n't even think about it .
i would give a `` 0 '' if i could !
are you serious ! ! ? ?
ca n't wait to finally be in a new office !
she kept leaving during my massage .
we paid for a 70 minute massage and it was less than an hour .
then when we were leaving the lady told me to tip her more .
do not go to this sleezy place .
so many other reflexology joints that are worth it .
i guess they do n't need my business !
they wo n't match prices .
their version of customer service = conceited indifference .
stopped by here today for some protein powder .
they have a great selection of products crammed into this little spot .
and , the staff seems really knowledgeable about supplements too .
their response : i was waved off with contempt .
but , it 's my six dollars , and why waste it unnecessarily ?
i 'm sure you can figure it out .
i went here for a crown and i never saw the same dentist twice .
the first one did the mold .
he drilled the back of the front teeth and left them feeling awful .
now my bite is off and ruining my front teeth alignment .
i am going to another dentist to hopefully get this corrected .
they have their money and that is all they are concerned about .
i am warning anyone considering on going here to not go .
it is awful ! !
they also try to up sell you every chance they get .
most of my fees were paid by my insurance and wsib .
the clinic could have pulled my report for my contact info .
this place is terrible i do n't recommend it !
i do n't not recommend this place what so ever ! ! !
was going to make an appointment .
i got an awful first impression of whoever was on the phone .
she sounded irritable , gave me one word answers and just sounded completely unwelcoming .
i think her name was jessica or something .
you just lost a customer .
detoxification is not good .
you wear a weird wristband connected to some machine that does seemingly nothing .
abc of massages is direct contact .
the owner gave me a sour look and said it was too low .
within a month , both nose pieces broke .
i 've never had this happen on any frames before .
i was required to drink 32 oz of water 1 hr before my test .
now it 's been 90 minutes since i drank the water .
mother nature is calling and they do n't care here .
with all of the skilled doctors they supposedly have -- whats the point ?
this dentist office is the worst .
that was the last straw for me .
this dentist is only there for show since the technicians do all the work .
any place is better than this dentist office !
after several years he closed his small practice and moved to cardiovascular consultants .
cvc could not give me the required reports and information .
cust service not friendly .
a place u dread to have to go .
understaffed in all areas .
i would never come back .
i love my primary barbara hoose , but i will nvr come back here .
charged my card on file without my permission which caused me to overdraft .
i came to this salon because of the high ratings .
they even offered me a discount since i was unhappy with my french pedi .
the facility is clean and has a very relaxing atmosphere .
one of the lines came out slanted .
the lines on some of the toes vary in thickness .
overall just not very clean or neat .
i did n't want to take the chance .
so perhaps the other services are good ; i honestly do n't know .
what i would n't recommend is getting any french mani or pedi there .
the staff are all friendly which makes an office visit much more pleasant .
i will not return to even try to have them fix it .
better to cut and run .
wish i had been a yelp user before i went there .
if i could give 0 stars i would .
they were booked but said they would call if any cancellations .
they sent a reminder text on the sunday and again on the monday .
i thought ok this is great !
i have never done this treatment and was really looking forward to it .
then she says can you come thursday instead ?
like my time and my appointment was not important or a priority .
i said no and why are you cancelling my appointment ?
i will take my time and my money elsewhere .
beware..this is how they treat new customers .
i 'm sure they are all very nice people .
but i should of walked out when i had the chance .
i scheduled a chem peel at the last minute on a saturday .
finally i get in to see the person i had the appt with .
she was really nice but was having an off day it seemed .
then she started going `` serum '' crazy .
like serum after serum after serum .
one was a vitamin c serum .
and it turned me oompa loompa orange .
but all the serums start coming off and its just falling off in chunks .
gave me a .25 oz sample size and charged me $ 5 for it .
my skin did look pretty good .
and the next day it was tight and dry .
but i never peeled .
and that $ 5 lotion ?
instead of peel , i broke out like a mo fo .
i 'm going to try a dermalogist instead .
good night pediatrics gets no stars from me !
what happened to you good night pediatrics ? ! ?
we have been coming to good night peds since they opened .
our last visit was horrible .
staff is so unfriendly with no personality .
dr gave us 5 minutes of her time and left .
plus they misdiagnosed my daughter !
do not bring your children here .
they really scraped the bottom of the barrel when hiring staff here !
not going back there again !
worst of all , his hands reeked too , as he is a smoker .
could hardly move the entire day today .
unfortunately , it was an experience i would want to forget forever and ever .
the longer i wanted my nails i it would be 10 $ extra ?
vacationing from hawaii and i can find better services in hawaii .
i 've been with this doctor for the last 5 years .
i do n't know what happened but i can not book an appointment anymore .
the appointment was made for the next day .
dr. vazquez was so , so rude .
wish i could do more than just write a bad review .
she 's the best ! !
this place has horrible service in pharmacy !
! ! ! ! ! warning ! ! ! ! ! !
if you value your limbs do not get seen by dr. robert evans .
he should not be considered a doctor .
he and everyone in his office are below terrible !
let me break down what happened to my dad , in a nutshell .
keep in mind my father has diabetes .
two days later it is now oozing puss !
this was her response : `` looks infected .
needs oral antibiotics no doubt .
higher infection risk with diabetes too of course . ''
evan 's assistant says it is not infected .
we are irate at this point and take him straight to the e.r .
to see a competent doctor .
i would not recommend robert evans or anyone at his office .
if you choose to , see him at your own risk .
side note- the er we went to was mercy gilbert and highly recommend them .
i agree with maria p- the schedule reflects their care for their patients .
i always here these stories yet trusted their recommendation .
i would give it 0 stars if i could .
they can barely handle making appointments .
had an appointment yesterday for the first time as a new patient .
after an hour wait i saw the doctor .
if we did we would be out of a job !
worst customer service ever !
do n yourself a favor and find a different group !
needless to say , i will not return to this office ever again !
great experience with the optometrist !
that was not an issue at all .
it was the `` upsell '' of items when looking into purchasing glasses .
we walked and shopped around .
anytime that i can save $ 390 dollars i am going to .
seems shady and i wo n't trust them or be back again .
i called a total of 6 times .
the first two times i was disconnected .
i hung up and called back , three more times .
never got through to anyone again .
i guess that 's too much work .
lesson learned : always yelp first ! !
finally went here to see what it was all about ... .very disappointed .
it was a very messy , dirty store and extremely small aisles .
they sell a lot of expired products .
it was rude , so i brought my stuff to another cashier .
i would rather go to tutti frutti where the prices are a lot better .
you can be saving up to $ 5- $ 10 at times .
like some of the other negative reviewers , i also share a similar complaint .
their thing is to always get payment regardless .
my 9 yr old son needed to have a tooth extracted because it broke .
that was on 1/2/13 .
they would ve gotten payment from me and from the insurance .
my 2 kids had dental appointments tuesday and i was running late .
stephen answered the phone when i called to say we would be late .
i asked him how much that was .
he told me $ 25 per kid , so that would be $ 50 .
if we were one minute late we would be charged a late fee .
we ended up not keeping our appointment with that outrageousness .
they were just too lazy to do this .
i paid about $ 90 for the services .
the insurance paid $ 113.81 .
brooke told me that the late fees were $ 70 , not $ 50 .
i told her that that is what stephen told me they were .
she said he is wrong and i owe the $ 70 .
we have been going there for 2 yrs or more .
so , we had to reschedule .
dr. cotton had to fly out the day of our appointment .
our appointment was already set .
brooke should ve honored what stephen said .
rather , it appears that they are upset at me and just finding reasons .
yes , this is a pediatric dentistry .
when you have kids , things happen , but that doesn t matter .
for those good reviews , well , wait until you have an issue .
it will not be pleasant .
me : nope receptionist : did they tell you they were running late ?
even my experience with the closed mri was much more friendly and gentle .
here it was sorry lady .
bah i will not be back .
this place is only good for people who ca n't afford insurance .
i do n't know what the fuss over fresh is all about .
we walked in and were squeeeeezed into our seats .
it was very uncomfortable .
the food is blah as well .
boyfriend ordered the thai curry ( buddha ) bowl .
i ordered a the phytosalad .
i probably preferred the salad to the curry bowl .
they were both ok. i would not come again .
i went to this dentist for a regular check-up/cleaning as a new patient .
a new client should clear their whole day for this place .
what dentist keeps a new patient waiting 30 minutes ?
there were no other clients in the office .
how desperate can a place be ? ! ?
i will not be going back to this place .
no dental appointment should ever take 2 hours .
they have to keep up their state of the art equipment ... ..
do not go here ! ! ! !
they do not care ! ! ! !
i came here & was being treated by dr. jung .
i called in last week to tell them i still need my prescription .
here it is a week later & still no prescription .
why is there no doctor there on a friday ?
if no one can help me ?
thanks for caring about my mental stability ! ! !
oh and btw , not the first time they did n't send a prescription .
if its brand new it should be good right ? ''
this was probably the single worst dental experience i 've ever had .
the one good thing was that i got an appointment for the next day .
good quickly turned to bad when the assistant came in to take my x-rays .
after the cleaning came the real pain .
the dentist came in to do some drilling and fill in a cavity .
ive had a torn meniscus for a year and then he just says reschedule .
we have gone here for years .
they are very disorganized and lack customer service skills .
as for the providers , the wait time is unacceptable .
yes , we have the appointment cards on these and they clearly state 8/14/2018 .
no , we never received a call that their appointments had changed .
his appointment was confirmed for 8/14/2018 at 8:30 a.m. and no labs were needed .
appointment was confirmed a week before ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i called the office on 8/14 and asked for the office manager .
as of 5:28 p.m. 8/15/2018 i have not received a returned phone call .
8/27/2018 at 10:17 a.m. my mom received a call from kim .
she said she was the office manager .
what happened to tammy and/or shannon ?
anyway , she explained and felt as nothing was going to happen .
i laid into her about the issues .
my husband felt dr. stern an adequate provider .
my father did not like him at all .
the problems in a nutshell : not gentle , not thorough !
unfortunately , this was to the detriment of my dental health .
the inflammation went away on its own but came back a few months later .
the next time i went in , i told them about it .
as well , i had fillings twice .
i have a hard time opening wide - it really hurts my jaw .
that 's when i realized i had the wrong dentist .
i switched to another dentist - female that also works on children .
they found two spots where this had happened .
now i know - a bad dentist is a really big deal !
i need to speak to mary montes .
she has no clue of my situation or the insurance system , apparently .
my name is joy alberico .
i would give them zero stars if i could .
why would anyone want to go to this place ?
i have never encountered such rudeness .
the receptionist was condescending and belligerent .
do not waste your time calling .
you wo n't regret it .
she 's thorough and she listens and the kids really like her .
we really liked her .
they treat every interaction with you like you are inconveniencing them .
the appointments average two hours .
our quickest appointment was one hour .
our longest was three .
( well appointments , not sick . )
i wish dr garcia would get new employees .
until she does do n't go here .
can not say enough about how disappointed i am in this chain practice .
i would not recommend this disrespectful practice to anyone .
thank goodness i called because they informed me i did n't have an apt !
i said , i never canceled .
finally i said what can we do to fix this .
she was still focused on reviewing her `` notes '' .
she again read the `` notes '' that said i canceled .
i had a breast augmentation and lift.this doctor was charming and i was inexperienced .
a doctor not telling a patient of what could go wrong seems like malpractice .
i would never recommend anyone to this doctor
this store is a sh ! thole .
the staff is friendly if you can find them .
the company chooses not to employ anyone at this location .
the shelves are picked through and not restocked .
the merchandise looks tired and aged .
if you continue to not serve our community appropriately .
please shut down and let another group service us .
did i mention my wife was high risk ?
there were complications which i attribute to the long wait .
do n't do it ! ! ! ! !
can i give zero stars ? ? ! !
get ready to be treated like a transaction rather than a patient .
it 's like they 're all robots .
no one cares if there is an issue outside of their daily standard procedures .
it 's as if they will do whatever to charge a patient extra money .
i rescheduled to april 7th .
no apology , no compassion- he just acted like a moron-what a jackass !
he was clueless and apathetic at best !
they will not get another penny from me !
horrible customer experience ! ! !
walked out not buying anything .
i have never been disappointed at t.h.c the holistic center
i saw dr. torres .
i had heard he was a decent doctor .
i was not satisfied with his service or that of the entire office .
he told me it was n't necessary because it was n't my history .
she did n't answer any of my questions or give me any information .
they scheduling person never has any clue what is going on either .
they are not that friendly either .
i would never do business with this company again .
however , my major complaint is that i was not given my prescription .
eventually i was in for a contact fitting and asked for a print out .
i had the same issue with my contact fitting .
needless to say no one called me back .
skip these guys and go elsewhere .
this place does not even deserve one star .
i 've come 2 times .
and another 20 mins in the room before seeing the doctor .
she has taken her phone out 2 times to google things .
i know doctors do n't know everything but that just is unprofessional .
i 'm disgusted and so disappointed with this clinic .
it 's not only me .
waste of time and money
pushed my sons dairy allergy off as dry skin/eczema .
took him in today .
he 's been sick and i was just diagnosed with double pneumonia .
he diagnosed my son with croup .
i knew this was n't true so i got a second opinion .
my son has pneumonia as well !
you are a god damn idiot ! !
and i will never be back here .
think twice about bringing your kids to this shitty place !
i never once had my lower back touched ! !
horrible experience through and through .
first off , they are remodeling and it 's confusing which door to enter .
root canal was done wrong by dr trujillo .
he did n't numb me enough and started working and i screamed and cried .
there was no laughing gas .
she said she would call me `` in the next few days '' .
it was wednesday and now it 's tuesday of the next week .
after calling today , the receptionist got back to me and left a message .
my urgent care dr said he would never prescribe 800mg ibuprofen ! ! )
and finally , there was a cockroach in the back of the new office .
i want my money back there is no appointment with specialist .
i needed an x-ray on my right wrist .
i called 4 times to schedule an appointment .
when i finally got through - `` oh , x-rays are walk in .
no appointment necessary '' .
i have always received speedy service at valley .
that was a 5.5 hour wait .
this place solicited me to leave were i was to come to them !
i did not seek them out they solicited me out !
what a big mistake ! ! ! ! !
i have severe hip pain from radiation i had 2 cordizone shots scheduled .
i called my provided they said i didnt need prior .
we had a bad conversation i got rude and so did they !
a bunch of nit wits !
this post is more about the office itself than the doctor .
then i waited over an hour to see the dr. beisbroeck .
the office also failed to even apologize about this whole horrific experience .
i re-explained the situation and said that i was frustrated about my whole experience .
if i could give them zero stars i would !
yep this practice is horrible .
always wait 30 minutes past appt time , constant turnover .
front staff is clueless , never follow up .
weeks to get referrals , etc .
run do n't walk away from this place .
i do n't recall ever getting a prescription filled on time by this pharmacy .
every time you call , it 's a different a excuse .
i had cool sculpting done without results .
i 'm 5 ' 3 and 124 at the start of the treatment .
sadly i see no results now 4 mths out .
i wish they would have said i would n't see results at the consultation .
the lack of results has made me depressed .
it was an extremely expensive $ 1200 lesson on body exceptance .
i 'm not perfect but i 'm pretty damn lucky to look this way .
also ... .thank goodness high waisted jeans are in fashion
in hindsight i 'm kicking myself for not driving elsewhere .
a few weeks down the road however , the pain was back .
so i call them back .
i went in for my appointment and everything actually went amazingly smoothly .
they told me the only part my insurance does n't cover is $ 154 .
all is good right ?
nope , sorry , your insurance did n't pay .
okay ... so i call my insurance company .
so i call the dentist office back and explain this to them .
`` well , do you want to get paid or not ? ''
well , they failed to put most of their info on it .
in the meantime the jerks try to send me to collections .
they send me nasty letters in the mail about every two weeks .
every time i call and they deny sending anything .
i have the freaking letter in my hand !
bottom line , do not ever go here to get anything done .
their front desk and billing staff are horrible .
the x-ray tech was really nice .
it took forever to book a family doctor .
i went in for a couple of times for walk in .
i was pretty upset with that visit .
but i am willing to give it second try .
i was surprise they did n't tell me when i booked my appointment .
i suppose this is not the first time it happened .
and this only means i have to wait however long to book another appointment .
also i never get a call back for an alternative arrangement .
i do n't argue further guess it 's not a good fit for me .
not at all impressed with the gilbert office on mercy .
not kid friendly or cozy environment- especially waiting room .
md mckenna not touchy feeling ( maybe a bad day ? )
and made us wait 25 min in the room until she came in .
then spent under 10 min with us .
chandler office is a better environment .
np was very helpful and nice .
a lot better service and attention .
these 5 star reviews have to be fake .
i found bow valley massage online and thought i 'd give them a try .
my massage was with a lady named linda .
what i got was a very light massage with her elbows only .
i do n't think her hands ever touched me .
i will not be returning .
their webste evn advertises lower than emergency tom costs .
i went twice with my sin and paid 160.00 more than i planned .
do not go here to save $ $ $ $ $
the worst women 's healthcare you will ever receive .
i will never return to this women 's `` healthcare '' facility .
i was incredibly disappointed with this place .
it was so ... wrong .
i did n't but i did want to get out of there fast .
i will continue driving to my favorite place on the westside .
it 's cheaper too .
seriously misled ... 4 stars ?
very disappointing visit for pch .
we have never had a bad experience with them until last night .
the lack of communication and organization was sad .
all the while my son does not even have a diaper covering him .
the school itself , is another story .
the plumbing was always out of order .
water was flooding the hallway and classes had to be cancelled several times .
i do not know if it has been fixed since i 've been there .
we got yelled at that it was not professional .
of course i do n't look like it .
but that was n't allowed .
our lab had freezing water as well .
the bullying was horrible .
so much for their no tolerance on bullying .
i never thought too much about which dentist i go to .
unfortunately , i needed a deep cleaning .
i was quoted a certain price after they looked at my insurance .
i 'm just out of college and a public school teacher .
i could not afford this !
the actual dentist was an absolute jerk to me .
basically insulting my intelligence !
the dental hygienist actually apologized for him !
she was professional , thorough , and extremely nice !
she was the only reason i stayed as long as i had .
i do n't understand what the motivation is for this .
she demanded i pay full price and ca n't use the voucher .
something came up and i asked to reschedule .
she refused to let me reschedule .
i 'm sorry i could n't make it .
this was such an unprofessional experience and just wasted $ 139 .
the procedure took all of 2 minutes .
felt like was behind a curtain in in emergency room .
the photos on yelp and the web site are deceiving .
the video was taken someplace else .
could n't do much with my feet in a bucket .
some people like this deep stuff , but not me .
next i was escorted to another room with curtains for a body message .
they were under towels but it was too awkward for my taste .
i felt like i was walking through the men 's room to leave .
i wo n't be returning .
horribly disorganized place , do n't even bother !
complete lack of customer service .
mind you they still have 15 minutes before the store closes .
never again will i go to massage envy at rock springs .
the service has really gone downhill .
all the good therapists have left .
trying out boca park next week .
happened to you ? ? ?
i hope you got a restraining order against him ' ... type of shiner .
my eye was/is literally black .
and my face wo n't move to this there is no excuse .
there was also no follow up call as was promised .
on the up side .
the facility was clean and cherry .
the front staff very nice .
dr t ... . forgive me ... .. i strayed ... ...
my first appointment was great !
i left feeling very optimistic and excited to finally be rid of my allergies .
complete waste of time and i ended up late to work .
really makes me feel cared about .
one of my concerns is that i 'm dealing with depression .
for the month i was on it , the results were great .
as a result , i am now looking for a new medical office .
i waited for the doctor for an hour and 45 minutes .
they always seem to run behind .
parking is horrendous too .
i never want to go back .
how can i rate them 0 ?
they 're greedy and do n't listen to me .
i 've switched psychiatrists with no hope .
i 've been misdiagnosed for years as well .
how many people have they killed ?
do n't expect to be seen anytime near your appointment .
thought i could drop in on my lunch .
do n't , do n't , do n't go here !
especially an 1 1/2 hours before they close !
avoid this place ! !
i do n't recommend coming here .
i waited almost an hour after my appointment and still was n't helped .
dr. lokey was rude and condescending .
she made snide remarks on multiple occasions .
our family and our friends have since changed and are much happier .
save your time if planning to donate goods .
i called them ... they give an all day window for pick-up..great !
next , driver shows up and takes out a branch on my tree..wonderful .
now they start to examine and cherry pick what they want .
none of this was worthless junk mind you .
do n't waste your time with this chapter in cleveland .
call goodwill ... they 're helpful and grateful for donations .
this office is terrible .
i was in the hospital and saw a dr from this group .
i was told to schedule a stress test when i was released .
well that was impossible .
so i left without scheduling .
do you know what 's slower and more inefficient than calgary laboratory services ?
very , very disappointing service .
i went last fall for a teeth cleaning .
today i went in for a teeth cleaning that i scheduled 4 weeks ago .
i never got a phone call , email or text from them .
now it 's too late to schedule anywhere else .
i 'm very disappointed in the lack of professionalism .
i 'll be choosing a more reliable dentist from now on .
that 's where the positives end .
i went there for a skin check by the doctor .
she performed cryosurgery , which has left a noticeable scar on my face .
i wo n't be going back .
this is the worst office i have been to .
be aware if you are on medicaid , they are the worst mco ever .
you will end up paying cash for every doctor you see .
whatever doctor we find on their list tells us to pay our own bill .
it happened every time .
avoid them ! ! !
once you pick them , your nightmare will never end ! !
i ca n't believe i have to give at least a star ! !
this should be a negative star place ! ! !
i just got out not even 5 minutes ago .
then we wait for the doctor to come right , ? like usual .
by this time its maybe 3:40pm .
these kids are 12 6 7 4 and just got out of school .
there hungry and cranky !
and i have other things to do .
im sorry but i got other things to do and feed my kids .
then the doctor was only in there for less than 5 minutes .
if i could give this place a zero i would ! ! ! !
i went there one time .
er wait time was 5 hours .
spent a total of 16 hours in er ... staff extremely rude
it was like it wasnt the same doctor .
edit- they tried to fix the situation with a free massage .
i have yet to receive that massage .
i called my doctor to refer me somewhere else , never this place again .
soooo that pretty much means there is a bi-annual admin fee charged .
awful communication between staff , security , and visitors .
again , i had problems with security .
i explained i did n't have a vehicle to lock them up in .
they told me they do n't hold those items at the desk .
they scanned me with a wand and i went through .
the nurse explained it was okay .
30 minutes later while visiting security asks `` what 's in your pocket ? ''
i told him `` my wallet . ''
so i ask security `` why did the e.r say that i could ? ''
a female security guard asks `` who told you that ? ''
i told her `` you did . ''
because she was in the lobby when i first arrived with another security personal .
i gave her my wallet and told them they need better communication between staff/visitors .
he worked himself up during an outburst into an asthma attack .
i told her needed treatment , a nubulizer , an inhaler or something .
ca n't you see he 's having an asthma attack ? !
can you get someone ? !
he ca n't breathe ! ''
the doctor decided to do an x-ray on his lungs .
i am changing my review .
i still think dr. cotton is great with kids chairside .
first , they insisted that my daughter have nitrous oxide for sealants .
the cdc and the ada were at odds with this last i checked .
it causes fluorosis , and even the ada recognizes this .
to be clear , i 'm not anti-fluoride .
my kids get fluoride treatments , and i 'm ok with that .
agree with her , or disagree .
we were running a few minutes late for our appointment .
nine minutes to be exact , as i pulled into the parking spot outside .
two hours on the road was totally out of the question .
i was scheduled at 11:30 , and lunch apparently begins at noon .
i told her we 'd be finding a new dentist instead .
first off , it was nine minutes .
i 'm thinking they 'd have a pretty empty schedule .
running a practice is n't just about what happens in the treatment room .
did the 60 minutes foot massage .
not only it was the worst massage ever .
it was the most ridiculous experience ever .
the masseuse demanded a 30 % gratuity .
i have never heard such a thing .
lots of bells and whistles , not all necessary .
all the x-rays and photos of my teeth took forever and were torture .
my cleaning was pretty painful .
they were very careful and sweet w my son .
i do n't feel what they prescribed was necessary .
my husband had a horrible experience w them so we wo n't be back .
it 's time to change doctors .
my mother uses this doctor .
i think i will be reporting them .
this is not the only issue i have with this place .
the dentist , dr. kim blanding has no business being a dentist .
my so called well woman exam was a joke .
no introduction no pleasantries .
he gave me a breast exam and that 's it .
i would never recommend this doctor .
here is how my office visit went down .
arrived and filled out their paperwork .
one page asked all the usual medical questions .
office worker called me into a room .
took my contact lenses out - we ran some tests .
i am in an eye doctors office - right ?
i go into another room and run through the eye chart - lens tests .
then they dilate my pupils .
i sit in the waiting area -not too long .
go back into other room - dr runs more tests .
then they bring me back into the first room for another test .
she says - ok then you do n't need to take this test .
i tell them again - i ca n't see anything .
they said - oh - you are done with your exam .
can i put my contacts back in ?
the doctor came out and explained everything to me .
i paid and left .
i ended up buying them online for about $ 80 total .
i also had to call 2x to get them to fax me my prescription .
outrageous billing , especially considering service i received was just horrible .
i would not recommend going to them at all .
so why are they using this as a method to diagnose the problem ?
i have given this facility three tries .
first time was a 3 hour wait .
it was busy , so understandable that it could be that long .
but i could n't help but feel there was an extreme lack of urgency .
staff was ok. not bad , not great .
4 freaking hours of waiting till i saw a doctor .
while they were apologetic , it does n't excuse the experience .
my third and final visit is simply , my last .
what in the hell is going on at this place ?
it 's not some run down , pop up urgent care .
one tip for this place ... set better expectations with your patients .
update-i am still trying to resolve incorrect billing issues from 8 months ago .
the phone number is out of order .
no other information listed for another number .
waiting for a reply from groupon customer service .
the food is somewhat average .
black bean burrito was a 2/10 .
quinoa onion rings are pretty delish and the deserts are to die for .
this place made me feel like i was at the dmv !
they take their sweet time with their costumers sitting behind their desk .
they do n't even have a big selection to choose from !
well let me tell you !
do n't believe me ?
then go to pearl vision to compare the cost .
avoid this location at all cost !
staff is rude , inconsiderate , loses paperwork , very unprofessional !
there are several locations in town , visit another one !
this place will and has always reminded me of a used car lot .
it 's a franchise and the receptionists are friendly , fake and inexperienced .
not sure i will return !
i visited this urgent care in july of 2014 for dehydration .
i asked for a saline iv drip and the pa agreed .
i would not recommend this urgent care for anything beyond a prescription fill .
he then forgets to put my points for the two smoothies as well .
i 'll make sure not to come in when he 's there .
i honestly do n't even need to write a review .
just look at the ones already written .
completely speaks for itself .
i could n't understand one word the in-take person said at the counter .
please put someone at the counter customers can understand .
just tell everyone they need an appointment .
they just took people as they came in for appointments .
this place is terrible .
i work on the same industry i never seen an unorganized health facility .
high end optical store .
they did not understand my insurance benefits .
i am only giving one star because i ca n't give zero stars .
i did not put the iv in my arm !
plan on waiting 45 minutes even with an appointment booked in advance .
i got my nexplanon implant removed $ 234 .
i also got the depo shot $ 89 .
so why did they charge me $ 383 instead of $ 323 ? !
you knew i was getting both services from the beginning !
i was told 3 different times that it would be $ 323 !
i even asked when making my appointment if there was any other fees !
i would of just got the mirena if that is the case !
i think it is under new management .
was looking for a new pcp .
this is n't the place .
was early for appointment and had to wait over an hour .
front desk staff and intake staff friendly .
physician ( janet pragit ) was awful !
i needed prescription refills and brought in my old prescriptions .
then she proceeded to write one of my prescriptions for 2x/wk instead of 2x/mo .
they then billed my insurance company $ 370.02 !
if you value your health - stay away !
do not go here !
dr. robi burns was the most uncompassionate doctor i have ever dealt with .
not impressed with office at all .
it 's more like a free clinic than a doctors office .
transferred me to a another line .
i do n't have time for all of that , not returning .
secondly , they do n't do substitutions .
is n't the vegetarian mentality to love animals and eachother ?
or is the hippy kitchen staff too stoned to handle a distinction like that ?
the only thing fresh truly has to offer is the coolness factor .
love terry and dr tummala but have had recent issues with office staff .
i recently changed insurance plans and called to ask if they accepted my insurance .
i was told they did and scheduled my appt .
they never called my insurance and will not take responsibility for their mistake .
this practice looks down on mothers .
dr. scott firczak has no kids .
he compares raising his dogs to raising children .
he insults those that sacrifice so much .
there are tons of good chiropractors out there .
on another note : the parking lot is awful !
came to vegas last weekend to enjoy time off .
we bought the $ 29 figures it would a better deal .
there was no back massage like other places ive been too .
the worst part of themassage was on my feet .
i got 30 minutes of barely good massage and a foot massage to remember .
maybe next time i will pay regular price instead of using groupon .
you have been warned .
i 've been a patient of dr. wyse for several years .
there are some rare services or individuals that are worth the extra wait .
this , unfortunately , is not one of them .
such a big carrier with a huge number of subscribers is not accepted ?
i 'm sure they 've got their reasons but i 'm really disappointed !
the facililty was very clean and orderly .
i honestly do n't think the dentist knows what she 's doing with invisalign .
i 'm sorry , i just have to be honest .
i compared my teeth now versus before , sadly it is too late .
please save yourself the heartache of a bad outcome and go to another dentist .
i went because i was having a rapid heartbeat .
they saw me and determined it was n't an emergency .
really ? ? ? ?
they could n't have told me that at the beginning ?
i could have gone elsewhere .
anyway , the entire visit was $ 15,000+ .
it 's nothing but pure legal robbery .
they should be ashamed of themselves .
soup is rarely fresh .
seems like it has sat there for a while .
there was no one to help either .
will i be whole after i eat food from whole foods ?
she actually never said `` hello '' and never smiled .
ca n't say this was a good experience and i wo n't be back .
look for a doctor who thoroughly explains what she is doing and why .
i expected better quality of service during my visit but was very disappointed .
first problem is price .
you will be paying the highest prices anywhere .
dentists do n't last long here .
we were here two years and are working on our third dentist .
3rd problem : scheduling .
appointments are constantly cancelled and rescheduled weeks out .
i was trying to get my son 's treatment completed since march .
i also complained and requested that dr mugelsten ( the owner ) contact me .
not a big deal or red flag .
i said politely , `` to make an appointment . ''
she hung up on me .
they took my number and nothing ever happened .
at 4:00pm took my dog to stonecrest animal hospital .
we got in right away and the staff/doctor were awesome !
we had no issues !
hope my experience is a single , isolated incident .
i feel like a number here and have decided to go some where else .
i highly do not recommend this place .
do n't let yourself fall by all the toys they have in the clinic .
looks can be deceiving .
do n't trust this company/location .
no issues what so ever .
who does that ? ? ?
ironic i think not .
always get a second opinion ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
and preferably by someone who is not a scam artist .
i purchased a cartridge and two dab buckets ( bogo ) .
i drove back to the store with the hope of simply exchanging the cartridge .
not to mention , why does my 14 day allowance matter ?
all in front of an audience of people .
i 'm so embarrassed ...
all dr. hopkins does is sit in his office and collect his paycheck .
i even contacted the college of physicians and surgeons to file a complaint .
find a different doctor .
you deserve to have your health concerns addressed .
i called my insurance company & they verified everything on my card was correct .
they helped every single person who came through prior to getting my stuff done .
if you have a choice , steer clear of this gym turned frat house .
the only thing going for this gym is its location .
real attitude problems amongst its staff members .
you might even catch them talking behind your back right in front of you .
life is too short to be a wynn fitness member !
go at your own risk
the absolute worse pedicure i have every gotten - especially for $ 35 .
the gal actually cut my large toe by too aggressively using the callus pumas .
four days later it is finally healing .
pay the extra and go to one of the hotel spas .
this place is a no go .
when are day shift working relatives supposed to see patients ?
calloused and arbitrary much , are we ?
i ran fast after one initial visit .
and not let me stay with him .
i switched to boyne and she did n't even use laughing gas !
( and let me stay with him . )
she used her great bedside manner to put him at ease and distract him .
harder work than the easy way out of sedating .
food came out barely warm and mediocre .
it is vegetarian and vegan friendly but skip it if you have other options .
there is no dialog with her .
she barely listens and then tells you to let her talk .
my concern about side effects i am experiencing totally brushed aside .
she talked at me for most of appointment and barely let me talk .
if your looking for a good school to better your self run !
i went to this school in 2010 and it was very unprofessional .
so here i am with 6000 dollars in deat and no degree .
burst fracture of my l1 3 weeks ago .
had major back surgery and was told that hanger was `` world-class '' .
well not quite sure who made that decision for the `` world-class '' part .
brace was improperly delivered to me at the hospital .
it did n't fit properly and they sent someone to `` fix '' it .
then tells me `` appointments take two weeks '' .
i would never recommend hanger to anyone .
poor quality , poor attitude , and terrible service .
i visited pearl med spa because i received a coupon for a free facial .
when it was time to pay they charged me $ 12.99 plus tax .
$ 14 for a damn glass of juice ! !
also the daves killer bread is almost $ 2 more than frys .
bathrooms always have lavender soap .
at this point if yelp would let me put no stars i would !
this place is horrible ! ! !
which you would think is great right ?
i mean this is so unbelievable avoid at all costs .
these people are awful !
the company is run like uber or lyft without the professional service .
the drivers use their own private vehicles .
unethical , unprofessional , and unreliable .
stay away ! ! ! ! !
apparently they were on lunch break and never communicated this to us .
very unprofessional and will never recommend this office !
i have a love/hate relationship with the ubiquitous wal-mart .
and the prices are usually decent .
this was a bad move on their part !
my most recent bad experience there was recent .
beware on returning products ! ! ! !
a few months ago , i purchased an item at the fashion show mall .
i did n't like the product .
the manager or owner was so rude ! ! ! !
he got mad because i bought the item at fs mall .
he told me i should go to fs mall to return it .
i got there right when it opened .
buyer beware ! ! ! !
hopefully you will never have to return anything you buy here ! ! ! !
i will not be returning to this location !
the manager working on friday night 4/18/14 was very rude ! !
i had just given the coupon and knew it was in her register .
i then asked for a manager .
i said that is wrong .
most cashiers return your manufacture coupon if it is right in their register .
he then just walked away from me and did not resolve the problem .
later , i called the cvs i usually go to .
be careful about this when you are shopping in this store ! !
i found them to be rude , no bed side manners at all .
i do n't recommend this doctor or the staff .
i wanted to leave their immediately .
i was told sign the clip board and to take a seat .
i did n't get my paperwork until 8:20am and it was 6 pages long .
really frustrated by this time .
3 different people by this time ! ! !
and the third and final person once again ask me about xrays again .
can i say lost of communication again ... grrr !
the massage was excellent and my masseuse was amazing ! !
it was the `` manager '' my friends and i had a problem with .
i told him i already tipped and my masseuse nodded in agreement .
if that was the case , the tip was still within their expected range .
went there for a second opinion and what a shock .
that 's nearly $ 16,000 worth of work .
wanted to get it done within 1-2 weeks .
he does have lots of fancy equipment .
her immediate response was `` do you want to leave now ?
i have been with her for 3-4 years .
she was obviously peeved at getting feedback from a lowly customer .
waited over an hour and a half with 4 people in front of me .
receptionist was nice but that 's all .
no urgency with my 103 degree fever and chills .
i have seen dr. maduka and some of the physician assistants .
he has helped me so much with all of my pain problems .
so today , i went into the office to do so .
mercedes at the urgent care front desk was extremely rude and unprofessional .
she told me she would not even so much as show me my results .
she said she did n't care because she ca n't find them anyways .
so unprofessional and annoying .
total wait time in the lobby was about an hour .
( did not put me at ease .
he did n't really seem to take in what i was saying .
and based off asking me my previous experience just prescribed me something similar ?
not sure if i was properly helped like i could have been .
i wo n't be coming back to this location .
this place is so expensive .
which ended up cutting way too close to my wedding date .
this place is more affordable than others , but not good quality work .
i usually crack 6-7 , of 8 attempts elsewhere
ive been a patient for over 15 years .
i made an appointment for today .
when i woke up this morning our apt .
and then my phone service was also down .
and that i also was out of blood pressure meds .
weve had nothing but damaging storms where i live .
i have no control over this .
ive been a loyal patient for 15 years .
it really hurts my feelings .
for fifteen years ive always kept my appointments .
of course there have been times when circumstances have made me call to reschedule .
my sister has cancer .
no one to help her .
i dont know , why did they get upset .
they make me feel belittled .
and that im a bad person .
thats really sad after 15 years with dr. vasireddy .
long waits even when slow !
was at er for over three hours and there were two people there .
watched a full shift change .
it was a painful procedure and my veins are still clearly obvious .
see the pictures in my review and read about what happened .
they then had a collections agency double the bill with service fees .
and that 's legal ? !
that is where our power over the institution remains .
i told them that they were kidding , right ?
she was my my primary physician .
any time i mentioned anything , i was thoroughly tested for it .
she would do these shots for me and knew my history .
it was completely humiliating for me .
then i received that $ 700 bill in the mail .
besides being treated crappy , her billing was always wrong .
always being over billed and double billed .
all the things in all the other reviews are true .
she is all about the money and prestige and fame , all ego .
she will unnecessarily test you to make that insurance money .
i guess i will update my post when my daughters glasses are finally received .
this store really lacks selection .
this was an aggravating experience and we never stepped foot into an office .
could not get an appointment scheduled sooner than a month later .
and he 's decided he only wants to work three days a week .
working in community behavioral health myself , i understand the frustrations of staffing issues .
but that is n't actually what 's happening .
this place is a falsely advertised urgent care facility .
i went in for the flu .
i am going to fight this if i can because this is ridiculous !
i am looking into asking my regular dr. to refer me to someone else .
the shit hit the fan , whoop .
then she says `` so , what did we do ?
what treatment did we take ? ''
-read/review your patients chart before you open your mouth .
otherwise , people start to lose confidence in whatever comes out of your mouth .
i do n't heart you , i do n't even like you .
super expensive for honestly no service .
my therapist geriann was amazing !
perfect pressure where needed very professional and attentive to my needs .
my anxiety was rising and the massage efforts were fading .
i had some mango smoothie here .
it tasted nothing like mango .
it may have made my experience a bit better .
another girl prepared the drinks .
`` you 're welcome ! ''
that you expect as a norm from any customer service position .
kinda warm in there too .
i would never stop by in the summer to cool off .
in short : do n't come here .
first i heard of it so i was alil irritated .
i have never met such an incompetent family practice .
avoid this place at all costs .
she seems to know what she is talking about and is well learned .
but these are the only things good about this place .
my family met with dr. sparks once .
we had to wait over 2 months for an appointment .
after waiting that long , one would think they would get some individual attention .
that 's a negative .
dr. sparks did not take any interested in either my wife or i personally .
she was unable to take time for us on any occasion .
instead , we had to meet with a new doctor hired by dr. sparks .
both times , we had to wait over 45 minutes to see the doctor .
this is completely unacceptable .
we made freaking appointments .
showed up at least 10 minutes early .
then had to wait 45 minutes until we were able to see a doctor .
there is no universe that this is acceptable .
this practice has so many operational issues , not to mention priority problems .
this was my first time at massage envy .
translation , not a sketchy massage parlor .
the introductory price was another bonus .
you could tell the masseuse was fairly inexperienced .
the massage was pretty generic .
i probably would n't return .
be prepared for the member spew when trying to pay for the one visit .
decent prices , but very disorganized .
i got 3 different methods on how to treat a nail removal .
appointment was at 2pm .
it took them 55 minutes for a dentist to see me .
45 of those spent in the lobby waiting area .
irritated that i wasted 2 hours of my saturday here .
i wo n't be back .
claimed my daughter had cavities upon a 2nd review proved she did not .
we will never go back there again .
this doctor is a complete crook .
not only was she late to the appt , she did nothing .
my primary dr refered me here after an abnormal pap .
talk about unprofessional ! ! !
so i got no pap , nothing but a bill for 100 !
i wasted my insurance here .
i have none left .
i thought this appt was about my body ?
do not go here shes so unprofessional .
there are plenty of other obs in the valley who are more attentive .
i do not recommend this place to anyone ! !
then his glasses broke in half while he was trying on glasses there .
`` but your ad right here says you offer 1 hour service ! ''
she would n't even check to see if the frames are in stock .
completely lack of customer service .
other salespeople are just standing there .
i go to the back to wait for my husband to get done .
doc is not rude , just apathetic .
no apology for poor customer service .
while my husband is finishing up his dilation , i start to google .
found a nearby lenscrafters , called them , they had the lens in stock .
we jet over there , one hour later , my husband has his glasses .
better frames , decent service and a decent price .
there was no excuse .
went in on a monday , and the doctor wrote me a prescription .
i 'm told the doctor needs to see my insurance formulary .
so i take it there , and am told they will call me back .
and i 'm told they 'll call me back .
do not use this place .
i made my final purchase there .
customer service is not their strength .
the day prior to his appointment my sister receive a call stating the appt .
when i arrived i was told my appt .
was at 10. which now push me back and made me late for work .
i was advised by receptionist that fitting if a crown would not take long .
it 's been over 2.0 hour .
unbelievable ... .. horrible service .
i 'll be taking my brother somewhere else ... , stay away .
the waiting room chairs are disgusting .
i go to the office on teneya .
i was n't told by his offfice i would be seeing a nurse practitioner .
even their answering machine is rude .
i see the p.a .
she has given me new outlook on life .
if she leaves i will not go back .
no letter , text , or phone call .
14 months , seriously ! !
i never regretted being to any doctors office before .
there is an elder lady right now who is having issue finding her paper .
there is 1 and 3 but no 2. what a joke !
negligent and irresponsible staff ! !
have already reported and filed complaints to allergan and the arizona naturopathic doctors .
frozen is a movie ... not what i asked for .
plus my eyebrows are uneven .
sleazy sales pitch after sleazy sales pitch .
am i at a medspa or a dirty used car lot ?
over priced membership package ?
more botox ? ! ? !
are you serious ? !
should have walked out then .
outdoor sign says botox $ 9/unit .
tried to charge me $ 14/unit .
complained to owner , she said staff would reach out and apologize .
ca n't teach class .
doctor 's here are good .
but they make schedule for their doctors overlapped in-between patients .
no enough time in-between patients for doctor 's to breath .
another you have to wait for a long period of time to your appointment .
they have a horrible answering service ! ! !
it just keeps on ringing
i am never coming back here again .
i arrived more than 10 minutes early for my appointment .
i had to leave because i had other affairs .
i will never come back .
rude horrible service do n't come here ! ! ! !
i arrived shortly before my scheduled appointment .
the waiting room was jammed packed .
i was not happy with the hour+ long wait i experienced .
i took that opportunity to ask what the hold-up was .
i was pleasant when asking , not rude .
dr. kim 's pa rushed through my exam .
specific questions i wanted to ask were left unanswered because of the hurried pace .
i will be returning to my former doctor for my next screening .
however , this visit was a waste of my time .
i 'm a paying customer/patient .
spectrum 's administrative staff needs lessons in courtesy and organization .
when i got the receipt , it said $ 75 .
well , this is my very first comment on yelp .
i went to this location today .
me and my boyfriend wait there for 20 mins with no one come .
i go every month to labcorp for my blood test .
here i did one blood test and well the picture speaks louder than words .
note im a pretty happy camper with mostly 5 stars kind of guy .
this doctor was horrible .
i would give zero stars if possible .
my second visit just got worse .
she had no compassion during a time of loss .
to be told what i already thought i knew .
thus prolonging my torment .
my interaction just went down hill from there .
she then did not follow the comment up with a reason ! !
because she clearly did n't know `` why '' herself .
i had to see her weeks later in order to have surgery .
she would not release me to see another doctor prior to the surgery .
in the end she suggested i find another doctor !
are you freaking kidding me ?
as if i would ever allow her to handle my medical care again .
i found this place on group-on .
the voucher cost $ 39 for a 60-minute massage with an insurance receipt .
had to call multiple times .
answering machine comes on , but does n't allow you to leave a message .
i was a little annoyed because i had informed them i had a group-on .
it was their duty to ask if i needed a receipt .
i did n't know that they had multiple group-ons !
c. the place was filthy .
i admit that it 's winter and we all get muck on our shoes .
but the floors were disgusting !
d. i was shown into a room .
and what do you know , a male therapist walks in !
i am a woman .
i am not comfortable with male therapists .
so i proceeded to have the most awkward massage of my life .
he kept telling me to relax my muscles , but how could i !
i was so uncomfortable !
to give him credit , he did keep most of my body covered .
i asked him only to do my upper back , neck and legs .
he did a decent job .
overall , i kept getting a creepy feeling about this place .
my husband was laughing when i told him about my experience !
i would not recommend this place for a woman for sure .
this was my first experience .
however , that was a huge mistake .
i later emailed the pa to get the results .
they billed me and would not discuss it ?
but md24 is a really lousy choice in my experience .
this was the weirdest couples massage ever .
the massage itself was good i guess .
the atmosphere and everything else was like something from the twilight zone .
the employees at the front are so unprofessional .
they were arguing loudly in front of us while we waited for our appointment .
he barely looked at me .
the glasses arm was broken .
so , not professional looking .
i got wired up for the weekend long test .
the tech who did it was nice .
gave me different info than i was told later .
i had some nurse that spoke to me like an auctioneer , no kidding .
i got nowhere with this place .
removal is defined as eliminating .
after nine treatments , i still have hair .
i would no longer need to shave or wax .
that is not the case .
the goal of ideal image is to remove 80 % of hair .
however , that is not stated in the contract .
should n't the lifetime membership kick in years later after the last treatment ?
if you want all of your hair removed then continue looking for another company .
try your local dermatologist office .
he showed me imperfections in my bite , etc .
finally , it clicked that they were recommending this for a completely different issue .
so finally , they sent me back and they executed the cementing quickly .
they never once checked my bite to verify before letting me go , either .
they are only in business because they very obviously cater to children .
i can not in good conscience even rate at one star .
this office has very few good points in their favor .
no one answers the phone , the reception person is beyond rude !
we will be taking our business elsewhere .
find ? ? ! !
if i could give no stars i would .
sad because this is the first negative review i 've written smh .
following the apple-green awning to this fresh lively waiting room .
there are many reasons to go to a dermatologist - mine ?
after chatting about my little dot we decided i needed it zapped .
i passed on the biopsy knowing the risks but taking them on anyways .
it will reduce the dot but could take a month .
so why two stars ?
is this priceness due to the convenience of uptown ?
if i need more treatments , i will definitely price out other locations first .
my vet recommended this pharmacy and they seemed ok at first .
you had to call in and place the prescription and they were very nice .
when i went to refill , i waited like 2 weeks and got nothing .
i tried contacting them through their website as it is difficult to call sometimes .
what was the point of putting my credit card info on their website ?
well , i went to their website and put in the refill .
so i sent them an email through their webiste ... again ... .nothing .
well , its been almost a week and still no drops for my dog .
that was 2 months ago .
i think this will be my last order .
1st time , shame on you , 2nd time - shame on me .
that 's a rip off ! ! ! !
and hey ! ! !
the time starts when you are undressed and in the bed ready for massage .
it 's a whole hour ! ! !
i felt like he was pulling my teeth out .
i called and cancelled my next appointment .
i have never had a bruise from going to the dentist !
i only had x-rays done and 3 cavities filled ! !
i will not be returning to them or recommending them to anyone !
i would not recommend this office to anyone .
this office is not honest .
i went there for a routine eye check up .
i showed my id and insurance card .
just told me after the service is done .
i could have gone somewhere where i 'm covered .
they just wanted my money .
it does n't matter if i signed a financial responsibility .
worse pharmacy in belmont .
customer service = nonexistent .
i highly recommend the walgreens right across the street .
the ladies in there did n't have respect for customers .
they kept giggling and talking to each other .
the girl that i had was veryy lazy about the massage .
there was no pressure , as if she was just touching/ rubbing my skin .
just a waste of time and money..
i told them no , but i was calling in about it .
so , yeah -- all extremely important to an extremely ill cat .
end of that week -- still no meds .
overnight shipping on a friday night ?
guess what -- i 've never heard back from them .
big time fails through this whole process and zero contact from them .
i will absolutely never use them again after this .
oh -- and just as an update .
nothing is our fault . ''
great customer service road runner .
what a crappy uncaring company you are .
you should be ashamed .
would give zero stars if possible .
called my insurance and they told me office claimed me for a deficiency .
no call or anything .
also they sent me to the wrong place ( twice ! )
do n't waste your time and money on this place .
this is plain crazy .
the pharmacist is trying very hard to help the customers .
the customer service of the front staff is horrible .
sorry but find another pharmacy .
i waited another 10 minutes after before being seen by the doctor .
the front desk call service is the worst .
the doctor experience was decent , however .
this dentist is a crook !
glad to see his office has closed !
i had only had one my entire life !
i moved out of gilbert and just went to a new dentist .
crazy enough he did n't find a single cavity ! ! !
i called and made an appointment on the 12th for 8:30 on the 21st .
that 's insane i thought !
i have never met the doctor .
i did n't know if they would be male or female .
the only response they gave is , `` it 's the doctors policy '' .
but , not for me .
we will never set foot in this place again !
charging seniors $ 4 for parking ?
why gouge and double dip against seniors on pension ?
dr.armagon is two faced and an insensitive person .
the manager alice needs an attitude adjustment .
we despise your success to the dismay of seniors hoping for compassion and care .
unacceptable ... avoid at all costs .
so i hoped for some improvement in the office procedures .
even the pt office had been watching for a referral .
so much for continuity of care !
i 'm unsure of how this man receives any positive reviews .
he may have prescribed me with useful medications , but he is horrible .
they feel their time is more valuable than ours .
the receptionist is awful .
she crossed her arms and zoned out when talking .
so glad my 30 days is done - never again !
so much to say about this place and not in a good way .
so the spa is located inside the hotel .
easy to find and right off the highway .
the ambiance and entrance of the spa is great .
the space is large and comfortable .
the room was also spacious and well laid out but it was cold .
i asked about the heating which i was told could not be adjusted .
i was offered an extra towel but i remained cold the entire service .
strange enough i noticed an electric fire place but it was never turned on .
i had a combination relaxation and hot stone massage from an esthetician named ruby .
her pressure techniques were strange and a bit unpredictable in a bad way .
i did n't feel like i could relax during the service .
i also felt like there was no practiced method or organization to the massage .
in addition she was using too much oil .
i felt like a fire hazard with the amount that was used .
unfortunately i do n't think i will be back .
the spa is out of my way and it did not meet my standards .
i went to a real dentist , and guess how many cavities i have ?
yup , that 's right , none at all .
i am horrified to think of all the people they have probably ripped off .
it really is hard to find a quality dentist that you can trust .
would not go back , not recommended .
dont believe the reviews .
the technicians do poor quality work here .
the salon is nice , the technicians suck !
a basic gel mani 2 hours and did n't even include a hand massage .
i had to repeatedly ask the technician to trim my cuticles back .
she argued with me on that too .
overall a f experience .
go anywhere but here !
jesmina shrestha , nurse practitioner seemed nice , but odd and nervous .
she had a tablet with someone over video transcribing the visit .
thankfully i got the labs done elsewhere and got my results online .
waste of money and wastw of time .
my hair is black and course and i dont have a hormonal imbalance .
that was a lie .
most of the staff of nice but not all .
since thet dont eant to help i will be making this a legal issue .
i do not recommend them ! ! !
trying to get an appointment at this place is near impossible .
their online system is a joke and the reception never answers the phone .
terrible manners and the receptionists are basically useless .
never coming back to this place .
i went back 15 min later and it was done and on the side .
i asked if anyone else could help and they said no .
honestly , i was just over it .
i paid for my $ 350 in groceries but will probably never go back .
this location needs to have a chat with their employees regarding customer service .
they do n't even deserve a 1 star .
jenelle in the front office is rude !
too bad her attitude shows lack of education .
what century is this ?
people at craft fairs accept credit cards .
drug dealers accept credit cards .
prostitutes accept credit cards .
what the hell is a `` discover card '' anyway ?
it 's like the american dream .
i tried this place out b/c it 's close to my house .
the massage was alright , not enough pressure for my liking but not terrible .
the reason for one star ?
$ 7 was nearly 20 % .
i was horrified that she would even ask such a thing .
i stated $ 7 was enough and left and i will never return !
health partners of nevada has the most unprofessional doctors .
dr. jasper liu is the most rudest doctor i have ever come across .
he has no people skills .
yelled at me like if i was a child .
he assume that i went to see him for my pain medication .
i told him that was not the reason why i was here for .
then he went on to say he wo n't be seeing me any further .
it 's the way he yelled at me .
i called for my refills and my pharmacy gave me meds .
from him last month .
whish was a shock for me .
how can anyone allow such a doctor to practice .
he is rude and very racist doctor .
i hope he loses his license as a doctor .
otherwise i would n't have put any !
okay so the foot massage was wonderful ... the back massage was terrible .
very disappointed in the dentist and staff at affordable dentures .
i had my mother go there because of the high ratings in yelp .
my mother explained she could n't t eat with bottom dentures .
they sent her home with no teeth .
elderly people need extra patience .
very very unhappy with this company .
this store must have the angriest employees i 've ever witnessed .
so miserable and unfriendly .
if looks could kill , well you get the point ... .
staff friendly but no matter how good , no excuse for waiting .
and i 've had about 10 appts over the past three years .
none were under three hour wait .
certainly do not care about the value of patient time .
today i had a 3:10 appt .
it is 5:40 and i 'm still in the waiting room .
i 'm very disappointed in this office .
had i known this policy prior , i would not have chosen this office .
dental practices have taken a serious downturn the past decade .
there is a lot of hard sell now and questionable practices .
i have several issues with hudec .
moreover , my teeth are just not prone to cavities .
so i setup an appointment for simple teeth cleaning and checkup .
this poses a problem because they do not divulge costs consistently .
make sure you know before you agree to anything .
i feel like the hygienist receives commission for procedures that she performs .
super deep cleaning which costs over $ 1000 .
i remember teeth cleanings used to be way more thorough .
i felt worse after the massage than i did going in .
i emailed solescape with this information/feedback on oct. 12 and they never responded .
this is honestly the worst dentist i have ever been to .
sure enough ca n't take it .
do not go here !
i ended up going to another dentist to fix that .
front staff very rude and lacking training .
my therapist was nice but massage was very robotic and repetitive .
lacks the spa environment .
horrible front desk and management .
if i owed this store i would fire all of them .
the massage therapists are amazing .
why was n't i called for the opening .
then , conveniently the manager was n't in again .
i was told to call back .
then , she said the manager was n't available .
it 's evident to me that the managers and receptionists need to be fired .
bad place to going dr goodman is not a good obgyn !
office told me they thought it had gone out but it had not .
he wrote the check for me it would be mailed today .
i thanked her for the update .
this tells me my patronage means nothing .
i would called my client immediately .
but that 's just me .
i do n't expect from others what i do n't expect from myself .
this is the worst place ever .
if you are injured , please do not bother to come here .
i split my elbow open while on vacation in las vegas .
unfortunately this was the first place we found .
there was no sense of urgency .
not even a little sympathy .
no one was bleeding or looked in pain .
after about 1 hour of waiting ( maybe longer ) .
i finally was put into a room to wait for the doctor .
i waited another 20 mins for him to arrive .
i was taken to another room to have the stitches done .
waiting another 30 mins .
waited another 45 mins .
please do not go here .
they trap you in a year long contract and wo n't let you cancel .
not worth the money .
i was sent to dr. cooper by my primary p.a .
i needed blood work to check my hormone levels .
i have been having a lot of health problems , so my p.a .
wanted me to have bio-identical hormone replacement therapy .
supposedly , dr. cooper was one of the few specialists who could help me .
well , dr. cooper refused to do anything .
i did n't just walk in off the street !
this is something my p.a .
she spoke to me as if she thought i was stupid .
i have never had a more unpleasant experience in a medical office .
if you value your time and mental health do not go to this practice .
the staff is absolutely incompetent .
the burger was tall and thick and difficult to eat .
there was a strong after taste of thyme that over powered the burger .
the fries were good though .
the kaleslaw was definitely interesting , and not in a bad way .
the concept is great but over priced and not executed well .
however , the wait for this place is ridiculous .
i was wrongly diagnosed by my urgent care doctor .
the entire interaction with the urgent care doctor was approximately two minutes or less .
a very long wait for such a short examination .
i would n't recommend this place if you can wait .
i only went because it seemed like an emergency .
i have not had any acknowledgement or response .
i can understand being busy , but honestly they have no excuse .
there was 1 person in front of me .
there were no patients besides myself & the other person .
this is n't the first time this has happened either .
it was someone else who was extremely rude over the phone .
she was talking to me as if i was stupid .
i am talking ? ! ! ''
i can not believe how disgusting this lady was .
i am never coming here ever again .
not to be treated like shit .
do not come here .
they are incompetent & disgusting .
extremely over priced , go to the spa for this price .
in my opinion , i really had high hopes for this place .
after another customer complained , they finally did something about it .
the menu was huge and i needed help navigating it .
whoa ! ! ! ! !
not what i want at all .
i ended up with a pounch burger sized shake and a huge bill .
it just did n't live up to the expectations .
maybe it was a fluke .
next time i am by , i will try again .
this is probably going to be my last visit here .
i disagreed with her .
as she was at this last appointment .
so , i declined and said that i was n't coming back .
which , really , i have no intention to return .
i will be taking my business else where .
i went in with a pain in my back upper molar .
they got me in quick which was awesome .
then i was scared into a extraction .
then i actually communicated with them about my problems with the price .
i miss my tooth and this is going to lead to problems .
looking into further action .
just know your expecting a 1+ hour wait !
check in process is slow !
would be nice if they had a sense of urgency with their guest .
last time at this location !
and third i did n't see his license on the wall ?
i do n't recommend it at all .
i decided to take my business elsewhere !
what a fucking joke !
are you fucking kidding me ?
than there was another women scheduled for 11:15 who also was waiting forever .
are you fucking kidding me ? !
my head feels like it 's going to explode .
my pain is n't just physical , it 's mental .
depression and migraines combined are literal hell .
i do n't want to live like this .
i just wanted help .
i left in tears .
both physical and emotional pain .
i ca n't handle this anymore .
what a fucking joke .
if i could give it no stars i would .
they market a birthday gift basket for uw students .
i confirmed that the order was received .
it was never delivered .
now i get my credit card bill and i 've been charged .
i really like dr. yu and the back office .
the front office fills me with such rage .
where do i even start ?
they most certainly did not .
the only phone call i got from them was confirming my appointment .
the very same 'coordinator ' that didnt return my calls for five weeks ? !
i figure at this point i had better just call the pharmacy myself .
the botox was never even ordered !
they did not even have my new insurance !
nobody from my drs office has even contacted them ! !
it appears to be absolutely nothing ! ! !
i love dr. yu but i am absolutely fed up with the front office .
so if you like spending thousands of dollars for nothing pay them a visit .
after one time management decided to revoke what they had promised .
not good business practice in my opinion .
ill be canceling soon .
i was basically told the same thing with no resolution .
the supervisor even apologized to me for not returning my call .
she said she was , ironically , out sick .
ok so let me first say that the massage was ok but not great .
massage tables are very hard and uncomfortable .
not to mention the lotion that used smelled like clay .
then two of the employees were fighting not even 10 feet from me .
but dr. kuty seemed to be concerned with your treatment plan .
will never bother stepping inside this place again .
bought a pair of sunglasses at saks .
i also offered to pay for their time .
the woman working there was super rude .
she complained i should take them to original store .
she insulted me and said the sunglasses were wrong size for my face .
she refused to adjust them .
i went to specs on queen st two days later .
super friendly and nice staff .
and way more helpful .
will def never go to owl again .
they were super friendly , down to earth , and helpful .
complete opposite service that i got at owl .
and owl 's choices of frames was pretty lame anyways .
on my street is another eyeglass store .
owner super helpful and also highly recommend .
horrible customer service at the front desk .
come to find out , they are not .
this place is only interested in robbing people of their money .
showed up for a massage that i booked .
i have filled out numerous pregnancy waivers and received massages .
extremely disappointed in this location .
just me , hubby , and our baby who was in carseat .
also fine , but after the whole experience every little detail sticks out unfortunately .
ordered a `` new mom '' smoothie & hub ordered a black coffee .
oh well we laughed it off .
food came shortly after ... that too was excellent .
small portions but very tasty .
no napkins or forks etc .
we had finger food but we would 've used a napkin .
i was done then .
pharmacy closes at 8:00 pm .
getting ready to move prescriptions someplace more reassuring and helpful .
dirty exterior and grounds too .
i 'd give this place zero stars if i could .
we were in town on vacation and i needed my nails done , stat .
found this place with , what looked like , great reviews .
the gentleman on the phone said , `` we have plenty people to help .
just come in , we 'll take care of you . ''
came in about 3:30pm on a tuesday to an empty salon .
two workers working on one client .
my mistake for not asking how long .
i picked my color and sat in the waiting area .
they were told the same thing .
maybe they were trying to make sure she was well taken care of .
they lost my service .
i do n't know if they ended up losing the other .
i do n't care .
huge waste of time .
pretty sure i just got ripped off .
there was no promotion and it was wildly expensive .
almost $ 6,000 for laser on my legs .
( i thought this was a corporate legit company .
so i did n't want to insult the manager by doing that ) .
i was suppose to notice a significant difference and i do n't .
my biggest mistake was not doing the research before the consultation .
i attempted to make an appointment online .
it stated someone would call me to confirm my appointment .
guess i 'll take my money elsewhere .
they are excellent -- at wasting time !
had to leave work early and drive across town .
they really did n't care .
they charge $ 50 for the first visit too .
the nurse kindly offered to contact banner hospice .
the hospice nurse was nice .
she said all the right things and i believe she was sincere .
i asked for a manager .
i spoke with the hospice nurse .
she did n't know why i needed to speak with her .
she had n't heard from the manager .
i had to keep after them and get it handled .
i do n't think so .
she 's not even awake at 6 am !
i , once again , called the banner health hospice manager .
i could n't convince banner health hospice that they made a mistake .
i called banner health hospice again and again .
they did n't want to deal with it .
i had to handle it .
i was lucky enough to be with her , holding her hand .
banner health hospice made a sad situation horrible and stressful .
in every situation , they made things worse .
letting others that just arrived go b4 me .
i do n't recommend u go here .
the people r friendly but now it 's like .
oh he has a purple folder so make him wait .
the customer service in this place is horrible .
brick and mortar chain druggist .
that being said they do occasionally have some decent specials/sales .
they have a $ 100 cancellation policy if you cancel less than 48 hours .
its too bad they want to lose patients over this : (
waited 1 hour and 50 minutes despite showing up 20 minutes early to appointment .
purchased a groupon for microdermabrasion .
( this is the yonge-eg location )
if i could give this zero stars i would .
he told me what i already knew did nothing to help .
waste of time and money .
i will never go back
seriously , your focal point is `` skin '' .
the phone rings and rings .
you can never get through to scheduling .
beware when using this service .
i got my teeth whitened over 2 months ago and they still hurt .
rethink using this service .
i had two visits with jaqueline .
the first visit was ok she seemed to care and offered ok advice .
the 2nd time not so much .
never coming back again .
abandon hope , all ye who enter here .
i have never had a good interaction with the staff here .
nothing is ever done in a timely manner .
doctors are okay , staff simply do n't care .
i felt like i was an animal at a vet clinic .
went in for my initial teeth cleaning after moving to this area .
dr. was not personal and busy with other things .
waited for 30 minutes to see the doctor .
they wanted to remove my gold fillings and replace them with porcelain .
i needed 2 root canals and had cavities inside recent fillings .
feeling a gut instinct , i did n't make another appointment .
before any work was complete or appointment made .
so very very disappointed in this dentistry .
if you decide to visit , get a second opinion .
i guarantee they have lied .
apparently the only person that had keys was about 30 minutes late .
the appointment did n't go that great either .
the technitian treated me like an idiot because i had questions ... never again .
two girls who we there could nearly speak few words english .
i read few good reviews about this place on yelp .
i went here because the doctor i was seeing supposedly had good reviews .
i wish i would have looked here before i wasted over two hours .
i handed the girl my paperwork and proceeded to wait for over an hour .
they finally pulled me back and forced me to answer questions about depression !
i left the room too and told them i was done with the appointment .
they just want to push antidepressants on everyone that comes in .
doctors like this should be ashamed of themselves .
i 've never had a cavity before , so 4 was quite the shock .
i declined filling and 6 months later went to a `` real '' dentist .
this dentist confirmed i did n't have a single cavity .
how the dc dental dentist could find 4 is beyond me .
you can find a better dentist , keep looking .
expect a 2-3 week turn around time on glasses .
they will not accept returns even if you deny the merchandise as unacceptable .
the staff and the whole system there is complete trash .
then i needed an extraction and they lost my referral and files .
how do you lose my files .
then today was the last straw .
i made an appointment for last week and they made me reschedule for today .
they did n't even call me to let me know or anything .
this place is complete trash .
to re-do my lashes .
at time of appt .
i was still charged a $ 40 difference for the volume set .
i did n't want to hassle and just happily paid the difference .
only hoping that this time around it would be done correctly .
david , kayu and staff are all very nice wonderful people .
so i 'm pretty much back at the same spot .
with the same problems as stated above only with longer lashes this time around .
in january , i went in for my annual appointment .
i asked for a couple of blood tests , a request that was accommodated .
apparently they expect their patients to have esp !
the exact same thing happened for the second appointment .
i called billing , got voice mail , and left a detailed message .
so , call the insurance company i did .
i received the bill from twhs in august .
i 'll be heading to another gyno to get better care .
the only reason i visit here is because my insurance forces me to .
some partnership bcbs has with cvs .
no benefit to the patrons in this area .
honestly , their service is n't much better .
the individuals up front are actually fairly pleasant .
i visit often enough to notice several changes in personnel .
i have to call my prescription in and speak to a tech or pharmacist .
to do that , i 'm often on hold more than 10 min .
the hold music is n't even interesting enough to bop along to .
just wish there was a way around using either cvs in my area .
both are poorly managed and just need an upgrade in all aspects .
make sure you get a second opinion .
tanya their dental assistant is great though .
i do n't even know where to start with this horrible unethical doctor .
i brought my son here because he was having seasonal allergies .
all of this they were able to decide without the help of the doctor .
my son has seasonal allergies not a rare disease only found in foreign counties .
how anyone gives this hell hole a good review is astonishing .
i stayed for 2 weeks and left .
the treatment is really bad ! !
they basically just the place is disorganized and just in total disarray !
nobody knows what is going on at this place , no one !
if you need anything , good luck !
very disappointed in the non-urgent care that this dr. did not provide to anyone .
btw ... this place was not busy at all .
true fail on behalf of this urgent care facility .
dr is great and very knowledgeable .
staff on the other hand is ridiculous ! ! !
when u get there that 's when they actually get shit ready .
`` hello , dr. linder 's office . ''
me : `` hello , i 'd like to schedule an appointment with dr .
have you ever seen dr. linder before ? ''
me : `` no , i have n't . ''
`` okay , what were you hoping to schedule an appointment for ? ''
dr. linder is not accepting any new patients at this time . ''
me : `` okay , so ...
however , the office staff is rude & not helpful .
even as checking in and they need to talk to me .
it was covered all along .
why would the do it this way ?
bigger profit always drives business practices .
just another reason we need single payer in usa .
i gave up after two weeks .
some shady billing/insurance issues going on .
this business has incompetent people working for them .
i canceled my yearly membership .
they charged my card 2 additional times .
i was told it was n't done .
they need to hire a manager who works regular hours or more competent people .
stay away and go somewhere else , it 's just not worth the effort .
if you love your child do n't take him or her here .
i received a letter from the state saying 4 shots behind .
i go in at 1pm for appointment and left at 2:30 without being seen .
doctor was not even in the building .
he was at lunch .
why the @ & $ ?
i got a call from them two weeks later stating my payment was late .
i advised them i cancelled and the girl said she would look into it .
i got a call two weeks later from them stating my payment was late .
i again advised them i cancelled .
they said they would look into it .
this place is a total scam .
stay away from this place at all costs .
and by the way , my massage from helga the destroyer was terrible .
the staff shelving and on the floor are helpful and nice .
the selection of organic and natural foods is good .
the store has been very clean each time i went in .
the staff in the deli/bakery are awful .
more than once i have given up and walked away .
no reason to put up with being ignored .
got there 130 ca n't find did you call ?
no they called me .
have a seat i 'll find out .
about half hour she said in lab just a few minutes .
overall about an hour .
off to vet she called we did not order twice .
so far , the longest i have had to wait is about 1 hour .
normally we have to wait about 15-20 minutes .
the assistants r just okay .
worst customer service and most unprofessional `` urgent '' care i have ever experienced .
find quality care elsewhere .
trust me , i only leave bad reviews when it 's due .
i responded to the facebook ad that advertised a free 6 week camp .
went to the informational session , where 5 different people gave testimonials .
i do n't see the appeal in being penalized for life happening .
the camp is n't my cup of tea but kudos to those who do .
i would chose to actually give this place no stars .
my first visit to the office was awesome .
i believe that i know my phone number and email address .
i got a `` ok '' .
worst place to get your contacts using your insurance .
customer service is so poor here .
i would never recommend this place .
waste of time , money and energy .
i can not give my story , as it is way too long .
please listen to me .
never bring them here .
you get what you need .
the staff is not helpful locating anything .
in fact the staff was just downright rude .
i got what i needed and left .
hopefully i do n't ever need to go back there .
beware of security camera in `` private '' massage rooms ; what privacy !
posted prices are also ambiguous .
not worth what was spent and certainty not going back .
they were all busy and was referred to this zen location .
wife had a $ 30 combination foot and body for an hour .
they may as well hope their business can survive in this culture .
for me , what is a few extra dollars ?
on the package it says give up to 5 days to receive a refill .
when i called they admitted the mistake but forgot to send the needed medication .
i cant get that to happen no matter how many times i ask .
i always have to call a second time and request it separately .
sometimes i receive a large dog toy which is worthless to my cats anyway !
chose this location as it was covered by my insurance .
had appt on 1/23/18 .
my appt was at 4pm and got there @ 3:30pm to fill out paperwork .
why is this necessary ?
sounded shady so i refused to sign it nor did i give my social .
this place caters to mexicans .
i will never ever return to this facility .
and did absolutely nothing to help me with the pain i was experiencing .
will not be going back there
i was not impressed with the facial i received here .
i found priti to be unprofessional .
i was really disappointed because she came so highly recommended .
sadly , i ca n't recommend her services .
wonderful doctors and fancy offices do n't make up for their rude admin staff .
not losing sleep over losing this place .
here 's a head 's up of what went on in nutshell .
i initially decided against that .
i was told that it would be possible for at lease 4-6 weeks !
why was n't i told this when i specifically asked during my consultation ?
this left me speechless !
why wait till my last procedure to tell me this ?
7. out of the four procedures , there was partial success .
that was a result of an `` oops .
he and dr smith were speaking about something unrelated to what smith was doing .
his focus was pulled and i got burned .
i was injured by accident and did my best to be understanding .
i left this office livid .
her response was that it was her job .
i responded ... not in this case it was n't .
the front staff needs some training and dr. mccord was less than helpful .
only the nurse does ears .
wrong ! ! ! !
he had a two hour wait to be seen ! ! ! ! !
our time is as valuable as yours , dr .
i wo n't recommend them again .
disrespectful and blatantly dreadful organization .
i 'd give zero stars if i could .
imho , i tipped much better than what was deserved .
not going to be a return customer .
apria uses a 3rd party billing company called care centrix .
we laid out hundreds of dollars for a device that was prescribed in error .
it 's like talking to a brick wall .
their `` online '' patient portal of little help either .
time to get a clue on customer service !
next time ... .mayo !
service was fast and good .
however , not very pleased that banner could not bill insurance correctly .
i have definitely experienced better .
i 've had 2 surgeries with the clinic .
they mess up the schedule and do n't tell you .
they leave the stitches in too long then have to go dig them out .
i 'll not go back .
eventually needed a root canal .
on the way home , i pulled over 3 times to throw up blood/bleach .
i had a bloody nose from all of this too .
this was the worst experience ever .
our company provided colmedlabs with their fleet vehicle washing ( detailing services ) .
i called sam 5 times and left voice messages .
guess what `` no call back '' now being 6 months later .
total charge was $ 80 each visits , and total charger being $ 320 .
horrific patient financial services .
carla and her sidekick badgered my husband prior to his surgery .
like he did n't have enough to worry about .
after surgery his dr called to let me know he was fine .
i asked when he would be discharged and was told an hour .
give me a friggin break .
at a time when we needed to be together .
we heard one patient asked if he could die and was told yes .
imagine hearing that right before your procedure .
using his full name no less .
i 'd be fired in a heartbeat if i ever did that .
thank god this was a minor surgery .
definitely not happy with customer service experience from financial services and the postoperative stay .
find somewhere else who have more loving doctors care for your precious children .
these doctors are n't the most knowledgeable nor the most compassionate .
i started looking into electrolysis a little over a year ago .
this encounter stood out !
for my first appointment i scheduled a 15min procedure .
i did n't mind initially because this procedure is quit painful .
this is a costly procedure and every minute counts literally !
this place is horrible .
my company switched insurance & my current obgy was n't accepting aetna .
fast forward a month or so later when my bills start piling in .
why am i getting these bills ? ?
so basically , im sol .
bad service , liars & cheats .
highly discourage this facility ! !
try another pharmacy that wants your business .
there were no customers in the entire store at 7:30 am .
i 'm going to keep my prescriptions where they are after all .
too bad , this pharmacy is in a much more convenient location for me .
the staff was friendly .
it was disgusting ! !
i recommend going to another building if you need to go .
any massage is a good massage , right ?
actually i wish i had skipped this one .
my friend did n't mind hers , though .
seemed good at first they rushed us into a semi private room .
there was no reflexology done .
why make an appointment .
i can only imagine what it 's like when they are behind .
what a joke of an office .
i scheduled my appt 1 week prior .
the front desk woman was rude and nonchalant about it all .
this is a huge inconvenience and highly unacceptable .
patients need to be seen and given advance notice of changes .
at least offer another doctor to accommodate .
i will not be a new patient here .
super sketchy part of town .
they hang outside smoking which blows back into the shop .
it was the worst day of my life .
we paid cash copay everytime we was here .
i came to ask the receptionist the reason why we waited too long .
holly did promised she taking care .
i also will report this matter the nevada business bureau soon when i can .
i arrived at 10:13 ... 3 minutes past their 10 minute rule .
when you walk through our doors , we 're glad to see you .
when you call , we do n't keep you on hold .
when you leave a message , we call you right back .
no manners as soon as i walked in .
the nurse who assisted dr. schlotterer was rude and seemed to have an attitude .
will not be returning back .
i attempted to call again to no avail .
this is definitely the last interaction with oasis and dr. bellota .
uhh you just saw him and knew he had n't been seen .
i even gave them 3 chances to get it right , it never happened .
i will be going to a different doctor from now on .
i hope dr pragit will move to another clinic .
the name should be `` my doctor no ''
nevermind on the previous post .
it 's not hard to prove you have stage 4 bone cancer .
he basically just treated me like a drug addict .
ignored all the paperwork which is valid .
i even asked him to call the ny doctors and he refused .
it 's very simple .
call the centre ask if i 'm a patient .
i want to go to the hospital .
pay 1000 for a scan just to throw it in his face .
how can you hold a medical license when you refuse to help people .
especially a dying person .
the front office supervisor is incredibly rude .
thankfully that guy saved my tooth .
then i was sent a bill for the work that he messed up .
i have developed a fear of dentists since seeing this guy .
the facility is very mismanaged .
you walk around asking where to go .
the administration is rude and dismissive .
it seems clear they want your money and nothing else .
their website touts lots of amenities that they do n't have .
they do n't care about you or your sobriety .
it was a nightmare .
i left after 4 days and got into a good facility in pasadena .
the doctors and staff at this place clearly have none .
reception staff was exceptionally rude and the overall experience was entirely unpleasant .
like all other massage envys , the therapists are a mixed bag .
many newbies so there 's a high amount of turnover .
i 've seen a couple good ones that i hope will stay awhile .
this location is particularly bad compared to my `` home '' dobson location .
the staff was accommodating and i did n't wait long to start my massage .
she was excellent , the massage was so relaxing .
if you want a massage go see milena !
i would n't go back , the groupon was definitely a good deal though !
ob patients please avoid dr deka .
i was coldly misdiagnosed with a miscarriage after my first apt with her .
she performed the ultrasound herself .
within 2 minutes she coldly concluded that i had lost my precious baby .
she ordered hcg l levels `` to confirm '' .
i spent 3 days in a deep depression thinking i had a miscarriage .
i am currently 17 weeks pregnant with a baby girl !
my baby would be dead if i took her `` expert '' medical advice !
going to this hospital had to be the worst experience i have ever had .
the vet recommended a 3 day stay to monitor her and printed the estimate .
it was $ 5000 .
my son and i were in tears .
this included giving her antibiotics .
my pet is doing fantastic .
the brush run vet , dr foil , is very caring , straightforward .
brush run really cares about your pet .
the vet hospital is just trying to get your money !
i went here for their new customer cleaning discount .
i made the appointment last week .
i showed up 15 minutes before my 2:00 o'clock appointment as requested .
i have never seen such colossal unprofessionalism .
judging by the other reviews here , i clearly dodged a bullet .
worst decision i ever made was get a membership to massage envy .
save your money and do n't waste your time .
i took my daughter to dr. rowe she was a provider under my insurance .
we started with 4 fillings and paid over 500 for them .
ridiculous treatment , waste of my time and money .
i felt as though they took my cold as a joke .
beware of this place , no bedside manner !
you really ca n't expect much from sql i have come to realize .
i went in to have some blood work done for my one year old .
um ok. the process was like a scene from a scary movie .
horrible experience with dr. meger .
he botched my rhinoplasty ( took off way too much from the bridge ) .
he would n't even do the right thing !
maybe he just needs to stick with breasts !
do n't let him touch your face ! ! !
the worst service i have ever experienced in my life !
never able to book an appointment when you call or email .
and if you want a refund because you are not getting any service ?
they messed up my appointment .
their behaivor leads me to believe this is a frequent occurance .
worst place for stat orders .
came in with ultrasound stat from my dr. for inguinal dvt .
then told to walk next door to valley radiologists .
even they were shocked at dvrs lack of response and care .
this has to be the worst hospital around .
the staff is below par .
overall i give it 1 out of 10 goiters .
she cracked my tooth while doing a simple filling .
geez i wonder how it got there .
perhaps it was the metal clamp you put on my tooth !
if i had not signed a waiver i would sue her .
i had perfect teeth ... had .
it turns out the one good therapist is nearly impossible to book .
the others i saw were mediocre at best .
recently , a service issue developed that i tried to resolve .
there are plenty of other great therapists in the area .
do n't waste your money or time here .
staff is horrible they 're customer service was pathetic .
this was removed originally from the pearson eyegroup .
the doctors were excellent .
the used car salesman tactics at lenscrafters should be illegal !
my original post follows .
the eye doctor was excellent , efficient and knowledgeable .
the glasses selection process is a scam .
i picked out some frames and was quoted a price of $ 550 !
after insurance it was $ 510 !
that right there is a $ 90 discount .
i wo n't even go into the rest .
the glasses should have been around $ 300 tops .
i do n't know .
beware and stay away .
this office is very disappointing .
the doctors are nice enough but the front desk staff is cold and incompetent .
the assistants are rude and inefficient .
they do n't know how to bill or schedule appointments correctly .
the office is nicely decorated but the equipment is outdated .
with tony , i felt that i was an inconvenience and wasting his time .
i honestly felt worse about my self after seeing him .
this is a failure at all levels , not only with tony .
i was on time and filled out same paper work i did two earlier .
sat in waiting for 45 min with no one saying anything .
the worst experience i have ever had at a dr 's office !
the pharmacy is 24 hours and generally always busy .
normally i 'm sure this place is great but today was horrible .
who wants to hear your vomiting and rabble while i 'm getting a massage .
bottom line if you want a quality massage this is n't the place .
i checked into the e.r .
the wait room was disgusting .
their assistant wendy and marilyn however seemed to always be confused and forgetful .
their guest came in @ 10 am and left 10pm .
admitting nurses great everything else was ok @ best i 'd go somehere else
i have had 3 appointments here .
i 'd like to give it no stars .
the front desk is very unprofessional .
the wait times are excessive .
i was there for an annual pap smear today .
already it 's an embarrassing and vulnerable situation .
the doc asks all the same questions she asked in the other appointments .
she asks about birth control .
i do n't need a sex ed lesson !
i have n't taken hormones for 10 years !
this is why i 'm seeing this doc .
this is why my appointments have been so close together !
so let me set the scene !
i stopped her , i said excuse me ?
she says `` what ?
just do n't get pregnant . ''
that 's very rude of you to assume .
she even tried to turn it around `` you should leave !
fully nude argument with a doc holding the door open !
but i would like to save others from having this kind of experience .
does n't even deserve one star !
if you can get an appointment elsewhere , do it .
one guy got in ahead of us for an mri .
he was in the back for 55 minutes for an mri .
2 people literally took almost 90 minutes .
others were sitting around .
she said `` good luck - i 'm leaving . ''
several other people showed up after that , and immediately left .
there were several older people , a couple of women with children .
and a couple of men ... all left .
from now on , any mris or x-rays will be done at the hospital .
this was useless and annoying.. very poor scheduling .
i even said no to a pap this year just in case !
i do not recommend this place at all !
when we entered , we were greeted by this younger lady who spoke english .
( on the flier it says 10 min head..etc ) .
we situated ourselves and they brought out the hot water .
way over priced and the proceudre was painfull adn showed no results .
do not go to her .
save your time and money !
do n't ever go here .
i went to this location for a time sensitive lab test .
saw multiple patients show up and have issues with their appointments scheduled .
and definitely do n't need medication .
use at your own risk .
not sure why they even schedule `` appointments '' they 're more like suggestions .
i had a 5 hours tattoo and it was a painful rib tattoo .
what kind of customer relation/ service is this ?
then he suggested i buy a h2o care kit .
i denied since this was not my only tattoo .
what ? ? ? ? ?
it took 20 minutes for a front desk staff to even check me in .
after that i waiting for another 30 minutes .
once i got in i had a nurse practitioner see me .
i was prescribed my birth control and was done .
waited 50 minutes for a 5 minute appointment .
but 2 months later same thing happened .
they said my insurance does n't pay for the services i requested .
my parents were livid !
my friend and i wanted to try this place since we had a groupon .
we decided to stop by after our pilates class .
i have been here once and i honestly will never go here again .
i will find a new doctor .
or even have the receptionist call me and let me know ?
this is so beyond ridiculous and i would never recommend this practice to anybody .
i had a groupon so i came here with my sister .
the drinks ( plural ) nope .
apparently they were serving fruit with a burger today .
hmmm one strawberry nd pickle literally half the size of my pinky .
are u kidding me .
i would give it no stars if i had an option .
never again will i come to this place .
i would recommend against it in every way .
the food ( cajun burger ) had no flavor to it at all .
i see doctors almost weekly and this has never been an issue .
i called my insurance company and they said everything was fine .
the front desk lady finally had to let me go back .
i get to the back and i wo n't get weighed .
due to this they now refuse to see me .
you have been warned !
update- vanessa is the front desk person .
she was so extremely rude .
i ended up leaving and asked for my filled out paperwork back .
i told her i did not trust her .
she said she did not trust herself either .
the massage was not relaxing because it was barely a massage .
definitely a place to avoid .
do not take time off work to come to this waste of an outlet .
my dad and sam are probably not even friends anymore over this .
in my book that is racism , not that i care .
please dr webber learn bedside manner !
today i had to come back for a missed test .
i protested and said that i was right on time .
this ai n't no micky-ficky airport ! ! !
your office does n't and did n't .
basically- their inner-office snafus wasted my morning .
i was still trying to make sense of what 's going on .
c'mon , get it together folks ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i should n't have had to come back to be tested today .
the wait at this place is ridiculous .
this is getting ridiculous .
they are extremely slow .
i will never go to any simon med imaging again .
these folks are notorious overbillers , and everyone should be very wary .
i hit my family deductible early this year after a couple of surgeries .
i get home , and look up my claims with my insurance provider .
my portion is zero ?
so i call my insurance provider and ask them for their thoughts .
`` you should n't have paid anything .
we 'll call simon med and request a refund . ''
well folks , guess what ?
ask your insurer for help .
i 'll never go there again .
if this happens to you , do n't blame me .
you have been warned .
this place is a joke .
none of them bother using gloves or washing there hands .
stay as far away as you can from this place !
the doctor did n't even spend 2 minutes in the room with me .
place is awful ! ! !
i urge you to stay away ! !
also good luck understanding them .
it 's very difficult if you are older .
it 's become like a meat factory herding people through .
it 's really gone downhill ! !
i have visited this spa from time to time when in vegas .
this time the masseuse was 50 min late .
i was booked for a massage , wrap and a facial .
i left feeling disgusted and ripped off .
made an appointment at the dysart location .
( i know exactly which location i called .
he would not listen to me at all ) .
i knew this was going to be awkward and weird again .
a lady comes out , also does n't speak english barely .
she starts asking me if i received a call from them .
no i did not receive a call from them .
she keeps arguing with me .
i told her nevermind , i 'm not interested .
she followed me out , chased me to my car .
wtf ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
the emergency room referred me to the core institute with a possible fracture .
when i asked if i had it correct , he seemed very aggravated .
that was about the greatest ounce of courtesy i received .
really i felt totally blown off and like my pain was n't real .
i was in the exam room for maybe 2 minutes .
the doctor glanced at my elbow x-ray and told me to start physical therapy .
at least with this visit i felt like i got somewhere : physical therapy .
right where the emergency room said it was !
i feel like i have totally wasted my time and money at the core .
and this is 3 months later !
never would i recommend going to the core !
they will rape you and your insurance company .
i went in for a broken nose and came out $ 10,000 in debt !
i spoke to a human for a total of less than 5 minutes .
i was left in a room for 4.5 hours .
i would rather die than ever set foot in the hospital .
terrible business practice to turn away customers before posted hours of business .
will be using amazon online ordering from now on .
the girls at the front desk are really nice .
they do not have moderately priced glasses .
i have n't seen a frame under $ 200 .
then add lenses and everything , you 're lucky to spend under $ 500.00 .
frames are limited as well .
i am extremely dissatisfied with this with this clinic .
on another visit , i was told that my results would take two weeks .
in the meantime , my symptoms are worsening which has resulted in terrible discomfort .
i am desperately seeking a new ob .
got a groupon deal for their laser treatments .
not happy at all .
i can not believe the glowing reviews this place has .
i had the worst experience with my first prenatal visit .
this is my second pregnancy so i know what good prenatal care is .
the only person that seemed competent here was the ultrasound tech from valley perinatal .
she was friendly and reviewed everything with the baby .
we were very pleased .
the place does n't have enough rooms ?
her responses just showed that she was inexperienced and not knowledgeable .
she fell short of answering my questions .
she never reviewed the ultrasound or determined my due date .
my husband even agreed that she did n't seem very competent .
how is she in this profession ?
she also had no personality .
she did not make any efficient use of the appointment time .
but , she asked if i had done blood work .
i was sitting around waiting for her that i had n't .
this is where everything went downhill .
the lady that did my blood draw was horrible !
my whole arm went numb !
she must of hit nerve twice !
i felt like i was going to pass out !
i have never experienced such a bad blood draw .
no problems at all with my first pregnancy .
this lady did n't know what she was doing .
my arm was sore and tingling for at least 5 days after .
i changed offices the same day .
there is definitely better care out there .
they use a yahoo.com email address for communication .
i just wanted to confirm that they transferred my medical records .
the girl answered and then hung up on me .
finally , someone else answered and took care of me .
what is wrong with this place ?
we thoroughly searched for a doctor while expecting our first child .
we interviewed with dr. garcia and she was great .
took her time , answered all of our questions and was down to earth .
i hated the wait , but she seemed worth it .
baby was only 3 months old ! !
i should have switched doctors then .
rude , rude , rude & rude .
i personally like eric wolson very much .
i have reported her to his upper staff for the past 4 1/2 years .
i am done trying to get past this imbecile to get proper medical attention .
i hope that you read your reviews and take action .
it was very quiet & foot soak/massage felt nice .
then escorted to massage table room & seemed to go well .
dr appts , rx & sleepless nights w/ itching .
please clean your upholstered couch/beds & linens ! ! !
no wonder it 's dark & they try covering our faces .
this turned out stressful , painful & humiliating .
needless to say , we left pretty upset .
i came by again on wednesday at 11:45 to find the place closed .
the sign says closed on mondays .
there were employees inside ignoring us .
how do you think you got through nursing school if you had adhd ? ``
as if those with adhd are too ill to be successful in nursing school .
he was profoundly belittling and condescending .
physician heal thyself ... .a tad bit cluster b perhaps ?
is n't that what yelp is for ?
be wise when choosing a dentist !
another example of why we have happily switched dentists .
this is not towards any of the doctors or anesthesiologist i have dealt with .
only the nurses afterwards .
i finally gave up without speaking to a human .
i wo n't be returning .
nurse who had me was throwing the f-bomb everywhere and the s word .
took them two hours to get me in .
fyi we were in the walk-in office .
waited two hours to get into the actual exam room .
doctor did n't show up for another 15 minutes .
so unprofessional and disorganized .
definitely would not recommend to anyone at all .
not recommended , unless you like waiting and poor quality treatment .
2 stars might be generous .
three phone calls and two emails have all gone un-returned .
this company is shady in their billing practices and ethics .
currently researching if there is any legal recourse i can take against these people !
they charged the maximum obviously .
i am wondering what kind of things they can follow up .
i even told them that i only used contacts couple times per month .
if you want to go that place for convenience , be careful .
they may just charge you without telling you .
anyhoo , i really wanted to try to start donating again .
i called to make a first time donor appointment .
apparently they do n't take appointments ... .it 's first come first serve .
no problem i guess .
got there at 0645 , thinking i would be one of the first ones .
boy was i wrong .
the waiting room was already more than half full .
twenty five minutes later they called me .
i was told i signed the wrong sign in sheet .
i had to resign on the `` new donor '' sheet instead .
for another 40 minutes .
apparently i got moved back to the bottom of the entire list .
so i just left .
so there he was again .
seems like a pretty unorganized system .
horrible place from scheduling , to billing , to customer service .
scheduled ortho appt only to find out the orthodontist did not come in .
not good business at all .
i have used wellish for 8 years .
i have never heard back ! ! !
cvs pharmacist called and no return call but i 'm in serious pain .
i called the office and was hung up on twice .
my first appointment i arrived at 1:15pm and i was not seen until 5:00pm .
sorry , i had to write this review but this is not good healthcare !
and no other doctor here .
waiting room full of people .
not sure this is how this is supposed to work .
i can , however , speak for my experiences with their laser treatments .
in a word , horrible .
everyone there seemed to care less about my pain .
they appear to be across the street from one another .
my appointment here had to be the worst i have ever had for anything .
they 're incompetent and make fun of the dying patients in the icu !
unless you have a death wish , stay far away ! ! !
it was a lie .
i figured it out before i went to see them .
this office appear to be so techy with their tablets and stuff .
overall , not impressed .
if only a minus score could be given .
dr gross was highly recommended to us .
when i read the other reports , i wonder how can this continue ?
value your eyesight , do not go to this person .
i brought my 11 month old here for some labs .
i was expecting a couple pricks on his fingers or feet .
instead they put a needle in his arm .
maybe that 's the way it needed to be done .
then instead of putting a wrap on his arm she put the tape .
which is the hardest to get off .
the lakewood location is by all definition slower , dirtier , and less organized .
and what about those check out lines ?
slow is n't even the word at those registers .
i kill them with kindness to hide my frustrations .
i also ask if i can bag .
it 's just quicker .
the closeout aisles however are always loaded with random cheapy deals .
it 's hard to pass them up .
i wish they had negative stars .
had spine surgery by a neurosurgeon 6 days later .
i told them i was fine with that .
it is now 1:28 pm and still no doctor .
all this for a simple procedure which will take no more than 5 minutes .
never coming here again !
have been using veyo for a while , rotten service .
lately when i telephone they are having problems .
not reliable , sometimes have to wait close to an hour to get picked up
i 'm sorry this is a bit long but hear me out .
here goes : i moved to arizona from hawaii 8/2014 .
i sought out dr. kale in the gilbert/mesa office .
thank goodness for my nurse ... she was a sweetheart and a half .
well , other than that , my delivery was quick and perfect .
with her being in the hospital , i had to rent a breastpump .
i rented the breastpump for 2 months .
my baby came home and she took to breastfeeding with no problems .
i had no problems with that .
i contacted goodman & partridge and spoke with a nurse explaining my situation .
obviously those dates would show i no longer need the breastpump .
so i coughed it up as a loss .
it was n't worth my time anymore for a mere $ 70 .
i 'm so over them .
just had to write this review for all to see .
thanks for looking ... find a small practice where they care about their patients .
they barely restocked their supplies .
the pa was trent blake .
his demeanor was sort of friendly , but his execution was lacking .
he had no concern for anything that might cause me pain .
stay away from this place .
all for what amounted to a 2 minute visit !
i 'm getting a new doctor .
rude ... i 'd rather be told we 're closed ... .
3 people in lobby .
they do n't take appointments for x-rays .
here with a child , this will not go well .
receptionist called neighboring simonmed .
40 minute wait , why do n't you go there .
forget that , 10 minute drive almost same time .
why is place understaffed ?
why do they want to get rid of patients ?
would not recommend to anyone .
i would never recommend anyone go to this doctors office .
takes weeks for people to call you back .
the run around you do and the wait time !
no one values a patients time !
i sure as hell am !
this place has been closed permanently and their phone number is out of service .
although this website is still up and running - it 's a farce !
the place has shut down with no forwarding address !
ca n't stand places that do n't answer their phones .
i call at 5:40 and the answering machine says i called after business hours .
they close at 6 ...
they offer empty apologies , without any change to their program .
what happened to `` glasses in about an hour ? ''
officially convinced , lenscrafters is sham .
find another low cost solution for tattoo removal .
do not be fooled .
after treatment 6 is has barely faded .
this place is a rip off .
they should be ashamed of themselves !
he was never given a smock to change into .
this entire facility should face legal action and be shut down .
i had my 10 week pregnancy check-up .
it bothers me a lot .
she did n't give me any estimates citing different insurances billing differently .
nobody mentioned the costs , even dr. swarup .
ca n't you have a little more compassion ? !
i just lost my pregnancy , you piece of crap !
nurses were moody and could n't explain which cups to use to urine samples .
when i called nurses and front desk , they were acting all arrogant .
what about me , the patient , and my availability ?
you know , i have a life with responsibilities too .
on-call nurses do n't know anything , googling stuff is more accurate .
she did not even cut some dry skin between the corner ! !
hate this place ! ! !
i wish i could rate them 0 star ! ! ! ! !
that is so rude ! !
i have to ask her 3x to do it !
never had bad experience like this from a nail salon !
i already told my family friends stay away from this nail salon ! ! !
your review that stated that we will fix the problem , fix what ? ?
i just want to let the customer know to stay away from this salon !
i saw dr. khiani for over a year and his treatment worked great .
i had the most allergy free summer in my whole life .
he advised that they do n't have a method to do so .
i came here in physical pain and i could barely tolerate it .
worst case of empathy .
there was never a smile in this woman 's voice the entire time .
i almost felt like i was bothering her !
she quoted $ 55 for an hour of massage or facial .
not a good first impression folks .
when we decide on a spa day , we will be looking elsewhere .
i felt so talked down to for needing an antibiotic .
i sadly will be looking for a new doctor 's office .
i work walking distance from this office .
the location is pinned incorrectly on maps .
i got there at exactly 2:30 and was told my appointment was cancelled .
no emails , texts or calls i received mentioned getting there early .
she had no empathy and did nothing to make it right .
what a terrible experience .
how does this place stay in business ?
because there are people like me who fall victim to their sales pitches .
people like me who are in pain and will try anything .
it seems too good to be true , because it is !
for about $ 300 , i got a pair of little plastic pieces .
they will try to sell you three for close to $ 1000 .
what a fool i am !
i should have left then .
learn from my $ 300 mistake .
do not go to good feet !
she retorted , `` your teeth are all going to fall out '' .
did n't you hear me the first time i explained it ? ''
i still have no idea if she 's licensed or properly trained .
if you provide any intelligent/questioning thought , you might be ridiculed and/or berated .
is there a rating less than one ?
worst dentistry ever ! !
is that a joke ? ?
really.. receptionist is unprofessional and rude .
how long will it take the doctor to approve and release my xrays ?
dont ever visit this place again !
this place has given me so many problems !
i waited again and they finally arrived at my house .
i finally made an appointment for today .
i told him that i could n't afford it .
i wo n't use avi again !
they have too many problems with the competency of their staff .
i have been holding off writing this review for months .
they performed a skin prick test which came back negative .
they diagnosed me with idiopathic anaphylaxis .
they officially diagnosed me with a dairy allergy .
i was switched from dulera to qvar .
20 minutes later i was having a serious allergic reaction .
i was given a `` dexamethasone sodium phosphate 10mg/ml injection '' to my ass .
i was told to never take that breo again .
i called tottori 's office and alerted them to my reaction .
they prescribed me spiriva respimat as a last ditch effort .
over the next few days my symptoms were getting worse .
after a day or two my asthma symptoms were starting to diminish .
i was able to go over a week without using my ventolin .
i was taking 200/5 dulera , they submitted 100/5 dulera .
i now have to call and get this fixed .
my only question for tottori is `` where is the accountability ? ''
office personnel never pick up the phone .
you need to reach .
very frustrating when it 's important to get in touch with someone .
i do not mind seeing pas imho .
perhaps if i firmly asked three times i will get what i asked for .
this is apparently a suggestion in my opinion .
i think this is unacceptable for a medical facility .
overall , very disappointed and will not be returning .
had an okay experience here , and would not consider going back .
the whole appointment felt rushed .
the hygienist was not gentle .
lenscrafters should not cost more for a visit to their store .
will not be using them next time .
i didnt even want to give 1 star !
i will no longer take prescriptions there .
i even took the time to contact there corporate headquarters in illinois !
i have 0 confidence in them .
i have been with this office for 13 years .
i have never liked the office staff .
i scheduled an appointment doe today .
i took my child in for a routine physical .
i am expected to believe they all can be seen at 130 ?
i am tired of this office and will not be returning .
billing coordinator is never available , and claims are incorrectly processed to insurances .
all in all the office staff needs to be reevaluated or cut .
i bought a groupon for 6 laser hair removal sessions on my lower legs .
receptionist and space is nice .
my first session i went home with a burnt mark near my ankle .
the machine is painful and i 'm barely seeing results .
especially the pharmacy department , where they only hire rude , incompetent people .
we went to refill a prescription that had previously been filled at another cvs .
when we asked her to recheck , explaining our situation , she refused .
that request was also denied .
`` they are unavailable . ''
we will never return !
i was transferred to his voicemail .
who am i to hold responsible , walgreens or healing hearts ?
yours truly , a dissatisfied arizona parent .
will never go back .
in addition , when i was initially diagnosed they scheduled a followup apt .
i am extremely disappointed in choosing happy dental .
here for the first time with my dad for his apmt .
can u say hipa violation ?
they do n't take patients based on their apmt times .
several people with times after our apmt were taken in ahead if us .
why even have apmt then ?
the nurse who took my dad back was very rude .
she looks at me and says you ca n't come .
no reasons no explanations just a no .
even another patient mentioned that it was rude !
i would never ever recommend this lab to anyone .
look for another option .
this is the last time i get my prescriptions here .
i would recommend not coming to this cvs ! ! !
if i could give zero stars i would .
tough approach , yes , uncaring , you betcha .
this woman was imbalanced , i reported her .
it was a nightmare .
then the word part ... les than 5 minutes with the doctor !
i got some new glasses here this past fall .
that appointment itself went well and i really liked dr. sorensen .
things happen ... .no big deal .
sadly the glasses have never fit quite right .
they fit nothing like the sample pair they have there .
that is true , if you can get them to wait on you .
the customer service for adjustments is terrible .
it more often than not i just give up and leave rather than wait .
i want to give my business to someone who wants my business .
this place is terrible and deserving of its low rating .
however , i 'll now suffer with ungroomed eyebrows before i go back .
you usually end up with a nice shape .
she was the last one i saw .
however , my last service is n't the only thing that turned me off .
and when i say push , they push !
i do n't care if you have the ultimate hair removal machine .
i do n't trust you !
fix the fundamental issues first , and then get into promoting services like that .
half the time this meant i would n't tip .
fat reduction , wrinkle removal , etc .
go in and see for yourself .
- they 're definitely pricey , but do n't provide value .
but that also means that customers expect a higher level of service .
anyway , i think i 've said enough now .
my advice is to stay away from this place if you can .
do n't do it moms , do n't schedule an appt here .
this place has a ten dollar canceled appt fee , i get it .
they are covering their own to stop ppl from flaking .
every policy needs wiggle room .
they lost our business completely .
i have to agree with these reviews good and bad !
her staff who answers the phones really should be counseled or fired .
she is short and just does n't leave you feeling warm and fuzzy .
getting my b12 shot is fast and efficient !
i am in and out in 2 minutes !
i called and cancelled , was informed of the 25 dollar cancellation fee .
maybe when hubby gets home i can get a ride from him .
case by case and be strict for abusers .
wish me luck and i will keep you posted !
the secnond opinion took full x-rays and cleaned my teeth .
it felt like you were in an emergency room of a hospital .
not a good atmosphere for a quiet couples massage .
then the massage started and that 's when it got interesting .
due to the sinus massage i have had difficulty breathing from my nose since .
then she left for about 2-3 minutes .
comes back and gives a half assed shoulder/arm/leg massage then leaves for 5 minutes .
she stands up on my back .
this goes on for 5 minutes or so then she leaves .
at this point i 'm just ready to be done .
i came here for a sleep study .
the lady that took me to the back was not very personal either .
i assumed she had a bad day and left it at that .
i got taken back and setup along as other people .
one of the other clients played his tv super loud .
i could not sleep till like 1 am .
i did not sleep at all really after that because mask was so weird .
bed was like soft prison bed .
sheets were even less desirable along with pillow .
ive been to 10 sleep clinics since high school and this was the worst .
the er sucks majorly !
thanks for the tylenol , jerk .
oh , the piano music and guitar in the lobby was nice and cheerful !
was not impressed with integrative .
love my regular vet but they do n't do acupuncure .
i called and made an appointment for an office visit .
just wanted him to check my dog and tell me their protocol .
vet techs do teeth cleaning .
also not something i was thrilled with .
i have always worked with doctors who did this themselves .
since he specializes in chiropractic , it seemed that 's what he talked about .
staff was pleasant but the wait was unreal .
i have an appt th but do n't know if will continue there .
we came about 9pm right after my surgery .
anyway we went through the drive through .
had a bad attitude from the get .
she told me ( even more rudely ) '' move along now ! ''
and she shoo-ed me away with her spastic hand motions ... how rude !
hello people do n't usually end up in the pharmacy at their best right ?
`` hahha oh ok miss ( ssss ) , guess what ?
now i do n't feel comfortable filling this . ''
`` i do n't like you so that is my right . ''
you do n't like me ?
`` too bad here is a cvs down the street . ''
she said , and she waddled away .
that is when i flipped .
`` please do n't complain . ''
she said , '' i 'll give you a gift card ! ''
`` i 'll fill your prescription . ''
`` sorry it 's just store policy . ''
whatever she rectified it .
still , it that was my grandma she was treating like that ?
i just would n't want to have not done my part .
i 'm still going to complain ... 1. to you , fellow yelpers !
there are too many other people who need good jobs !
i will never go back to the chubacca cvs .
not even to use my $ 25 gift card .
i will take her advice and go to the one down the street .
and when i stop for gas ?
go talke some customer service classes you rude mean person .
see , i can be mean too !
but i did n't call you chubacca once !
attitude is everything folks .
i feel much better , thanks yelp !
ridiculous it 's been a month .
nobody calls me and when i call them they do n't seem to care .
terrible terrible service avoid at all costs .
very surprising from a business that seems to be soliciting yelp reviews .
dr jawadi was very personable on my first visit .
i was going to have test so we scheduled for the next visit .
i will admit i was nervous about it all .
my sister had a procedure done and stated it was very painful .
this increased my anxiety .
the procedure started and i jumped .
dr jawadi stayed i could not feel what was being down .
well yes i could .
she told me i needed to be ready for the next procedure .
she pointed her index finger at her head and said in you mind .
speaking down and curt to me like i was stupid .
actually i was afraid and anxious .
she must have missed the class on bedside care in school .
so i was late to my appointment .
i was informed they had a 15 min rule .
well no one shares the rule and it is not posted .
i patiently waited for my turn before and paid my money to be seen .
there was no discount because she was late .
the receptionist would not even ask if i could still be seen .
it is our policy that if you are late you have to reschedule .
i asked for the report of the previous test .
they gave me the results with no explanation and i left .
i came back and canceled my appointment .
i then returned to get the rest of my chart .
i said you just had my records .
the receptionist said you are not getting your records today .
we have 30 days .
i understand you are upset .
i told her she did not understand .
do n't take it out on me .
i left and then i remembered i owned money .
i offered to pay what was owned .
the receptionist informed me that i did not owe anything .
she looked at me and turned and walked away .
i guess she missed the communication and courtesy class too .
i am very disappointed in her and her staffs behavior .
i am a new patient that just moved to the area .
i have been with laura waggener , np , for 15 years .
i followed her from ingrid haas ' office when she joined paradise valley obgyn .
i liked her and felt comfortable with her .
i was told to get dressed and leave .
this was the most humiliating experience .
needless to say , i left there in tears .
i could understand it if i came in off the street .
laura was the only `` doctor '' i had known .
the renovations are now impacting the quality of my ymca membership .
there is no classes between 12:30 and 4 pm ?
what a joke ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i 'm about to cancel my membership .
my family goes to this facility .
we have only seen dr mickus .
he referred us to a dermatologist .
his nurse called and gave us the appt time and location of the dermatologist .
we ended up in the emergency room .
he is starting antibiotics now .
horrible service ! ! ! !
i sure do n't think so .
i have already reported the review as a fraudulent review because it truly is !
shake my head ranch dental plaza !
2. on my ranch dental plaza paperwork .
3. by a person who works there that i 'm friends with on social media
altaf did n't know what robaxin was for .
i also know it makes me feel bad .
she wanted me to take more and add another muscle relaxant to this one .
she also decided she knew more about my pain than i did .
how is that possible ?
a pain threshold is held by the person with the pain .
this is a `` medical group '' with around 20 physicians .
i called to schedule an appointment with a different doctor .
when she asked questions , she spoke over my answers .
you ca n't hear what someone is saying if your mouth is moving .
and it 's rude to interrupt .
i 'm the one trying to get better .
they are authoritarian and indifferent .
they lack empathy and compassion .
are they working in healthcare just for the pay scale ?
i followed up after my appointment , first thing the next morning .
this is the middle of the second business day .
they wont speak to me , and have not returned answers to my questions .
this location is dirty , smells , and has an interesting staff .
this place is terrible and so was the doctor that saw my grandfather today .
we had to wait 2 hours to be seen .
after each question he answered , the doctor would ask `` why ? ''
in such a condescending tone .
anything but `` why ? ''
`` why '' is such a silly question . ''
wow did this guy get defensive after that .
i just gave him a blank stare .
you should learn a little compassion and talk to your patients with respect .
you go there for headache they send you right away to allergy test .
horrible horrible horrible customer service ! ! !
do not purchase from liftchair.com or liftchairexperts.com ! !
vegans / vegetarians beware ! ! ! ! !
there were items marked vegetarian that were actually vegan .
well , this is a yes and no answer .
now , the reason for the one star .
this kind of defeats the purpose of being vegan / vegetarian .
the cleveland va being rated so high is a joke .
this hospital is a dump and their employees dump on you .
i am so sad to have to write this review .
my boyfriend and i visited here for spa week yesterday and were really disappointed .
unfortunately , the joya spa did n't live up to my expectations .
after looking at pictures and reading reviews , i was still excited .
upon entering the spa , we checked in with a smile-less hostest .
they swept us off into opposite directions so we had to coordinate via text .
the facilities are nice and i liked having my own personal locker with keycode .
my therapist joel came to get me 5 minutes after my scheduled 1pm appointment .
joel took me back to the treatment room and the room was pretty uninspired .
service was slow and my turkey burger was pretty bland .
i was served my salad in a bowl where the sealant was coming off .
he just said 'okay ' .
maybe we just had a bad experience because of spa week ?
i 'm not going back to find out .
terrible service ! ! !
if you can find another place ... ..do n't choose this terrible ortho dentistry !
it might be cheap but is not worth it .
please do n't waste your time and money .
first , you wo n't be welcome by receptionists .
they are too busy with whatever to give you any attention .
you must speak up for yourself and let them know you are here !
i wo n't be back .
i went in here with my husband several weeks ago .
after the eye exam , i heard him speaking to his receptionist about us .
i wasted 4 hours of my time today to be denied service i requested .
the impact of my current condition is both physical and emotional .
used them for several years and they were fine .
they just said no .
they do n't do refunds and said they 'd send the right medication .
we 'll , it was obviously a rush , right ? ? ? ?
they still refused to refund any money and blamed it on my vet .
so do not use this pharmacy .
dr. bijan ahrari is not a very good doctor at all .
do n't waste your time or money .
you are better off googling your issues and resolving them that way .
i worked here and only lasted six weeks .
my lead supervisor was cold , indifferent and unfriendly towards me .
this adgitated her and she got an attitude with me .
this was an overall very disappointing and somewhat humiliating experience .
i went in for fillers under my eyes , my lips and smile lines .
also botox and thermage .
my eyes and lips look worse than before .
actually want my eyes undone if that possible .
it took months for the swelling and bruising to go away .
had to go back 3 times to get the botox right .
this place is the poster child for how not to run a medical office .
i just said okay and hung up to do my research .
the doctor was great and full of knowledge .
i had no choice but to say yes and go see his replacement .
then the dr. should stay home and you receptionist should n't schedule anything .
they have me so upset .
i swear these reviews are fake as hell
two crowns for a total of $ 4000 .
i got a second opinion and got two fillings for less than $ 150 .
i thought i would wait awhile before writing this review .
the previous one star review on yelp uses the words `` money hungry '' .
you be the judge $ 4000 vs $ 150 .
i 've been a patient of dr dalley for several years without complaint .
however here lately their office is extremely difficult to reach .
they tend to overbook patients .
i had to wait about 40-60 minutes every single time i went there .
you will wait 10 mins first to see a nurse .
your actual time with a doctor is about 10mins .
no wonder every one has to wait a long time .
i do n't like a place that seems to be very profit driven .
update : just got my lab bill .
roughly 4 months later .
this incompetent medical practice pulled $ 1000 worth of blood work .
they should change their name to slowmed .
honestly this was a pretty terrible experience from start to finish .
after sitting in the room for another 20 minutes the dr came in .
she 's like `` yea . ''
the most insulting experience ever ! ! ! .
if there were 0 stars they would get that .
i have been coming here for 7+ years .
after reading all these other reviews i see that 's a common trend here .
he volunteered to call for me .
my new dr got me in within 3 minutes of check in .
new horizons averaged about 1 hour even with an appointment .
so bring a book .
i liked my therapist , and i enjoyed the therapy process .
however , they screwed up my billing .
do not go here .
i got my breads and desserts elsewhere .
i think the overall feel from staff in the store is impersonal .
i can get organic anything elsewhere with much friendlier service and cheaper prices .
i may return if i hear they improve on customer service .
do n't waste your time .
your time does n't matter here at smile brite dental .
dr vu schedules way too many appointments at once .
i 'm so disappointed with the staff .
the dental hygienist rushes through my cleaning every single time .
wow , so unprofessional .
if you love your teeth and your time is valuable do n't come here !
it 's not just this location it 's all of them .
worst hospital i 've ever been to !
we waited 4 hours with her crying out in the emergency room .
she was never even offered a blanket .
she said she had never seen anything like this !
i got the coldest answers from the front desk .
they were the most unsympathetic people i have ever seen .
they were laughing with each other and then ordered a pizza !
i had been talking with a woman waiting to be seen about my daughter .
it was one of the woman behind the desk .
she said `` you need to sit down .
she also told another person to be quiet .
i felt iike i was in kindergarten , not an adult .
she was talking about me !
i was so embarrassed !
i later received a call from a customer relations person for the hospital .
no complaint form , just a `` sorry about that '' letter .
my tattoos did not even have color .
when i said something to the manager she suggested i buy more treatments .
i only bought the other 3 because they said definitely they would be gone .
i was also told to drink more water .
i have been dealing with these tattoos for almost 3 years .
that was 3 weeks ago .
i have not heard back from them either .
i wo n't be finding out .
why would i drive 3 cities over .
yet when mentioned to the manager she just suggested i purchase more treatments .
now i 'm off to delete in phoenix .
other then that there 's not anything too positive to say about the place .
the guy at the front desk could n't have been any ruder .
he never even looked up at us .
the doctor was ok i guess .
this is a very nice looking place .
last time it was about an hour .
folks , this place is not big and i was the only customer there .
the just seem really clueless which is great since they handle my meds .
the absolute worst ! !
avoid at all costs .
i would absolutely discourage anyone from becoming a patron here .
even if you 've contacted them before using text .
their bogo deal is no deal at all .
spent $ 360+ on 2 pair which both broke within 1st year .
got a great pair at costco for $ 190 .
will never shop there again .
i 've been waiting for 1.5 hours to check in .
there are only 4 total people in here .
( cheyenne location ) not a very good experience with scheduling .
so , i called the office to schedule an appointment .
they use a specific system that my doctor does n't use regarding referrals .
one call after another .
so much red tape .
my son finally gets his appointment .
i drove across town to be told that they canceled my appointment .
i never received a call .
now im looking for another doctor .
do not go here !
read other reviews from actual patients .
no follow up and you can not get carmen on the phone .
front office is a disaster .
i had been in the chair for 3 hours and just wanted to leave .
it 's a shame because i like curtiss , the hygienist , very much .
called ahead 12:00 gave me a time for 2:45 .
3:00 they called to come down .
4:30 i 'm still waiting .
that was the quick service ? .
it was n't even busy .
the antibiotic has a listed complication .
oh yeah , we 'll have to retype the prescriptions .
the staff spent more time on insurance billing codes than patient needs .
a sharps box ( used needles ) on the floor .
nurse tells kids stick hands in `` all the time '' .
do n't let your kids stick hands in . ?
what is the box doing on the damn floor ?
i would n't even take my dog to this place .
once you get in to see the doctors , everything is great .
we especially love dr. winterland .
however , the ladies up front are terrible .
we have never had a good experience with them .
our must recent bad experience happened today .
we kept the same appointment time with another physician .
we checked in on time , and then waited and waited and waited .
after 30 minutes of nothing , i went to ask how much longer .
`` oh , he 's running an hour behind today . ''
we have a one and a half year old .
they need to seriously clean house up front .
needless to say we left .
come here if you have nowhere else to go .
apparently , 9 bucks were n't enough for her .
where 's that attitude coming from ?
that was the first and the last time at that place for me .
for the most part the office employees were friendly .
i should have read the reviews before booking with this dr 's office .
do not go to see doctor hamburg or anyone else at this business ! !
so thank you so much , you pompous son of a bitch !
i sincerely hope you rot in every hell .
i was recommended dr kootman by my eye doctor due to dry eyes .
meridian valley labs ) $ 154.85 directly as opposed to $ 650.00 .
this dental practice has very unfriendly service all around .
i have n't gone back and i will not recommend anyone to this practice .
everyone was nice , but at what cost ...
do not use this outfit !
terrible customer service and cavalier with customer 's time .
will not be going back .
i wo n't be back .
my fiancé was experiencing extremely bad abdominal pain .
we got there and everyone was very friendly except for one nurse .
she ruined the entire experience .
i liked the doctor , but the office staff is rude and condescending .
really ? ! ? ! ?
why should i have to prove i was right ? ? ?
we did some research and discovered we had paid the bill .
insurance had finally gotten it put through in feb 2016 and we immediately paid .
i told her i could still dispute it with my cc company .
she said they would mail the check that weekend ( it was wednesday ) .
i asked her to refund the card , which she supposedly did .
i also asked her to send email confirmation of the refund .
do not trust these people
( although better but not right ! )
another chat with my insurance company is again informing !
swdg still did not follow through with my advise and filed incomplete claims .
~ she finally filed correctly ! ! !
which i knew was coming but why so much ! ! ! ! ... .
can you believe it ! ! ! !
how shady can you be ! ! ! ! !
needless to say ... i 'm only paying the cost share and nothing else !
sooooo long story short beware ! ! ! !
i decided to give the new doctor a chance ( dr.rosario ) .
never again will i step into that office .
i was extremely disappointed with how i was treated .
bought the groupon for exam , x-rays , and 3 adjustments .
setting the appointment was quick , easy and friendly .
the video was of testimonials saying how awesome this new nucca chiropractic treatment was .
wow , he was 20 pounds heavier on his right side .
so we set an appt for the next morning .
by then we already knew we wasted the $ 45 on the groupon .
so finally time for the `` adjustment '' .
the adjustment did absolutely nothing to my spouse .
so for some , the mind funk obviously works .
thanks for reading ; )
this office is so unorganized and unprofessional .
i am very disappointed with my experience .
they had no idea how to help me with my tooth pain .
i do not recommend his place .
please read the yelp reviews !
it would have helped me to make a better decision .
i too , purchased a groupon and over paid .
i felt so embarrassed .
the tip suggestion started at $ 15 for just good .
i felt the massage was counter productive after that .
i just moved and we are on a budget .
i paid for the actual service , so do n't suggest a higher tip .
i rather they hike the price but that 's their game i guess .
get you in the door and then after , surprise ! ! ! !
please let me know !
sorry , i wanted to write something amazing about you guys .
i was excited but i ended up feeling insulted .
beware of dr sharif ! ! ! !
beware of this `` doctor '' !
his office and him are extremely unprofessional !
it has been hell from the beginning with this surgeon !
for starters my mother checks in for surgery , 6am .
the chicks in his office confirmed the week prior they will get them .
and he obviously shows up to the hospital without the mri or prepared .
no one called or advised her they needed it or did n't have it .
he walks out to call his office .
i run and go get the disk , come back .
he tells us , i cant do the surgery .
this is too rushed and i just cant do it today !
and mind you my mom is in excruciating pain and desperately needs this surgery .
he has to follow up on the surgery he preformed .
this surgeon could n't care less about his patients !
and will kill or paralyze you .
if at all possible see a different doctor !
my 6yo son went in for a filling and 2 root canals .
he was nervous , but everyone promised him it would n't hurt .
he gave 5 novacaine/lidocaine shots .
2. charlie brown just proceeded to drill without testing for numbness .
he proceeded to drill again , and my son screamed again .
dr. brown 's frustration was obvious .
again , no test for numbness .
my son screamed again , and was now crying .
i was frozen in shock , and regret not interjecting .
dr. brown drilled again , and my son freaked out , sobbing .
nope , not numb .
this injection was more painful , and again , no topical anesthesia .
that 's when we realized the bites were way off .
who does crown work and fillings without bite adjustments afterward ?
it was short notice , and the earliest i could get in was noon .
we had to wait until monday .
my son cried a lot in his sleep that night .
not enough to wake himself up , but just soft sobbing throughout the night .
it was heartbreaking to hear .
he 's super diligent about flossing and brushing now .
anything to avoid going back to the dentist .
correction i asked for the paper work in may , got charged in june .
requested paperwork again then did n't retrieve the email .
then finally the 3rd time requested email .
girl up front not very interested in helping .
i asked if they could call in and have someone help her ?
got more sassy attitude and she spoke to me like i was not intelligent .
i guess im crazy .
left immediately and wo n't go back to a location that hires rude idiots .
i was forced to come here during a short vacation .
they tried to connect with me and make sure that i was comfortable .
i had sat in my room waiting for the results of my blood test .
is n't that how you ended up here in the first place ?
this nurse had no right to say that to me .
i just wish that she would have been more polite about it .
that is no way to treat a patient that is paying for their stay .
anyway , my experience was eh .
i really liked this office on my first visit .
now i am beyond frustrated .
not sure how they stay in buisness .
easily the worst doctor i 've ever been to .
she does n't listen and only pushes birth control on you .
the staff rarely answers the phone .
i had an issue last year and she was sent for an ultrasound .
now less than 6 months later the issue has returned .
i would not recommend this place for anyone .
very rude receptionists ( not all but some ) .
do n't take it personally !
also the deli is having very limited number of choices for the crowd .
for me this is not a recommended place .
i went in for an x-ray at this facility and that went fine .
there was a wait but whatever ... the real pain came after my appt .
it has been a joke .
i wish i looked at the yelp reviews before switching to this location .
compare offices..mesa has the worst rating .
( i 've never had a problem with the scottsdale office ) .
their office staff has zero empathy .
*do not visit this office* i needed to be seen for 2 things .
1. foot pain 2. tb test .
then they sent me a bill on top of that for $ 139.86 .
further- dr. patrick tested my thyroid and the test came back normal .
i was then referred to a thyroid specialist by dr. patrick .
when i questioned this he stated i needed to see an endocrine specialist .
it 's not the first time i 've had to remind them either .
i am saying this because i went somewhere else and it uncompareable .
i had previously written a good review but i am changing that .
no prelude , no explanation , nothing .
so this can drag on ?
i am sorry but this is my life , my baby ! !
hello anger & frustration , there you are .
a few things about this clinic that gave me a negative impression .
the reasons i was given did n't add up .
my advice : install the 'calm ' app on your smartphone .
you have the app with you as long as your phone is with you .
i wish i could have given a zero star .
i went there with severe throat pain due to pharyngitis .
i was seen by mr peter who behaved very rudely with me .
i spent so much money to hear these things .
very ill mannered and rude physician .
my wife made an appointment after finding out she was pregnant .
if i could leave less than one star , i would .
i dont know who tge 4 star reviews are by .
they must be relatives of the owners .
this place was the worst place ever for my mom .
my mom was the very first resident at hacienda .
i began complaining about issues happening .
they did not bandage huge open wounds that got very infected .
several times i visited my mom and there was blood all over the floor .
but was dried so it had been there for a while .
there is so much more .
if anyone wants more info , you can email me at thegiftingstore @ gmail.com .
dr. delee isnt the problem its the front office .
i like dr.delee but after my twins im switching to another ob .
his front office is just horrific and rude .
i listened to it .
so , i got a second opinion .
i did just say that .
there is no cavity .
the tooth is literally fine .
and as for the other two fillings dr. keller told me i needed ?
that was one thing that this new dentist could agree with dr. keller on .
and i had her fill it , and she did an amazing job .
so , dr. keller should be embarrassed .
heck , i would be .
i would never lie to a patient .
get your wallet out !
this has been my dentist for five years !
five years , my kids and i have come to this office .
now i call and ask what the balance was for ?
well , the insurance has not paid .
i ask them to call the insurance company .
so i call and stated i need to speak to the office manager .
i leave a message .
she never calls back .
five years i have been coming here .
i explain that i have- how did all the other bills get paid .
did they check in on the reimbursement ?
no they did not .
i state they told me they would- i 'm told that 's my job .
when i call i am left on hold .
my emails are unanswered .
no one answered , thus leaving the bill unpaid and a balance for me .
so many fake reviews ! ! !
i ca n't stand that .
i went to this place for contacts .
seems a bit expensive overall .
if you like care salesman tactics this place is for you .
it 's all about selling you !
i was ignorant towards this type of `` business '' .
they convince me i need major testosterone !
money hungry businesses that 's who !
never a discussion further .
i made one last attempt to go i to the office three weeks ago .
this was the worst experience !
my blood pressure is 184/111 dangerously high !
what do they do ?
he said it did n't matter i still owe it .
he walked out , now i 'm in the .
what real dr does this ?
plus never explaining what the additional charge was that they were demanding me pay .
i have contacted an attorney who says i have a solid case .
this practice should be ashamed of themselves !
please stay away read all these complaints on yelp .
this office does the same thing to everyone !
go to to an md who is not a quack !
it feels like the staff does n't care about their patients .
i am fairly disappointed with custom eyes in general .
so obviously , with the information given , you plan your day accordingly .
the person with the key arrives few minutes late .
i go in to check-in and sat there waiting .
he was thorough and was explaining what each machine does .
she apologized for her tardiness .
she was knowledgeable and informative and asked if i had any questions for her .
in the end , i left the office at 11:30am .
made an appointment the day before was sent the email that confirmed the appointment .
that morning i was offered an on call shift at work .
when arrived they had no record of my appointment .
even though i had text a message confirmation and email confirmation .
cost me big money .
the girls all were very rude , and took no responsibility .
it 's time to look into a receptionist .
the results of a 24 hour urine test were reported on myquest.com .
i called quest to explain the error .
my trust in quest is seriously eroded .
i can only wonder at the quality of the results from other tests .
practice is 4.5 stars ! !
but dr. mckenna should receive zero stars for bad business practices ! !
if you care about ego , status and popularity then go for it .
saw the nurse practitioner who was great !
she diagnosed the issues and recommended treatment .
next appointment was with dr. mckenna since he would be performing the treatment .
standard doc ... friendly , knowledgeable .
nothing special that would wow you .
she said she would call us with a potential date .
being popular among rock stars ?
not ent patients ? ? ? ?
i do n't care about a rock doctor !
i care about my step-daughters issues ! ! !
i have been going here for three years as a self pay .
i am never greeted by the girls at the front .
i now have insurance and am currently looking for a new doctor .
i have never felt so undervalued .
no bedside manners and extremely dissatisfied for life with the services rendered .
this place is a joke .
after 3+ hours waiting to see the dr , i had to leave .
i had no choice i had to get back to work .
i had a bad a experience with this place some months ago .
literally an hour later still did not get called back .
so , i just left .
they never called or e-mailed me to apologize .
i was there for a free consultation .
if possible to find another neurology center , i would recommend doing so .
i was diagnosed with sleep apnea years ago .
i need a cpap machine .
i started the process with them in march .
it is now july , and i still have weeks more to wait .
you guys deal with sick people all day .
do you like working here ?
her attitude changed really quick .
extremely inconvenient and literally no regard for my moms and my time/ money .
surprised this place has no reviews .
maybe they pay to have them removed .
i received the initial consultation at the desert location .
everyone including the dentist seemed professional enough .
by the looks of the office they are by no means a high-end facility .
they picked me up which i thought was a nice service .
i heard everything i needed to hear at this point .
i decided i would not continue with the advised plan .
super shady and i will be letting the insurance company know about these scammers .
seriously i had an 8 am appointment and it 's been nearly an hour .
there is literally one woman tuning the show .
she is checking in , doing the paperwork and then sucking the blood !
worries about the quality of anything and tired of waiting ! !
joke of an office .
if you can avoid it at all , never go here .
office staff that is rude and does n't care .
they ignored a lady crying in a wheelchair in the office .
i had to help her pull out her dl and insurance card .
they could n't have cared less .
she actually wrote resolved for the vertigo on my check out sheet .
tell my body that , you half wit not even a nurse .
now there 's dr. yu .
who at first seems okay .
very thick accent , but does n't seem to remind repeating things .
because their are n't , for him .
he 's not taking it so he does n't care .
six ? ? ? ?
one or two i could see , but 6 ? ! ? ! ?
guess he 's weak in math , as he is in being a neurologist .
they had my vertigo as resolved ( spoiler alert : it is n't ) .
how stupid are you , dr .
yu ? ? ? ?
how much do n't you give a fuck ? ? ? ? ?
i 'll be `` short '' about the wait times .
they 're fucking forever .
if you get in by 8 a.m. you might get out by 11'ish .
have an afternoon appt ?
hope i 'm alive to get her call .
seriously , what a shitty office this is .
my name is renee noyes this place dragged me along for over two years .
sat there and argued with me that i always had scoliosis .
they write stuff to cover their own butt and dr. daftari is the worse .
he refused to help me with pain .
i can not walk or stand with out pain still to this day .
i can not sit because of my tailbone pain .
i can not look down because something is wrong with my neck .
i do not recommend going to them .
i do not trust them .
i finally have pain doctor that is helping with pain .
dumb jerks i tell them that because i am home bound and hurt .
why even give a star .
worst place to come to .
staff is very unprofessional .
but yet everyone that came in after you is seen .
the staff should be more courteous and people friendly .
instead of seeing you as a disease .
well-oiled machine my foot .
i asked for a referral and the referral department has yet to call me .
it has now been three weeks .
also , the billing department attempted to double charge me for my copay amount .
most importantly , dr. irene delorenzi has some serious likeability issues .
rather cold bedside manner and a condescending nature .
time to switch pcps ... again .
thanks for the runaround , wfp .
the waiting at this facility is unreal .
i have donated several times and it seems like the wait time has doubled .
it 's is closer to 4 hrs now .
they have no sense of urgency .
their workers will stand around and chat .
i do n't understand why they allow this behavior to continue .
it 's sad that they are okay with that kind of customer service .
the people who work here even seem to hate their job .
i would never recommend this place to anyone .
it 's not worth the little money you get for the time it takes .
he offered a $ 20 consult .
i purchased the option for me and my husband .
he used a divide and conquer sales method .
this place feels like a mult-level marketing scam !
we have since found a reputable provider .
please , please , i beg of you go somewhere else !
note : this review is for the billing department only .
the doctors and medical staff are excellent ( 5 stars for them ) ! !
i 've already filed a complaint in bbb because of that .
i saw dr. robert j hamburg , md ( great doctor ! ! ! )
please note that the medical performance date is 11/3/2011 .
one year after the service date , i finally knew such bill existed .
beware of the billing department and any bills from this clinic .
hope this review helped .
and again , i do recommend dr. robert j hamburg ! ! !
he 's very very nice , kind , patient , and knowledgeable ! !
and so she set up the appointment for my 2nd sleep study .
i 've been waiting for over a month now .
i 'm just hoping that i will get my results read this month .
for the meantime , i 'm still waiting ( sigh )
i agree a lot with sarah louise .
i love the exterior and the storefront .
like sarah , i found the instruction to be below average .
i will likely use up my groupon but then move on .
i had an 8am appt time .
they were already more than an hour behind for walk ins .
she tries to put my info in the computer and it does n't work .
their computer system was down .
i waited two weeks to get a morning appt .
i took time off from my job to do this lab .
another useless big corporation not caring or making any effort to actually help people .
this location only staffs 1 person to do all the jobs at the lab .
i would give it negative stars if possible .
i agree with katelyn b review .
the place is pathetic as i wrote before .
which mind you was pre approved by them ! ! ! ! !
i am an 800 credit score .
i paid every office visit when they asked .
they handled this situation in a very unprofessional matter and were extremely rude .
including the head person linda who was just not nice .
she will come off very nice but she is not !
remember my previous review was deleted because they were being exposed by me .
do not go here !
this should be illegal .
do not go here ! !
absolutely no way i would have my exam started within an hour .
this is why i scheduled my appointment .
never seen this office so disorganized and uncaring .
i left and will not be returning .
however , in our very next appointment , they make us wait for 2.5hrs ?
how unfair is that ! !
i 'd complained about allergies all my bleeping life southwest medical just gives pills .
got ta call tomorrow and that 's okay , it 's almost 5 pm .
to just summarize it all .
slow service they seem to drag things so you pay another co-pay .
i find them incompetent .
this place was just awful .
the whole time i felt like i was getting ripped off .
will never come back .
we knew everyone there and service always great .
since avella bought it the operation has been chaos .
not good medicine and not good business .
going to walgreens down the street .
can not believe this place is even open
the dentist was very quick-almost made me feel like a number .
the hygienist was downright rude .
each visit brought on multiple issues with their staff acting unprofessionally .
will never recommend anyone in serious pain to this hospital !
brought my nephew in today because he has a fever .
we were told that a pediatrician will be available to see him .
after checking in , we were seen by a nurse practitioner instead .
then recommended to insert a catheter to draw his urine to check for uti .
we disagreed & asked to see s pediatrician .
for ear infection , i already know the doc is amoxicillin .
they did not even asked for these symptoms .
yes , he has dry cough .
so we refused catheter insert for uti test .
i said no , it 's otc & we already have it at home .
omg , otc advil/tylenol/motrin is q4h or q6h .
where is informed consent ?
no one bother to follow this as health care providers .
i 'm a health care provider myself but not in pediatric .
u just do n't try to shove medications or procedures on to patients .
so glad i came with my nephew today .
when you love your market you love it , it 's simple .
then at the juice bar they no longer take punch cards , why ?
i will not be going back .
my insurance covers a standard exam , including dilation .
both her and the paperwork made it sound like it was basically mandatory .
finally , they refused to tell my inter-pupilary distance .
their refrigirated section is discusting .
it has not been cleaned in eons .
needless to say , i wo n't be going here anytime soon .
there 's a giant eagle in the same area .
i ask myself why i did n't go there ?
but then after meeting the doctor my mind definitely was change .
so i guess they did n't want my money .
i wanted the 2 for $ 70 glasses with the included exam .
i just do n't get it .
honestly the whole thing was really stupid .
definitely not going back here .
the staffs in this loblaws are very unfriendly .
they ignore customers , give wrong information , and yell at customers .
it 's always freezing here , bring a sweater .
wait time is really long .
hmmm what about drs orders ?
i did everything he asked and ordered .
nevada healthcare needs to step it up a few notches .
horrible `` dr '' .
hopefully you wont make the same one .
this plan is unhealthy .
and most of the meals are just bland and fatty .
they all have this similar taste which gets revolting after a few weeks .
went today and i have insurance with a copay .
i did n't consent to it , so they would n't see me .
as long as someone else is paying they are fine .
called to make an appointment because i read such great reviews .
which one was it ?
lost my interest in this place that fast .
my midwife was lisa , the founder of the company .
despite being a late transfer , i felt confident in my decision .
however , this is when the first red flag flew .
this is when things went wrong .
it is only a strip after all .
still she was not concerned .
`` i do n't like to do internal exams .
you look alright to me '' .
i left feeling unheard and slightly embarrassed .
about four hours in , i developed a backache .
i dealt with it for an hour but it progressively got worse .
i also developed nausea and fatigue .
maybe i 'm just sitting wrong ?
all in a condescending tone .
we got a hotel .
i was there thirty minutes before i knew something was terribly wrong .
they took me to the nearest er .
i was admitted for two miserable days , fighting pain , fever and nausea .
my poor baby had to be monitored due to high heart rates .
after all this , i simply ask you proceed with great caution .
you may be lucky and nothing goes wrong , but god forbid it does .
indeed , they are a business despite trying to appear otherwise .
proceed with care sisters !
thanks for reading this review .
do n't be fooled by their fancy office , and their well-dressed receptionists .
they still owe me 1000
speed read 1 ) made from real beans , right there .
2 ) i do n't like their sale tactic .
when i buy take out , i usually do n't examine what 's inside .
i bought it from here many times .
well , some time i am not happy with what i got .
stay away from this place unless you have time gas and money to waste .
# 5 the listening sessions only give you a glorified nap .
plus they repeat these listening sessions .
i 'm not the only one see online for more reviews .
waste of time money and additional stress .
walk away - you could get a good 5 star vacation for $ 1500 .
dr. steinbrunner needs to take a patient/ doctor communication class .
be honest , explain treatment , results , possible risks and outcome .
how do you know a week later that i have a bad infection ?
that was the end of our relationship .
do not go here ! ! ! !
now they say no that it goes toward next service .
do not use this voucher .
i tipped her $ 20 too .
she entered the room and went right to work , which felt very uncomfortable .
so i 'm giving her a star for her time .
worst company ever to deal with ! ! !
stop over treating ! ! !
this place is a joke !
do n't recommend ! !
my primary care doctor advised that i see both a neurologist and ent specialist .
they had recommended phoenix neurological associates .
when i called , we went through standard information gathering .
then the scheduler asked me what i was being seen for .
my gp advised that i see a neurologist for a reason .
poor customer service and very rude .
the guy that helped me had a cup in his mouth the entire time .
he hurt my arm as well .
will not be returning to that location again .
i had $ 120 and that was it .
today , i stopped in there because i really need new glasses .
my current pair was about 7 years old .
i picked out a $ 150 frame and brought it to the counter .
now it 's a different lady at the front .
why do n't i have an eyeglasses script on file ?
i guess the $ 200 dollar eye exam did n't include an eyeglasses script .
my script has changed very little since early 90s .
i did not need another exam , i 'm tired of this highway robbery .
this place seems to really like the money grab so beware .
in response to dr. rios ' angered reply .
why doe n't $ 200 cover for a glasses script ?
what lobbyist out there wanted a state law to renew eyeglass scripts annually ?
can you say `` special interests '' ? ? ?
where do you see blackmail ?
that statement about blackmail alone makes me think you are wacko .
i am completely satisfied with my new glasses and i see great .
thanks for your concern about the health of my eyes , though !
how would he know if my script was the same since the 90s ?
he only saw me once and i brought no previous records with me .
i do have an exuberant personality , i do n't deny that .
when i got the the counter it was twice that amount .
he mentioned that the `` eye care community '' had recently discovered this information .
let 's divide their services .
their technicians , on the other hand are excellent .
duh , maybe because it was never written up ? ? ?
they 've been able to take care of almost every problem i 've had .
maybe $ $ $ ?
i have been on hold trying to schedule an appt .
for over 33 minutes now .
you guessed it - scheduling .
i 'm right back where i started .
if i could ... i would seriously give this place 0 stars !
this is a medical center !
very rude service being that they are working at a medical place .
i suggest or recommend to go to a different medical center / hospital please !
i am doing everyone a favor out there .
if there was a no star it would be my choice ! ! !
i have kept quiet for months & i 'm done .
after waiting 3 months to get my dentures i have had it .
today 's visit was icing on the cake .
tried to fit me today with my completed dentures .
the lowers are looser than the ones i have .
the tech kept grinding the dentures trying to get the bite right .
i was told they would be fixed & done by wednesday .
well i 'm not going back .
they sure have almost $ 2500 in their pocket tho .
i will be pursuing any & all resources to get a full refund
i was just standing there waiting to be acknowledged .
hope you can resolve this issue asap !
thank you but no thank you .
good luck to you i hope your experience is a better one .
they have compensated me for my gas given vip cards and everything !
i purchased a groupon and scheduled an appointment online .
the appointment was confirmed and i arrived 15 minutes early .
luckily , groupon is awesome and refunded me .
the ladies at the front desk are completely rude and unprofessional .
i live about 30 minutes away from the clinic .
came in 30 minutes before closing .
mind u drove all the way there again .
just completely rude and unorganized .
need to staff and system and a better team .
i went to my appointment today .
one of the workers came in to do another eye exam .
what is the point of having him there ?
i told her to get the doctor .
i walked into the waiting area furious .
it does n't make any sense .
she has to call the main office to get my money back .
steer clear of this place unless you like to waste your time .
***their office called me today - said they wo n't refund my money .
i literally signed up for yelp just to leave this review !
i could not agree with her more ! ! ! ! ! !
i 'm shocked because she described my experience as well !
i mean zero interest ! ! !
she was combative and dismissive the entire time .
do not waste your time or money ! !
all they seemed interested in doing was writing prescriptions .
this was the most god awful medical service i 've ever had .
i could have received more insightful health information out of a vending machine ! !
we hope you feel better .
the back area is very smelly as well .
have had better service honestly but the gel was painted decently .
we live far & have been with clinic over 3 years !
french manicure was carelessly applied .
dr. leroy kareus was my initial doctor , but sadly he passed away .
in my own opinion , he was the 'gentle soul ' of that practice .
my appt was sch late afternoon the day prior by the orthopedic office .
i knew and the orthopedic office knew my insur required referral approval .
no on answers and a mesg comes on advising their closed .
really smh , so what exactly happened ?
how was that over looked ?
definitely improvements needed in that dept .
5 to the gal up front , thx !
worst of all : they expect a minimum tip amount .
they expected a minimum of 30 % .
they kept shouting at me that they wanted more tip .
and then they said it was a required tip minimum .
are they crazy ? ? !
do n't go to this place .
i was very unimpressed .
i used a groupon that i got for a 60min swedish massage .
i would n't say it was worth even the discounted price .
the woman who did my massage was not friendly at all .
she barely said anything and was somewhat snippy and cold throughout .
it just felt very cold and sterile .
i would n't return for a massage .
the man who worked there seemed nice , though !
my dog went four days without her chemotherapy as promised .
roadrunner did not process my order for five days because of their oversight .
i called multiple times to get my dog 's chemo .
shipping is advertised to be free and in three days .
my first and last experience !
stay away ! ! ! ! ! ! !
he does n't deserved a star but i have to put one to proceed .
2 ) they lost my script .
who has the answer ?
your guess is as good as mine ! ! !
lost of a script is unforgivable ! ! !
major disappointment ! ! !
same company , two totally different experiences .
clearly i will be taking my business to the one that deserves it .
i went to this dentist yesterday .
though i will never go back to them they had an extremely nice staff .
i loved the receptionist , dental assistant and doctor .
do not walk in to this `` walk-in '' clinic .
arrived the second they opened , still waited 3 hours and had to leave .
way overbooked and only care about the copays .
currently have an infection that showed up a few days after my vasectomy .
procedure went well and there was no pain during .
i 'm sick and need medicine , get some pep in your step !
honor your appointment times !
from the moment i walked into this place , i felt some off vibes .
the counselor i was set up with was awfully judgemental and made me uncomfortable .
she was prying too much into religious views and such .
just another one that doesnt get that not everyone is religous .
i 've been going to this practice for over a year now .
this is the second time they have charged my card without permission .
charges and overdraft fees because the money was n't there .
i am done with this office !
when they were at their old offices service was great .
never had to wait more than 10 minutes beyond my appt .
when they moved to a larger office it all changed .
three weeks ago i went in for a 10:30 appt .
she asked if i wanted to reschedule and i said yes and left .
yesterday i went back for my rescheduled appt .
i now have a recommendation from my doctor for a new dermatologist .
i had my appendix removed earlier this year by this doctor .
it was the worst experience of my life .
well guess what ... he did n't care .
he instructed his billing department to move forward with billing me .
please email me privately for that website address .
do yourself a favor and run from this doctor .
do not let him operate on you .
or you only have yourself to blame if you do .
never had such bad food in there
my initial thought was this is a really nice pharmacy , esthetically .
however , it be better managed .
i was in the area and had my drs .
i was not feeling well .
two medications were called in and i was instructed to start them immediately .
this pharmacy was close to closing and my drs office had already closed .
she said they can call it to my local avella pharm near me .
i then had returned to the cashier line to pay for my item .
she paused awhile and asked the pharmacist if she could do that .
i mean seriously ... rocket science here or just common sense ?
she finally checked me and the other customers out .
i wish avella would have been up front with my drs .
office from the initial phone order .
i would have gone to another pharmacy to get the meds that were prescribed .
the doctor seems like he just rolls out of bed and comes to work .
good thing i use a new doctor now .
do n't waste your time people .
i have enjoyed this place in the past .
unfortunately on sunday i had a miserable experience .
i was told i would be contacted and never was - very poor service .
once again i got burned by this location .
i always say i 'm not going back but somehow end up there .
today put me over the top .
the parking lot is hands down the worst in the city of cleveland .
i almost got hit 3 times by other drivers .
they need to have separate cashier who only deals with this form of payment .
i can not recommend them based on this .
so we got there around 10pm and it was not that busy .
service there was two ladies and one guy .
they could not really understand english so they there was a language barrier .
they we 're all nice but i did n't feel welcome .
i guess that 's better than massaging soft .
overall i would not return to this foot massage because i got ripped off .
the guy stopped us and said we had to tip a minimum $ 10 .
this is the worst most unorganized slowest cvs i have ever dealt with .
this particular visit i set in the drive-thru for at least 14 minutes .
cvs at 44th street and bell please get your act together !
if i could give this dr a negative 5 , i would .
he is the worst doctor i have ever came across .
i would not recommend this doctor to my worst enemy .
unfortunately , as a 40 year old male i had my first er visit .
unfortunately , it was at mountainview hospital .
they took over 3 hours to provide any treatment of any kind .
i felt very alone and helpless in their care .
not a very compassionate hospital .
it felt like that was the accepted culture at mountainview hospital .
this is only a summary of my experience .
stay away if you can !
the office manager amanda has no idea what she is doing .
i tell her that is the definition of insanity .
doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result .
do not ever come here for help or treatment in the medical field .
the worst run doctors office i have ever seen .
i see better management and workmanship at a mcdonalds or mexico .
receptionist had very poor phone etiquette !
no customer service at all and absolutely no aloha .
place seems like a serious scam !
i was told they only accept new `` functional medicine clients . ''
besides the fees they would bill my insurance .
what a joke ! ! !
craziest first phone call i 've ever had to a `` professional doctors office ''
you can go to a fine clinic just up the road for $ 39.00 .
so happy i will only have to be here for one test .
nice jennifer main piece and others i 'm not familiar with
staff were unhelpful from the first call to until my appointment departure .
dismissive staff , terrible communication .
had to pay for parking to be dropped off ! !
avoid if at all possible .
this dentist office is a joke .
i paid and left .
there she did not feel the pain and was numbed correctly .
i know saturdays are convenient but i recommend waiting and getting into another office .
one of them then proceeded to ask me why i was visiting today .
i was n't too sure if i missed something .
ever since dr. doyne passed away this place as went to poop .
they dont listen to your needs .
which i found out by personally calling my quest .
the answering company answers the phone more than they do .
and no the answering gas service will not pass on the message .
i would n't recommend this place for my worst enemy .
it had went so far down hill that is not even funny .
i did n't feel like they even tried to help .
the absolute misleading place i 've ever been to .
i was quoted 2 different prices 2 different times .
this place does dishonest business .
the staff is unprofessional .
smirked the entire time and looked like she was about to laugh any minute .
is this how you treat all of your patients ?
sorry , i just ca n't recommend this place .
the doctor was great but the staff was awful .
three weeks later , i was still trying to track down my order .
you 're supposed to guess when your prescription comes in .
i left with all the knots i came in with .
the massage therapist kept walking out of the room .
i gave her a good tip on the original amount because i felt bad .
the service did n't deserve a tip at all .
it was n't even close to the full length of time , but whatever..
this urgent care is the worst i have ever been to ! ! ! !
i would never recommend this place to anyone .
so bring a 1rst time patient i arrived to see dr tanarya at 2:30 !
she gave me two prescriptions one for back pain and another for muscle relaxer !
no one 's answering the phone .
miss placed my drivers license and insurance card .
well my first impression is my last impression of that place .
i 'm sure this is a more profitable area for them .
had a groupon to this place .
she disnt speak english so i could n't really have a conversation with her .
i sat there for about 25 minutes and finally somebody walked in .
then my 30 minute detox was 20 minutes .
i never recieved the email .
this place was horrible and far from relaxing .
i recommend not coming here at all .
shame on devin luzod .
i saw dr. chasby today and left crying and frustrated .
i am now permanently marred by his animal .
i booked this appointment a few weeks ago and have been waiting .
no sir , i am not requesting that .
this experience was completely unprofessional on multiple levels .
thank you for wasting my time today dr. chasby .
i 'm reviewing the minute clinic .
i went in for an ear infection the other day .
i think i 'd only go here for vaccinations , if that .
what a ridiculous way to run a business .
sorry to cut down on spreading germs .
will not be returning here .
scheduling staff was unfriendly and lacked compassion .
do n't waste your money .
i do not recommend this plastic surgeon .
never had this happen in my life before .
massage was good but pricey .
staff is rude , loud and obnoxious !
they curse out loud ! !
waiting room is old couches and chairs that are ready to fall apart .
tv has a dial and antenna .
rooms are small with no decor .
the doctor is up front and fast .
tell her what you need and she will give you a perscription for it .
be very skeptical of this establishment if you get your teeth cleaned here .
' ... yeah , right .
i was also charged a $ 30 co pay for virtually nothing .
no mention of periodontitis or cavities .
the 2nd dentist never told me that i needed laser gum treatment .
they will likely try and sell you expensive dental services you do not need .
dr. prabhu is terrible and his staff is even worse .
another doctor used to work here who was much , much better .
i did n't get to work with him very long , because he quit .
you look like a bunch of fools every time i come in .
i ca n't wait to find a new doctor .
you 're the worst in las vegas .
you need to write your cpap prescriptions for a full year or a lifetime .
i actually use mine every single day and need it to live .
you should be ashamed of yourselves .
you 're not medical professionals in my mind .
all you do is rip off and inconvenience everyone who walks in here .
you deserve to go out of business .
i visited this center twice .
both times , i felt dismissed and not heard .
`` essure '' in my fallopian tubes .
the doctor never called to consult or ever followed up .
i 'm truly grateful i did my own research and changed the plan .
oh , i wo n't be returning here .
ive been coming here for over 3 years now .
pros : doctors are nice and helpful .
assistants are great at blood draws and pleasant , kind .
cons : absolutely horrible communication regarding payments and insurance .
front staff is rude and does not know how to explain anything regarding insurance .
never told me there was a check in time and an appointment time .
never calls back when they say they will .
ca n't keep track of client history .
is my mental health really that much a priority to them ?
obviously i will be finding a new doctors office .
one of the most uncomfortable , unprofessional experiences i have ever had .
but , i paid what i was told what i owed .
then out of the blue , they billed me for over three hundred dollars .
there was no reason why , just a bill .
save yourself some trouble and go somewhere else .
the worse service i had ever received .
save your stress level and pick a different office
the staff is nice , but the wait times are *ridiculous* .
my husband saw dr. bradford 14 years ago and had a wonderful experience .
it 's a shame that the medical profession has lost all compassion and understanding .
there is no paul b , owner .
the practice is owned by dr. bellota and her husband dr. a. bist .
unethical behavior should not be tolerated .
i have screenshot and documented all correspondence with this office .
do not accuse me of making things up .
my appointments were all 5 mins long !
do not comment on my mental health .
do not assume i expect to be cured overnight .
first , do no harm !
that 's a medical malpractice suit waiting to happen .
this just adds on to the incredibly unprofessional and subpar treatment i received .
the beaurocracy here is absurd .
i have nothing nice to say about their service .
if i could give this business a zero , i would .
i had extreme dizziness being on their program .
it was to the point that i could hardly go to work .
i saw two different doctors and they confirmed it was due to the program .
my experience was not as positive as that of the other reviewers .
he seemed rushed and disinterested .
i 'll give you a referral . ''
and then he was gone .
he practically left skid marks .
he was a real jerk with no bedside manner at all .
i felt sorry for the women working in his office ; they seemed nice .
he was a real asshat .
have had to use them for just about 2 years for regular supplies .
both derms suggested i increase the rx .
i would n't recommend spectrum to anyone .
just remember that this is your journey and your child .
who enjoys seeing negative online reviews and ratings about his or her business ?
is now heading towards an evening appt . !
they said they were still pending insurance verification .
why does this process take so long ?
so , i waited another week or so and i called them again .
( when was somebody going to call me and let me know this ? )
there is no available appointment time .
i never heard back from them again , so i called them again .
this is where i am done .
i will find a place that can manage it 's business office .
your office practices have caused a serious delay in my son 's care .
0 stars is more like it .
new parents , do n't waste your time this place is a joke .
this happens to my husband and i every time .
are you kidding me !
i called my location for the document for a reason !
providers are wonderful but do n't expect to see the same provider ever .
even if you schedule out , something always seems to go wrong here .
again do n't waste your time with this awful staff .
wish i did not have to rate this office .
sending us to the 3rd dr to see if someone can correct it .
dr knows both hips are having issues but wants the insurance money first .
they are interested in money and only money .
your first visit is just a questionnaire which you would normally fill out yourself .
i should have left then .
he is all about money .
this is total bs as many of you know who are on adderall .
i asked do you give them medical treatment other than the chiro treatmen .
i was like wtf dude !
like helllooo , i am so sorry i wanted soup .
worst experience ever with a psychiatrist .
and he is a therapist ?
i tried to discuss symptoms with him when he suddenly announced i was depressed .
i am not depressed .
i have extreme anxiety .
do n't waste your money or what is left of your sanity .
never ever go here .
i had two different tests done here .
this place is an absolute joke .
there are many other places in town , go there .
wish i had read the other yelp reviews of people with similar experiences .
stay far away from this office .
had a horrendous experience just trying to make an appointment .
this is my first introduction to this office .
i finally got the receptionist and she said i needed a referral .
i explained i have a ppo plan that does not require referral .
when i questioned her , she hung up on me !
i find this behavior rude and unprofessional .
why should making an appointment be this difficult .
i was referred by a pediatrician to see this md .
i am new to the area and i had no idea what to expect .
i had reserved my judgment of the area -- -they could be good .
my first visit was good , but odd .
i was not told i would see a physician assistant until i arrived-not cool .
i am trying to go with the universe .
i did my labs on the property-yes !
and when you ask questions to the staff , they know nothing .
i just ca n't with them .
my health insurance listed them as an in network doctor .
thank the heavens i do not need referrals .
i am going back to the one medical group .
shows they did n't care about my business ! ! !
do n't dare go to this hell hole .
they ripped me off and the owner is a liar .
its been 6 months and my mouth is still in pain .
i have filed with the state board over my situation .
save yourself heartache and aggravation ... do n't go here .
i had a membership and recently canceled .
my therapist was very pleasant , and it started out great .
it did n't happen .
i was very disappointed and it was the worst massage i 've ever had .
it 's saturday , not a phone call or follow up to be had .
let 's be honest , shopping at marc 's is awful .
they have the most inconsistent inventory ever .
but the absolute worst part is check out .
and what the hell is up with their bags ? ? ?
how is that cost saving ?
in sum , marcs -- the necessary evil for the cheapskate shopper like me .
what an awful experience today at this visionworks location .
talk about zero personality .
honestly , i think the whole experience was a crock .
horrendous place to go too ! !
probably not even real doctors .
bad experience with a female dentist there .
the female doctor there is lazy .
it was so painful that the horrible pain kept me up all night .
i would not recommend her to anybody !
not ever going there again !
definitely suggest retraining bad attitudes only get you so far ... ... never again
the place is clean and the staff is cordial .
they are not about serving their patients .
i have been going to the 4c medical group for quite a while now .
he 's a child .
they get sick sick .
i wish i could give this dental practice zero stars .
very sarcastic also , in an failing attempt to be funny .
then finally they did and mailed my mom her check .
new dentist likes to recommend unnecessary dental work to everyone .
i highly recommend anywhere else .
i called 2/22/18 to make an appointment .
i gave them all my info to get prequalified for my procedure .
was told i would get a call back the same day .
completely unprepared for thanksgiving rush .
every department in disarray .
the office staff is either incompetent , or they just do n't care .
not just a delayed response , zero response .
last time it was 1.5 hours .
dr. aragon seems knowledgeable , but i find her cold and distracted .
does n't make eye contact , does n't seem like she 's really listening .
office is officially closed .
it 's been a nightmare .
my daughter starts allergy shots soon .
so far the office has been great to work with .
one lady turned to another and said they 'd been waiting 90 minutes .
well , to be accurate , 57 minutes .
( yes ) and then asks if it 's metal ?
and i just look at him very level .
and i tell him , very quietly , `` no .
i do n't have any extraneous metal hair ties . ''
this comedy show goes on for a while .
at no time does he come in and say anything .
like- did we have to start over ?
did something go wrong ?
at no time did he offer assistance .
well , no it was n't .
i know , because i can math .
good job , simonmed .
i was highly recommend to dr cummings in this group .
he did not order any diagnostic imaging for the first 3 months .
i was only prescribed physical therapy .
when that failed he ordered mri imaging for my elbow only .
over 6 months later i got surgery on my elbow only .
when that failed to produce real results he suggested injections in my shoulder .
do n't even think about using them for any work related injury .
not worth a single star !
not the greatest service here .
the meat and seafood departments rock but the others , not so much .
i have so many of those stories where people just do n't care .
the one on the strip is superb .
they have their a game going , too many tourists not to .
there is a wonderful lady at check out counter in henderson .
i 'm going to get her name .
she 's happier than a pig in mud every time i go to her .
she makes my trip to whole foods worth it .
always smiling and happy to have a job .
dr. sabouri is a great dr. and person .
i gave been a patient for glaucoma treatment .
i cancelled my appointment for july , manager refuses to return my phone calls .
dr. wellish , your reputation going down for $ 15 .
do n't buy a groupon from this place !
my group of friends & i got screwed !
we were under the impression that there were several employees who could provide service .
first of all : `` vom fass '' ? !
what did you just say ?
and i 'm 30 years old .
fortunately , i heard about this place through word of mouth .
to me , this felt like a pretty disingenuous business strategy .
just do your homework before you buy !
i didnt see one white person in sight .
the produce looked ok ... . i would buy that if it was on sale..
stay away from this pharmacy .
i would give it zero stars if i could .
the medication came and the capsule is over 1 cm long .
i asked for a small courtesy discount , they refused .
wished i could give no stars .
1. clothes on during massage .
2. mandatory tipping 3. no one speaks english ! ! !
4. not licensed masseuse 5. unprofessional beware ... do not waste your money .
my friends and i will never revisit this place again .
i cant tell you how awful this was .
i was `` seen '' yesterday .
1 ) i cant rate a doctor i did not see !
recently moved to a new town , new vet .
called roadrunner to change contact information , shipping address and credit card information .
vet then called in our order .
dog just had a checkup .
vet called in order already .
taking our business elsewhere .
would make ordering so much easier for everyone .
save your money and go elsewhere !
my lashes coming into this place looked so much better .
i did n't understand .
she claimed it was because she did a classic set on me .
regardless , i usually always get classics done and they never looked like this .
they were so short and spaced out .
3 days later everyone ... smh..
came in at 6 pm and was seen at 12 am .
does n't make any sense .
once i had to tell him what i think he should be prescribing me .
i do not trust this facility with my healthcare at all .
this place is a joke .
my advice is to run , find another doctor .
anything is better than this .
the front office staff was very professional .
the reason i see a professional is to get there professional opinion .
i 've never been charged extra to receive this information .
she then proceeded to touch the protective plastic that went into my mouth .
somehow things got worse .
no cash out , i asked what happened .
they said the bank system was down all day .
i find it odd that they were n't telling people that from the beginning .
especially since it had been happening all day .
i heard talecris was better and had better new donor fees as well .
fyi watch the pharmacy techs max and brenda .
she does not communicate well at the drive thru window .
she has messed up our prescriptions in the past .
god forbid you call her out on the phone she yells and becomes argumentative .
brenda is mostly there during the day avoid her .
will not ever go back there .
we are now in may and still do n't have my glasses .
i have been dealing with headaches and having to work straining my vision .
all because of the lack of responsibility and professionalism of this place .
i wish i would 've read the reviews prior to giving them a try .
waiting a month and half for it is unacceptable .
i asked for a refund but was told that all sales are final .
do n't waste your money , time or energy here
i have been a patient of dr. sparks for over 10years .
i have been on physical disability for 22 + years .
2017 was the first year i asked for a pain med ever !
so i went to the pain doctor .
after she parted ways with ( humana ? )
she changed her practice .
she became holistic , and blames all sicknesses of any kind on gluten intolerance .
she pushes homeopathic medication that she sells her self .
updated-after i saw the doctor ?
they ended up finally taking me to the back to see the doctor .
and i waited another 35 minutes and still no doctor .
i ended up walking out as i stated before i had work .
these ppl are a joke !
u might catch their laziness , incompetence and stupidity .
sucks does n't it ?
so what happens now ?
did they warn me ?
it took me over 30 minutes to fill out the paperwork .
yeah she was extremely helpful ... .can u read my sarcasm ? ? ?
so yes i 've been waiting over 40 minutes now to see the doctor .
am i going to be late to work ... .no why ?
i 'm not waiting past another 30 minutes to see the doctor .
cuz that is over an hour that once waited for the doctor .
and i think that is enough .
they should have warned me to come in earlier to fill out the paperwork .
they should have done a lot of things differently .
but i would not be holding my breath .
we did a walk in .
been here several times before with ok service .
it 's been 3 hours now and still 2 people ahead of us .
i had a horrible experience with dr gross .
i would never recommend him and i hope others stay away .
this place is a joke .
i remember when it opened and they were so accommodating .
i used to live around here but now i dont live close .
so i do n't go often .
i walked in today and was on the phone .
coco said `` it 's okay there 's no one here '' .
she asked how long did i want .
then before i could answer she said do you have an appointment ?
i told her no .
i am so pissed .
what kind of company turns away customers .
worst customer service ever .
to make matters worse , the next morning one of her brackets fell off .
was n't that the point of the mold during the first visit ?
at this point , i am so confused .
why would we expect her wire to fall out again ?
and why is it my job to fix it ?
her orthodontist takes an hour and a half to even enter the room .
i have so many concerns and questions at this point .
why isnt the orthodontist more involved with her patients ?
why are dental assistants doing all of the work ?
there is absolutely no communication at all .
it has been a complete nightmare ! !
i was expecting so much more .
i 've just decided to contact the better business bureau .
i would not go back here and would not recommend this dentist !
the patient portal is very useful .
$ 50 is excessive ... but there is value in it if used correctly .
my complaint is the communication or lack thereof .
i 've seen dr. goldman and my wife has seen dr. archabeck .
the doctors are great ... their staff is not .
also ... here 's a negative to the portal .
we received a call from the office to call back asap .
every time i go for a cleaning have a new cavity !
( you 're right because i wo n't be back ! )
after going to another dentist he didnt find any cavities !
so what was the dr going to fill if there were no cavities !
will not be back !
i ordered a vanilla smoothie with almond milk and vegan protein .
umm , excuse me , did i ask for sugar free ?
they should have told me it was sugar free before selling it to me .
they laughed at me .
i am so disappointed in their lack of customer service .
i ended up throwing the second drink away - awful taste .
i 'd probably get better nutrition eating bark off of the tree outside .
you could n't pay me enough money to ever come back to this place .
if i could give no stars i would .
a lot of `` i do n't knows '' .
front staff very very rude , unorganized and unprofessional .
i was very surprised because sante spa in mission is the exact opposite !
this medical facility is an utter disasterous joke .
then today it was reported to me by my pharmacist that my d.o.b .
was incorrect on their records received from wfp .
my family has been going to this practice for more than 10 years .
depression ca n't wait .
this practice has become machine .
get in line and wait to get processed thru .
does the doctor get a kickback ?
i had already informed him of my current brand which is fantastic .
eye doctor tried to push back on this brand he suggested a second time .
i said i would try , once i put them on they sucked .
the lenses i have are silicone hydrogel .
finally he said they would order them .
he changed the damn script on me .
so we had to look through the lenses again .
i think they got a trial box .
i only came here because my eye insurance changed .
never again , i 'm going back to central phoenix eye care .
i 'm changing employers and insurance anyway , might as well lump this in .
i wo n't be back .
this review is for our experience 9/2015 .
no problems setting an appointment or being seen in a timely fashion .
i decided to just go somewhere else to fill the cavity .
and now my wife has to wait again ! ! ?
and walmart is faster and they give you a courtesy call .
last time i will be here .
i do not recommend this place .
if there was a no star button i would 've gave it no star .
waste of my damn time .
and i paid in full right away .
now the worst part for me is trying to get a refund from him !
`` , just because i said that i felt i should do a review !
what a terrible dr ! !
we brought our toddler in with thrush .
the website is substandard by 1992 standards .
there are forms for download , but they are the wrong forms !
my wife and i were going to be seen here because we live close .
she said , `` probably not '' .
i told her that my wife wanted to be evaluated for braces .
we would have had to re-register with a whole new dentist .
the ledgers are completely in medical coding , mind you .
not to mention that she asked extremely personal questions to everybody that walked in .
`` are you married ? ''
`` what happened to your girlfreind ? ''
`` what do you do for a living '' etc .
this dentist office is bad .
so , so bad .
edit : this review was meant for the office on desert inn road .
worst bowling alley i 've ever been to .
the lane was extremely greasy , way to much .
the bowling balls were covered and grip of the ball was limited .
it was about 90 degrees inside .
i hit the help button after our lane froze up and nobody came .
( it was us ) .
bad experience all around .
bought the groupon for $ 15.00 .
wo n't be going back .
however , this surprisingly was n't what made me find another dentist .
worst dr office i have ever been to !
if i could give less than one star i would !
now i 'm told there are two people ahead of me !
the same thing happened when they did my colonoscopy .
they did n't even start the procedure until 4 ; 15 !
this appears to be a pattern now !
my time is valuable as well ! ! !
if you have a choice use someone else who perhaps respects their patients !
do n't do it folks , it is noting but one huge headache .
ps amanda - i am not wasting my time reaching out .
please feel free to have someone from your office contact me .
brooke d. can let you know how to reach me .
your life is worth way more then a bill .
they checked me out , said i had a uti and sent me home .
again i went back to mountain view .
where upon telling them my symptoms they told me i was deyhrated .
i had just told the nurse i was unable to keep anything down .
it was even hot to the touch .
but no one touched me .
that day i researched my symptoms online .
i concluded i had appendicitis .
but twice i was told by medical staff that this was normal .
but i knew in my heart that it wasnt .
so that night i made the decision to go to another hospital .
i was rushed into emergency surgery .
i had a c-section and my appendicitis removed .
after mine and my child 's recovery we went back to mountain view .
you decide for yourself .
does n't even deserve one star .
my sister had genetic testing and found out she had lynch syndrome .
wait until i get a chance to speak with them face to face .
my guess is we are not the first family to experience this .
the most rudest staff and filthiest facility i have ever laid eyes on .
not to mention they gossip and laugh about patients diagnosis .
i really like tom willim which is why i give 2 stars .
the office however is like dealing with a bureaucracy .
no one is treated as an individual just another number coming in the door .
they do not listen .
i am so disappointed - really disappointed .
now i may have to search elsewhere .
really - they need to be reminded that their field includes compassion and caring .
do not go here ! ! ! !
i think their reviews are by their employees .
and said , 'no , i looked longer than i normally would ' .
i asked for a refund and left .
i am reporting him to the medical board .
its a terriable allergic reaction , not scabies .
i ca n't believe this man is licensed to practice medicine .
only one star because i had to , but o say zero
now i 'm super annoyed .
one of my prescriptions was called in for the wrong dosage .
i kept checking with the pharmacy .
called both yesterday and twice today .
it has not been corrected , nor have i received a call back .
i never was able to speak with anyone or make an appointment .
after reading the other reviews here , i think i will choose another pcp .
was referred here by my orthopedic surgeon .
suppose to have an appointment with kayla .
kristin willis of planet beach is the reason i 'm writing this negative review .
she refused and said i can help you im the manager .
i left and will never return .
the staff that works the front desk are always super welcoming and friendly .
with that being said , the pharmacy is a totally different ball game .
i went in the other day , needing something from behind that counter .
ugh , are you kidding ?
never going to this specific pharmacy again .
i had very high out of pocket costs .
i do not recommend going to this clinic .
if you are in a hurry , forget about it at this place .
that is all i can say .
this is a long review so stay with me !
i began to see dr. deka for my first pregnancy in october .
before i had even met the doctor that would be delivering my baby .
fine , i thought .
this was my appointment with the np .
the next app was with dr. deka herself .
she seemed nice , knowledgeable and genuine .
ok , i thought , doc knows best right ? ) .
all we covered was that i want a natural birth .
she did not seem interested in anything else i had to say .
day of the delivery : i went into labor at 39 weeks .
my contractions were getting stronger and coming faster .
the nurse was pissed .
dr. deka was pissed .
i did n't care .
my labor was progressing normally and naturally .
she even called it a `` textbook '' delivery .
sounds like some money making tricks to me .
the front office is the best part of the entire practice in my opinion .
they answer your questions , are pleasant and remembered me every time .
it 's the only reason i 'm leaving a two star review .
and no one did .
either way , really terrible customer service and phone skills .
we will never return .
was told this place was amazing and i will never return or recommend .
made me wait two hours and were nothing but rude the entire time .
almost walked out several times .
visited twice and they got nothing done both times .
would n't wish this place on my worst enemies .
beware : unprofessional and in it for the money .
she never asked when i spoke to her on the phone .
her attitude about it was very accusatory and rude .
why would i pay out of pocket ?
they were n't needed and my insurance only covers one every 3 years .
i wasted time there and was not able to get a cleaning .
simply because she wanted money to do an x-ray .
i 'm glad i figured this out before having them get near my mouth .
now i get a message they have reinstated blue cross ?
what 's up , warner practice !
this was my first time visiting a psychiatrist .
i came in seeking help for anxiety and depression .
then she asked which one i think i have ?
and the treatment plan ?
`` there are mood stabilizers and anti-depressants .
here 's what each one does .
which do you think you want or need ? ''
nut shell fragments in my salad almost caused serious dental problems .
we are not talking about large , obvious pistachio shells .
would not come here again .
i ca n't inspect every single bite before i eat it .
eating is a major hassle if i have to do that .
do n't go with the older guy with glasses .
he kept falling asleep during my one hour foot massage .
bought a vegan cake for my sons birthday .
asked if they could write happy birthday on it .
woman tells me ca n't i 'm not a cake decorator .
this store gives zero shits about the customer experience .
they are sending me away and really acting like i am bothering them here !
btw there is nobody else here , not like they 're busy or anything .
just wanted some help and this urgent care failed 100 % .
i have n't had a great experience here .
i didnt even get a crappy prescription for my pain .
so waiting for the weeklong process was uneccesary .
i honestly feel neglected because i 'm generally 'young ' and 'healthy ' .
otherwise it would be $ 50 .
my dental hygienist also put barely any effort at all into cleaning my teeth .
i do n't know if it 's because it was around lunch or what .
one of the most horrible receptionist i have encountered .
her name is tram .
awful , unproffesional , rude , impolite .
taking my business somewhere else because of her !
all they care about is your money .
do n't waste your time and money .
they do n't try to help you .
they 're the worst .
we went to elixir with high hopes given their menu and approach to food .
we arrived and were one of two groups in the entire restaurant .
when the food came it was pretty good .
the only guests in her new restaurant and could n't come out .
i ca n't even begin to wrap my head around that kind of mentality .
then to not come out and introduce herself under these circumstances - just mindblowing .
to have a brand new restaurant opening and not want to come out and greet
we planned a girls day for a friend 's birthday .
they were fairly unapologetic about it .
they need to get it together .
their services are way too expensive to have to deal with all the drama .
save your money and your time , go somewhere else .
during this time , some movement in his lower teeth occurred .
he also stated this was all because my son was not wearing the retainer .
i went to this provider about 3 years ago .
i had my teeth cleaned 5 times within 8 months .
the other dentist i went to was awesome .
i told the dentist that the first cleaning was fine .
then she would charge my insurance as a teeth cleaning .
so she said i needed 3 deep cleanings .
that would be 9 visits .
my insurance would only cover 2 cleanings .
so after the second cleaning , which was the other side of my mouth .
i had to pay full price which was around 150.00 dollars or more .
i still have all the receipts of all the over payments !
i was referred onto dr. yasmin ismail-juma .
on a separate instance , she messed up the routine filling job .
then to fix her error , she offered to perform a free root canal .
beware : i feel demeaned , can not trust yasmin ismail-juma .
shame on the dental practice !
i was visiting las vegas and desperately needed a mani-pedi and a bikini wax .
based on reviews , today nails looked like a good prospect .
really ? ? ! !
extra fee to take off gel polish .
extra cost to cut down nails .
extra fee to do ombré gel on nails .
then made them wait 40 minutes or more .
an expensive lesson learned !
i do n't know but seems fishy , wo n't be back .
then they want to prescribe medication that alter your state of mind .
culinary uses them as a main provider .
it 's a cash cow for harmony .
avoid them do your research .
do yourself a favor .
today was the last straw !
the markings created were not wiped off/removed .
overall i would not recommend going here for anything .
my wife went for a cleaning .
they said she needed a deep cleaning and would not do a regular cleaning .
we paid $ 95 for a smile save plan .
i 've asked for a refund and disputed the charge .
i feel like they were trying to rip us off with the deep cleaning .
i 'll be upfront ... i really do n't like no frills .
but sometimes the price is too good to pass up .
ataulfo mango for 30 cents each ? ?
then i remember that i do n't like no frills .
dr. sakias it 's very unprofessional and very cocky .
his staff was rude they left me in the room with no explanation .
also i supposed to have a prescription nobody ever called it in .
a doctor that ca n't read an mri disk .
dr. j. phillipp is a great dentist , very friendly and professional .
i highly recommend this office for the nice synergy the whole office has !
together with their agape team are caring , professional , thorough and knowledgeable .
each visit is carefully tailored to your current state of being and needs .
the doctors have always been super nice .
my daughter had stitches done , and she was a nervous wreck .
it was very nice .
we have had a wonderful experience with dr. beals treating our son .
i love this place !
this store carries products that i ca n't find anywhere else besides online .
organized , clean , and a huge selection .
best service i 've been in las vegas !
everyone are so nice !
and all the design are perfect
i so disagree with a couple of the reviews i read .
she is very detailed and shows concern regarding all aspects of my health .
i have referred several people to her .
only one word - fantastic !
his staff is excellent , and his art in dentistry and patient care unsurpassed .
cut and dried - dr. goth was outstanding .
he is the man to see in the pittsburgh area .
anthony `` tony '' walker and jennifer hannon are a great team .
they really know their stuff .
beyond knowing their stuff is their continual dialogue with patients .
then we would get into planning for that day and going forward .
i was involved in the therapy .
and we continued in this joint planning over a month of treatments .
good resource for most all of us .
she is a great technician to boot !
i needed a quick appointment and did n't want to wait several weeks .
i took a gamble and picked first available , which was dr. chuang .
i could n't have disagreed more on the negative reviews .
both valley ent and dr. chuang were professional , courteous , thorough and friendly .
i will enthusiastically recommend both to anyone looking for quality healthcare .
i strongly endorse them .
yes , this is as good as it gets !
the whole staff is very professional , kind and accommodating .
not to mention happy !
the hygienists are just the best , as are all the staff .
i highly recommend this whole office to anyone needing work done !
you will not be disappointed .
honestly she did n't even go over it all the way with the laser .
there 's quite a bit of the tattoo that 's untouched .
i 'll be going somewhere else for the remainder .
dr. bang is by far the best chiropractor i 've ever been to .
we actually did n't start adjusting joints until my 4th visit !
my experience with dr. malek has been nothing short of fantastic .
dr. malek was kind while retaining a very professional demeanor .
everything was very upfront .
there were zero hidden charges or unexpected costs .
the results are incrdible .
today my friend and i came in for a body massage .
let me tell you !
very relaxing and clean .
i did n't get my misuses name but she did a fantastic job .

we absolutely recommend this to all of our family and friends .
he is the nicest , most caring sweet attentive doctor i 've ever seen !
i do n't know what i would do without him !
michael tucker is the best !
yes it might just be rice and steamed greens but their sauces enhance everything .
when i come for healthy vegan food , that 's all i really want .
i just wish there was somewhere like this in calgary .
woke up earlier this week with a crazy case of torticollis .
went to the joint on wednesday , thursday , and friday ( today ) .
quick , easy adjustments and i 'm back to *almost* 100 % .
today , i mentioned offhand that i 've had tmj for 3 weeks .
two seconds of adjustments and bam it 's fixed !
what the heck ? !
why did n't i ask about this before ? !
i have a good time here .
i was kind of upset that my previous dentist left .
i wish they would have sent an email or something letting me know .
the staff is really nice .
overall , great atmosphere ! ! !
what 's to say !
it 's a grocery store with what ya need downtown .
pvsec was amazing when our family dog was attacked by a deer .
the staff and doctors were wonderful .

the entire staff from the receptionist to the hygienist , to the dr 's .
have all been very wonderful and patient with a wimp like me .
you will be pleasantly surprised !
this is the most wonderful place to go .

it 's all here .

i have n't had a workout yet that i walked away feeling unchallenged .
what i do like is that the workouts vary from class to class .
i hate cursing and the disparaging comments that often come along with it .
being vulgar does n't make me feel more like a fighter .
my only con is this .
i would like them to offer another option for their classes .
it seems it 's just one deal with $ 99 for unlimited classes .
dr. gawley is the best .
he completed my reconstruction post double mastectomy .
i could not be happier with my final results .
dr. gawley was consistently available for questions both before and after the surgery .
he turned something very scary into an uplifting ( no pun intended ) experience .
his staff is friendly , yet professional .
the staff is also knowledgeable and discreet which is greatly appreciated .
what is n't awesome about this store ? ! ? ! ? !
hands down the best organic grocery/household/beauty product location in downtown toronto .

i purchased a groupon in august to get my eyelashes done .
there were no appointments available until the end of september .
we reschedule for sunday - even though they are n't open sunday .
i reluctantly went ahead and made an appointment with them .
she does n't spend time writing in a notebook as i 'm talking .
i truly am not exaggerating about how wonderful this therapist is .
after every session with her , i feel like a whole new me .
the spa was cozy & the massage therapists were very professional and courteous .
we are definitely going back in the near future .

once you get past the waiting room this is a decent er .
the paid staff ( docs , nurses , med assistants , etc . )
overall though , it 's a decent er .
what a huge relief .
but , it made a big difference for my dad and my family .
you ca n't buy moments like that - thanks easy medical store .
i also liked hearing that she is more into non-surgical solutions than surgery .
i left with many good ideas to think about .
so far so good .
i have been coming to this dentist for years and have felt comfortable here .
these doctors and pas are amazing .
first , you 'll notice that there 's no reception window .
the receptionists sit in the waiting room with ipads to check you in .
there are lots of local offices for this practice .
i 've only been to the chandler office .
personally , i 've found the doctors to be better than the pas .
my last visit was actually with dr. partridge .
i would definitely recommend these doctors to any woman .

dr. tom was so concerned about our girl .
when our girl was slowly recovering dr. tom was so happy too .
this experience made me a true believer in dr. tom and his staff/facility .

we only want the very best for them .

it 's a rare treat to meet such a nice , accomplished professional .
i did not get the milk tea .
i came for the curry fish/beef balls .
it worked out , so that was all fine and dandy .
the curry here is surprisingly aromatic .
i would not liken this to chinese curry .
it smells more like a malaysian or indian curry ?
it 's spicy , in a leaves-your-tongue-tingly-after-eating kinda way .
they 've got a nice texture while being soft .
that was kinda cool .
this place is wonderful !
the staff are helpful and friendly .
highly recommend this place !
this place was amazing !
tried it out with a groupon deal and it exceeded my expectations .

100/100 best obgyn hands down .

i only waited about 15 minutes before i saw the doctor .

plus they were able to fit me in last minute .
when i walked in i was immediately greeted and taken care of .
the facility is really nice and very relaxing .
the lighting and decor is perfect to get you de stressed .
amanda my therapist was great .
she was very informative about the services and the aromatherapy .
she was able to do some great work on my pain points .
amanda was attentive to me and made sure she was n't too rough .

the best part is you feel full but not heavy nor bloated .
definitely worth going back over and over again
had my hair dyed by april recently and she did an amazing job !
definitely my go-to spot for hair and spa services .
the procedure itself was totally painfree .
i am not exaggerating .
i was not even aware when the molar was removed .
it all boiled down to not stretching properly .
i was first seen by a d.o .
( doctor of osteopathic medicine ) who is a medical doctor ( m.d . )
which made me much more comfortable and confident .
i was examined by the d.o .
if you 're not familiar , a radiologist is also an m.d .
( medical doctor ) who specializes in reading and interpreting x-rays .
examined me and x-rays were completed , i was seen by dr. madejek .

dr. madejek was found to be very warm and welcoming .
she took the time to explain everything about my injury and her treatment plan .
this place is so pretty and serene .

he is very friendly and i always feel comfortable with his examination .
i love dr. bateman and his staff and i highly recommend !
my biggest fear was to be rushed out , with little explanation or compassion .
and that 's the exact opposite of what i experienced today .
the staff here was so sweet and caring .
taking their time to listen and make sure every question was answered .
i will recommend him to every one i know , that 's for sure .

tamar is very careful and very knowledgeable- there is a huge difference .
state of the art facility with knowledge staff .
trevor and brian tailored a strength and conditioning program specifically for our rugby club .

2016 yelp review # 38
this doctor is a truly remarkable human being .
it was a miracle that we asked for a second opinion .
his experience and charity work are surely a blessing to encounter under any circumstances .
i wish you nothing but the best .
1st visit : i was greeted by kyli and jill both were very nice .
i watched an information video .
she was so kind and courteous !
i was so happy and relieved !
customer service is of utmost importance to this office and to me .
they are truly top notch !
i adore coming here , especially for their fabulously priced plant proteins !
i needed my annual eye exam and decided to try focused on eyes .
i 'm happy i did !
it was a pleasant experience .
thanks to dr. lucas and her team !
pospisil dentistry is the best !
thanks pospisil team for always making my visits the best they can be ! !
awesome front office staff , great doctors and incredible treatment .
i could n't ask for more !
i am rarely trendy but straight hair lacking frizz tempted me like the devil !
after researching the price throughout the area , i made an appointment .
rina was so pleasant and so far i am very pleased with the service .
i will definitely return when i need a hair affair .
so i started with doing b-12 mic shots .
you would buy 4 shots & do them every week .
i did n't feel sluggish at all .
hcg changed my life !
there is a strict diet you need to go on for 24 days .
mostly eating veggies/fruits , protein .
no oils & sweets .
cindy helped me throughout the whole hcg diet .
honestly it was n't as bad when i did it .
i think it was because i was determined & motivated to lose weight .
i lost 25 lbs alone from the hcg diet !
i 'm telling you hcg is worth it !
hcg really did change my life
i recommend choosing spooner !
btw front desk ladies are helpful with scheduling and explaining benefits .
all in all a great place to get the rehab you need .
i 'm back on my feet ( literally ! )
he is amazing and i 'm very sad he is retiring .
he spends time with to answer any questions .
very knowledgeable and love that he tells you the truth .
we will miss you !
i 've been going to don nobis for a little over two months .
he is one of the sweetest doctors i 've seen .
but surely it has .
i had went to another therapist matt smith .
they ignored me and gave me stuff i could do at home .
here at don 's practice they take care of you .
everyone at anew is so welcoming and friendly .
i appreciate how much time they take to explain options and treatments .
i have n't had a single bad experience !
great massage and great customer service .
i have been going to bonital dental for 2 years .

i know davonna will take very good care of them as well .
best wishes ~ laura in queen creek , az

the road to rebuilding my self confidence started here !
the lady assisting me was helpful and gave some suggestions for lunch .

it totalled just over $ 30 .
i really like chickpea brownies .
so much chocolate and denseness , hit the spot juuuuust right .

the lady offered a 10 juices for ~ $ 100 package .
i am so incredibly happy we started coming here !

so after a month , i cancelled my appointment .
i knew i had to get the work done .
and i was so informed of every action that was happening .
i did n't have to listen to music to distract myself .

it asked `` are you bored of your regular workout routine ? ''

the energy level of the trainers here is incredible .
the theme is , `` never give up . ''
today was just a taste of what their boxing classes are actually like .

) , staff is friendly , and they take a variety of insurances .
i was blown away by her expertise , friendliness , and concern .
highly recommended on all counts !
the relaxation lounges are a must .
especially after a massage .
and then after some time in the steam room , or in the whirlpool .
just anytime , its an experience all on its own !

you can tell they like what they do .
the location is ugly though .
the service is beautiful .
it is wierd though that they have cookies in their lobby .

i got douglas & my bf got brenda as our massusers .
first , the massusers introduce themselves and ask a few questions .
they says to undress completely and go under the covers .
you will be draped with double aheets throughout the service .
the massage beds were heated nice and warm inside a chilled room .
i think douglas used a unscented lotion .
which was great because i am sensitive to weird smelling lotions .
my bf had shea buttter .
douglas started off nice touches and started to hit all my pressure points .
he did my shoulder and back really well .
no facial ( thats separate ) i do feel much better .
a little sore but a good kind of sore .
my bf says it was okay .
at the end of our session they waited outside until we got dressed .
they were waiting with a cup of water .
then we paid and asked for a receipt .
and they do n't give out receipt .
oh wells no biggie .
then our shuttle took us back to the hotel .
now i 'm soft , smooth , and less sore !
the dentists and staff at inspire !

the services were amazing ( massages ) and very good ( pedicures ) .
i had elizabeth a perform my massage .
hunny ... her 30+ years of experience truly showed .
my attendant was very good and was very complimentary of my dry feet .
y'all there were no snacks in the spa .
they had water and i swear two pitiful looking oranges in the bowl .
i was like wth .
every spa must have snacks .
now i know to ask from here on out !
i 'm going to add one more vote of support to the chorus .
essence of life has so many great products and the pricing is great .
in my opinion , dr. schroeder is the best !
i should also note that his staff has been wonderful as well ! !
great place cheap prices friendly staff .
needless to say we went back multiple times while we where there .
this is an awesome shop with a wonderful selection of an eclectic assortment .
the owners are helpful on any information you might need .
the jewelry in there is even handmade by the owners .
i went to the women 's imaging for a routine mammogram .
it was that time , my doctor said and i dread these exams .
who really likes their body parts being smashed ?
i arrived at for my 11:15 am appointment about 40 minutes early .
i really love when i do n't have a long wait time .
they respected my time and glad everything went smoothly .
my thoughts on mammograms now are they are n't that bad .
thanks for making this a good experience for me and respecting my time .
this is probably the best walk in clinic i 've been to in years .
the downside is the wait times but overall the service has been exemplary .
receptionists have been courteous and efficient .
the doctors have been very professional and more thorough than my family doctor .
dr. rick is the best !

they did n't give us any grief about bringing her in at all .
they staff really knows how do handle children and comforts the parents .
i will always choose this facility .
today my daughter 's regular rmt , stacey grigsby , was unavailable .
without periodic massage , neither of us could function .
so we opted for a newly hired rmt , natalie aviles .
she knew exactly what to do to give my daughter substantial relief from pain .
now after an hour 's massage from natalie , she 's feeling much better .
you 're in good hands with these people !
dr. black was such a great person to give this exam .
he was helpful , informed and patient .
i recommend this place for your eyecare needs .
they got us in and out quickly !
on top of everything , our exam and glasses was covered 100 % ! !
i scheduled more appointments for my husband and i on the spot ! !
she did a good job and i like the result .
they may want to communicate a bit better about confirming reservations .
came here for the first time today and was very pleased .
the cooling spray for numbing was great and it helped tremendously with the pain .
the technician was knowledgable and very nice .
will be coming back here for sure !
i really appreciated how thorough they were with me as well .

our insurance is great but stopped covering fertility , of course !
we are seven weeks pregnant as of today .
their is no clinic i would choose over green valley fertility partners .
mind you this is sunday !
checked her vitals , did an ultrasound , gave her an iv .
they are the greatest !
dr lundgren is a miracle worker !
not only is he great but his staff is amazing !

our morning weekend walks always takes us here .
great atmosphere and bakery , hot/cold foods .
place still looks bustling .
i have had a neck injury with herniations , scar tissue and the works .
this felt great and increased the range of my neck movement .

they do n't oversell you like most places !
great place , totally worth every penny .
i would definitely recommend this place to go to when u want a massage !
everyone here is so nice & comforting and welcoming !
well , she sure did !
she even gave me some stretching exercises to help improve my back problems .
you are an angel and a lifesaver !
they were very helpful in filling my prescription for my cat .
i saw dr. banfield for a root canal yesterday .
first of all he is so nice .
the money i spent for the laughing gas was well worth it .
it made 45 minutes feel like 10 although it was quite funny tasting .
i went home with ibuprofen which i took yesterday .
would recommend 5000 % .
they also call to remind you when you need cleanings .
that personal touch goes a long way .
mandana kheshtchin and navid javadi are both extremely gentle and personable .
they are down to earth and reasonable in their prices .
i had a 60 minute massage with maxfield .
it felt like a very slow , focused massage that pinpointed troubled areas .
also , the place seems very nice , comfortable , and a little fancy .
marshall the pharmacist took care of me today .
i 've been getting my teeth cleaned here for the past 3 years .
i highly recommend this office .

so glad i found dr gombert and his fine staff a few years ago .
found dr gombert and he 's been just as great as my previous dentist .
the entire staff is awesome , from reception to the hygienists .
i love cloud nine !
i 've been going there for massage for many years .
they never keep you wait and the staff is very friendly .
i do n't think i 'll ever use another pharmacy .
she makes the entire experience informative , fun , comfortable , and easy .
you will not be disappointed !
i met the owner 's daughter upon arrival .
she was super nice and helpful shortly after we walked in .
my only disappointment was my purchase on a whisker for the matcha tea .
it was $ 20 and it did not work .
hence why it was n't working the way it was supposed to .
we thought about returning it - but change our mind on our way there .
we will order another one via amazon , no biggie .
i learned so much with just one trip .
the shoes are pricey but it 's totally worth it for the comfort !
plus they are n't cheap made in china shoes so the quality is excellent .
i only used the travel clinic here and could not be happier !
they had flexible hours that worked with my schedule ( open weekends !
can you believe that ? ! )
dr. van was so great .
i decided to come here since they had a great pedicure special going on .
( why not ? )
when i walked in , i was greeted by everyone .
hannah was my nail technician , and she was amazing .
i definitely needed a pamper , and this place just went above and beyond .
i would definitely recommend this place ! !

pros : - student discount !
i got 10 % off which saved me $ 500 .
- personal consultation , which you can cancel at any time .
- relaxing pill ( valium ) and massage chairs before your procedure .
cons : - dr. stein has a long waiting list !
you 'll have to wait a bit before you get an appointment .
dr. troupe and the team at polished dental do absolutely outstanding work all around .
my entire experience was easy and inviting -- it is such a friendly environment .
i am so grateful !
you wo n't be disappointed if you make an appointment with megan !
i am always happy with my results .
she is friendly , easy to talk to , and excellent at her job .
my fav place to lunch with friends .
it 's the best .
i could eat the salad bar every day
i am currently going to dr. racanelli for invisalign .
i wish most places would keep you in the waiting room so short .
they put espn on a flat screen in front of me while they worked .
dr. racanelli has good bedside manor and explains everything in great detail .
we could n't have done better ... the service is great and very personal .
we are so glad we found this family .
i love this office !
i saw dr. crum for my pregnancy and she was amazing and very knowledgeable .
the phlebotomist is best !
i will never let anyone else draw my blood .
she was always so fast and definitely knows what she is doing .
i ca n't imagine going through another pregnancy at another office !
had first appointment and really liked dr. wolfson .
he took my husband and i together .
i have lots of medical problems so he is dealing with them as needed .
easy to talk to .
had a facial and some injections today .
the staff was so friendly and knowledgeable .
i 'm so excited to go back and refer all my friends .
i 100 % recommend this place .
from the moment i walked through the doors i was at ease .
2016 is a new year so i figured a new dentist to start fresh .
once inside , it is beautiful .
it 's very dark yet tranquil and smells like relaxation .
i enjoyed my massage from shannon .
very professional , clean , and tranquil place .
i 'm glad i got to try this place out .
rubber flip flops from cvs to the rescue and i was good .
it was so needed after a morning of early morning travel .
i will definitely be back if needed when i return to vegas .
dr. k. has been my doctor for some years now .
he is located in the tall building on the children 's sunrise hospital property .
i have had nothing but terrific experiences here .
some with views and a few with none .
those get kinda claustrophobic feeling for me .
each room also has beautiful wall art .
that 's usually what i spend my time doing while waiting .
and it 's not weird having a guy gyno .
i completely recommend him to anyone and everyone for gyno services .
prompt , reasonable fee , personalized service - finally a vet i trust !
vet techs and receptionist are all very friendly and prompt .
i usually can get an appointment the same day .
we 're glad we were referred to him .
we had a toddler with a broken clavicle .
doc gave us a figure 8 brace .
x-rays are done in-office .
great service to us as parents and our little boy who was 2 .
i highly recommend him for his professionalism , kindness and beautiful office .
his staff are all so kind and helpful .
the new facility is stunning .
so clean and fresh .
the doctors are all very thorough .
dr. caplan is great .
she listens to the concerns and also respects the parents input and preferences .
high quality care here for sure .
they are easy to talk to , prompt , professional and flexible .
all the way , two thumbs up ; i recommend them with great confidence .
my wife and i decided to treat ourselves to couple massages .
i was reluctant , but i am so glad we have done it .
i look very forward to our monthly couples massage .
the staff at gilbert and germanne is very attentive and nice .
my wife swears by the salt scrub foot treatment !
the therapists are top notch as well ! !
i like the staff and the wait time is always short !
i started training 4 weeks ago with seth .
the first few sessions were tough .
i began getting stronger right away , and appreciated the encouragement from seth .
thanks to seth for helping me get my body and strength back !
had my cleaning today and it was great and fast service !
i saw hieu , dr wong and zabee !
thanks for a stress free visit !
this place is as good as it gets .
-and finally ... free meal at noodles & co. with your visit receipt !
i mean what ? !
i have found my dentist !
i really loved all the help and great customer service !
yeah i guess u could say i like the place .
for a fresh change he is not that businessman only thinking of profit .
his medical knowledge is second to none .
he also exhibits an exemplary bedside manner .
he literally will hold your hand throughout the whole process .
he is also very honest about treatment .
standing next to dr. fisch is his staff .
this is honestly the best dental office i 've ever been to .
i came in with severe sinus pressure and congestion .
after a week of dealing with this i was at my breaking point !
the staff here was so nice and efficient !
they really made my whole experience here great !
i could n't believe how gracious , efficient and caring this office was !
i will definitely be back !
he was very concerned and actively involved in my treatment .
i ca n't put in words how amazing this place is .
i have always been nervous coming into the dentist for any reason .
blown away by this place and will be a customer for life !
this place is always busy .
would recommend for 2 to 4 people .
the quinoa onion rings are delicious - order it with chipotle mayo .
i also love their hot sauce .
i 'm not vegan or vegetarian and i 've enjoyed everything i 've tried .
not only is this location beautiful but the staff is very friendly and helpful !
they have definitely helped me change my opinion of dentists .
i had n't even thought of reviewing roadrunner until i saw someone else 's .
my siberian husky was diagnosed with valley fever and prescribed fluconazole .
( sometimes a toy , sometimes treats . )
and so it went for about a year .
then i moved to san diego .
apparently , valley fever is not so common there .
then i got the price for a month supply of fluconazole .
same pills , same dosage , triple the price ! !
we took our dog to the animal hospital as a last resort .
every vet who saw her x-rays said we needed to do surgery immediately .
they stood to make a great profit off of both hips .
would highly recommend if you 're looking for a professional , kind atmosphere !
i have nerve pain in my feet and the sea salt massage is wonderful .
i go there now after every work out .
the food here is really great !
i had the falafel tacos and quinoa onion rings .
the tacos are super messy .
they also have really good hot sauce .
once i got my food though , the service was pretty nonexistent .
this place also gets pretty packed .
they do have a patio to sit outside as well .
i 'll be back , and hopefully service will be better next time .
probably one of the most unique spa experiences i 've had .
i had the one hour reflexology ( whole body ) plus shampoo .
the head massage is fantastic !
ask for jenny -- she does a great job !
clean , serene atmosphere , great value and an overall relaxing , therapeutic experience !
for a ymca , the dowd is an awesome gym .
the athletic conditioning class is no joke !
you will 100 % be sore the next day .
i also go to the morning spin classes .
the instructors vary by day , but there 's a great mix .
in addition , this year they did a million dollar reno .
and once the reno is 100 % complete it will be really awesome !
i love everyone there .
the staff and dentist are very helpful and attentive to my needs .
they left me smiling and i look forward to my next cleaning .
i had a wisdom tooth removed at this office earlier this week .
dr bond and his staff were great !
they deserve the 5 stars i 'm giving them !
this is definitely one of the most comfortable offices for gynecological visits .
dr quinn is a very good dentist and i never feel any pain .
i 've been going to this dentist for over 4 years now !
thumbs up for the dr and his staff !
they also call to remind you when you need cleanings .
that personal touch goes a long way .
mandana kheshtchin and navid javadi are both extremely gentle and personable .
they are down to earth and reasonable in their prices .
i went to charles for juvederm lip injections .
i had gotten my lips injected elsewhere and was very unhappy with them .
charles is super friendly and made sure i felt comfortable during the whole experience .
at $ 29 for a single visit you ca n't beat it .
they first go over your problems so they can focus on a specific area .
i have referred several people to the joint .
i had a broken wisdom tooth with a cavity .
i was in and out in less than an hour .
everyone was friendly and professional .
i even got a shirt !
he listened , did n't rush me through anything - i was definitely satisfied !
phew ... these things are usually hit or miss .
and it was amazing ! !
this was our first visit but it wo n't be our last .
great options , prices and service , fantastic place !
i had a really great experience with affordable dentures and implants .
something you can probably only appreciate if you 've been in a similar situation .
my mom had trouble holding still and repeatedly failed to follow instructions .
carlos never stopped smiling and encouraging her .
jennifer assisted with the surgery .
she was incredibly kind , gentle , and thoughtful .
dr. athari has an amazing sense of calm about him .
he walked us through everything and talked to us throughout the procedure .
always helpful , knowledgeable , kind , and gentle .
it took a day to get a call back to schedule .
we waited a little while in the office too .
that 's worth waiting for .
overall , they work like a well-oiled machine .
we got to meet the whole team , including their on-site lab techs .
every single person met us with a smile and kind words .
i can not thank dr. athari enough for creating an environment like this .
that 's a major difference worth noting .
they also have an on-site lab , which saves costs as well .
anyway , again , sending a huge thank-you to dr. athari and his staff .
you guys are beyond awesome .
the staff at spectrum dermatology is wonderful , everyone is so kind and helpful .
thank you lauren , you 're the best !
the people who works here are very nice and helpful .
they accept most insurance as well .
thank you , lisa .
happy to give dr. rehl the 5 stars he deserves .
i would give him 10 !
i just needed to know that this was going to be addressed with laura .
i recently had an eye appointment here and had a very good experience .
the staff were friendly and provided prompt services .
they were knowledgeable about my insurance benefits and selection of eyeglasses .
i am a repeat customer there and will return again for any concerns .

dr malek is a true artist i would recommend him to anyone ! !
i have referred friends of mine to him for botox etc ..
i highly recommend this location as i have seen great results .
he helped and after 3 treatments the pain and knots were gone .
i would recommend him to anyone .
i 'm from portland but visit scottsdale often .
the staff from the front desk to doctors were amazing .
there is a big difference between given options and a sales pitch .
i 'll be back soon !
however , the last time they were spot on .
while i was there , the nurses and doctors were great .
i was scared and they were so reponsive and kind .
wonderful front desk staff smiled right when i walked it .
saw molly m , who was very pleasant and helpful .
beautiful office and well organized .
i was able to get an appointment last minute too !
my masseuse rebecca , was amazing !
you could tell she was very experienced .

you 're awesome & your staff makes me feel so comfortable .
the dentist took his time to explain my treatment options .

i actually had a pleasant experience .
i went in for a root canal .
dr ike hardy strikes me as knowledgeable , skilled , and trustworthy .
he really makes you feel you 're in good hands .
the staff were nice and friendly .
i had the best pedicure ever here !
the spa food i ordered was delicious and tasted pretty healthy .
one dish is enough for 2people to share .
downside : i had a chatty cathy getting a pedicure next to me .
the tea that they had tasted artificially sweetened .
i was horrified , as i stay far away from unhealthy preservatives .
i stuck with water .
the spa pool was nothing to write home about .
definitely was not relaxing at all .
lots of loud people drinking too much .
it 's easy to make an appointment and they usually run on time .
we 're able to access all medical appointment notes from home which is awesome !
we definitely recommend her !
they released my back pain .
i can walk upright again .
i will go back my next trip .
he is so personable and trustworthy .
he knows what he 's doing and makes you feel comfortable .
i 've gotten botox , dysport and juvederm with him .
he has a great eye for perfection .
i recommend everyone to him .
thank you charles for always making me feel my best !
before stepping into the doors , i have never taken a cross fit class .
i have to say , these trainers blew my mind ! !
how awesome is that ! !
the place is so clean and organized .
the instructors ... fantastic ! !
they really focus on safety and are really motivating .
everyone was so welcoming and did n't show anything they could n't do .

took a cab , and got there in a few minuets .
the place was very clean and friendly .
i absolutely love the décor .
you definitely feel like you 're in vegas !
this is a great place for relaxation !
it started off with being picked up by their own transportation .

it was hard to make out the car since they match every other vehicle .
2 ) use no chip nail polish .

his staff is great .
charlotte is a skilled ultrasound tech and amanda is welcoming and thorough .
front office is proficiant and accommodating .
office wait time was minimal .
east to get an appointment .
medicine in the usa is not practiced that way .

this time he did electro acupuncture .
this session was easier ; massage , acupuncture , and cupping .
typically a pain cycle like this will last three months .
i 'm so glad i found dr quan !
the office is comfortable and spa-like .
they will even text you if you like to communicate that way .
this place is quite the opposite .
every detail is paid attention to .
i would recommend every healthy pregnant woman to deliver here .

i was so empowered that i was able to block out the pain .
we were back home in our own bed just a few hours afterwards .
her class was a powerful experience and she even takes pictures during the birth .

look no further than tokyo shiatsu clinic aka suzuki shiatsu at the beaches/the beach .

this will definitely be my hóme dental office going forward .
other places charge 150-250 $ just for consultation .
not an urgent care place more like a check up place .
i had a really bad rash all over my legs .
i took the medication and it actually cleared up my rash .
great experience worth the wait .

i had my first thai massage today and it was extraordinary .
it 's been called passive yoga and that 's what it felt like .
i am 63 and used to be quite flexible .
dominic stretched and pulled my limbs and muscles like i was young again .
prices were very reasonable .
facility was new and clean .
this therapy has been integral to my recovery .
i 'm able to sleep peacefully , enjoy more flexibility and move without pain !
i had shoulder trouble for 2 years !
i could hardly move my left arm without pain .
i tried everything short of having surgery !
a friend of mine suggested acupuncture as an alternative .
well i was sooo desperate i thought what the heck ! !
dr lee was really nice and very comforting .
especially to someone who had never done acupuncture .
within 2 visits i was able to move my arm without pain ! !
after 5 visits i had full range of motion ! !
of course your mileage may vary .
in other words your results may differ .
and let me tell you i have made some doozies ! ! !
my shoulder and i can not recommend dr lee enough ! !
artistic created boutique instead of the typical clinical `` sterile '' looking optical space !
notice the displays ... nice touch !
so your insurance will be footing part of the bill !
they have plenty of great looking less typical eyewear for men !
plenty of styles for ladies too !
many brands i have heard of and a few i have not !
wish they had some they did not !
near `` al 's pizza ''
best choice i 've ever made .
i got 2 teeth extracted on my 1st visit like nothing .
the facilities are beautiful and liked that they use new technologies too .
definitely would recommend it to family and friends .
they suggested meds , ice , and `` rest until you feel better '' .
that is a band-aid , not a cure !
my teeth got 5-6 shades whiter and the process was painless .
treat yourself to a younger smile !
you 'll be glad you did !
at least i sure am !
thank you true teeth whitening !
i 'll be back for maintenance every 6-12 months because i love these results !
i discovered this place on yelp and i 'm hooked .
i 'm halfway through my treatment and i am seeing fantastic results .
the technicians who work there know exactly what they are doing .
i loved robin and nancy ! !
i highly recommend this place if you 're looking to get laser hair treatment .
they 're affordable , offer discounts , and care about their clients .
this place was awesome .
i had my very first mri done here this morning .
todd took care of me and did my mri .
he made me feel so comfortable !
i was nervous before going in but he made me feel very calm .

the nurse practitioner , nancy jorgensen , is so wonderful !
i immediately felt at ease once i met her .
i honestly ca n't say enough good things about her !
as far as the staff , i thought they were very efficient and friendly .
but we love dr.garcia just the same !
she is attentive , thorough , caring , and knows what she 's doing .
the staff is wonderful as well .
you wear comfortable clothing and do not undress like a typical massage .
you could n't beat it !
i normally pay one dollar per hour back in nh .
on my second visit i asked for specific areas to concentrate on .
if you are ever in the area you must give them a try !
they are a full service fertility practice conveniently located in henderson .
gvfp provided all of that and more .
you 'll love this team !
i have used dr morley for 3 years .
he has exceptional price plans and no ripoffs .
can i give this place 10 because it deserves it .
so i went in during the day on a monday .
i discussed i was looking for a reflexology & body massage .
i 've been to about 8-10 foot spas in vegas as well .
give them a try !
i recently had surgery here .
and i am thoroughly impressed with there patient care .
check in for the surgery was very smooth and everyone was so friendly .
i ended up having my surgery bumped up by an hour .
they explained everything to me and ensured that i was ok and comfortable .
otherwise everyone else was very kind and comforting .
overall very impressed with patient care at this hospital .
usually , i make an appointment for blood work .
the place was pretty crowed at 10:50a.m .
but , i was in and out in 28 minutes .
so , pretty quick service , imo .
my tech , anna , did a great job on taking my blood .
i hardly felt the needle go in .
also , considering we have deep vains , they find them with little effort .
my daughter had a veneer break while visiting a couple of years ago .
she called dr angel 's office .
she had issues with that veneer several times and had gone to several dentists .
dr angel was the first dentist to fix it correctly .
everyone at dr angel 's office is friendly and professional .
the waiting times are short , yet i have never felt rushed .
she also does n't try to convince you to have unnecessary procedures .
the office is comfortable , clean and conveniently located .
almost made the experience enjoyable !
they are always encouraging .

i need that every other day .
i had a doctor willing to prescribe but he had to know the ingredients .
he agreed it could do no harm but also needed the ingredient list .

hand scaling is more acurate .
all with a no-pressure approach .
with my busy schedule , this is a great service for me .

very happy they will be handling the renewals .
this is the place that gets the job done .
jackie did a great job cleaning my teeth .
she was very cautious about my sensitive teeth but also very thorough .
pity , i wish they still had this around .
the thing i usually get when i come here are the bowls .
most of the time i get the macro greens .
i 've had other bowls , but i kinda like this one the best .
another thing is that they have daily soups that they keep changing up .
fresh is one of those places that 's good for everyone .
i 've been with dr. vicuna for over a couple of years now .
she 's definitely knowledgeable and friendly .
i received a massage from james today and it was fantastic .
he is a very talented therapist and will definitely be returning !
so i stopped going .
i decided to hunt down a new location and grouponed for brazilian waxes .
i lucked out w skin of dreams and had sandra as my waxer .
ladies , i highly highly recommend her services .
it is true the more you go , the lesser it hurts .
just go to skin of dreams and request sandra !
you wo n't regret her kind spirit and great services !
i have been coming to this office for at least 12 years maybe longer .
it is always very busy .
it is a huge office with a lot of people working here .
even more patients.they seriously must see hundreds of people a day here .
even though i have now moved to another town .
i still come to this office .
they really do try to get you in as quick as possible .
yes , you could be dead by then .
this place gets you in asap , never more than 2 days .
her ma is fantastic as well .
the blood lab is right there on the property .
which makes it great that you do not have to drive anywhere else .
good medical care , fast appt. , every thing you could need .
ample parking , very convenient .
yesterday was my first appointment at seventh street dental care .
every one treated me so well .
dr. nack is so compassionate and caring .
i am so relieved to have found my dentist !
thanks to brigham orthodontics , i am on my way to a perfect smile
it can be a bit nerve wracking to say the least .
doctor racanelli makes it so easy to get dental work done .
when you find a good dentist , you know .
and you follow him ! ! !
my results have been impeccable .
this man and his incredible staff have literally brought my dreams to life !
i could n't be more ecstatic !
if i can do it all again , i would in a heart beat .
i felt prepared and confident i was under the best care possible .
the hours in the dental chair flew by !
i was more then fine .
doc worked so meticulously and carefully in mouth i did n't even feel him .
and yes , you should consider flying across the country as well .
your teeth are the first thing people see when they see you .
trust me- it 's worth it !
the best dentist i 've ever been to .
he really seems to care about his patients and to listen to them .
the hygienists do a great job at assessing your teeth and gums .
i would definitely recommend as opposed to some other dentists i 've been to .
absolutely recommend this place ! ! !
love the boot camp on saturday
excellent experience all the times dr. liu has completed work on me .
i feel it was my good fortune the day i walked into his office .
i would recommend him to everyone wondering where to find good health .
very nice staff , from check in to check out !
nurses were all very kind to my dad as well !
i visited solescape based on the solid reviews and they are right on .
she is an artist and your skin/muscles could be her canvas ! ! !
emily will not disappoint .
she has a gentle voice and presence but amazingly strong hands and energy .
one thing i feel like solescapes could improve upon is bedding .
regardless , i will go back .
thank you , emily !
well first of all let me say that the service is great .
2 hours later the wife feels great and rejuvenated .
i had a great visit with dr. cheree and her assistant dina this week .
she listened to my concerns and targeted specific areas .
the staff is great with the kids , friendly , and generally pretty quick .
my children never complain about going to the dentist .
fabulous doctor , fabulous staff .
incredibly knowledgeable , and amazing bedside manner .
he also performed my hysterectomy .
he obviously has an incredible reputation in the medical field .
dr raia was so great and so was the staff at their surgery facility .
it was quick and comfortable , with an onsite cafeteria .
the doctor explained everything .
overall i will be back for another .
i cant wait to see my baby !
i know dr. leah wingeart as a colleague .
i would definitely recommend her as another professional in the mental health field .
i have n't met a friendlier staff .
everyone i talked to was kind and made my experience great !
i 'm so excited i found i dentist i want to go back to .
i had a good experience here the other day .
i was assisted by darion .
he was kind , patient , and professional .
he helped to get the lens replaced in my eyeglasses and sunglasses .
all of the employees i encountered were very nice .
there were only 2 employees available to adjust the eyeglasses that were ready .
dr. pozun is great , one of the better doctors i 've had .
the only reason i give them four stars instead of five is the staff .
others do n't return phone calls promptly .
i want some ! )
but the other front desk staff are generally unfriendly if not rude .
as i wrote earlier , very much recommended .
dr bigler and his staff have been wonderful .
i 've been a patient for 2 years and have excellent service .
i would highly recommend this doctor to anyone
i received a recommendation to southview from a coworker and so glad i listened .
if that is the case , check out southview !
barely visited this store in the last couple of years .
have within the last year rediscovered the store , as prices seem more reasonable .
some items are actually the same or cheaper than longos and loblaws .
i was super shocked .
what sets it apart is the service .
there is almost always someone i 'm there you help you .
they will ask you if you need help as well !
rare for a chain grocery store !
this one time , there was n't a sample i could try .
i asked and the associate there quickly opened a bottle for me to try !
that 's customer service .
items are in stock even on weekends and weekend evenings .
check out never takes too long either .
they always open up new lanes and the cashiers are so friend .
they go above and beyond to tell you info or talk to you !
i 'm not complaining .
lace was masseuse and was just amazing .
as a world traveler and experienced spa goer do n't miss this boutique .
i 'll be back later this year on my next trip to the states .
say hi to molly !
dr. pervaiz is knowledgeable and professional .
he is now my primary care physician .
his staff at the rainbow office is pleasant :
best spa in vegas .
stay off the strip to get superb customer treatment and normal prices .
after tips less than $ 300 !
will go here every time i visit !
this example has made us dynamic eye care patients for life .
nothing bad i would say about this location .
however they did notice a fluid build up in her abdomen .
my husband was satisfied with the service he received during that visit .
she was very thorough and advised is daily about her condition .
i completely understand their reasoning .
pvsec is a fantastic state of the art facility with wonderful providers .
it 's worth every cent .
i recently moved here and have kaiser .
that being said there are no kaisers in nevada .
luckily healthcare partners of nevadas urgent care on wynn accept kaiser .
besides that great fact , they are fantastic there .
they also have great prices for the medications they prescribe .
since i do have unacceptable insurance at most places this is great news .
i would really recommend anyone go here .
i absolutely adore all staff here .
either dentist is a great choice .
my biggest fear is being judged for how bad my teeth are .
i dont like going to the dentist .
so i usually dont .
i have a habit of waiting until im in excruciating pain before caving in .
after one visit to this place , you wont ever go anywhere else .
i literally drive all the way across town .
yesterday , i went in and had a facial done with cindy hernandez .
all i can say is she was amazing and worked magic on my face !
the whole staff was nice and the place was beautiful and clean !

i enjoyed the wrap process i was so relaxed and kept falling asleep .

i can not say enough good things about dr. noorda and his staff .
i highly recommend them and would give them 100 stars if i could !
thank you dr. noorda & your out standing staff ! ! !
any negative reviews are from just generally awful people .
i was there when a patient threw a clipboard at their front desk person .
and she was pregnant .
the pas are all wonderful as well as the physicians .
it 's a busy practice .
they spend a lot of time with you compared to other places .
i wo n't go anywhere else .
dr. pack delivered our second child , which had complications .
as nervous parents , we could not have had a better experience .
i would ( and have ) absolutely recommend dr. pack !
when i got to urgent care i did not want to wait all night .
which is why i am writing this review .
i was feeling so much better just after 20 mins .
thank you micole neely and your wonderful staff !
source centre is a very welcoming and calming environment .
dr. leo took the time to explain it to me and answer any questions .
i have scoliosis and tendinitis in my hand and wrist .
my overall wellness is better for it .
i would highly recommend source centre .
i absolutely love this place , and treasure dr. kim .
she 's thorough , answers all of my questions , and is incredibly personable .
i have never been a marc 's fan .
and i was surprisingly impressed .
i visited yesterday to get my lips done & had a great experience .
everyone there was friendly .
i am sharing pictures for reference !
my lips are still slightly swollen but seem to be healing well .
music is fun to dance to .
so happy canada is open to drugs !
i highly recommend this company based on my personal experience .
dr. shelly o'connor is a great chiropractor !
her personality is another awesome feature of her service !
there 's no down-side to seeing dr. shelly !
dr gawley and his staff are incredible !
i had a mommy makeover done about 6 weeks ago .
i have had 7 kids , and my body definitely showed it .
i had a tt and ba .
my husband and i are thrilled with my results !
he went over and beyond my expectations .
we are forever thankful for dr. gawley !
in june 2013 i decided to make my health a top priority .
at that time i was a complete mess .
i could n't climb a flight of stairs without being out of breath .
i had joined 24 hour and quickly became disappointed with the trainers .
july 12 , i will be competing in my second mens masters physique competition .
stephen , seth , aaron , steven q. , jayson are the absolute best .
i have met a lot of wonderful people there .
everyone has a story to tell .
there is so much inspiration and motivation at tpt .
these guys are the real deal .
give them a try you wo n't regret it .

she is a great doctor and her pa christie is amazing as well !
everyone there is so nice and try to work with your schedule .
these people also really care about their patients .
we absolutely love healing hearts and everyone there .
natalie answered all of my questions and addressed my concerns .
she was more than great ! ! !
i do n't think we could go wrong with anyone at this office .
this is an excellent program for those seeking help with recovery .
they are doing something special here .
they a first class gym with an awesome boxing ring !
incrediblely motivating 12 step meetings ... .the best ever !
i liked the staff that really care .
helpful employees and fun place to visit .
if you have n't heard- you get all the samples of oil/vinegar/wine/liquor you want .
in fact , they are encouraged .
some of the stuff is pretty reasonable .
for example , the calamondin vinegar is amazing .
it has like a citris/lime flavor and is like nothing i have ever tasted .
also , give the pumpkin seed oil a try .
way funner than the `` oil and vinegar '' stores in the mall .
soon they will add liqueurs to their portfolio , which should be very exciting .
also , small selection of wine there .
tip : bring your own containers ( can you ? )
because those add up .
and , ask the staff for pairings .
for example : mango vinegar and chili oil .
i had my implants done at layman shirman and associates .
always a pleasure to work with dr. shirman and their staff .
if you 're in pain , dr. kevin kaldy can help .

i highly recommend desert springs dental care to everyone .
i have very temperamental skin ... normal to dry complection along with hormonal/cystic acne .
my coworker mentioned skin laundry and how your first time is free !
usually it 's $ 65 a treatment .
the location is very clean and professional- and they all are very informative !
ask whatever you need to feel comfortable !
the specials they have are worth it !
the process : you check-in .
you wash your face .
they bring you into their room .
cleanse your face again .
start up the treatment and discuss a routine for your skin .
10 minutes later- you 're checking out !
sure , let 's do it !

i take pictures of the terrible park jobs and send them to my friends .
they do n't have much selection or variety .
4 stars , because they have my heart - but are still inconvenient .
i was still terrified ! !
i had pretty much no pain after surgery .
another great thing is that everything is taken care of in one place .
mri , dr. appointments , surgery , and physical therapy .
they make it so convenient for you which is so much appreciated .
i highly recommend dr. bigler .
he 's not only a great dr , but a genuinely wonderful person !

dr. garcia is wonderful .
we 've been taking our son there since he was born .

partitions are all around so you 'll have a semiprivate room .
we tipped $ 15 each .
i am new to the area and fractured a molar .

but not this time .
all the doctors at alliance are great including dr. park and dr. pierson .
the spa is off the strip and very close to the rio .
a 80 minute massage is priced right at $ 100 .

friendly and helpful staff , good selection of frames , very thorough eye exam .
they also have a great referral program .

he was nice and calming but i did find that he was very rushed .
procedure itself was essentially pain-free .
by day 4 the swelling had reduced and tearing subsided .
visual acuity is decent , with some blurry vision but otherwise good !
i come here almost every week or every 2 weeks .
the staff is always super friendly and sweet and remember my name !

elite is a clean and well equipped establishment where anyone is welcome .
i highly recommend checking it out .
one word : heavenly .
solescape has a very welcoming and relaxing vibe .
the woman at the front desk was also very nice .
we started off by al sitting down with me and asking me any concerns .
he told me that he does ashiatsu , which i 've never had before .
he was kind , warm , and funny .
such a nice guy !
i was a little nervous ( feet ! )
but it was soooo relaxing .
an hour massage cost $ 75 ( plus tip ) .
expensive , but seriously worth it .

while the initial arrival was rocky , it all went well and ended well .

this review is about vanessa because she is the shit !

dave actually follows through with it until the very end .
what he explained to my dad and i was pertinent information .
the hearing went according to what dave told us .

the massage experience is amazing and consistent .
needless to say that i wake up not feeling rested .
i was able to float for the first time and truly enjoyed it .
when you hear floating in the dark for 1 hour sounds a bit daunting .
seeing is understanding : you are in control of the environment .
your pod is a private room with shower .
you control lights sound/music and can leave pod door ajar or completely open .
this establishment is very clean and organized .
i really appreciated the staff they were very informative and made feel at home .
i really look forward to floating again with true rest float spa

found them on groupon and i 'm so happy i did .
alan did my deep tissue massage and was absolutely amazing !
they are lucky to have him .
sometimes i feel like the therapist is rushed and not into their job .
when someone has their hands on you , you feel their energy and intentions .
i could tell that he enjoys his work .
he was n't rushed .
this is huge for me !
i cant wait to go back .
already booked my next appointment with alan .
they have great packages and do chair massages as well .
give them a try !

i 'll definitely be back soon .
dr. roach is seriously the best .
they do a free body-fat composition with specific details .
it 's hands-down legit !
they also offer protein supplements without sugar , which is ideal .
additionally , the store is super clean and the service is top-notch .
if you ask a question , they will answer it in a friendly way .
there are no attitudes here at all .
quick and easy way to get after hours care .
- especially when you have a sick and cranky toddler in the back seat .
but it 's worth it !
dr. harouni is very kind and warm , and very , very smart .
there 's even fruit and coffee in the waiting room .

he 's the best doctor ever .
he cares about his patient so much .
before the procedure he explained everything really detail .
since one of my hemorrhoid size is too big .

i was pretty stoked it included a massage as well .
it 's not an overwhelming scent but it is pleasant .
it 's an awesome combination of oxygen and a little massage .
they do try to sell you their stuff but are not pushy .
but that 's another review .
the people are so nice and the store is very clean and well arranged .
we will definitely keep this store in our repertoire .

andrea is honestly the best !
two weeks later the doctors performed a mid calf amputation .
after a difficult two months , she was ready for her first prosthetic .
pro care was a few blocks from our home .
first visit she carried her leg in a bag .
not a good start .
therapists do n't accept excuses .
pretty soon he was pulling the walker to make her keep up .
each visit the therapist introduced new exercises to get ready for the next steps .
now , he follows critiquing each step .
steps and curbs are a particularly terrifying obstacle .
going to be walking from now on .
success and end of professional therapy is walking with a cane .
looks like that is a week away at this rate of improvement .
it 's been a physically exhausting , a little painful but mostly terrifying journey .
miracles take work sometimes .
the therapist and staff at pro care work miracles daily .
it 's been an amazing transformation with a motivated patient and expert care .
customer service is the best .
he never rushes and is very knowledgeable .
my daughter feels comfortable and he makes her smile .
the office is always clean and the staff is always polite .
literally stop here daily !
always so friendly and helping me get exactly what i want .
friendly and knowledgeable staff .
my 7 yr old felt very comfortable as a patient there .
i really love this store !
this pet store really cares about customer service to the fullest .
i think that is awesome !
this could be by far the best place to get a massage at .
i paid $ 80 for a deep tissue massage in may this year .
i cant rememebr my therapists name , but she was amazing .
her hands were perfect .

what an amazing day !
ca n't wait to go back !
just got my first section done today .
really happy about the result so far .
really clean place and friendly staff .
he has so much patience , and is a true professional .
i started seeing her during my pregnancy .
everyone i 've ever sent to her absolutely loves her and feels immediate relief .
she is an artist and master of her trade .
i am so grateful to have such an amazing practitioner for my family !
i wanted to give a shout out to the camp transformation center !
he wears many hats ... and he wears each one exceptionally well !
his office staff is pleasant , efficient and accommodating .
... and now , all is well .
... he saves lives .
and tip the ladies at least $ 10 .
they do an incredible job & for the price , they definitely deserve it .
they even use hot stones on your back .
it 's pretty great .
wow , where to begin ?
this woman is amazing !
i had back pain for 8 years .
personality aside , ashlee knows what she is doing !
by week 6 my pain was gone ! !
but that is how engraved the pain was in me and even my mannerisms .
now i carry him around all day and never feel a thing !
thank you pch for your help .
dr. foreman made the dentures fit very well in my mouth .
he was amazing ! ! !
he was professional , friendly and respectful to me .
right away he saw the healing and mouth and changes in my oral needs .
i 'll continue coming back .
i 'm fortunate indeed !
the best ymca around ! ! !
they have two indoor swimming pools .
they also have a fabulous sauna both dry and wet .
they even have a jacuzzi for your enjoyment .

they have that taken care of too !
smoothies , hot cooked meals , quick on the go grab food .
pretty awesome , now come find out for yourself ! !
i 've had brookstone dental as my dentist for fifteen years .
i 've always hated going to the dentist , like most people .
i never wait more than five minutes to be seen .
dr goldring and his staff are very personable and fun to visit .
i highly recommend brookstone dental .
i have changed primary physicians 3 times in as many years .
not because of the doctors , but because of terribly incompetent staffs .
hilcrest dental really is as good as it gets !
extra kudos to dental hygienist sherlisa !
some day they might even update their website .
my mom has been a resident at scottsdale memory care for almost six years .

i like dr. patel & the staff @ bella vista internal med .
the doctor is very conscientious and thorough .
so the cost of some of my meds had doubled .
and i thought they were expensive 90 days ago !
i have received calls from the doctor 's office with updates of test results .
thank you dr. jigna patel .
fell in love and went again 2 days later .
the main takeaway though is the damn quinoa onion rings !
holy they are sooo good .
note that its $ 6 and they legit only give u like 5 rings .
whatever , well worth it !
the grilled veggie n pesto wrap is my fav .
like who does n't like pesto right ? !
i have tried it in the tortilla and on a bed of lettuce .
the side of kale slaw is nothing great .
the fries are also amazing here !
shocker - the regular ones are better than the sweet potato fries .
do not get the cornbread ever though , its dry and nasty .
the doctor talks with you and makes you feel comfortable during the adjustment .
had a wonderful foot and body massage .
very professional and price is within the top 10 spa 's in vegas .
thank you abc dental for the great service !
my appointment was right on time , love when that happens .
her assistant was really nice and helpful and so was dr. kim .
polite , professional , and thorough ! ! !
i would n't go anywhere else !
overall a great experience .
i scheduled a eye test and finally had to break down and get glasses .
from the actual md to the sales representative , they were very attentive .
they have a great selection of quality frames which i liked .
most places just have the same old bland frames .
i was very happy with my experience .
a whole new concept in the world of chiropractic care !
come on people , not everything is reheated with a microwave oven .
luckily for us , we got the joint .
oh well , that was few years ago at another place .
now , i do n't have any of these problems with the joint .

the experience is all about comfort and great dental care .

i conveniently forgot about the dentist until a crown fell off .
they were able to schedule an appointment for the next day .
i think i 've found my dentist for the next 20+ years ! !

from the moment i phoned dr. thompson 's office , the staff was amazing .
mine covered nearly all of my visit .

they are very professional but also make you feel as though they actually care .
i have never had a doctor do that !

now it 's my turn to get a few things worked on .
i was disfigured and miserable .
one side was partially paralyzed and the other completely .
we were amazed , but it shows just how effective this therapy is .
this laser helps the healing process exponentially .
his staff are all caring and professional .
none was able to find a reason or long term solution for my pain .
he took the time to explain in detail what was causing my pain .

usually it 's $ 65 a treatment .
the location is very clean and professional- and they all are very informative !

the specials they have are worth it !
the process : you check-in .
you wash your face .
they bring you into their room .
cleanse your face again .
start up the treatment and discuss a routine for your skin .
10 minutes later- you 're checking out !
sure , let 's do it !
go treat yourself to a free treatment on your next day off !
it is so worth it .
we started our infertility journey two years ago .
first , the consult was free , which was refreshing .
we appreciated how real he was with us .
we walked out of there happy , relieved and optimistic .
three feelings we had n't felt in a long time .
we were so heartbroken , but were eager to try again .
we tried a few weeks later with a frozen transfer .
we waited ... then went in for our first beta .
he called and said my numbers were low , but in the positive range .
he prepared me that it could be an early miscarriage .
i prayed that our second beta numbers would go up .
not enough for him to be certain tho .
so , i went in for a third round of blood work .
it went up significantly !
we were so relieved and over joyed .
what a beautiful sound !
they are helping us complete our family and making our dreams come true .
it 's definitely worth your time
again , 100 % spot on .

this level of kindness did n't stop after the first meeting .
the clinic is stunning and clean as a whistle .
the staff are so kind and become like family .
as each month passed i saw myself improving .
my symptoms were being eliminated left and right .
the pain that made it impossible to function was gone .
it was the blessing i had been praying for .
and i 'm not the only one who received a miracle after attending sunridge .

sunridge medical brought me the health that i had only dreamed of .
before attending the clinic i had all but given up hope .

their products and protein shakes are really good .
i drink at least 1 protein shake a day , usually chocolate or cinnabun .

i am obsessed with their salad bar .

i was unaffiliated and looking for a box to do the wods at .
every class is mixed with beginners to advanced athletes .
each class is an hour long .
at the beginning of the sessions , everybody does a warm-up and stretches together .
wods can range from under 5 minutes to over 45 minutes and in between .
do n't be scared !
you go at your own pace .
you can either go all out or just take it easy .
it 's all up to you .
sure people are watching but we only want the best for you .
we know you are hurting but we all hurt together !
no pain , no gain !
ca n't forget about the infrared sauna in each of the change rooms .
i feel stronger , healthier and happier than ever before .
lifelong friendships and personal fitness goals are bound to happen at rcr .
hope to see you there !
because it was super affordable before in comparison .

i 'll be going back again in 8 weeks !
no one ever called me back to set up new appointment .
he said he had no idea that she was so terrible to me .
i now have an appointment set up for this week .
such an awesome crew working here !
the happiest group of people and they are constantly making you laugh .
awesome atmosphere for kids and adults .
what kid would n't want to go back ?

friendly helpful staff that will make sure you get your question answered .
the place is neat & tidy , very well organized .
things are well spaced out , easy to find & well stocked .
it 's not the closest wfs to me but it 's worth the drive .
so.. , i had a great experience with pv ob/gyn .

cleanings with kim are comfortable and thorough .
reception staff is friendly and accommodating .

dental appointments once freaked me out , but not since coming to this office .
it 's actually always a pleasant experience .
went in for my first microdermabrasion treatment .

i felt very relaxed and rejuvenated after !
i went to see dr kuranko on the suggestion of a friend .
i have never felt calmer and treated so kindly .
i felt safe and well taken care of .
absolutely love this place !
the only reason it does n't get 5 stars is because of the price .
this store is pricey ! ! !
but i would never be able to shop here on the regular .
i come here for unique health items i ca n't find elsewhere .
i also come here for their amazing vegan desserts and the best .
i first visited babymoon inn a year ago because a friend worked there .
i am so excited to finally be pregnant and a client at babymoon inn !
there are two birthing rooms , each with its own bathtub .
there are two bathrooms available , one with an inviting shower .
the offices are just as inviting as the birth center .
the lobby is cozy and beautifully decorated .
the midwives ' offices are comfortable and non-medical .
( belly checks are done on a massage table ! )
i can not recommend babymoon inn and its amazing staff any more highly .
hands down best staff in the valley ! !
i 've been to fresh a few times and i 've enjoyed every experience .
most of their menu items are carb heavy .
they also always have some delicious sweet treats from sweets from the earth .
make sure you save some room for dessert .
they 're also available on a bunch of delivery apps which is super convenient .
the whole team at floss dental is so caring and professional .
i highly recommend them to anyone !
you will not be disappointed ... .
i am delighted to read that improvements are scheduled .
they are always courteous , professional , respectful , and fun to interact .
otherwise , it feels like i am a passive recipient with no power .
the entire team at this practice indeed visibly care about your healing .
i feel very comfortable going around and asking questions .
thus far , i have completed 8 sessions and i can feel the improvement .
i am really grateful to have found tim soder 's pt !
the professionalism and dedication are constant and consistent ; it is in the air !
the place is always squeaky clean and feels upscale and inviting !
i had an appointment with dr. magdato today .
the office was nice , simple and clean .
it was easy to find and had lots of parking .
the staff was friendly and informative .
dr. magdato was very professional and easy to communicate with .
i could never figure out why my eyes were so dry .
they also had a really good selection of frames to pick from .
ca n't wait til i get my new glasses !
dr alejandro lopez is wonderful .
dr lopez is caring and spends the time it takes to help me .
everyone at the front desk and elsewhere has always been kind and caring .
it is not always possible to have an appointment when you need medical care .
i highly suggest dr evens and his great team !
they have good rates but most important is the 5 star care you receive .
they 're thorough at answering questions and making you feel comfortable .
very skillful and knowledgeable and all around great office .
have been many times and will be back .
thanks spring valley dentist office !
i showed up for my appointment the next day .
the office is extremely professional in appearance .
i met with dr. liu and i think he is very sharp and friendly .
in turn when my grandma had swelling , they sent her to another hospital .
the next day we met shahera who would be my grandmas cna .
her job was to come help bathe , change and monitor my grandmother daily .
more reassurance was given to us .
she also told us what to expect .
we were given a booklet on signs the end was coming for my grandma .
when my grandma passed away , i called the hotline .
he listened to our stories of grandma while we waited .
he also hugged us when he left .
everyone we had contact with at infinity made this process easier .
they sent medications quickly .
supplies came with our cna .
kenta , the oneself therapy guru , actually deserves ten stars .
he would not give up until he identified the issue .
i left oneself today walking without pain and with a normal gait !
this was truly a therapeutic massage .
the setting is classy , comfortable , and well decorated with good music .
kenta is kind and friendly and patient and truly gifted .
our family has been going here since 1982 before dr. innes retired .
he has corrected painful problems and has performed innovative surgery with positive results .
their office is close to home and convenient for parking too !
dr. judy has been so amazing for our family .
she truly is so genuine and caring .
we are so thankful for her .
had a great experience with michelle .
i suffer from muscle pain in my back due to a snowboard accident .
so i go to massage therapists at least once a month .
since i travel i get a lot of different therapist .
michelle ranks on the top .
result : i felt way less stiff .
she really softened my muscles .
went for a heart beat check at 7 weeks , it was great .
had a great expirience .
i just wanted to say how awesome tyler is ! !
i have chronic back pain and tendonitis due to my profession as an esthetician .
tyler is very professional and a great rmt .
when i first arrived i was pretty surprised how big the dispensary actually was .
i recommend the cheesecake or the mango juice both are great choices .
placed an order for catering for a group of 8 for lunch .
i ordered lunch boxes for all .
ordered : fresh deluxe boxed lunch/wraps !
very good and the basil pesto tortellini was the favorite of all .
there are other technicians there so the environment is really nice .
great place for your eyes !
i was interested in breast augmentation .
dr. geoghegan made me feel the most comfortable .
she was very informative , caring , and honest with me .
three years later i have no regrets !
i have had no complications during surgery or after .
i am extremely pleased with the results and would highly recommend her practice .
nancy is the best dentist in the state of arizona !
go to dr. robinson and you will never look for another dentist agian !
the entire staff believes in helping each patient individually .
i was not a number and a chair here .
i was a human that received the specialized care i needed .
jennifer is beyond wonderful !
literally , after just one visit , i became hooked - so obsessed !
in fact , my mother is coming in next week !
she truly cares about her clients .
if i could , i would seriously come back every single week .
she is that amazing .
i can not recommend her enough ! !
: ) : ) : )
absolutely love the girls st skin laundry .
everyone has commented on how amazing my skin looks !
i definitely recommend checking them out and trying it for yourself !
the elite family is friendly and willing to answer any questions .
honestly the most helpful and qualified gym staff i have encountered .
i am in training club which is offered at various times of the day .
stockton dermatology is the best dermatology office in the valley !
the front office staff is extremely polite , friendly , and inviting .
their appointments are flexible and they are prompt and on time .
i would recommend them to anyone !
he made me feel very comfortable and confident i would get great results .
i would definitely recommend him to anyone wanting to look their best .
very personable , knowledgable , and honest .
i never felt like he was trying to sell any unnecessary products or services .
thank you charles for a wonderful experience .
love the people there so i give them 5 stars
dr. beaty was very pleasant to deal with along with her front office staff .
along with the glare reducing coating .
she pushed and she pushed .
she made me uncomfortable and while i 'd visit the office again .
i would not allow her to assist me again .
i got a 1 hour massage from brian and he was very good .
i 'll absolutely come back again .
dr frankie is the best ! ! !
2. you want the best post-natal care in the state .
the office and exam rooms are beautifully maintained and feel warm .
the colors and fabrics are a far cry from the traditional doctor 's office .
the birth center is just absolutely beautiful and cozy .
that 's how you put a diaper on !
i had no idea about the stages of labor !
( yup , all of it was news to me . )
following my birth , babymoon inn continued to be supportive .
the help i received with lactation consultation was invaluable .
what you choose , when you choose babymoon , is community .
dental office as a whole from start to finish was great .
all staff was friendly and knowledgeable !
both my children 7 year old and 3 year old loved it .
dentist was great with both kids !
i 'm always on the hunt for healthy food places !
i ordered a greenhouse bowl ( ? )
she also gave me a free drink card !
tempeh flavour and texture were spot on .
nevertheless i felt very satiated ( not bloated ) .
our food arrived quickly and i was blown away by the cornbread/soup/salad combo .
the portion size was perfect .
my split pea soup was hearty and very umami-filled .
the cornbread ( with flax i believe ? )
was excellent and it tastes 10x better than its classic butter-laden cousin .
it is my new favourite casual restaurant .
i agree with a previous reviewer saying that it 's `` unpretentious '' .
dr. plorde ( spelling may be off ) was fantastic .
i would recommend this place to anybody wanting good quality dental work .
probably the best facial i have ever had .
i first went with my daughter and then went back for myself .
she takes the time to understand your skin and offers healthful suggestions .
the only drawback is that her location is in sort of a weird complex .
i have spent more time and money here than i care to admit .
i 've even come to prefer vegan cupcakes to their more fat saturated counterparts .
i miss this place when i go home to the states .
i wish they delivered .
easiest 5 star review of my life .
megan always does such and amazing job !
i would highly recommend him for crowns .
i 'm so thankful , my smile is priceless !
i 'm highly satisfied and telling everyone to come here ! !
i truly believe there is a place for western medicine .
she spends the time to listen and to properly diagnose your issues .
i highly recommend dr. kwan to anyone seeking a sincere and caring physician .
i usually have little wait once i check in .
what an incredible experience .
her demeanor and professionalism were second to none .
this was by far the best option rather then going to the er .
i could n't recommend this service any higher - well done .
looking forward to utilizing you guys again when needed !
i highly recommend this place .
i am definitely going back .
super friendly staff and affordable : )
the staff is absolutely amazing !
i feel as though she has one on one care .
i regret not coming here sooner !
my son is 2 1/2 and his first ever dental visit went fine .
this will be my son 's dentist .
the place had a clean and nice relaxing atmosphere .
we paid $ 30 for feet and body massage ... ..totally worth it !
will definitely be coming back !
went to this store for the first time today .
it was so nice !
everyone made sure we were finding everything and it was so well put together .
best place to go for a shake after your workout ! !
staff is so nice and remembers what i get !
i was very skeptical , but 1 month later my problem is gone .
i feel grateful to have met dr. miller .
i feel like she was honest and frank with me .
i trust dr. angela miller .
she also treats my husband who is happy with her .
i came here as a kid and now i bring my 2 kids .
so worth it to see dr weiner and dr muyot is good as well .
walking into bella smiles , i came across a dental gem in the desert .
best dental office i 've been too across seven continents .
also , my experience at the reception has been good .
i have had a lot of dentists in my life .
i really like dr todd russell and his staff .
i recommend them to anyone looking for a dentist .
we are from out of state and our families loved the livestream feature online !
we are having a boy !
we will most likely be back for a 4d session in the third trimester .
i felt miserable before the massage session .
she was able to make me feel like a different person after the session .
you are the best !
i love working with dr amena deluca .
she listens carefully and provides skin care for all my family members .
including my young daughter with severe ezcema .
easy to schedule appointments and thorough exams .
i have been a client since 2009 and this place keeps getting better .
they use awesome products and always have a product on sale .
i 've had an appointment canceled last minute bc a student was out sick .
i always treat my out of town visitors with a facial at swina .
excellent clinic very helpful and knowledgable .
even helped me out after hours no charge .
he has helped make this scary journey so much better for me .
he 's my angel !
bless you and thank you dr. hollifield !
had a great experience at rejuvenation spa !
i got a cut and highlights .
i said just a trim and thats just what they did !
the color of my highlights matched perfectly .
now my hair is perfect , will be going back again !
go here ; you wo n't regret it .
( mydrnow- see review via my profile . )
tests : they could do so much on-site .
i needed blood , ultrasound , x-ray , hba1c and some other stuff .
i 'm really impressed .
she was warm , and just really great all around .
ultrasound tech : sandra- once again , lovely- just lovely .
they were just as lovely as everyone else i dealt with today .

's , and an ipad to choose from for the children .
it 's a new facility and very clean .
the atmosphere was very comfortable and my son 's experience was quite pleasant .
what can we say about this little nestled gnc store ?
he suggested these awesome little appetite suppressant/ energy boosters that i love !
i was looking into decompression therapy to help me with my low back issues .
everyone has been so helpful and friendly with me , i consider them family .
even with the pet names , al is a wonderful asset to the team .
you are not treated like a number , but as a valued patient .
quick , friendly and informative .
this clinic is amazing !
they also direct bill my insurance which is a huge bonus .
and , they 're right downtown at yonge and adelaide .
just one more thing to love about this clinic !
ca n't say enough about rebalance .
we finally changed our entire family over to skyline .
the front staff is great and always professional .
dr. kerry green is great , but so are the pa 's .
they listen , which is son nice at a medical office .
i do n't like condescending medical professionals .
we 're excited to have a place for the entire family .
my son needed a simple tooth extraction , we had never been there .
but doctor christensen was able to get him in that morning .
his staff and him included were just wonderful with him .
my friend is a patient there .
the nurses take good care of her and she is always clean .
there are a lot of nurses , aides and respiratory therapists .
the staff are really caring .
i 'm glad to know she is in good hands .
i absolutely love going for my visits with ashlee !
and then the relief i feel after the acupuncture and cupping sessions is amazing !
james has magic hands .
his pressure is perfect !
i wish i could go every week .
my back , shoulders and neck would be the better for it .
i am a meat lover .
a classic hamburger is my all time fav .
so when my friend took me to this vegan restaurant i was skeptical .
i ordered the `` banquet burger '' with bean sprouts and veggie bacon .
and it was so good and super filling .
if you 're like me and love burgers gives this vegan place a try .
tastes amazing , great service and a bonus that it fills you up !
if i am in the area , i will go again !
the staff is amazing !
they are so friendly and make you feel right at home !
i love dr. krugly and dr. bradshaw .
dr. krugly works with me and dr. bradshaw works with my dog .
their entire staff are friendly and obviously love working there .
dr. krugly is excellent at explaining and treating .
i have been to several physical therapists , rolfers , massage therapists , etc .
but dr. krugly surpasses them all .
dr. bradshaw helped my dog when she fell and hurt her back .
i love dr. leverett and his staff !
jennifer is great and she really makes skin care affordable .
i can hardly go a month without a `` fix '' .
and now , she 's got a website where you can schedule your appointments .
i had an excellent dental experience at red mountain family dental .
the front desk staff were friendly and accommodating in scheduling my dental care .
i had the best cleaning and exam .
the hygienist was patient and gentle .
he provided pain free dental work and completed it fast .
everyone thinks i 'm weird because i actually enjoy going to the dentist .
it 's because i 've gone to dr. j. since i was 5 !
( i 'm 25 ! )
he is amazing and his staff is incredible too .
they are always so friendly and welcoming !
they do excellent work and dont do unnecessary things .
i 'm always nervous about x-rays and they also ease my worries .
they also have new hi-tech x-rays that are so quick and painless .
the first person you 'll meet is liz , she runs the front office .
she is such a good example of what 's to come .
very friendly and welcoming and always professional .
if you 're looking for a dentist , this is the one ! !

the rest of the staff i had contact with were also caring .
i highly recommend him !
i am really happy with family doctors of green valley .
all the staff here are very friendly and compassionate .
i have n't had a long wait at any of my appointments .

i lost one pair of hearing aids and they replaced them very quickly .
malisa at miricle ear in henderson nevada is outstanding .
i made my appointment online .
i went in to be seen for a sore throat and possible sinus infection .
he was wonderful and very professional .
once he left the np walked in no less than 2mins later .
overall i was taken care of and had a great experience !
one of the best dentists i have ever had , very thorough and gentle .
the staff including the front desk and dental hygienist are very friendly .
! ..recommend the deluxe with hot rocks !
i had sinus and deviated septum surgery completed by dr. weingarten .
finally i can stop looking for a new dentist !
it was off a regular price that was already $ 550 less ! ! !
it includes retainers and all your visits , no hidden fees .
i can not say enough about how excited i am to have found them !
i will be recommending them to all my family and friends .
you 'll see i 'm right !
today was my very first full treatment appointment with dr. wrye .
without question dr. wrye is tremendously skilled in many treatment methods .
i had a great experience from start to finish with ttw .
when we arrived , we were the only customers .
this store is n't just about retail , it 's an experience .
the hygienist was one of the nicest i 'd ever met .
the new patient exam was thorough and included a short medical history .
he did n't believe that gum recession was caused by aggressive brushing techniques .
if you go to this location , request her you will not regret it .
i left feeling completely pain free .
so ... add $ 27 to your gel manicure or pedicure .
they never answer the phones , which can be frustrating .
however : they are nice .
they know what they are doing .
dr. hofflander was referred by my gp .
he got me in fast for a consult and scheduled surgery conveniently as well .
i was very happy with the surgical center staff and dr. hofflander was great !
great produce , good selection of healthier brands of food and health products .
employees seem happy and willing to help .
got the head and reflexology combo and the ion detox .
i absolutely loved both services .
for two hours , i was pampered beyond belief .
i felt like i was in a state of bliss .
this beats those burke williams any day .
in and out in 20 minutes with no appointment .
friendly team , clean and comfortable waiting area .
we tried a few locations before finding this one .
i 'm sure with an appointment this location would be a breeze .
one issue is no one actually monitors the front desk .
i 've been visiting this dentist for almost 10 years .
i actually go from california to las vegas to get treated every year .
i ca n't trust anyone else with my teeth .
dr. alemi is very kind and i find him to be very trustworthy .
he is always honest and communicates and educates me a lot on my teeth .
his staff is also very present and kind and the clinic is always clean .
i trust him more than i could trust anyone else with my teeth !
he tries to be very flexible and accommodating !
i was skeptical at first , but i was willing to try it out .
i am using the groupon and it 's helped so much !
the staff is so wonderful , friendly and knowledgable !
i recommend med shape to anyone who is considering it because you cant loose .
could n't ask for more ! ! ! !
this place is really great for a smaller shop !
their staff is super friendly and very knowledgeable about their products .
they have the best edibles there and always have a fair price .
i would definitely tell my friends about it !
there is no one better in charlotte than prit !
she has the highest understanding of her clients and unmatched customer service .
he is very kind , caring , and attentive .
i would highly recommend him .
kevin is the best .
he focused on the issues i was having and made it so much better .
in a word - incredible !
ca n't believe all the 1 stars .
anyway , 5 stars go to both dr. andy tran and dr. camille le .
i am soooo happy today ! !
my shoulder has been giving me problems for 2 years .
i 'm open to possibilities .
this is awesome ! !
tonight my shoulder is comfortable for the fist time in years .
dr. shelly is definitely worth seeing .
i feel good right now ! ! !
thank you dr. shelly !

i will only go here now .
great place to go i highly recommend .
i 've been a patient of dr. lawyer 's for more than 10 years .
would n't think of changing .
he and his staff are superb .
the owner made booking the appointment super easy .
next she asked us if there was anywhere we wanted them to focus on .
finally we were let into this nice little clean couples room .
the massage was really good and very relaxing .
relaxing music played the entire time which i enjoyed .
first time customers pay $ 27.99 for 1 hour .
they do prefer you tip in cash .
overall everything was amazing and definitely worth the price .
also the bathroom was very clean !
i would recommend to everybody !
great experience here ! !
the staff is great ! !
super friendly , funny and professional ! !
they have help me tremendously !

jon gave one of the best massages i 've ever had .
he 's really good at what he does .
i would recommend jon to anyone ! !
if i could give jon 6 stars instead of 5 i would !
he 's that good !
i 've been coming here for specialty prescriptions for the last 2 years .
they are always friendly and provides good customer service .
this is a truly excellent doctor but his office needs major help .
otherwise i would have had to wait months to see the doctor .
what a shame because he is truly an excellent doctor !
just got the prettiest matte black stiletto nails done by mary !
great service , clean salon and a variety of services offered !
i will def be back in the future ! !
thanks pop lash & nails !
not bad , not bad at all .
this is not a fancy spa .
and it 's open late , till 10 pm .
if you 're in the strip mall , definitely worth a visit .
after a gym class , getting a massage treatment by yang feels very refreshing .
if you have coverage , use your health insurance benefits !
physical therapy is so very helpful , the staff is awesome .
the knowledge of the staff is great ...

everyone was very nice and personable as well .
we love my left foot childrens therapy .

ca n't say enough about jazz and her facials .
she is the best !
very fair pricing , an overall great experience .
my skin has never looked better and i appreciate her approach and technique .
jazz also does n't try to push products or other procedures not needed .
i would recommend her to everyone without hesitation .
dr. roskos has now been my dentist since the late-1990 's .
i would never consider going anywhere else .
the entire staff treats you like you 're the only patient they have .
friendly , gentle , talented people that genuinely care .
wow ! ! ! !
that 's all i can say .

it was the first massage that i have had in about 20 years !

but the two clerks working the counter were courteous , helpful and informative .
it took about 15 minutes to complete all the paperwork .

step one extraction of the 5 of the 6 broken teeth .
on 12/13 i had those teeth `` surgically extracted '' .
i was beyond impressed from the minute i got there .
i actually liked them .
preparing myself for the horror of a dental appointment , as i recall them .
i did n't feel anything at all getting the shots .
ok. i 'm impressed but we 'll see how it goes .
so , i honestly felt like i was in the chair 15-30 mins .
i was confused at the end like `` we 're done ? ''
yeah , we were done .
spoiler alert : it went great .
i felt no pain .
i felt pressure , sure but trust me that is definitely not pain .
recovery : after the anesthetic wore off i was actually fine .
the tenderness is gone and the stitches are pulling themselves out a little .
`` are you sure it 's ok for me to swallow ? ''
`` what if i sneeze ? ''
they worked seamlessly with my insurance .
i 'm excited to have a plan .
i 'm excited to no longer have infected broken teeth in my mouth .
i 'm excited bc i have hope .

at a cancer center , though , that is less often the case .
it 's a newer place , with giant windows and pretty photo art .
the staff has been great so far , too .
that does a lot for peace of mind and financial and medical decision planning .
then , a kind volunteer showed us the way to our next stop .
so far , two thumbs up .
the office is small , clean and quiet .
dr. david ngo is hands down the best dentist in arizona .

i went for my facial soon after wards .
the room and table were very comfortable and kept at the perfect temp .
my aesthetician was great .
my favorite part of the spa was the pool .
the pool is only for spa guests so it 's quiet and relaxed .
the food served poolside was surprisingly good .
my mom and sister went gaga over the turkey sliders .
the menu indicated it had 400 calories , but i do n't believe it .
if it 's true , that 's a work of black magic .

this was my first crossfit experience coming from a background of traditional gyms .
there are so many different class times to choose from throughout the day .
saturdays are so much fun because there are usually team workouts .
the coaches focus on form to ensure that no one injures themselves .
all in all , you should definitely drop in and do a workout .
you 'll never want to go to another gym again !
i was so very pleased to find this community .

our daughter bumped her tooth pretty hard .
her tooth was loose , bloody gums , etc .
it was about 7pm .
they were one of the few dentists open .
we are grateful we came in .
did i mention how awesome they were ?
neither one would eat the mac and cheese , so i tasted it .
i was appalled at the very starchy sauce and very mushy pasta .
i threw it out .
the same response to the tamales , which i could n't wait to try .
totally dry with no flavor .
i threw them out also .
not to mention the person who waited on me .
i will be much more careful next time i hit the salad bar .
