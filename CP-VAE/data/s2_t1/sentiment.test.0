parking is ok now that baseball is over .
but the place is suddenly filthy .
pictures of the dirty machines are attached .
hair , dust , sweat accumulating for weeks .
lifetime ca n't open soon enough !
all this time was spent with the pa , leanna peterson .
the dr. came in for about 2 minutes at that appointment .
horribly rude and very unhelpful staff made for a terrible night in the er .
avoid at all costs !
these people do not care about patients at all !
meanwhile , she could barely hold her head up nor speak .
i walked away and saw her get on her cell phone .
do not come here they do not care for patients !
horribly dirty , careless physicians , completely unacceptable service !
the wait times are way too long !
very inconsiderate of health and pain levels .
please fix the tv sets on the stair machines upstairs .
they have not worked since those machines were put in 4 months ago .
they turn on but have no stations .
unacceptable when there are a total of 4 stair machines .
half do n't have working tvs .
less expensive gyms have working tvs .
this is not a luxury .
i am forced to watch tv on my phone .
have to use my own data plan .
again , reliable wifi is not difficult to provide .
i like the staff at this location .
unbelievably bad customer service .
they 'll take your money and give you product but that 's it .
no real coaching , counseling or follow up .
thank god i am out of that hellhole !
some were fired although some left on their own .
please keep in mind this was my experiance .
the one major con is the food bar .
the selection is mediocre , and the chefs do n't really change it up .
i was in phoenix for about 2.5 weeks .
i usually get food from whole foods when i 'm on business trips .
however , this time it was a challenge .
the server was awesome .
super knowledgeable about wine .
terrible place in general !
enter this place at your own risk !
forces new patients to give a credit card # or pay up front .
dentist herself is not family oriented but , somewhat friendly .
do n't think she has kids .
dental work is fairly expensive and average at best .
if it 's not an inconvienace i would work with someone else .
do not go here , they do not take care of you at all .
if i could give this place a zero rating i would !
then , they finally get me a room .
this place is a pathetic excuse for an urgent caresmall hospital .
wrong diagnosis and poor , poor care for their patients .
gave us hardly any information .
why would n't they just tell me over the phone .
my sister and i presented today for lip injections having purchased vouchers on groupon .
i 'm very sad to have to update my previously positive review .
all of the other d backs employees park off site .
not sure why he gets the closest spot to the club .
not sure why that had n't been done from day one .
so people from other clubs are parking and going to the game .
other cars had no permit and no note .
there were five people in the gym and 16 cars in the lot .
i came to dr anantuni for a 2nd opinion .
she hardly spoke to me and was exceptionally rude .
anantuni 's demeanor was no better .
no explanation of what was happening to me was given .
i gagged twice from dry mouth while sandi ignored and continued suctioning & probing .
i was offended nearly to the point of tears during the first appointment .
to my horror , the 2nd visit was even worse .
my crown did not fit even remotely , as sandi forced it on .
sandi told me not to move when i shifted out of pain .
she attempted for force the crown on with floss 3x .
eventually she gives up and anantuni fits my crown .
when i left my gums were still bleeding and bruised .
do not come here .
i 've confirmed the similiar experiences with sandi from 2 other patients .
meaning you have to grab all groceries and transfer .
nasty workers should get fired in my opinion .
thanks for your vote !
talk about a total lack of transparency with pricing !
and , there is no mention of pricing on their website either .
felt like we were dealing with a used car salesman with a hidden agenda .
needless to say we took our business elsewhere .
only go here as a last resort .
if you can get to henderson or vegas do it .
less than 2 hours .
they are very hard to communicate with and quickly attack your credit .
st. rose is so much better you cant compare them .
these guys may be good to give staples or stitches
do not rent here .
you are better off in an all age community .
keep your sanity and stay away .
the negligence is blatant .
the process and the system in place fails every patient .
this is an sos signal .
someone save me ! ! !
a different dentist came in and apologized .
needless to say , i will not be returning .
this was a sloppy mistake that could have easily been prevented .
i purchased a voucher to visit the rest nest float club on groupon .
this was not the case at all .
when i went back to the lobby , there was no one there .
shortly thereafter , he was back in the lobby .
he had gone to a neighbouring business to discuss a leaky roof situation .
i wish there was an option for zero or minus 10 stars .
sadly , i think the deplorable customer service issues are a corporate-wide quest problem .
why is it so impossible to get your test results ?
it does not work .
i had labs drawn seven days ago .
today , the doctor says they have no results from sonora quest .
my lab results were just going to sit there in nowhere land ?
they were n't going to bother following the instructions on my lab requisition ?
it took my calling them to get them to do their job ?
getting your labs drawn is not the problem .
getting you results , that is consistently a nightmare .
i absolutely despise this company !
snappy , argumentative and ghetto .
she kept the phone to her hear while talking to me .
are n't there hippa regulations ?
he seemed annoyed and angry to be there .
the visit only got better when the doctor and melissa came in .
will think twice before coming here again
second i would choose zero or negative ten stars if i could .
do not leave your loved ones here ! ! !
no one cared what happened to him .
i would n't allow a dog to be in this facility .
dr bilski does the hard sell on tooth implant and probably other services .
which i did n't know at the time .
save yourself a lot of money and grief and go to a specialist .
my jaw is still in pain from his work three years later .
best of luck to you all ... way overpriced
one of the most unprofessional pharmacies i have ever encountered .
today i called in to see if a prescription was ready to pick up .
a script that the doctor called in 3 days ago !
i was told that it was not ready and still being worked on .
no apologies or explanations were given .
when i asked for an eta the tech hung up on me .
all my business is going else where !
after two years of seeing dr. davis , we will not be returning .
they need to slow down and properly care for children 's teeth .
on our first visit , davis recommended my two children get sealants .
one year later , it was recommended several get replaced .
two days after they were replaced again , an entire sealant had popped off !
monday came , no call .
tuesday came , no call .
they refused to remove the sealants saying they would have to drill them off .
i do n't know if that 's true .
no amount of brushing will be able to prevent that cavity from forming .
i will not be returning to this office .
this is not okay .
the absolute most awful receptionists i 've ever dealt with .
we had absolutely disappointing experience with new you spa .
their accounting department avoided any contacts with us .
dr. ghodsi from lasting smiles dental care is a joke !
... . he slick , polished , and full of bs !
my wife and i went there to inquire about their $ 695 dental implants .
i wanted to know what the grand total was .
at this point , we were done !
the person that makes the copies had gone home for the night .
in our opinion , dr. ghodsi is an embarrassment to the medical community .
this review is for dr. blake goodbar : a condescending young physician .
he is part of the `` everybody gets a trophy '' generation .
has absolutely no personality and hideous skills dealing with individuals .
my dogs veterinarian is more qualified than this clown .
we have til sunday to know if he will make it .
ive used this business off and on for years .
i 'm appalled at how this company treats their patients .
i went to this business solely based on yelp reviews .
the whole session was just kinda rushed and rash .
dr. wickman is knowledgeable but too difficult to contact or schedule an appt .
when i first visited - on a friday - everything went well .
too difficult to contact the dr. or her nurse .
the entire scheduling process is much too corporate .
i 'm looking for another , smaller , practice to serve my needs .
this one just is n't worth the effort .
a sheep in wolves clothing !
at first glance this place seemed wonderful .
my husband and i got a cleaning and x-rays .
my husband was told he needed 12 fillings ...
this coming from 2 adults who get 2-3 cleanings per year .
their ploy did n't work .
this is n't his area of expertise at all .
i believed dr. ditesheim was truly the best cosmetic surgeon i found .
i felt so comfortable with him and his staff .
i had a breast augmentation 8 months ago and my results are unacceptable .
all totaling over double what i originally paid for the initial surgery .
i sent a letter voicing my concerns and received no response .
i requested my records and received no response .
i will now be searching for a more competent surgeon to do my revision .
what do you want me to do ?
make it again or do you want something different ? ''
i appreciated the offer , but her attitude was less than desirable .
and the frozen fruit to top it off !
was i supposed to gnaw on it ?
: ) add the vanilla whey protein powder for an extra boost !
i will no longer be a patient for the following reasons .
prior to visit versus during my visit ) .
as you may be aware of , blood work requires preparation such as fasting .
i have never met a more incompetent staff than at nevada eye and ear .
was not satisfied at all !
i will be going elsewhere from now on .
i will also let my friends know about my experience here .
well it never did .
unfortunately a very underwhelming experience !
my first appointment was awful , she was a terrible listener .
making judgements about my lifestyle that simply were not true .
i pleaded , argued , and begged for the referral .
and that i should contact him immediately next time symptoms arise .
i have no clue why this woman is a family doctor .
health department should be involved in mandating grocery stores to have power backup .
if not the hd then at least good business sense .
i think years ago this may have been a great place .
now , it is a cattle call .
totally my fault , i missed it .
do n't expect much personal attention .
every appointment i have had was over an hour late .
i have been given results for someone else on more than one occasion .
so i do n't see how they thought i was someone else .
i went in for just a sonogram and was there for over 3 hours .
this has happened at every appointment .
i have switched to the scottsdale office ... much much better experience ... .
today there were five people in the gym .
two of them are a couple and drive together .
the parking lot was almost full .
gym management has still not gotten the proper signage to actually tow cars .
the gym opened in 2012. it 's clearly not happening .
the man who checks for permits is useless .
he had no answer .
he also parks illegally in the lot .
he has quite possibly the easiest job in the world and is completely ineffective .
problem would be solved if mountainside actually towed cars .
some of the repeat offenders work inside the stadium and park there each game .
i 'm done with mountainside .
a lifetime is opening up in 2019 near the biltmore .
i can hardly wait .
i 'm going to encourage my gym friends to check out lifetime .
who cares about hippa violation ! !
i was a patient of dr. patel for over a year .
it is very apparent that it is all about the money in this office .
beware of this doctor and his unlicensed staff treating patients ! !
you are just a dollar sign to them ! !
be aware of this place !
not to mention his teeth are only a few years old .
long story short i got a second opinion and guess what ? ? ?
no cavities , no decay ! ! !
so why the immediate need to fill at 4 yrs old is beyond me .
i 'm not writing this review to bash the place .
i just do n't want parents/children to go through unnecessary procedures .
apart from the money scamming , the place is good .
i will not be returning because of this !
the other reviewers obviously have deep pockets .
not very bright service .
asked for ingredients for something and nobody knew .
got 3 salads , a falafel app and 2 drinks .
$ 93 ! ! !
i heard it was pricey but that is insane mixed with grandiose entitlement .
sad cause i was looking forward to a juice/raw restaurant on the east side .
i do love pulp kitchen and will go there from now on .
it can be smelly and dirty .
let 's just say the help do their best .
it seems to be cultural .
garbage in ... garbage out !
it takes learning about healthcare to get great healthcare .
that is true in all aspects if healthcare .
the internet make it easy .
especially if you study natural , holistic health options !
so within 20 minutes i was at the store to purchase it .
however , when i got there it was nowhere to found .
i 've never been spoken to like that regarding my plate on meatless monday .
in fact , other cashiers have just rubber banded my plate .
i understand policy and such but there 's nicer ways to go about things .
worse than a walk-in clinic .
treated like a revolving door or just an ohip/insurance card to be billed .
learn from my mistakes if you actually choose to go here for care .
do not pay up front .
check your own insurance benefits .
the problem is , they refused to refund me any money .
the final heaping load of salt in the wound ?
the $ 600 back brace is on amazon for $ 150 .
no one has bothered to talk to me .
apologize for the delay.. nothing .
this is the worst medical office i 've been in
i think the purpose of her doing that was for her to get tips ?
she did n't say during the session and was not very welcoming or friendly .
i would never go back there !
if there can be zero star rated , i would 've given them that !
i was sent from honor health hospital for physical rehabilitation .
as soon as i get there , i notice how filthy the place is .
the woman at the front desk as i came in ignored me .
i went to the room and it was even more disgusting .
the woman at he desk finally noticed me !
the staff and management followed me out begging me to stay .
literally , the staff and management were begging me to stay .
if you are going for physical rehab , go somewhere else .
worst doctors experience i have ever encountered .
avoid at all costs ! ! ! !
it only took me two appointments to flee from this place .
the technicians are not meticulous and they are not friendly at all .
yeah machines are alright ( not a single squat rack ) and somewhat clean .
i already knew in that moment that this is not going to be easy .
i ended up paying 135 because of course they want more money from me .
it is not even about the money , they are bunch of greedy liars .
even la fitness has an easier cancellation process !
extremely hot in the uncomfortable , loud waiting room .
bud room was nicely air conditioned , but very crowded and very loud .
**nurse review** so grateful to this dispensary for providing a cannabis r.n .
for consultations ! ! ! ! ! ! !
we give her more stars than offered here .
definitely worth the time if you need questions answered .
i also know they up-sell ; fact ; my husband does n't have insurance .
why not just give him the regular cleaning ? ! ? !
it was a total waste of time .
i 'm headed elsewhere ... and taking my entire family with !
this is the worst establishment .
they dont gove 1 fuck about their patients .
dont recommend save time & money go somewhere else .
please dont here ! ! ! ! ! !
dr. young is fine , however , the staff is not .
after that , it went down hill .
she then left me a vm a few min .
because i owe them money .
then , cancel my appt .
because i am late ? ! ? !
glad i am done with this office .
sorry dr. young , your staff has made you look unprofessional and quite embarrassing .
sandy in the pharmacy gives a new meaning to the word ' rude ' .
i let her know how i felt .
calling the cvs main manager .
this place was a complete waste of time .
it 's extremely rare for me to leave a 1 star review .
no thank you , will never return here .
this is the worst place anyone can go for any type of therapy .
now the only thing that tells me is it 's all about the money !
please if you can avoid it go somewhere else .
je n'ai vraiment pas aimé ce gym .
je le trouve déjà mal disposé .
on se sent vite confiné .
il y a quand même pas mal d'appareils de muscu au 1er étage .
des casiers inutilisables et des miroirs cassés dans les salles d'entrainement .
des horaires pas très larges .
vraiment dommage surtout pour le prix .
yeah if i you id go elsewhere .
the dog is allowed on the beds and pillows that are used for treatment .
the equipment is old .
it 's not a professional medical facility .
if i could put 0 stars i would .
i went there almost 3 years ago and got all my mouth work done .
the dentist obviously does not know what she is doing .
its fallen out twice .
im very disappointed and i will not be returning .
i do not recommend dc dental on 19th ave and bell rd .
unless you like shitty work and wasting money .
ridiculous to wait that long with an appointment .
the first time i went it was wonderful .
the massage and facial were both great .
second time around the massage was wonderful , but the facial was awful .
approx 30 minutes of the girl rubbing my face and head .
it sure was relaxing but i wanted a facial not a head rub .
i will never go back there again .
terrible service and ridiculous prices .
my review in one word = rip-off !
this `` court appointed '' pc does n't deserve a single star .
be warned and do what you must to get his recusal !
no family is safe here .
you guys are literally never open .
super upsetting , because i love all the juices and products .
but i feel that the public should be notified .
my entire family had appointments with this dentist .
so the 5 star reviews are extremely misleading .
by the time i was leaving , i was almost in panic attack mode .
almost $ 20,000 in dental work was prescribed .
crowns on almost every molar needed , inlays on most others .
this is not for cosmetic purposes .
he said my teeth were full of cavities .
i had no idea how this could 've happened in 6 months .
my husband was also prescribed near $ 15000 in work .
! and this new dentist has been in the community 30 yrs .
so you tell me , out of three dentists .
who do you believe ? ? ?
once again , beware of the 5 star reviews .
they give you a discount if you write them .
and there is n't a phone number listed !
do n't feed me bullshit .
i would n't recommend anyone to go here .
was n't a horrible experience , but could have been better .
the office space is clean and modern .
my injections did turn out nicely though .
very hard to get an appointment .
i have gone to this clinic for both iui 's and an ivf cycle .
they have too many patients and you feel like a number .
we are know paying for that mistake .
definitely look elsewhere for someplace that is more organized if you have to option .
not the best place to seek medical care .
i would never risk another pregnancy with this practice .
the ultrasound given there showed incompetent cervix and bulging membranes .
he decided to do his own ultrasound .
when that showed an acceptable length of cervix .
terrible experience all around .
i would n't wish it on my worst enemy .
my father was admitted here after extensive back surgery .
his mind is completely foggy and he 's more incoherent as time moves forward .
do not see dr. michael schlaack !
he was smiling and mocking me the whole time .
he made me feel like i was there to get `` narcotics '' .
that was back in april .
the nurse told me `` we do n't do that .
we are pro-life here . ''
it is fda-approved to prevent pregnancy and will not harm an existing pregnancy .
if i could give this place negative stars i would .
do n't go to the gi department ! ! !
when i called to complain i was dismissed again .
they are just trying to get insurance money .
hate to say i saw this coming , but there you go .
mixing non-profit management with a retail establishment is recipe for disaster .
all amf locations are terrible .
high prices , old equipment , no or little tv 's .
just because i 've only wrote a couple of reviews mine was not posted .
omg~ generally i like massage envys .
but i decided i would still be pleasant and pay for the massage .
i had to go back to get my card .
horrible experience nearly every time i had to go here during my pregnancy .
she should not be allowed to interact with patients .
it felt like a cattle call when you get in there .
they want you in and out as quickly as possible .
they are irritated when you ask questions .
if you are looking for a caring dr this is not the place to go
overall , bad experience .
the receptionist was fine , standard customer service .
barely asked any questions and diagnosed me .
the level of competence here is very concerning .
i wrote a review in 2015 when my mom was in sante of mesa .
even calling does n't get results .
staff are under educated .
look beyond the decor and eating anytime you want in their restaurant and bistro .
just because they have carpet instead of tile how clean is that ?
as i said she was neglected and wasted away .
this spa has an arrogant , dictator running the men 's spa .
i sure hope someone sues these guys .
yesterday , i get a call asking to reschedule .
today , hrs before my appt , i get another call .
this time they said that their machine started acting up today .
seems they ca n't get their story straight .
( they did offer an appointment today at a location across town .
this place has excuse after excuse and nothing runs efficiently .
there are so many places you can go for an mri in vegas .
do n't go here .
i went to this establishment because i had a contact stuck in my eye .
i was charged almost $ 200 for the doctor to remove the contact .
she acted like she was afraid to touch me .
she treated me like i had the plague .
she was the most aloof and unfriendly doctor i have ever been to !
very dissatisfied with how she treated me .
do n't go here if you have an issue .
they 're all about the money !
based off my insurance , i had a deductible , as many others do .
plus , their obgyn 's are on par with dr. luh .
they sent me to collections over missing one payment .
they sit there with bitch faces and bad eyebrows .
i was always nice , too .
what can you do .
i went in for an infection .
i was paying out of pocket .
i let both the front office and the pa who was treating me know .
those two bills worth almost $ 3,000 were for a 30 minutes visit .
this was by far the most unprofessional and worst care i have ever experienced .
i regret ever going .
fairview hospitals birthing center is very mediocre .
i ca n't put negative stars ?
i should be able to .
what an effing joke .
why is this place open ?
went here with my wife .
i have bronchitis and my wife is showing symptoms of it .
she went in and was treated like dirt .
you guys are unprofessional and should be ashamed .
people , trust yelp reviews and move on to a different urgent care .
there is a reason this office has bad reviews
only choice is to leave a message .
reminded me of the bureaucracy at the government level .
dental clinic is terrible .
their excuse `` we are a teaching clinic '' .
great way to teach your students .
do n't even think of making a suggestion .
they will `` dismiss '' you as a patient .
on the plus side it hurt less than previous waxings .
i 'll try the other salons in the area .
they do not value repeat business i still feel ripped off !
look , a good optometrist is n't hard to find .
this is my second year going and they let me down .
i looked online and found the same glasses for an average of $ 60 .
this was my second time seeing her .
i ask if i could exchange these glasses for another pair .
not because the glasses were marked up , because they agreed they were n't .
their policy is 30 days .
group classes wo n't answer your individual needs .
they 'll always refer you to the individual therapist you 're to maintain .
16 week 4 part module you 'll go 4 weeks then off 1 week .
cuz guess what ? ! ?
kids in another room 4 ) doctors lead the group sessions .
7 ) water , pens and candy pieces are available upon entry .
it 's the smallest available .
a 1 '' inch is most apropos .
10 ) they accept all credit cards .
11 ) help yourself and get an electronic copy of the receipt .
enter ... get lectured ... review the homework .
17 ) no hard data or empirical data .
fair enough but at a minimum # surveys seeking confidential input could be provided .
**we need gradual steps down nothing definitively final like it is offered here .
a few sips in and i start to have a severe reaction ! ! !
i have been to other places and never had this problem ! !
being i work next door i frequented this place .
however i promise i will never return to a place with such negligence .
believe me , i get there 's a risk .
otherwise this may have ended a lot worse ! ! !
i set up an appointment which was fairly convenient .
or go somewhere else .
it may have been on their website , but i did n't see it .
right now i am just frustrated that i wasted over an hour on this .
the worst patient service i have ever encountered !
better business bureau and my insurance company will be hearing from me .
this is a scam , do not sign up with this company !
seriously , save your money .
it 's not even a real clinic once you walk in there .
the only machine that i 've seen in that place was the weight scale .
very nice staff , very professional and clean office .
more than ones they ran over one hour behind .
what 's the purpose to have an appointment then ?
i recommend this place , if you have extra time to waste !
it makes it feel like a chore shopping here !
definitely prefer other locations .
the space is so small and you are literally bumping into things .
i will definitely not be going back .
i 'd rather spend my money elsewhere .
i went here with my fiance because we purchased the 80 minute groupon massages .
first of all , we walked in and were n't greeted .
he was picking at his face and was very socially awkward .
the water they serve is terrible .
my therapist had really dry hands and did n't seem very experienced .
he talked the whole time and was n't professional at all .
my fiance 's therapist was alright .
it was awkward and not organized .
the entire appointment was not enjoyable .
i would not recommend going here for anything .
that 's about it .
had a positive ana lab result with my gp .
he recommended dr. peters at aara .
( in hindsight , i kind of have to agree with her there ! )
( why , if i had nothing wrong with me ? )
it turned out a few of my levels were above range , slightly .
since she is a specialist , my co-pay was $ 60 .
i might as well have flushed my $ down the toilet .
never again ! ! !
the place is pretty new .
i was out of there in less then 5minutes !
this amount was just for seeing the dr. not anything else .
make sure before you go to this place that you really have an emergency !
try your local clinic or ask friends what to do .
unbelievable that even with insurance this is what i have to pay !
all together $ 990.00 .
this was the worst hospital i 've ever been to .
we had the pleasure of having nurse jaqueline .
other patients having pain needing help they yelled at and told them to wait .
please if you have another option for care go there .
anyways i hope this helps others in the future .
he is condescending and short to say the least .
incessantly checked his watch during my short 10 minute appointment .
i will never return to this doctor for care !
i am just now getting correctly diagnosed with a rheumatologist .
they do not take insurance as they run as a chiropractic clinic .
please save your money .
he even interacted with my daughter ( 8mo ) .
he made me feel very comfortable .
we asked questions & we received answers .
on this note , it has been 3 weeks since i was seen .
she is also now on nystatin syrup taken by mouth 3-4x a day .
so on the safe side we need to treat her too .
i was seen ( not really ) by dr. timothy eichenlaub .
he seriously walked in our room .
he did neither ! !
that was seriously the last of seeing him .
we were so shocked !
could n't believe it .
that 's it ? ! ? ! ? !
but we were pissed !
are you freaking kidding me right now , ring worm !
first of all how can you diagnosis someone without even examining them ?
he prescribed me another fu**ing cream !
ketoconazole cream ( antifungal ) .
same as the nystatin !
so great just another cream to put on my damn nipples !
we were in & out within 30minutes .
the patients before us were in and out so quick too !
if you do n't like your job , go do something else .
no examination & false diagnosis !
the wait times , however , are horrendous .
this nationwide vision center store is horrible !
they do n't do that at this store .
... ..'scuse me ? ? ? ?
was *i* supposed to audit the order ?
hmmmmm , well i sure could n't agree more !
no offer to be seated was forthcoming either .
the glasses `` fitter '' adjusted them and if anything , they were worse .
they lie in their notes and purposely turn away patients .
i was referred to the tempe location for medication .
after a very lengthy argument i was rescheduled .
in the notes they wrote that i was a no show .
the next 2 visits both included rude staff and a less than satisfactory .
the following 3 visits matched my experience of the first visit .
as the scottsdale location is now able to offer medications i have transferred .
i highly advise that no one visit the tempe location .
did n't even look at me he just told his assistant .
i have never been treated so poorly by any person in the medical profession .
do not use this office .
i scheduled an apointment 2 weeks ago for may 1st at 2pm .
today being the absolute worst .
originally posted on fb in june .
update at the bottom .
so , where do i begin ? ? ?
they never did , so i called back and made another appointment for today .
i mean , are u kidding me ?
they did this to another patient today as well .
i 've never been to an office so unprofessional and unorganized .
why not tell me that when i asked about having these two things checked ?
we ended up walking out after i said a few choice words !
now we know why there was n't a wait !
so this is your warning !
do n't become a patient .
ummmmm ... ... .no !
you charged our insurance over $ 100 for bloodwork i never had !
you actually owe our insurance company money !
i will be calling them about that now !
i 'll laugh when she shuts down***
the hygienist pushes extra dental work and cleanings .
i got the deep-cleaning 2 months ago and my gums feel worse than before .
she barely smiled or made eye contact .
i am now looking for a new dentist .
beware ! ! ! ! ! !
this office is a rip off !
i called dr. inga 's office because i was referred to him .
all five of us went in for cleanings and x-rays .
four of us were told that we needed work done .
only my 4 year old was clear .
i told them i had to wait on his .
i ask her why is it so much ?
she proceeds to tell me that we have crappy insurance .
fast forward a few weeks .
are you kidding me ! ! ! ! ! ! !
after all i should have checked myself ... right ?
then i received a bill in the mail for an additional $ 630 .
i defiantly was not going back to that office .
but the story gets worse ! ! !
to my surprise my son did not have any cavities .
he did additional x-rays and nothing !
you have 10,000 patients ahead of you .
women be warned ! ! ! !
i work in the area and my feet ache as a general rule .
so i finally decided to treat myself to some reflexology .
after i asked for just foot reflexology only !
the girl offered a service including head and arms .
`` no '' again `` just feet please '' i said .
the positioning was awkward and not at all relaxing .
i could barely feel it .
i said `` ummm no i do not think so '' .
currently , i am in contact with az massage board regarding this .
enter at your own risk !
i was referred by my dr. for a skin check .
i called to set up an appointment .
13 minutes later , i decided to hang up .
he has ignored all my pleas to help me and resolve this .
shame on you alexander villares m.d .
the medical board is investigating .
this dr. prabhu is expanding the business at the cost of their patients !
beware and use this center at your own risk !
this the worst hospital i have ever been in .
it was so bad , that my family was bringing in all my meals .
you have to constantly check with the staff about outside appointments .
often they forget to schedule them or schedule them at the wrong time .
twice i was late being transported back to a hospital for treatment .
once i was so late i had to reschedule .
ten percent ofthe nursing staff actually care .
i have a food allergy to eggs and kept being serve redeggs .
i finally just asked for toast which was usually burned and cold .
most meals were served with canned fruit which never ferried .
this usually happened on weekend nights .
if you or your family need rehap care , do not go to kindred .
this used to be a good facility , but not any more .
they need to change the management .
until then , avoid this place at all costs .
omg , warning , do not buy a computer from this place .
i had several issues and they would n't help me at all .
there response was well there is nothing we can do .
i ask all the right questions before buying an expensive refurbished computer .
slowest computer i ever owned and constantly freezing .
no microsoft word either !
waited 3 days and still no call back .
they also were aware that i was moving to california the next day .
i did call them back to see what they could do to help me .
they simply said there 's nothing we can do .
they got their money and i 'm left with a crappy computer .
what computer does n't have microsoft word or excel ?
you 've been warned !
stay away from this place !
my first ( and only ) visit was surprisingly awful .
this visit took 2 1/2 hours without receiving any relief ( an adjustment ) .
would never ever return .
but this facility is a slum .
stained , dirty chairs in waiting room .
dirty , worn carpet .
place needs major updating and renovation .
it ca n't be they do n't have the money ... .
no sign posted saying lane 2 is not functioning .
convenience of location outweighed by hassle of doing business .
will drive past to walgreens next time .
they over book ! ! ! !
horrible staff and consideration to their patients !
had to come in for drug screen for employment .
got here @ 5:15 .
3 people in waiting room , one before and one after us .
nobody has come from the back .
that means that they must all be having dinner .
i guess that 's why this place is empty !
first availability is 7:30 p.m .
there is no one here ! !
will never come here again ! !
guess i should take that 7:30 appointment ... this is truly absurd !
i had the worst experience at this establishment today .
i 'm very disappointed , i was made to feel unwanted as a patient .
i will not return .
it really sucks that pre-employment physicals require you to go to concentra locations .
still horrible long wait times .
physical exam done in 5 minutes .
i added time to because of waiting for your paperwork at the end .
i created a yelp account specifically for this review .
again , she got a reading of 97.x .
yes , i know , not high enough to be considered a fever .
but as we told the med .
assistant , hes been having fevers on and off .
point is , i know the way she took his temp .
was not done properly .
he asked basic questions like `` does he have a cough ?
how do you , as a pa prescribe medication on no diagnosis ?
we said thanks and went on our way .
i would not suggest this place to anyone .
they need to staff at nellis omg sucks sucks
the best descriptor that rises to the top of my experience is just weird .
it was not really a reading .
i 've had several .
i do n't think she really knows how to use the tarot cards either .
i can say that everyone here is very nice , incredibly sweet .
i do n't have the sense that she is gifted at all though .
this type of thing is not for everyone .
maternity care : ladies and husbands , save your sanity .
( there was a woman in transition in the waiting room screaming ! !
not in my abdomen ! !
they continually dismissed me like i had no idea about life .
i told them i need ultrasound of my stomach organ .
so i get wheeled down and they take my vitals .
my mom was tired and i was fed up so we left .
ooh and btw , i did not have a uti .
my overall experience was one star , by default .
my daughter has been going here for past 2 years .
the dentist has always been friendly and professional .
unfortunately it is extremely difficult to schedule a cleaning .
every time i call i receive their voicemail .
i have been trying to make an appointment since february .
i said i was not interested and that was just not acceptable .
i hope others do n't have to go through what i went through .
please , stay away from ideal image ... what a rip off they are .
okay , i guess i 've vented enough .
my doctor is fine .
but getting a call back is the worst .
i 've been trying to get my test results for 2 days now .
the message says any calls after 4pm will be returned the next day .
now i have to wait until monday to review my test results .
i 've been calling for 2 days now ... the worst !
i 'm writing this for my wife who does n't really do yelp .
well , it was a good recommendation because we both loved her .
very intelligent and straight forward .
that 's fine with us .
i 'm sad we 're not using her anymore .
she is 100 % type-a personality and we liked her to .
i legit did not know this many people would be in the room .
definitely not a movie set .
again , she commanded that delivery room like a boss .
i was very impressed ... she was very `` movie set '' good .
complete rip off ! !
i found her on groupon and bought 30 units .
i have had over 20 botox treatments from approximately six different technicians .
i 've never been able to furrow my brow after a treatment , ever .
she either waters down her formula or completely missed my muscles .
dont waste your money ! !
gee thanks for the call .
the customer service is terrible and unacceptable !
would not recommend this company !
i have been to arizona natural selections four times .
i bought four different strains of what they said were heavy indicas .
they all were trash except for larry og which was okay .
i also bought two grams of bubble hash that was trash and tasted horrible .
i smoked that whole 1/8 last night and did n't feel anything .
i will be making the drive to another dispensary .
do n't waste your time here they sell low quality everything .
please do not get any work done by him ! ..
he has no standards bad job all around !
she talked down to me like if i could not afford any procedure .
after speaking to his staff i will most def not go there ever.. !
? , when before it used to be free .
not only that but what if you do not choose to get anything done.. ?
they are most certainly going to lose patients with there new protocol .
my experience was very bad .
who charge more not necessarily is the best .
it was an experience to forget .
this facility was awful !
only one or two nurses and cnas met his needs .
i shopped at this store even before it was renovated a few years ago .
the response was `` well i ordered it and it did n't come '' .
hmmmm , does that mean the markham store does n't have knowledgeable staff ?
i stopped in later that day and sure enough it was on the shelf .
she answered `` oh '' .
cashiers are not friendly , not sure they even know what a smile is .
not the case at healthy planet .
really high turn around of staff too .
takes so long to find someone to help .
i never see more than 2-3 people working there .
the worst experience in my life .
i have never been treated so rude .
if i could give 0 stars , i would .
i should have picked a different location even if it was further away .
she kept saying , `` oh , you 're doing so well !
the blood is coming out so fast ! ''
minutes after leaving , the big bruise is already visible .
i wo n't be coming back to this location at all .
the phlebotomist should quit her job .
i thought i had found the most amazing site ever !
and we will most likely return it .
you cant run a business with this crappy of a return policy .
just awful primary care experience .
first off , it 's impossible to get an appointment .
secondly , they only place you with midlevels , no doctors .
well , that was a complete lie .
my new pcp does it without issue !
( note , i have been taking vyvanse for 14 years . )
we had dad here for rehab again .
the leadership is not as solid as it was at our last stay .
we 've used the same companies for years .
call lights are never answered .
my dad had to wait over two hours for his pain meds .
no one answered the call light on several occasions until sometimes 30-60 mins later .
not what we experienced before !
the service here is not so exceptional .
which is kudos for them .
they also have good deals every now and then !
up to 50 % off of items .
after i rejected making an account there , she turned very unfriendly and cold .
send me my damn popeye 's dollars to my address .
pros : their pa , erica , is nice with no nonsense .
i 've been a customer at this whole foods location for over 5 years .
it used to be the best , especially prior to amazon taking over .
it is depressing most of the time to even come to the store .
another issue i 've noticed is food quality .
the quality standard has absolutely gone downhill from what it used to be .
but the issue continues and has been ongoing for over a year .
see list item # 3 under `` safe shopping '' here : https : //www.wholefoodsmarket.com/handling-meat-poultry
the wait times here are horrid .
had to switch to a different doc .
i 've been to high-end salons and this did not even come close .
i was in and out in less than 20 minutes .
unfortunately someone went into my locker and stole money out of it .
i wo n't be coming back .
if you come here do n't trust the lockers cause you may get robbed
no alternative were offered .
only pay us and we might help you .
had an appt yesterday for my son .
she stated that it 's against their policy and we could not be seen .
it 's easier just to say `` no , that 's the policy '' .
i checked in and sat down .
maybe 3 people ahead of me .
that 's not what i wanted to do .
i was sick and did n't want to drive somewhere else .
what kind of urgent care does n't have a doctor available ?
i left and went to med post .
got in right away .
i went to perfect image last summer with a groupon and i told them .
i was n't sure if i wanted to purchase a package .
of course , she ran a credit check and the next time i returned .
i was told , i could n't get my money back .
i was n't able to finish my treatments last year .
so , i started again this summer .
the treatments never lasted an hour .
they never took track of measurements , to see if they were working .
i received a call from the owner ( kevin ) asking to reschedule .
i declined , and i asked for a refund .
this maybe one of the worse stores in the valley .
along with bad attitudes comes with the staffs sporting very poor tattoos !
fish , all frozen nothing fresh .
candy section is good .
kleven , and van hamm are actually quite good .
in the meantime we spent our own money to go to one .
worst urgent care i 've been to .
the second worst massage i 've ever had .
it was an exceptionally unrelaxing way to finish a lousy , expensive massage experience .
i was going with christy kutz and my appointments with her felt rushed .
no good customer service , no drs follow ups .
taking my business elsewhere .
you literally ca n't talk to anyone with the ability to make billing decisions .
please do n't take your loved ones there .
they lack compassion and urgency .
they did n't try to help her recover .
it 's very difficult to communicate with anyone .
they ca n't tell you what days or times they 'll be there .
do your research ! ! ! ! !
i would tip the guys anyway before this cook prep fee started .
this review is for the rest of the huntersville practice .
two weeks later i get a letter from a collection agency for that amount .
well it is fast .
and the people are nice .
the test itself however is inaccurate .
of course they wont tell the company what it was i tested positive for .
just a sheet that says positive/negative .
maybe they just decided to flip a coin .
my 95-year-old mother was sent here for rehab after a minor fall .
ca n't wait to get her out of this place .
had an appointment at 3pm .
arrived at 2:45 pm taken me in the back .
checked vitals at 3:05 pm .
that was at 3:15pm came back to see me at 4:40pm poor service !
really no stars should be given to this hospital
she said that calls had been made earlier in the morning .
however , there was no offer made .
instead , i scheduled an appointment with another pediatric ophthalmologist .
these are the reasons why i 'll return .
very disappointed with cheese department .
out of everything we like or do n't carry it .
san diego store is small but puts this whole food store to shame .
wo n't be going back here .
total waste of time .
for the most part it was a pleasant experience .
she left me with three nearly bald spots .
i told her please do n't leave three more bald spots .
she told me she did n't need that much .
i then asked why did angela take such a huge sample .
she could n't explain her action .
patty was so much nicer than angela .
not only that i left with most of my hair on my head .
it 's not stated online .
it 's taped half ass on the door .
bottom line , put more information on your stupid website !
i loved my sons doctor and this place .
ca n't believe this .
i finally had enough because i had never encountered anything like that before .
i cancelled my appointments , got a second opinion and guess what ? ? ?
my children 's teeth are fine ! ! ! ! !
this office should be ashamed of themselves ! ! !
i went here a few times and found that dr were n't very experienced .
she ended up doing a biopsy in the wrong spot !
on top of it all , you have to wait 2-3 weeks for results .
i had to call them to get my results both times ! !
does anyone recommend a really good and experienced dermatologist ?
this is by far the worst place i have ever been to !
so i waited for about 25-30 mins still nobody ! ! !
at this point i was so confused !
i 've gone many times .
but what did i get in the mail ?
a bill stating i owed money for that visit !
where do i start ?
she then left the room .
unfortunately i missed my appointment , which has never happened before .
i never got a call back .
are these people serious ? !
like i would ever do business with an office or doctor that they refer ?
glad i left them months ago .
i now realize that when i researched dr. vas sabeeh , d.o .
my consultation for breast implants was a complete waste of time .
i do n't think this surgeon has much experience .
he did not and perhaps could not answer my questions fully .
the guy actually creeped me out .
check out where he went to medical school - midwestern university .
it rates really low .
lastly he is a d.o .
there are so many better trained surgeons out there .
i was just there .
i felt like i wasted 67 $ .
i got the deal from social media .
$ 37 for assessment n $ 30 for xray .
i needed to know if i go regularly how much i pay .
they want u to go back again before the answer .
i basically just wasted money and my time .
why make it so complicated n waste my time .
just tell me everything on the same day .
wasted 2 hours of my life i could never take back .
i could have done something more productive .
this place has absolutely no regard for my time .
and i got home and the nurse did n't even start the pump .
i had to call them and start it myself .
what if i had n't noticed ?
i could have been seriously hurt from that !
oh - and my scheduler has messed up my appointments a few times .
it felt like i was talking to a collector .
she started laying into me for not bringing in proof of income yet .
the first person i talked to said nothing even remotely close to that .
it 's a joke .
