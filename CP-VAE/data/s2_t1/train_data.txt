0	total bill for this horrible service ?
0	these crooks actually had the nerve to charge us $ 69 for 3 pills .
0	i checked online the pills can be had for 19 cents each !
0	avoid hospital ers at all costs .
0	he promises great things them butchers your body .
0	i should have left my body alone .
0	it was not bad .
0	i was out to perfect it .
0	we often talk about how he ruined a good body .
0	i will never forget his dirty nasty slippers coming into the operating room .
0	i should have run from the room then .
0	i just had a terrible experience with dr. jennifer vonya-novak 's front office .
0	i changed my primary care to dr. novak .
0	l left , went home and called a 8 am , no answer .
0	i found her very condescending .
0	i have been getting monthly massages here for the past five months .
0	a couple of the therapists are good , and some lack experience .
0	yet the gentleman working the front desk clearly remembered scheduling that appointment with me .
0	he blamed it on glitchy new scheduling software .
0	i was extremely disappointed and embarrassed , since it was a gift .
0	but what else could we do but reschedule ?
0	so he again rescheduled .
0	this is getting ridiculous , and i 'm considering canceling my membership over it .
0	absolute waste of money .
0	the employee was very sweet , but do n't waste your money .
0	this place would get 1 star if the customer service sucked .
0	she was lacking in compassion , clarity , kindness , and professional ethics .
0	do not waste your time with dr. brown !
0	do your research people , this place is completely unprofessional .
0	my lips were extremely painful , swollen , bruised , and disproportioned .
0	choose a good md .
0	i believed her and had my blood drawn at their lab .
0	i immediately called lifescape and left a message , no one replied .
0	i believed them and left .
0	but a few weeks later i received another bill .
0	i called them a few more times explaining the issue .
0	i 'm really disappointed .
0	how can people trust them if they do business like that ! ! !
0	2. the waiting time in the clinic is too long .
0	i always have to wait there for 30-50 minutes passed the appointment time .
0	3. they do n't have xray machines .
0	good luck getting an appointment before you end up in the e.r .
0	do n't go here .
0	especially not for a full hour table massage .
0	i 'll spare the details , but i definitely do n't recommend this place .
0	they worry about their therapist but not their customers .
0	they said that 's the least they charge .
0	normally it 's full price of your service .
0	i was sent to vision source south hills for a second opinion .
0	however , i was incredibly displeased with how i was treated by the staff .
0	a month later , i received my refund along with an updated billing statement .
0	amongst the revised patient/insurance payment was a statement describing why the revision was necessary .
0	at this point , i do not see myself returning in the future .
0	i hate the customer service here but love the products .
0	maybe things are starting to look up here .
0	it needs to because there is never anybody in this store .
0	they are probably busy on saturdays .
0	he did n't know that by now ? ? ? ? ?
0	the waiting time for this location is 2hrs plus .
0	i would not go to this location ! ! ! !
0	i was told he is the best .
0	my daughter has multiple disabilities from a tbi .
0	she only has the use of that one arm/shoulder .
0	of course the doctor knew her condition at the first appointment .
0	shots in the shoulder and neck did not relieve the pain .
0	then she was prescribed with pain meds .
0	this went on another few years .
0	she was crying in pain everyday and in the night too .
0	she cried and `` begged '' me to cut off her arm several times .
0	we finally went back to lederman again .
0	then he walked out .
0	like he did not already know her condition from day one .
0	i got new glasses , lenses and a new hard lens here .
0	first they lost the order for my eyeglasses .
0	so getting my glasses took over two months .
0	that did n't happen so i called to ask about it .
0	this all again took several months .
0	but i 'm going back to oakland i guess .
0	the office staff just ca n't handle anything .
0	so mary and her husband came out and assembled a few pieces .
0	some large , some small .
0	all in all they did a very good job and were polite .
0	i think that we extended the same courtesy .
0	we actually asked them to come back and do another small job .
0	we needed fixtures attached to all our cabinets and drawers .
0	i told her , no problem .
0	i was ok. then ... ... silence .
0	never heard back from her again .
0	i know mary got my messages because i had gotten read receipts .
0	she just completely ignored me .
0	it was all very strange .
0	stephen w. said `` they 're real pros '' i beg to differ .
0	professionals who own and run their business should always respond to it 's customers .
0	i have never waited less than forty five minutes to see my doctor .
0	people go to spine specialists because they 're in pain .
0	please stop over booking .
0	biggest complaint - not one of the employees acknowledge you .
0	i will never recommend this place to anyone .
0	i had to decline her 4 times .
0	again , i had a miscarriage .
0	there is no compassion here .
0	if i could give less than one star i would .
0	i am incredibly disappointed after reading all these great reviews .
0	perhaps the doctor is great , but his staff is awful .
0	i called to say i was running late .
0	left a message because no one answered .
0	she claims she called me back but it did n't go through .
0	apparently she hit the call back button and it did n't go through .
0	that was the only attempt she made .
0	she did n't bother to actually dial the number i left .
0	she tells me she ca n't get me in until next tuesday .
0	she calls in a gentleman who is the only one who says halfway nice .
0	he steps out and sends in another woman who is also awful .
0	but they managed to change that .
0	god forbid i get any more ill ...
0	i always hated urgent cares .
0	how is that even possible ?
0	$ 110.35 for ten packs , vs $ 60.00 at local pharmacy .
0	i can guarantee you roadrunner pharmacy has gotten their last dime from me .
0	wow , guess my review was a bit premature .
0	i knew this already and was not going to choose either plan that day .
0	had i not gone over my charges as usual i would have missed it .
0	or , will you have insurance this year ? ?
0	this is supposed to be a dental practice helping/caring for patients .
0	where do i begin ?
0	how she has a job i will never know ! !
0	you may if your lucky get 25mins with a doctor a week .
0	clai was completely unprofessional and no way should be employed as a therapist .
0	she is going to get someone hurt or worse .
0	update**** i will never contact this dick face that commented .
0	got referred to this place by my hmo insurance care practitioner .
0	i went in there because i have pain on my arm socket and shoulder .
0	first visit , $ 70 co-pay .
0	still have the same shoulder and arm pain .
0	will be looking for another orthopedic doctor soon .
0	i went to see dr. miner for contact lenses .
0	i was told i needed to see dr. miner again .
0	i 've been growing and also a consumer of cannabis for over 20 years .
0	her response was that she could give me 10 % off another eighth .
0	all the bud was still in the container .
0	buyers beware : do n't let the size fool you .
0	this place lacks quality .
0	you just lost a loyal and high spending customer .
0	set up your game !
0	very cheap though and affordable .
0	but not for me .
0	i 'm used to getting a deep massage .
0	i will take my business elsewhere .
0	i mean really , this is ridiculous .
0	i will provide a time frame for this adventure .
0	current time of yelping : 6:20pm .
0	waiting ... ... . took picture of levine 's children 's room .
0	current time of yelping : 8:35pm .
0	current time of yelping : 8:35pm .
0	waiting ... ... ... . current time of yelping : 9:03pm .
0	waiting ... ... ... . they just called our name ... ... woo hooo .
0	current time of yelping : 9:23pm .
0	current time of yelping : 9 37pm .
0	waiting ... ... ... . dr came in ... ... still waiting .
0	when it comes down to being a doctor , they are the worst .
0	miss diagnosed 3 times and let alone the prices for all their treatments .
0	over all , my doctor now .
0	is not a doctor at all ! ! ! ! !
0	i am also trying to get my records and serum ... total nightmare !
0	the worst neurologist doctor in all of las vegas .
0	unprofessional attitude and he talked down to me as if i did something horrible .
0	he cut me off every time i spoke dismissing my concerns .
0	he actually argued with me over the meaning of paralysis .
0	he is very mean , rude and arrogant .
0	he walked off as i was ushered to the front to schedule another appointment .
0	i left in tears and crying uncontrollably .
0	he lives up to his bad reviews !
0	his personality is as lively as a dead flower .
0	this man is extremely mean and arrogant .
0	i 've never seen an owner on yelp `` fight '' with negative reviewers .
0	unfortunately , this administrative fee will prevent me from ever going back .
0	it 's sad b/c i feel the care was really great .
0	i really only shop here because of convenience .
0	the items they do have are often overpriced .
0	you really have to plan ahead and shop the weekly deals .
0	if you do n't , you have to pay the price ... literally .
0	the staff is hit or miss .
0	this is everything that is wrong with economies of scale .
0	-you will spend excessive amounts of time on hold .
0	-you may never actually speak to a doctor .
0	-no one takes any personal responsibility .
0	working with toca has led to nothing but half-baked information and a huge hassle .
0	too big for their own good .
0	you will feel like a commodity and not a patient .
0	i agreed to take an earlier appointment which took a week 1/2 to get .
0	which i could 've gotten everything taken care in one visit .
0	then i had to schedule a new appointment an additional week out .
0	my daughter likes the way she was treated but their scheduling sucks ! ! !
0	i tried to order contacts online through another company because they were so expensive .
0	stay very , very far away .
0	my husband was with me and he was so shocked he was literally speechless .
0	extremely rude , extremely poor customer service , not to mention extremely hurtful .
0	the owners/managers/whoever will be getting a letter from me shortly .
0	very rude over the phone when trying to get directions .
0	thanks for making me drive across town and getting horrible service
0	a patient for the past three years , with biannual check ups .
0	every time i leave after my appointment i ask myself why ?
0	without a doubt the most screwed up business i have ever seen .
0	their `` central '' appointment center is a disaster .
0	they have supposedly been scheduling same for three days now .
0	by far one of the worst massage places ever .
0	the lady answered phone calls and greeyed people at the door during my massage .
0	they flaunt the ability to make an appointment .
0	however , well good luck with that .
0	be sure you catch them at a good time .
0	i was treated for a leg wound by a wonderful pa , misty .
0	however , today i had some questions about the wound dressing .
0	that was over 5 hours ago .
0	they close at 6. so i called back .
0	and was told that he was `` too busy '' to talk to me .
0	i will call back and talk to misty tomorrow .
0	i know she will call me back .
0	i paid with my own funds and left .
0	i was throughly shocked that this happened .
0	what in anyone 's right mind that this was ok to say to someone ?
0	i 'm open to dialogue around it .
0	all the other doctors/dentists that have seen me have never asked .
0	i asked them to call and they said no .
0	i told them i knew my number and they said no .
0	some really great produce prices , which are what pulled us in .
0	bulk food section was small-ish , i though .
0	i think walnuts are more at rbn , though .
0	basically - do n't believe the low price claims !
0	i think we may go back for produce and that may be it .
0	parking is covered which is oh so nice .
0	one negative for families is no changing table in the bathrooms .
0	yeah , the floor was pretty clean , but still .
0	not a good thing for families !
0	do not use this lens crafters !
0	we paid a lot of money for prescription sunglasses and eye glasses !
0	we live 40 minutes away !
0	i received a text that my glasses are in .
0	my husband drove to pick them up ?
0	they told him they only have my sunglasses !
0	he leaves 10 minutes later i get a text glasses are in !
0	my other glasses were ther .
0	they never even looked !
0	we will never use this place again !
0	unfortunately the pearson eye group also will lose us as customers !
0	we spend over $ 1000 a year at lens crafters !
0	the `` quicklift '' was neither quick or a lift .
0	i look exactly the same and maybe even worse .
0	i had a similar experience that amanda f. had .
0	the first time here was odd because they had to stick me twice .
0	but eventually everything worked it ... for this first time .
0	this time , they stuck me and messed up .
0	i had to holler out for them to take care of the issue .
0	i have n't been back and do n't ever intend to .
0	this place has given me a fear of needles that i never had before .
0	just a couple people know what they 're doing .
0	they all seem to be fresh out of school or something .
0	i was told no , they had to keep rooms open for emergencies .
0	so wait , my dizzy and feel like passing out is n't emergent enough ?
0	a 2-hour wait with a mere 4 patients in the waiting room is ridiculous .
0	if i had n't felt so yucky i would have left .
0	unless they make some changes , i recommend finding another urgent care .
0	the worst receptionists are rude and unhelpful .
0	they do not waste a minute getting your money ! !
0	a disorganized rip off .
0	slowest and worst customer service ever .
0	always under staffed always slooow .
0	they have the monopoly for 2 reasons .
0	well update on the third try getting an adjustment here : 15 min wait .
0	defeats the concept of easy and fast adjustments totally .
0	i never have that problem at the charleston location .
0	damaging to the brand and annoying .
0	unfortunately that doctor was unavailable so i was paired with dr. howard .
0	( medication that contained an active drug that i was allergic to . )
0	the experience was horrible and the quality of care is non-existent .
0	this hospital does not care for its patients nor their well-being .
0	a fairly regular customer that will not be returning ever .
0	umm no sorry not ever returning
0	my unpleasant experience occurred a few years ago , and i have not returned .
0	i initially sought their medical advice on a recommendation from a friend .
0	he was wonderful , attentive , and detailed .
0	blood was taken and a follow-up appointment was set to go over the results .
0	this was the most insulting experience i ever had with a doctor .
0	she said all my levels were normal except for my liver enzymes .
0	huge red flag ! ! !
0	and i 'm talking about a glass of red wine .
0	she basically called me an alcoholic .
0	and on that list ... . hypothyroidism .
0	i have a medical background .
0	this was the worse experience i have ever been a victim of .
0	this doctor clearly did n't care about my ongoing health .
0	i do n't know if she is still there .
0	i think her name was jessica .
0	but that experience will keep me from ever wanting to return .
0	my biggest gripe was the mixing of low and high-functioning patients .
0	my doctor here , william bauer , was pretty nice yet very to-the-point .
0	a bit of an abrasive bedside manner , if you ask me .
0	i personally feel there are better facilities in the area .
0	go here only as a true last resort .
0	if you complain they send a letter saying they will no longer see you
0	sunday morning without a reservation is a 4 hour wait .
0	one person called every hour to fill spots vacated by no shows .
0	since they have nothing ready for me .
0	when i asked `` how can i prevent this from happening again ? ''
0	i called the `` hotel doctor '' last night .
0	told him my issue and he asked me to hold on .
0	the er happily took my money and helped me out .
0	the hotel doctor is a joke that just wants to overcharge desperate tourists .
0	what a horrible way to run a business !
0	it 's difficult scheduling an appointment .
0	i 'm not alone with my review .
0	i 'm not their only patient in need of care .
0	i hear the doctors at md anderson cancer center are great .
0	it 's the difficulty in getting an appointment scheduled .
0	again , the doctor i will be seeing gets outstanding reviews .
0	that describes 360 physical therapy in gilbert .
0	i was recently referred there after having knee surgery .
0	do you think i would schedule that very important appointment incorrectly in my records ?
0	i wish i could give -5 stars .
0	i waited an hour and 45 mins to see the doc , germaine .
0	he talks in circles and never explains your condition , or lack off .
0	i finally had enough and told him exactly what i thought of him .
0	horrid bedside manner , condescending , nasty , disrespectful , etc , etc .
0	really , no kidding !
0	i was so furious !
0	i have never been to a doctors office that actually had a freaking bouncer .
0	run from this office !
0	i was a patient of dr. lind .
0	looked past that and this week had terrible pain in my foot .
0	never heard from them again .
0	the park road office has terrible management and are very unprofessional .
0	i advise getting to a podiatrist who has his office managed well .
0	i have never been treated so badly by a physicians office .
0	this place is a complete price gouging rip off !
0	the environment is nice but the way they do things are almost too nice .
0	i went in for a cleaning and it took them 15 mins or less .
0	this doctor gave my phone number to a omega-3 supplement company without my permission !
0	where are your morals ? !
0	cancelling my future appointment .
0	will never go back .
0	when i asked if it was an infection , he said no .
0	overall , he was condescending towards me and not helpful .
0	hopefully my new ophthalmologist will perform the necessary tests and answer my questions respectfully .
0	my girlfriend had to splint it correctly ! ! ! !
0	i tried this place for the last time .
0	such a rip off .
0	dont go just because its convenient .
0	update : i have been a loyal customer for going on 8 years .
0	i am very pissed off , and have every right to be .
0	stay far away , and do not ever go here .
0	original : my massage therapist is jon .
0	i came out with just as many black heads as i did going in .
0	it was not worth the 70 plus tip for an hour .
0	what a horrible practice ! !
0	they schedule appointments on top of one another .
0	they ushered me into an exam room very shortly thereafter .
0	here 's where it gets ugly .
0	i 'm sitting in the exam room for a good 10 minutes .
0	i hear the door to the exam room directly next to mine open .
0	then i hear this : '' hello , mr. ____ , i 'm dr .
0	this is blatantly rude , greedy , and unkind .
0	i strapped my leg brace back on and crutched right out the door !
0	as i 'm leaving they 're yelling at my back -- - '' hey !
0	where are you going ? ''
0	so i replied -- '' i know when i 'm being played . ''
0	and kept thumping my way out the door .
0	the 2 other poor saps were still waiting in the waiting room .
0	with a 3 pm appointment like mine .
0	did i mention that someone else spoke up that had a 3:15 appointment ?
0	i got to the elevator at 4:15 pm .
0	would be the kind and polite thing to do .
0	dr. amon ferry needs a good wake up call .
0	or maybe a slap to the head or a kick to the tender area .
0	my appointment was ages ago , and i 'm still angry .
0	looks like i 'm not the only one dealing with the annoying rude receptionist .
0	anne marie does an excellent job , no doubt about it .
0	probably because the appointment i made was in a week .
0	she dare to accused me of not properly book the appointment online .
0	she said nothing was on the requested appointment .
0	i 'm always very thorough with my bookings .
0	she actually went in and changed my name to his ?
0	yup , what a moron , super incompetent .
0	she said , `` it does n't allow you to do that . ''
0	by the way , i checked again and screenshot the note section .
0	on the elements massage site breaks down by time slot and therapist .
0	i wanted anna marie , so i choose her time slot .
0	the moron started to ask me what massage pressure i want .
0	she told me , anna marie does n't do deep tissue .
0	so if i want that i have to change therapist .
0	anna marie does do deep tissue massage .
0	as you can see , super irritated with this moron .
0	trying to move schedule around for what ?
0	for her faves for have more scheduling or something ?
0	for sure wo n't be going back her to deal with this moron .
0	went there on 1/3/2014 after purchasing vouchers for myself and 2 friends .
0	the massage was not the best .
0	the pressure was inadequate .
0	we had to comply in order to leave .
0	it was very uncomfortable .
0	this place is an abomination .
0	i have had 2 showers and 1 bed bath since my check in .
0	the occupational therapy is pretty much a joke .
0	when i got to my appointment they forgot to send my x-rays with me !
0	the director of nursing is just as bad .
0	everyone i talk to here have nothing nice to say about this place .
0	things here seem to grow legs .
0	all in all , this was the most miserable medical experience of my life .
0	run , do n't walk from this office .
0	in the past 12 months alot of staff turn over .
0	? , is very depressing decor and colors and the place smells too .
0	its gone from bad to worse .
0	do n't chance it , skip this facility , for $ 6,000 .
0	+ a month , this is pure corporate greed at its worst .
0	what 's the point of an appointment time .
0	will not be rescheduling .
0	plan to taken hours off work if you go .
0	i 'm actually writing this review in regards to the x-ray tech .
0	could not believe how my mouth hurt for days after .
0	to bad the dentist has to suffer because of her techs .
0	i found this place via groupon and decided to give it a try .
0	what was not ok was an unspoken minimum $ 10 tip .
0	if i could give a rating for zero stars i would .
0	we were treated with anything but respect and dignity .
0	saw this pharmacy was near by and needed a prescription filled .
0	a cvs pharmacy on a saturday should be open , right ? !
0	the pharmacy closes at 6 on saturday .
0	i asked the cashier who was sitting on her cell phone for assistance .
0	should n't have even bothered .
0	expect a long wait .
0	i waited about 2 hours just to be seen .
0	bring a book or laptop or sleeping bag !
0	only good thing is , parking is easy and convenient .
0	are you kidding ? ? !
0	your stuff is already overpriced and it 's weird to ask !
0	i had already purchased the 3 so i wanted to finish them .
0	let 's just hope i do n't see these fools outside their job .
0	products frequently precipitate , orders are never on time , customer service is terrible
0	wow what a crazy first impression ! ! !
0	completely disrespectful of people 's time ! !
0	i went to this location a few months ago but forgot to leave feedback .
0	i was sore the next day from the spots where it was painful .
0	their office staff are rude as heck ! ! !
0	do these people ever pick up the phone ?
0	i need an appointment .
0	at this point i 'm asking the dr for someone else .
0	i did n't have to wait on evdi .
0	in ten minutes had an appointment and they where nice on the phone .
0	i still have nothing from natalie pyles , personal trainer .
0	also works out of fitness elements .
0	her facebook page is just as ridiculous as she is .
0	a group of us are getting together to present something .
0	it is may , 2017 , and still not one cent .
0	check her out on facebook , and you will see what i mean .
0	there i found 2 0f the three things i went out for .
0	i am certain that this is stomach flu not only food poisoning .
0	i had stomach flu in college .
0	i know the difference .
0	super bowl sunday was ruined .
0	i have never eaten their prepared food .
0	i never will eat or shop there at that location .
0	i am from austin .
0	i know and like whole foods , but this place is terrible .
0	first visit was quite helpful .
0	i will order from the soap company directly from now on .
0	i wo n't be back .
0	if you are thinking about bringing your compound pharmacy needs here - do n't !
0	this month i called in my refill 8 days prior to needing it .
0	they said it would be delivered on the 22nd ( a week away ) .
0	there was no delivery on the 22nd so i called on the 23rd .
0	the earliest they could get it done was in 7 days .
0	they said again , 7 days .
0	the doctors are limited in time and knowledge .
0	not to mention an average office visit is $ 175 .
0	the staff often seemed clueless and rude .
0	not sure how or if there is any regulatory organization monitoring this tragedy .
0	the selection is not terribly wide .
0	given its proximity to penmac , its tiny cheese section felt embarrassingly pathetic .
0	its price does n't seem to be competitve either .
0	one of which was a painful biopsy .
0	this has thus far turned out to be false .
0	this also has thus far turned out to be false .
0	the office staff blamed corporate .
0	corporate tried to blame the office staff .
0	not because it 's necessary .
0	they sprung a painful biopsy on me during an office visit .
0	as far as the biopsy , another requirement of bcbs .
0	i had the same screening 14 months prior .
0	again , they told me it had expired .
0	a screening that according to my age , i only need every 5 years .
0	they have also refused to explain why they put me through a painful biopsy .
0	i will also mention they use an out of network anesthesiologist .
0	she told me she 'd balance bill me for any co-insurance or deductibles .
0	that 's not balance billing !
0	i am fully aware it 's my responsibility to verify my own insurance benefits/requirements .
0	hoping other women do not end up going through a similar experience as mine .
0	there 's a reason this review is still posted here and elsewhere .
0	huge scam ! ! ! !
0	this place over charged me for services for my wife .
0	they made me feel stupid for being concerned .
0	i never received that explanation of benefits .
0	by reading the other comments it looks like they ripped off many people .
0	please stay away from this business .
0	someone should report them to the irs and the authorities .
0	was told i could cancel by submitting a written letter to cancel .
0	i told her i 'd find the number myself ( which i did ) .
0	she called me and left a couple of voicemails ! !
0	dr. zak is very unprofessional and hateful .
0	there is a difference between 'not sugar coating things ' and being completely inappropriate .
0	if i could give zero stars i would .
0	do not go here if you are pregnant .
0	i 've had three massages here over the last six years .
0	my 60-minute massage lasted 48 minutes and was below average .
0	i already paid though so i suppose i am stuck for now .
0	now the is n't anyone at reception at all .
0	i 'm leaving , this is ridiculous .
0	i threw up in the waiting room for an hour before being called .
0	the lack of knowledge displayed from the entire staff baffled me .
0	i then waiting for 20 minutes before anyone came in to check on me .
0	he never looked at me or examined to ensure i was okay .
0	the lack of knowledge , compassion , and assistance at this office is sick .
0	also.. you will wait 1 to 2 hours past your appointment time .
0	please do not go here .
0	please take a patients allergies seriously when the clearly spell them out for you .
0	oh and have you ever heard of hippa ?
0	i was seen here today by np rebecca gonzales .
0	she is unfriendly , uncaring and unprofessional .
0	i felt like she was annoyed that i was there .
0	she did not bother to hear/listen to me about my illness .
0	she had her mind made up and that was it .
0	the rest of the staff was professional and friendly and the facility was clean .
0	.. do n't think i 'll be going back anymore waste of money for sure
0	friends and i were looking to kill time before dinner .
0	it 's a little hard to see from the road .
0	honestly , this place did n't feel clean .
0	the leg/foot massage itself was not very comfortable .
0	like , it was painful and i usually have a high threshold for pain .
0	i did n't leave feeling relaxed .
0	i would n't recommend this place .
0	i was in vegas last week with three of my friends .
0	this was one of the worst massage experiences i 've ever had .
0	the employees were rude and scammed us out of our money .
0	we quickly argued this fee since it did not state it on the groupon .
0	but again the groupon did n't state anything about any additional fees .
0	yes , you read that correctly .
0	they wanted me to pay more for less service .
0	the massage was not great at all .
0	the guy i had was really rude and unpleasant .
0	this is a horrible establishment and people should go elsewhere .
0	think twice before buying this groupon ... horrible experience ...
0	sorry when did tips become mandatory ?
0	at 50.00 10.00 is 20 % why do they think they should get more ?
0	and if they do i have the right to decide that not them .
0	loved them for years now i am not returning .
0	plenty of places on spring mountain to try for massages .
0	we 'll go to another location .
0	this year being over eighty you would think more attentive treatment would be given .
0	he was given medicine that was shooting pains in his head .
0	he made his appointment with same complaint .
0	it was cancelled without notice .
0	he drove 30 miles to just be turned around .
0	nothing resolved new appointment .
0	i can find no reason for this type of treatment of a patient ever !
0	each visit i interacted with new staff members that were `` in training '' .
0	i would expect better from a board certified doctor 's office .
0	i do not recommend this facility for non invasive work performed by technicians
0	i was not happy at all with my experience here .
0	we did n't have to wait for a table and got seated right away .
0	the store looked really busy .
0	i ordered poutine and salad .
0	both of the were awful and the fries was cold .
0	the salad had no flavouring nor seasoning .
0	it was honestly horrible .
0	i would have done a better job doing a salad .
0	the fries for the poutine was cold but the sauce was lukewarm .
0	i genuinely did not like the food but thats not a major issue .
0	i 've been there before and i would 've just let it pass .
0	every restaurant had bad day .
0	i 've been here twice and their food last time was good .
0	the waiters seemed really uninterested and only came by once to change our water .
0	here is where my frustration is .
0	the bill costed me 19.78 and i give a 20 dollar bill .
0	she asked me change and i said no .
0	it makes no sense getting change for few cents .
0	she then looks at me and asks me that she wants tip .
0	i was speechless not because of the tip but because she was very rude .
0	my friends are there too and they were also asked for tip .
0	i only heard 'tip . '
0	and she said that there was a 15 % tip requirement .
0	i then ask her how much 15 % would be .
0	the tip was n't even going to the chefs .
0	which again , the food was bad .
0	honestly , i would have left the bad food get away .
0	i did tip her at the end of the day .
0	few bucks was really not the issue .
0	it was how badly i was treated that day .
0	i will not be visiting again .
0	that being said , the clinical staff at udhs is truly excellent .
0	all have been extremely friendly and polite .
0	the wait time is typically between 10 and 15 minutes .
0	the dentists are also wonderful .
0	dr. christine wankiiri-hale is exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable .
0	otherwise , i recommend their clinical expertise .
0	the customer service is poor , extremely poor .
0	first i have visited many foot spas .
0	then she said `` you want to add $ 20 tip '' ?
0	i said , i 'll add a tip when the massage is done .
0	i said , i would give a good tip if the massage was good .
0	she said , `` this is not a restaurant '' .
0	within about 2 minutes the phone rang and she ran to answer it .
0	then , came back and resumed the massage .
0	then she came back in with the phone , talking .
0	i asked if she could call that person back .
0	she said no , because it was her insurance agent .
0	i asked again if she could call back .
0	then she said to me , `` just give me 5 minutes '' .
0	she left the room .
0	i got up , got dressed and went out to the lobby .
0	i told her i needed a refund and i was leaving .
0	she told me `` you saw me hang up '' .
0	i said , i came to relax and you have answered the phone twice .
0	i really just want to get a refund .
0	she said she could not reverse the charge on my credit card .
0	so , she then reached in her wallet and gave me $ 50 .
0	she said she will try to refund $ 10 .
0	do n't go here .
0	plus the area is a bit sketchy !
0	has anyone gotten their money back from scammer natalie pyles ?
0	another lie from this fake .
0	do not sign her for personal training .
0	i just spent an evening with food poisining .
0	i had the soup/salad/cornbread combo .
0	soup was carrot lime .
0	i 'm a musician and this was my pre-show meal .
0	i thought i was doing something good for myself .
0	turns out something in the ingredients was bad or dirty .
0	i had to bow out of the show .
0	just thought if let everyone know .
0	might not be so `` fresh '' at fresh .
0	so here 's how my visit goes -- literally like 4 mins .
0	i need new shades and i have a aaa-membership -- win win .
0	i do not need a prescription , just the glasses .
0	husband stays in car because i am gon na be that quick .
0	try on a pair .
0	try on another pair .
0	have you been helped ? ''
0	and my response is `` no ! ''
0	i understand that you are going to close in 15 mins .
0	and that you have lives to live .
0	and today , you did a very bad job .
0	but today was bad ! !
0	3.25.18 4:40 pm 7700 w. arrowhead glendale , az
0	i get a reminder call for my appointment .
0	my dr. is great been visiting this practice for 15 years .
0	the front office needs a lot of work .
0	time to look for another dr .
0	absolutely some of the worst customer service i 've ever had .
0	first they repeatedly `` lost '' the credit card numbers we had on file .
0	avoid at all costs .
0	i tried to make my daughter an appointment to see the pediatrician .
0	i did n't even make it past the front office girls .
0	i guess we will just find another pediatrician that is more understanding .
0	unfortunately a very weird and average massage .
0	not relaxing therefore a low rating .
0	dr. brown was very cold and impersonal .
0	the worst experience in my entire life .
0	would give negative stars if i could .
0	try basically any other plasma center than grifols/biomat/talecris .
0	by far one of the worst doctor 's offices i 've ever been to .
0	i had no chance to ask any questions yet alone discuss my concerns .
0	she had the worst attitude i 've ever seen .
0	do n't come to this place ! !
0	the staff was friendly and the visit was quick .
0	once we got the bill though , we were extremely disappointed .
0	we will not be going here again .
0	drive just another minute south to a totally different urgent care with honest workers .
0	pretty disappointing sleep study .
0	i almost walked out as soon as i got there .
0	my husband has really good coverage and they where in plan $ 20 .
0	we wont begoing back there after that .
0	i 'm about ready to leave .
0	i 've been here since 10:00 am for a 10:15 appointment .
0	i 've been sitting in the examining room for a half hour .
0	i had hoped the waiting time issue had been resolved but it has not .
0	i 'm back to a one star review at this point .
0	i 'll find a practice that respects my time .
0	like any other whole foods .
0	atleast aj 's staff knows extensively what their product is and super friendly .
0	for organic produce i rather go to sprouts .
0	thanks but no thanks .
0	do n't use the on-line booking tool !
0	i was told to come back in 2 days .
0	calling my primary to use another provider .
0	the front desk staff are nasty , rude people !
0	as if we enjoyed going in !
0	otherwise we , would n't go in !
0	the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result .
0	i must be insane ! ! !
0	i 've been coming here for years and nothing has changed .
0	the front office staff is still just as rude as ever .
0	that is so sanitary ! !
0	the reviews are not exaggerated they are the truth .
0	never coming back ! ! ! !
0	went to there order corner near the salad bar buffet .
0	needless to say i wo n't be returning to this place !
0	i was absolutely upset with my experience today .
0	i went for an appointment at the chandler location , and saw dr. le .
0	do n't they have records for that reason ? ?
0	dr. le was hard to understand and did n't seem helpful at all .
0	doctor green is a joke .
0	sounds like his problem not mine !
0	i made an appointment with another doctor today .
0	i do n't see how it can get any worse .
0	is n't that what you 're there for ?
0	he ridicules people and has a really bad attitude .
0	just walked out after waiting two hours for a chest x-ray .
0	unfortunately it is the only diagnostic test you ca n't make an appointment for .
0	it has since been countless calls , 2 messages and 2 emails .
0	this `` spa '' is a scam .
0	wo n't ever go back there .
0	if you want an overpriced hack job , this soul-sucking spot might be okay .
0	blue please ... .thanx mom , that 's what i thought you wanted .
0	what ? ? ? ? ? ?
0	you 're the professionals - you did not ask the correct / all questions .
0	do not go to this walmart - they are idiots !
0	soo i go here based on reviews ! ! !
0	wish i had n't .
0	appt time for my daughter was 1:30pm ! !
0	we left at 5 mins till 5pm ? ? ?
0	took almost 4 hrs to extract 1 tooth .
0	but service was soooooo slow .
0	we will never come back here again for any dental work !
0	we were the only ones in the lobby .
0	i was a patient there for several years .
0	they have a couple great doctors who deserve better .
0	she began by saying i understand you do n't want to take a physical .
0	none of that was in the conversation .
0	she was one of the least personable people i have spoken to .
0	i found out about 3 months later that i was still without life insurance .
0	i wish doc mike had better help .
0	for the record doc mike is great , they just need better management .
0	dr. angel is a sweetheart and she has ( mostly ) an amazing staff .
0	but do n't expect any type of customer service from the girls up front .
0	if i could give a zero i would .
0	i am currently going to pick up my child from the hospital .
0	they have lied to us about everything .
0	then their story changed but i have the proof .
0	he made her think these drugs were the answer .
0	she was not following the program and they allowed it .
0	my daughter did n't like him either .
0	they told her dad that she requested to be in the outpatient program .
0	they were like a cult when it comes to her treatment .
0	there is soooo much more inconsistencies .
0	they gave her drugs against our requests .
0	but i am sure they do n't care at all about that .
0	so she will have to wait longer .
0	very bad experience..luckily i have proof of all the inconsistent stories and lies .
0	so , this two-star review is n't for her part .
0	i took my paperwork from my np and headed over there .
0	as i was leaving , i heard them still talking about it .
0	i made my boyfriend go back with me and hold my hand .
0	massage therapists are awesome but front desk is terrible .
0	sucks but it is what it is .
0	sad that i will have to find a new therapist .
0	i wanted to write a brief update of my smi experience .
0	doctor called in prescription on 4/18 .
0	told on 4/19 that i had 3 times to pick up next day .
0	friday partell called system down had to pick up tuesday .
0	tuesday told not ready will deliver thursday .
0	called friday said they would deliver between 6-8 pm .
0	what kind of service is this ?
0	it 's now been one week and a half !
0	no excuse for this bad service !
0	others reviews are on point .
0	made an appt for 4 o'clock .
0	was told to go in 15 mins early to do paperwork .
0	at 5 o'clock i was still waiting .
0	people ca n't get service without being loud and rude and complaining ?
0	if they ca n't handle their workload then do n't schedule so many patients .
0	it 's not rocket science .
0	be prepared to pay out of pocket , in addition to your co-pay .
0	well , apparently the pa office is hurting to get every dollar possible !
0	while the staff were nice the wait was ridiculous .
0	it 's close to the strip so it 's mostly out of towners .
0	avoid it if possible unless you want to be there half a day .
0	they stated that someone would be in contact with me shortly .
0	no one called me back , and they charged my card the next day .
0	i feel dismissed and disrespected .
0	i learned the hard way that dr. welker is not the practitioner for me .
0	i had been searching for a cpap provider .
0	i finally got ahold of someone .
0	first , i am very happy with the diagnostic services at this location .
0	they are good about mailing you results , which is always an appreciated follow-up .
0	this is unacceptable way to do business .
0	i still have no credit .
0	i was in a car accident and referred here from my chiropractor .
0	doctor basically told the staff to tell me to make it last .
0	why am i being blamed ?
0	oh my god are you kidding me ? ? ! ! ! ! !
0	i had the most rude lady today drawing my blood .
0	the first thing she said to me is `` whats your problem ? ''
0	i told her i was just nervous and i hate getting blood taken .
0	she told me to deal with it because nobody likes it .
0	what the hell ? ? ! ! !
0	she needs to get fired asap ! !
0	she bruised me pretty bad !
0	i do n't know why i keep going back here ... convenience i guess .
0	this place is the worst though .
0	what 's up with that ?
0	ugh , next time i 'm going to costco ! !
0	so , i stumbled in , signed in & found a seat .
0	the services they provide are good .
0	their scheduling and billing are terrible at best .
0	the results were outstanding ! ! !
0	being on time and billing though are catastrophic .
0	usually , you wait 15-30 minutes beyond your scheduled time to see the doctor .
0	unfortunately , i had another immovable appointment i had to get to .
0	so we ran through everything and she suggested i do the immunotherapy .
0	that leaves me with my billing complaints .
0	i have been there 4 times .
0	for anyone in accounting is this gaap ?
0	heck no it is n't .
0	this is irs puts you in the pokey kind of accounting .
0	this place is in desperate need of a coo and a cfo .
0	and with her care and long hair products we do n't get split ends .
0	sincerely ben the receptionist and the clients that heard you on speakerphone .
0	can i give this place zero stars ? ?
0	i could write a negative book on this place .
0	so my friend two years ago recommended this place .
0	but they started getting shady about 6 months ago .
0	a different doctor every time .
0	then he started treating me like an imbecile and showed no good bedside manner .
0	can i curse in my review ?
0	going on good faith as i do care about my health .
0	um i am not a fool , a random doing invasive work !
0	i walked out getting nothing done and went for a second opinion somewhere else !
0	glad i did as what they said was an emergency was far from it !
0	especially if you do care about your health !
0	i have been told by everyone and their mother how great redemption psychiatry is .
0	to compare , i 'm paying $ 2.50/month for my current meds .
0	unfortunately that 's not the worst part .
0	instead , i was interrogated to admit that my dad abused me .
0	that had potential to ruin one of the most important relationships in my life .
0	i challenge everyone to be aware of this next time .
0	the people are nice , but that 's about all .
0	but i guess that 's their version of express .
0	if you can find a different shop for your pedicure .
0	positives : my appointment began on time .
0	the nurse was efficient and moved with rigor , the office staff was personable .
0	negatives : the doctor was less than compassionate when it came to my issues .
0	i explained that i have chronic sinus infections that linger .
0	i explained that green/yellow mucus is in my throat and nose daily .
0	i also explained that my sense of smell seems to be deteriorating .
0	he did not address this concern .
0	i went to the desk to provide the $ 60.00 copay .
0	i asked for a print out of what i was seen for today .
0	i was told it 's not ready , but can be mailed .
0	i do not feel like my needs were met .
0	i was told its easy to find !
0	.. well it was not .
0	i tried to talk to customer care , again with the machine .. seriously ?
0	i have been spoiled by world class treatment at umc .
0	i have been a patient of dr. burns for over ten years .
0	i see her for my yearly women wellness check ups .
0	they do n't see each others patients .
0	i explained how this was an emergency .
0	which they would n't provide to me for another week .
0	i have never been so displeased with a physicians office .
0	i was about 15 minutes late because i went to the wrong location .
0	too bad because it used to be a pleasurable experience .
0	orthopedic services were average , very forgettable !
0	the billing is extremely disorganized and very poorly managed !
0	i received a bill in september for services rendered 10 months earlier !
0	otherwise , i would n't give this store a second thought .
0	their products are pretty much all overpriced .
0	these people seem to find it very hard to say `` hi . ''
0	no people skills whatsoever ! !
0	one guy in there is pretty douche-y .
0	i do n't bother to find out his name .
0	i do n't like her at all .
0	she 's real confrontational and does not care if something is bothering you whatsoever .
0	the appointment lasts for all of 5 minutes .
0	she then weighs you on a scale she bought from walmart .
0	does n't she have record of that ? !
0	she is a bit difficult to get in touch with .
0	she also charges md prices when she 's just a nurse practitioner .
0	very expensive and very rude.. would n't recommend them to anyone !
0	the women running the business is a very scary-looking and rude woman .
0	she does n't even have nice teeth herself .
0	groupon holders beware there are way better ways of getting whiter teeth for $ 100
0	this place is a scam .
0	i bought a $ 49 groupon , towards $ 1,500 towards an invisilign treatment .
0	i was dumbfounded , and left it alone .
0	extremely long wait before nurses to respond .
0	my sister is a human being and our loved one ! ! !
0	the casting team and physical therapists here have been very competent and personable .
0	others seem to appreciate him so maybe it depends on whether he likes you .
0	we found him to be arrogant and impatient .
0	other doctors had recommended surgery but we were hoping for a noninvasive second opinion .
0	she has been using it `` normally '' , and it hurts .
0	it 's been hurting since it was broken , and never really stopped .
0	she is not the type to complain unless it is serious .
0	and when she tells me something hurts , i believe her .
0	probably `` dr. haber '' did n't believe her .
0	but i suppose that comes hard to those with too much hubris .
0	the woman i talked to was very rude and showed no empathy .
0	it 's a required medicine .
0	who knows if i 'll be able to find someone or not .
0	the concept of time means nothing to this group .
0	have a 2pm app't ?
0	how about you stop booking folks in the p.m. instead ?
0	and it 's not just stockton , it 's the pa 's as well .
0	poor service culture here .
0	my advice to anyone reading : got a rash ?
0	dash off to another firm .
0	if i could give this place no stars i would .
0	this was one of the worst experiences i have received .
0	i contacted them in regards to my complimentary consultation .
0	i do not recommend this office to anyone !
0	i have no respect for dr. dalley and her staff .
0	i read the reviews .
0	one review brought tears to my eyes .
0	dr. dalley was my doctor then and thank god never again .
0	i remember my ( first pregnancy ) .
0	i was feeling strange .
0	i was sent to have blood work done and something else .
0	i took her advice she did the surgery .
0	years past and once again i was pregnant for the ( second time ) .
0	one week later i tell my mom that something does not fill right .
0	i said ; ( mom i think that i am still very pregnant ) .
0	i say to her ( what did you take out ) ?
0	i could have died .
0	please to all the women ( pay attention to your body ) .
0	i told her i do n't have medicaid .
0	she needs to get her time accurate .
0	i told her i never told her that nor did my mom .
0	she said `` oh , what did you tell me ? `` .
0	i was so ticked off .
0	i was like wtf did i just see ? ? ?
0	i could n't take anything he said seriously because of what i had seen .
0	she was so unprofessional and a straight up rude b**** .
0	i was also told my appointment would only take 30 mins .
0	well some of the other reviewers are correct .
0	i went here because of all the excellent ratings .
0	the staff was super nice and made me feel comfortable .
0	the computers were having issues that day and had problems with the xray .
0	so i never got to see why i was having tooth issues .
0	never gave me pain meds or anitbotics after i went twice .
0	so she had me reschedule again to do it again .
0	oh and she measured my cervix wrong .
0	( i always make sure my insurance covers ) they said yes etc .
0	the lady at ( prenatal valley ) had to edit all of my information .
0	they 've always told me no .
0	which is a lie because now i have a balance owed of $ 147 .
0	for the `` emergency 's `` .
0	thanks to this location i now owe all together roughly around $ 600 .
0	so thank you to all whom participated in my negative experience ! !
0	he then said they only sell the flavoring for the shakes .
0	i hope they pay close attention , as you will continue loosing patients .
0	the doctors that i have encountered have been uncaring , rude and unprofessional .
0	i will never be returning to this practice .
0	in addition i had two kids with me .
0	she barely helped me through the menu and was just unpleasant in general .
0	i will find another location to visit based on this experience .
0	***** long term patient***** be careful !
0	i started going to southview in 2012. polite , kind , fancy equipment .
0	annoying and time consuming .
0	there were 2 very bad experiences i had .
0	1 - a crown broke when i just moved to europe .
0	it was very hard to manage with it broken .
0	why do that when you know i grid my teeth ! ? !
0	he said because the top was protecting those teeth , i was fine .
0	i was n't going to get work done in europe .
0	only my back molars are touching .
0	this was not the case with southview .
0	i recommend seasoned dentists .
0	please learn from my costly error of going to this practice .
0	my experience with junction optometrists has always been poor .
0	the two optometrists i have seen were excellent ; helpful , competent and friendly .
0	unfortunately the pricing and the staff are way below par .
0	and there were a lot of forms !
0	it felt as though many of the questions were unnecessarily duplicitous .
0	again , i decided to work with them and reschedule .
0	turns out , they had n't .
0	by this point , i had given up .
0	they clearly do n't have a working organizational system , which concerns me .
0	ultimately , i decided to book with another dentist in the area .
0	i found the sales staff to be a bit aggressive .
0	maybe it 's just me .
0	she looked confused and in disbelief at what she was seeing .
0	children do not belong in a hot tub to begin with .
0	i wo n't be back .
0	outdated salon with rude , horrible customer service .
0	i asked for a trim and the result was an uneven mess .
0	save yourself , and your hair , do n't go here !
0	horrible customer service experience ; could n't even get past the receptionist .
0	refused verified insurance coverage , inaccurate cash pricing , poor attitude .
0	overall an underwhelming and less than positive experience .
0	my feet have been killing me .
0	i do n't know why .
0	now i regret it .
0	ok these people do n't speak english well .
0	she just lightly rubbed them .
0	see you soon healing touch !
0	wo n't go again .
0	my child needed some fillings and we found this dentist had positive reviews .
0	do not use them unless you have money to burn .
0	extremely poor commuunication and listening skills- highly suggest going elsewhere !
0	i never thought i 'd see the day when walgreens became classier than cvs .
0	this place used to develop photos , now it does n't .
0	once the procedure was performed , they wanted to charge me full price .
0	this made an already difficult day worse than we could have ever imagined .
0	great customer service after i called twice already .
0	managers came outside and rectified the situation .
0	they were great and apologetic .
0	it happened and that 's why good managers will address it .
0	i take back the nice things i said .
0	but this place would definitely not be my first choice after reading this review .
0	worst experience of my life !
0	dr. thomas redid an old filling and chipped my tooth next to it .
0	had to go back to fix it .
0	he sliced my tongue on the drill .
0	i ended up having to go to another dentist to fix all his mistakes .
0	he left a filling to high and messed my bit .
0	he is very rude and unprofessional .
0	i have a crazy confession to make ... . i hate whole foods !
0	i especially hate this whole foods .
0	i do n't get the love.. sorry people .
0	*their salad bar sucks .
0	their cottage cheese is runny and gross .
0	i adore menage a trois wine .
0	i typically buy it at smith 's for between 6.99 and 8.99 a bottle .
0	why does whole foods charge 16.99 a bottle ?
0	i hate you whole foods *prepared food is n't that good !
0	pizza.. sucks.. ( come on settebello is in the same parking lot !
0	) , pasta.. awful and inedible .
0	sandwiches are just ok.. just ok for these prices ?
0	nothing is that good or worth eating at these prices .
0	*i 've found expired salsa on their shelves.. expired by a freaking year .
0	just cancelled and move to fitness connection for $ 10 bucks a month .
0	serious over crowding issue .
0	been here for over 4 hours and still have n't seen a doctor .
0	they are always short staffed .
0	went there this weekend with my husband .
0	you tell them your problem before being processed.dr .
0	zima pakzad did absolutely nothing to help him .
0	an urgent care that gives no care ? ? ?
0	she told him to go to the hospital .
0	how is talking to him going to help his medical problem .
0	the place was dirty .
0	blood on the floor in the waiting room , right next to couch .
0	they office staff even had bad appearance .
0	it looked like 80 % of them rolled out of bed and came in .
0	do n't waste your time here .
0	they do n't help .
0	my original review was very positive i did enjoy my message from breida .
0	it 's they only place where my eyes came in contact with anything .
0	the former activity director was very attentive and helpful , not to mention business-like .
0	recommend all veterans to not go to this neurology center ! ! !
0	unhappy patient of va , who was reffered here , big mistake ! ! !
0	made an appointment three weeks ago to see a doctor .
0	i had to wait that long because he was very busy .
0	do not come here .
0	the office seems very old and creepy .
0	each room had a floor fan and a beat up desk .
0	one of the hallways did n't even have its lights on !
0	just completely dark , very creepy .
0	the place just looked completely deserted .
0	( at this point i was very upset and frustrated ) .
0	moral of the story ; do n't trust zocdoc with their recommendations .
0	i should 've checked yelp to see what people had to say .
0	this could 've all been avoided if i had seen all these reviews first !
0	and do n't go to this practice ! ! !
0	the most unprofessional and unpleasant experience i 've had the displeasure of living through .
0	i started treatment in november 2014 for laser hair removal on two areas .
0	other than that i was satisfied with the personal at this location .
0	now for the hair removal .
0	it did n't work - at all ! ! !
0	all of my hair is back , with a vengeance !
0	if that 's the case , then why did n't it work .
0	even the very minimal touch-ups is an understatement in my case .
0	very dissatisfied with the results .
0	they did the next morning .
0	the nurse practitioner i saw ( dr .
0	so far so good .
0	`` , he said .
0	i had him check my two moles .
0	he said we 'll keep an eye out on them .
0	again , `` what else ? ''
0	i showed him the skin tag by my eye .
0	so i wasted my pay for this place .
0	time to find a new eye doctor !
0	this place had decent yelp reviews so i went with it .
0	initial scheduling was a breeze but rescheduling was a nightmare .
0	with each call , i was asked to verify my insurance information .
0	`` it was n't recorded , '' was their response .
0	on the day of the appointment , i arrived fifteen minutes early .
0	what 's up hipaa ?
0	after the phone call she said i was not covered by vision insurance .
0	alas , i was covered and just in time for my appointment .
0	i called a week later after not hearing from the office .
0	`` one pair is finished , the other will be done this afternoon .
0	we 'll call you . ''
0	we 'll put that pair together today and call you for pickup . ''
0	meaning i was lied to the day before .
0	and again , no call .
0	i waited two more days .
0	i 'll call you this afternoon for pickup . ''
0	bummed , because they 're so close .
0	but i wo n't be going back .
0	i 'd rather have 12 unmedicated kids with add than deal with her .
0	i do n't have time to make notes about this '' .
0	if she worked for me she 'd be fired in a hot minute !
0	they even faxed me proof they were waiting on her !
0	buffy is amazing and dr. piacentine is great !
0	front office girls are not friendly .
0	probably trained by latisha .
0	i went to dr. rick office for general dentistry is great .
0	he is good and gentle .
0	now i had to go for oral surgery to close the pockets .
0	i was told no the gaurantee was cancelled when i left the practice .
0	one implant has cost me $ 7,421.00 which is horriable .
0	i do not recomend him .
0	dr. knirk is completely incompetent .
0	accuses patients of faking .
0	lies right to your face .
0	avoid at all costs .
0	this place is keeping itself in business by promoting weekly and monthly recurring customers .
0	some chiros will help you .
0	nice receptionist , but morally bankrupt premise that their business is built on .
0	dr. kotoske is terrible .
0	please go anywhere else .
0	i did a rhinoplasty a few years back and he made my nose worse .
0	my new nose looks swollen and it still hurts .
0	they did absolutely nothing but hurt .
0	i am more self conscious about my nose than ever .
0	it 's not like it 's a one time mistake .
0	he did the same exact thing to my sister 's nose 6 months later .
0	so this is a habit .
0	well it ca n't be a professional opinion when you make something worse .
0	from one civilized person to another , please do n't go to him .
0	it will save you money and time .
0	doctor-patient manners are non existent .
0	i was then told i could come in the next day to see someone .
0	dr. young was condescending and overconfident when my husband came to him for help .
0	this location in particular , was a huge disappointment .
0	think i am looking for a new office ! ! !
0	i 've been coming here for grocery once a week since they opened .
0	i buy the organic veggies fruits and chicken .
0	however , the meat price has gone up twice since amazon took over .
0	i stopped buying meat from here .
0	they went bad within a couple of days .
0	the quality of the deli is not as good as before either .
0	i got a 30 minutes reflexology , the massage itself was okay .
0	i did like the fact that the place was clean .
0	wow , for a $ 20 massage $ 5 tip is pretty good !
0	but they expect $ 15 and up !
0	but that 's not right !
0	the owner should pay them what they are entitled to .
0	one star , because you 're not able to give a zero .
0	made an appointment for a stat childrens x-ray .
0	came to the appt , and waited over 1.5 hours ! !
0	ridiculous and will never go back .
0	3 ) the doctors here are psychics !
0	they are n't very effective for eye pain !
0	you guys really are the absolute best in medicine !
0	remind me to drive right past this place if i 'm ever dying !
0	the staff is terrible .
0	they have called me twice the day of to try to get her in .
0	who is in charge of this place ?
0	my doctor recommended dr. romine .
0	i arrived this morning 20 minutes early to fill out paperwork .
0	i was told dr. romine was booked .
0	at this time i was told they would try to work me in .
0	we received none of the services that are standard with a complete physical exam .
0	the pa barely looked up while going through the forms we completed .
0	the bulk of the visit was watching her type the info into the laptop .
0	i still need a physical , a pelvic exam , and a breast exam .
0	yep , i still need all of those things .
0	all other concerns will be saved for another provider .
0	it was early but i packed up the kids and went to the hospital .
0	as though that were my fault .
0	and it 's costing me $ 175 .
0	forewarned , parents of young ones .
0	if i could do no stars i would .
0	had a hot stone pedicure from the owner ben .
0	it was the most painful non relaxing experience .
0	he cut me three times .
0	i had a prescription sent over to this pharmacy at 8:30 in the morning .
0	i showed up at noon my lunchtime to pick this prescription up .
0	the young lady helping me have no idea what workmen 's comp .
0	well it 's workmen 's comp .
0	and then i find out the prescription cost $ 35 .
0	the owner doesnt care of client who visit with the groupon .
0	totally , stay away from this so called clinic spa ! !
0	rude admin staff and very hard to reach .
0	always had to call several times and/or leave several messages .
0	always felt like i was bothering them .
0	great smoothies , terrible service .
0	everyone who works there is nice but sooooooo slow .
0	be prepared to wait 30 minutes for your smoothie .
0	we have visited many times , never had on complaint .
0	i was very disappointed & felt a waste of time and money .
0	all i got for my money was you 're doing a great job !
0	you are an ideal tmj patient .
0	just keep on managing it .
0	my oral surgeon first was one of the top at ucla .
0	it 's well worth it !
0	the hours are posted and they are never here .
0	they also never answer their telephones .
0	do n't waste your time and money on such a. u professional place .
0	twice what most dentists in toronto charge .
0	i was very happy with their service , until i shopped their price .
0	stay away from this place .
0	go to doctorcare or cholla medical instead .
0	i bought a 60-minute massage session from groupon .
0	i walked in 5 minuets before my 10 am appointment .
0	the massage therapist gave me some paperwork to complete .
0	i will never go back there again
0	i had a new patient appointment and wo n't be going back .
0	i needed a new doctor and searched online for the best female doctor .
0	finally a male doctor came in the room .
0	he was very nice but i never even found out what his name was .
0	the salon was empty , only one associate working -- `` amy . ''
0	we then promptly began the foot soak .
0	i closed my eyes .
0	i opened my eyes and saw that she was texting on her cell phone .
0	she looked up at me , said `` sorry ! ''
0	and put her phone away .
0	and put her phone away .
0	finally , two minutes later i caught her texting a fourth time .
0	that did it for me .
0	she said , `` sorry , sorry , sorry . ''
0	we ended at the half-hour mark .
0	i asked how much i should pay her for a partial hour .
0	she said twenty dollars .
0	-- -- - i did n't know whether to be angry or laugh .
0	gold spa foot reflexology , sorry .
0	i went to cdc chinook for ultrasound .
0	they told me to drink water an hour before which i did .
0	the technician was almost 40 min late .
0	no one called and said that it would be late .
0	i had to sit and be tourchered for almost an hour .
0	it 's unacceptable to tourcher people like this .
0	finally i could not wait anymore went to the bathroom .
0	i just do n't understand why .
0	for procedure like this it 's not ok to make person wait that long .
0	i ate the white food for 48 hours .
0	honestly i get a better result from the strips .
0	i wo n't be back or recommend this to anyone .
0	had an appointment at 3:30 to get my sons 15mo wellness and vaccinations .
0	i pride myself on this .
0	so this just threw me over the top .
0	this review is partially about the center but mostly regarding kenneth houchin , md .
0	my wife had a cva ( stroke ) which took part of her vision .
0	the last visit we had he back-peddled stating that her vision might improve .
0	i say `` soooo what ? ! ''
0	an idiot is an idiot regardless of title or position !
0	long story short ... do not go to dr. kenneth houchin !
0	i had my initial appointment to see ann marie for some postpartum troubles .
0	so i sat there , and sat there .
0	they let me into the counseling room and i sat even longer .
0	here ann marie was with her and said she 'd be right there .
0	it was not a great way to start rapport .
0	i never got the email to begin with .
0	i forgave this time .
0	again , i went up to the same receptionist and asked how much longer .
0	i replied that is was already 30 minutes past my appointment time .
0	but obviously she did ! ! ! !
0	seriously , so sad and ridiculous .
0	receptionist was rude , badly dressed and thought she knew everything .
0	blue cross blue shield is the worst health insurance company i have ever had .
0	when i try to go inside the door was locked .
0	i looked at the hours and they should be open .
0	a lady showed up to the door and said there was no doctor there .
0	i joined yelp for this one and only review !
0	you 're lucky my finger accidentally hit a star .
0	well , that happened , twice actually .
0	$ 1300 cash and then addition $ 47 to reattach .
0	very rude front office .
0	dishonest and unethical provider .
0	please do your research and follow your gut .
0	i wish i would have .
0	there were several red flags .
0	i would never recommend this place .
0	you 've been warned .
0	i have bruises from the classic massage - `` light to medium '' pressure .
0	also do not recommend the c and c scrub .
0	just a sugar scrub , and then you hop in the shower .
0	drink had no alcohol and was also pricey .
0	personal preference is a smaller spa .
0	do n't care for the forced 20 % tip either .
0	i will tip well for great service , but this was n't .
0	never have they answered my phonecalls or returned my calls .
0	failed to send out prescriptions multiple times .
0	staff is rude and lacks empathy .
0	doctor is a joke .
0	the nurses and doctor seemed more interested in bickering than helping my kid .
0	i 'm avoiding dignity like the plague from now on .
0	my dentist must have sold them his patient list before moving to illinois .
0	i walked in to have a crown re-attached .
0	my dentist ( b. costaras ) was not their .
0	they did have one of the dentists available to re-attach it .
0	also take notice the charge amount does not display in the signiture pad !
0	we cancelled ... and disputed the credit card transaction !
0	i typically enjoy my time practicing yoga .
0	dont waste your time ! ! !
0	worst experience ever i took my daughter who had been throwing up mucus .
0	she refused and ddnt change my prescription .
0	that the urine sample was no longer needed .
0	i called the pharmacy and was told the medicine cost over $ 170 ! !
0	so again why was it prescribed ?
0	this trip was completely worthless ! ! !
0	last time i will be going there .
0	please do n't go there
0	this facility is horrible .
0	then they have no personality when talking to you .
0	you can not make an appointment without waiting at least as week .
0	kind of ironic with how many dr and pa 's they have there .
0	needless to say looking for a new dr .
0	always understaffed , always takes at least two hours .
0	never went back ... . almost done coming here too .
0	most staff is usually kind but all are horribly slow .
0	so i have changed doctors and hope to have a better experience next time .
0	do not go here .
0	i then waited another 10 minutes before they had a student doctor come in .
0	i wait another 5 minutes and someone comes in with a swab .
0	talk about spreading disease , gross .
0	i was sooooo frustrated with my experience .
0	do not waste your time with this office .
0	the oil they used which smelled like lube made me itch afterwards .
0	it was just a bad experience .
0	i will never go back again
0	i am very conflicted writing this review .
0	this store always seems to run out of items that are in the flyer .
0	currently , potatoes are on sale but on monday they have run out .
0	same problem as some others .
0	these guys are flakey .
0	making and breaking appointments .
0	not returning calls and emails .
0	this was the most interesting restaurant i have been in .
0	super expensive for some really bland , boring food .
0	just because its vegan/vege does not mean it has to be terrible .
0	the decor is 100 % salvation army , pieced together from a thrift store !
0	and it took an hour
0	i adore and respect my physician , dr. koppenbrink .
0	the problem does not rest with him , as he recently joined this group .
0	when i leave the office , i always ask what my copay is .
0	both visits i was told there was none , as i have medicare .
0	i have spoken to the office to no avail .
0	the phones are always busy if you wish to not talk at a machine .
0	i had a very important meeting , and wanted to look my best .
0	i waited 20 minutes , and still no stylist .
0	that is no way to run a business .
0	skip this place if you really want to get your hair done .
0	i also paid hundreds of dollars in deductible .
0	when i refused to pay her extortion she put it on my credit .
0	i am still fighting this .
0	she is shady and her work is terrible ! ! !
0	i recently moved to madison and chose this optometrist office based on yelp reviews .
0	i 'll start by saying the doctor and technician were very strong .
0	i felt like i had a solid eye exam .
0	my poor review is based on the cost practices of this office .
0	i 've worn the same brand and strength of contacts for several years .
0	in this exam , they confirmed that prescription was still the right one .
0	they did not fit me with new contacts .
0	be smarter than me !
0	ask more questions about the price of the services before you go !
0	this place is horrible at so many things .
0	they are the supercuts of doctors offices .
0	it is quicker to go to a lab to get your blood taken .
0	i have had 2 female doctors that i have seen at the practice leave .
0	they push , push , push , unnecessary tests and medications .
0	upsell , upsell , upsell at this place .
0	it is a joke .
0	went to doctor zedek in hopes of pursuing cognitive behavior therapy for my anxiety .
0	unfortunately , i paid $ 150 for a less than 10 min conversation .
0	if you are looking to pursue actual therapy i would not recommend him .
0	their basic pedi does n't even include a massage .
0	extra $ 5 for that .
0	and to remove your gel polish is an extra $ 5 .
0	definitely not worth the pric
0	finally , i went in one last time , had two cavities ! ! !
0	never got them filled , and never went back .
0	she swore i was just taking it wrong .
0	i vomited all over myself at work .
0	he changed me to another medicine .
0	she then was condescending about the medicine the other doctor put me on .
0	i 'm not a doctor , i did n't choose it .
0	this medicine eventually made me ill also .
0	i emailed her about it and she did n't bother responding .
0	it 's like a factory line .
0	do yourself a favor and look for a different doctor .
0	i know i will be doing so .
0	it 's not a coincidence that she only has 1 star reviews .
0	they are very limited and only open one saturday a month .
0	after trying for six plus month i decided to just throw them away !
0	instead , i got someone who told me i need to relax .
0	at that point , i knew i was done .
0	i did n't know what to think of this after i left .
0	she canceled my next appointment due to other obligations and i was relieved .
0	i canceled my next appointment and opted out of future visits .
0	after being made a joke of , i will not return to therapy .
0	i 'm an extreme shrimp lover and i usually get shrimps from costco .
0	tiger shrimp is always not cheap even in costco .
0	when i peeled the shell i felt the softness of the shrimps .
0	the shrimps i got from costco were firm when i peeled them .
0	i was lucky enough that they did n't make me sick .
0	no more shrimps from whole foods .
0	i will start by saying that i have not used their dental services .
0	i did my research before selecting first choice .
0	i consulted with 7 different ortho clinics in the madison area .
0	dr. trent cox is great , he really is .
0	they have failed at every one of my last three appointments .
0	yes , three in a row !
0	luckily , i caught it this time around , having learned my lesson .
0	i am stuck with them for the duration , but you are not .
0	such an awful human being .
0	well , a normal person would say she was in a suite .
0	she is not helpful or understanding .
0	basically all she told me was i was wrong .
0	the receptionist was wonderful , she needs to gt out of that place .
0	guess i 'm not good enough for your help .
0	also , she is not board certified in psychiatry , nor a doctor .
0	she is a nurse practitioner .
0	however , i honestly fail to see the value of this .
0	the issue is painfully obvious .
0	whereas my yelp review was merely intended to share my personal experience with others .
0	why go to a 2 star rated hospital ? ?
0	i came here because i have been having severe leg cramps for several days .
0	if all else fails try a muscle relaxer .
0	no kidding dr.. i got that from google search too .
0	what a rip off .
0	if you want urgent relief do not go here !
0	i was admitted quickly and seen by a nurse and a doctor .
0	they administered multiple tests including an ekg and blood work .
0	the nurse on duty called the doctor on call for instructions on my treatment .
0	i am very disappointed in dignity health .
0	the dr himself seems fine & very thorough as mentioned in other review .
0	however the staff is what drove us out .
0	the wait was an hour past the appointment time .
0	the wait in the examination room was 10 minutes .
0	the dr visit was fine .
0	he asked plenty of good questions did examination & as i said was thorough .
0	wow ! ! ! !
0	so we left on that note .
0	so it is 100 % staffing issues .
0	so unfortunate that he 's good dr surrounded by bad staff .
0	bueller ... ... bueller ... ... bueller ?
0	seems they needed the original sleep study report to fill the order .
0	a week later i call vr up again , wondering what 's going on .
0	ok , i call banner and do as i 'm asked .
0	`` no , it was 8 years ago in 2005 ! ''
0	make it all one word , add a dotcom and you 're in business .
0	bottom line , valley respiratory customer service stinks .
0	do n't use them .
0	you might eventually stumble across my folder .
0	115 days since i first placed an order with them .
0	that says it all regarding their customer service .
0	which i 'm not !
0	how is this criticism a conflict of interest ?
0	liar and this is bad for your business .
0	total time twiddling my thumbs = 2 hours !
0	my journey of waiting started in the lobby .
0	time ticked by , as i tried to entertain myself .
0	repeated glances at my phone , looking up at the tv .
0	before i knew it an hour had ticked by .
0	`` hello '' , said the doctor after waiting an hour and a half .
0	i was greeted by the bill of what might be done with my teeth .
0	not going there again .
0	now i need to get the tip of another root done and finally sealed .
0	on the upside neither root canal hurt at all .
0	however years of pain made up for that .
0	yes you did a root canal as well as the one through the top .
0	this is the worse pedicure i have ever received .
0	the girl who did mine rushed it .
0	my feet are more rough than when i went in .
0	i came in with the flu .
0	he prescribed me tamiflu knowing what the side effects are .
0	i been in remission for 2 years ! ! ! !
0	with no symptoms ! ! !
0	so i 'm beyond pissed off .
0	you would think being a doctor he would be smarter than that .
0	but i guess not .
0	unfortunately i learned the hard way .
0	not even close to these pictures . ''
0	no way out on the surface , lifecenter plus seems like a decent gym .
0	however , prospective members should beware .
0	if you use the fitness area , there a some big problems .
0	2 ) the weight equipment is also old and very limited .
0	if you are looking for hammer strenth , forget it .
0	3 ) management does n't care what you think .
0	she did n't even listen to my comments .
0	do n't count on having evening care because they only offer 2 a week .
0	5 ) lifecenter plus requires a full year commitment with no back-out clause .
0	do n't join lifecenter plus .
0	impossible to make an appointment when your sick .
0	i will not be back .
0	clean facility and nice staff .
0	the girls at the desk are rude , and not helpful .
0	it felt like as if they do n't want to help you .
0	instead you get a `` here 's a brochure from the wall .
0	call these list of numbers .
0	they 'll help you , not us . ''
0	again i asked them not to contact me again .
0	i received another call in february then a letter i march .
0	this is nothing more then harassment !
0	if you like getting harassing phone calls i recommend this medical office .
0	they are unprofessional , unorganized , and flat out rude .
0	when friday rolled around i called back .
0	it was finally called in the next tuesday .
0	after two weeks i called back and asked to speak to dr. mody directly .
0	she said the appointment person only worked until noon and would handle it .
0	to get them to change it to the right procedure took another week !
0	i hope this helps steer other future patients away from this practice .
0	so extremeeley frustrated and dispointed .
0	i have been a customer for three years .
0	worst customer service ever , incompentant and lazy .
0	they never call back .
0	then i had them expediate the shipment .
0	wtf still havent sent it .
0	i feel like suing these a-holes .
0	dont trust this company with your pets livlihood they dont care anymore .
0	maybe it has new managment idk but its a disgrace .
0	this place is so unorganized it should be county .
0	the left hand certainly does n't know what the right hand is doing .
0	2 weeks later it was n't working .
0	now i 'm seeing a different dr. irons .
0	gives me now 2mg xanax .
0	she thinks she is not only a dr but a psychiatrist .
0	always she fills it and adds another medication .
0	next visit ( i could never see the same doctor for some reason . )
0	oh by now i 'm on 40mg celebs,4mg xanax and 500mg gabapentin .
0	which by the way is a joke .
0	the dumb bitch wrote me a fake script .
0	while in the exam room she told me she hated it .
0	i was too high on a dose and walks out to write my refill .
0	thinking nothing of it i did n't look at it till i got home .
0	the crazy bitch set me up .
0	my file is frozen .
0	anyway they kicked me off the program .
0	refusing to give me my medical records been 5 months .
0	and dr. snyder no longer works there .
0	i was extremely disappointed by this location .
0	i had appointments scheduled at 130 , 2 and 215 for myself and children .
0	i arrived at 115 to complete paperwork .
0	i 'm incredibly disappointed with this facility and their lack of promptness .
0	this office is so unorganized .
0	i 've been here coming here now for about 6 month .
0	but today was the worst .
0	i have to drive 45 minutes to get to this office .
0	so they tell me we 're sorry we are out of cards .
0	of course she 's like you need a card .
0	maybe you should do something so you do n't run out .
0	so she 's like i ca n't give you your shot .
0	so surprise surprise they ca n't do that either .
0	you have to make an appointment for that .
0	wich of course will be like a month out .
0	now i have to suffer .
0	after reading the review from the zarina i want to give them a try .
0	i wo n't recommend anyone to come here .
0	what 's the point of walk ins ? ?
0	i came here because i truly needed medical care and i got scammed .
0	it 's so sad what healthcare has turned into !
0	i do n't know .
0	not a good experience : (
0	on november 17 my grandmother fell ill and we visited mountain view .
0	she struggles with bowel obstructions and was in a lot of pain .
0	i told him what i knew .
0	he disregarded what i said .
0	he sent her to a bed and had nurses care for her .
0	let me start off by saying the massage was actually pretty good ! !
0	i agree with the other poster , dr. rostan has a non-existent bedside manner .
0	seems a little over-hyped in the community .
0	-their chocolate peanut butter shake is good but quite liquidy .
0	waited an hour or more for every single appointment .
0	it indeed was sears to my surprise !
0	it was the doctor himself !
0	he said `` i am trying to work too and you cancelled . ''
0	you never know who you are entertaining .
0	the owner fida is a lying , cheating , stealing bastard .
0	he ca n't live up to his promises and along with settling disputes properly .
0	very poor attitude and business professionalism .
0	go buy the product at a reliable company , not this one .
0	**please note the other review regarding his past indiscretions with the court system .
0	but he told me he did .
0	i 'm sorry i have to give this place one star .
0	the only deserving star is because dr garcia seems to care about her patients .
0	however her staff is rude , and short .
0	it 's unfortunate after 5 years but we will be going elsewhere .
0	the er has faster wait times than this office .
0	this store is in absolute chaos .
0	very hard to tell who he 's talking to .
0	waited over 60 minutes for a 4:00 appointment .
0	never even bothered to apologize .
0	obnoxious , incompetent and inefficient .
0	take your business literally anywhere else .
0	they should do the dignified thing and just close shop .
0	there is no sense of urgency what 's so ever here .
0	the front desk can be very slow .
0	some of the dr 's hate being there .
0	if you have a choice go elsewhere .
0	they have a contract with principle my dental and united ppo medical .
0	they never even billed the medical .
0	i would never go back
0	unprofessional business owners ! !
0	more interested in money than people and employees .
0	they do n't care about patients and fired loyal employees with no notice .
0	find another dental practice ! !
0	not great but not bad .
0	short : tiny cramped salon .
0	unfriendly techs but nails came out really good .
0	pretty unsanitary if you ask me .
0	long : i was a walk in for an acrylic full set .
0	they told me 10 min which was great .
0	vanessa was my nail tech and probably the most unfriendly i 've met .
0	greeted me but that was about it .
0	no small talk or even an attempt .
0	seemed like she was maybe training her ?
0	great color and shape is good too .
0	well i guess not at this place .
0	vanessa literally pushed my hands away and told me i was done .
0	honestly ca n't say i 'll be back .
0	this guy does the cheapest work possible and cuts corners .
0	i do n't know whether to blame the dr or her staff .
0	i got my labs drawn 7/31 .
0	waited 1 week , no response .
0	come 9/9 still nothing !
0	a moment of silence while she reviews it , `` oh !
0	do n't waste your time and money here .
0	i would steer clear of this office .
0	i showed up 4min before my appointment .
0	got in the room 9min after appointment time .
0	was finished 56min after the appointment time .
0	great 45min message , if you ask me .
0	in addition , their bedside manner is atrocious .
0	i encourage anyone to avoid this place at all costs .
0	if i could give a negative star rating i would .
0	at 41wks that all changed .
0	both delivered vaginally w/o any complications . )
0	the dr , on call , was dr benjamin-avery .
0	this turned out not to be the case .
0	dr avery flat out refused to induce labor .
0	she pressured & bullied me into a c-section .
0	danner also knew this .
0	i begged , cried & pleaded to not have the procedure .
0	all of my efforts fell on deaf ears .
0	i was hysterical going into , during , & after the procedure .
0	dr avery could have cared less about my fears .
0	they treated me like cattle instead of a human being .
0	and the 6 1/2 inch incision scar has left me feeling mutilated and disfigured .
0	i went in for what i thought was a kidney infection .
0	did you have one at home ? `` .
0	i will never go back to this place .
0	so i kept my mouth shut , shot him a smile and waited .
0	another customer asked him for a lid and made a joke .
0	the man behind the counter did n't think it was funny .
0	i said `` hold on , are you talking about me ? ''
0	even now i 'm shaking .
0	she offered free smoothies and smiles if i went and saw her .
0	later on that day the owner of the val vista location called me .
0	the girl went to the back to tell the owner i was here .
0	i visited dr. stowell looking for replacement hormone therapy for testosterone .
0	he said it was the best approach to my situation .
0	for seven weeks i went for weekly testosterone injections .
0	i immediately went to a traditional md .
0	foolishly , i trusted dr. stowell that he know what he was doing .
0	this fellow should not be dispensing drugs or writing prescriptions to patients .
0	clearly he should stick to being a chiropractor and dispensing vitamins .
0	out to lunch , closed early , at other office , etc .
0	stay away and go some where else .
0	i asked if there was an emergency or was this normal .
0	she said it was very normal .
0	i had rescheduled my business appointments to be on time for this doctor appointment .
0	the other patients waiting were equally frustrated .
0	i would n't have minded waiting if there was an emergency .
0	it is a matter of respect and good business .
0	she did n't care one bit .
0	do not use cardiovascular consultants , ltd !
0	i will never come back here this is ridiculous .
0	you should not come here if you have any actual plans omg .
0	also , people who have shown up after me are being seen before me .
0	they obviously triple book without any concern for their patients .
0	i ended up going to urgent care and then an opthamogist .
0	i just want to be able to see .
0	what a joke , i ca n't believe pearle bision stays in business .
0	i went in for a tooth cleaning .
0	they told me they had to do some `` medically necessary work . ''
0	not being a dentist i trusted them .
0	they assured me it did .
0	i had them double check to be sure , again they assured me .
0	i went home and researched what they were going to do .
0	i went forward with the work .
0	i was able to scrape the money together to pay them .
0	i was upset and paid in all $ 1 bills .
0	i am seeing a new dentist now who i enjoy much more .
0	wish i could rate it less then a ( 1 ) star .
0	blue cross blue shield will be notified next .
0	not happy that i can not speak with anyone when i call .
0	they do not call back promptly to setup appointments and follow ups .
0	been trying to get in all week for a med check .
0	i call again , i 'm put on hold indefinitely so i hang up .
0	i love fresh but have to say something for today .
0	hopefully the business will read this and do something for a loyal fresh fan !
0	cleaning was great but the wait was ridiculous .
0	do n't come on a lunch break people .
0	she ignored major symptoms that could have lead to serious issues .
0	it 's disappointing that their quality of work has deteriorated so much .
0	the initial psychiatry appt we booked for our son we did online .
0	ok , i 'm irritated but mistakes happen .
0	so , we reschedule .
0	we finally meet with the dr and she seemed great .
0	i book it online again per the instructions on their voicemail .
0	how are you already 30 minutes behind in less than two hours .
0	our appt was suppose to be for 1:50pm .
0	what the heck ? ? ? ? ?
0	she had us do his bloodwork weeks ago .
0	what if all this time , he 's had toxic levels in his system ?
0	i 'm so pissed .
0	she tells me she does n't .
0	how can you have proper therapy with someone in 15 minutes ?
0	this tells me she 's just in it to dole out meds .
0	so , needless to say , we 're switching doctors .
0	she had read the above review and felt we were blaming her unnecessarily .
0	i will never again go to elements massage on ft apace .
0	the owner is only concerned about herself and not her clients .
0	she would n't even call to check and find out how it happen .
0	i filed a complaint with the better business bureau and attorney generals office .
0	be careful if going here ! ! !
0	high prices i only wanted a soda !
0	fast cashier by the name of eddy though
0	nothing but a bunch of money grubbers .
0	this has gone to the point of absurd .
0	we have been told we owe a balance of $ 307 for no insurance .
0	we have insurance , we have always had insurance .
0	the bottom line , our end is taken care of .
0	they have been trained to not make appointments for people with past due accounts .
0	this is all according to our health care .
0	it 's come to the point that urgent care has become her primary place .
0	a prescription was called in to my pharmacy for me .
0	no one has ever called me with results .
0	i felt very upset about this place .
0	what i can say，service is good but too much long time to wait .
0	we 've been going here for a couple years now .
0	i get sick of the `` up selling '' that happens when we visit .
0	a friend recommended this doctor , 15 mins on hold before i hung up .
0	could n't even make an appointment .
0	rude , arrogant and flippant salesclerks .
0	this place is ridiculous .
0	i made an appointment for 2pm and did n't get seen until 3:30 !
0	because they took 3 walk-ins before me !
0	i was even early to fill out paperwork and everything !
0	all i could think was how rude she was .
0	the only positive to this building is dr. imani williams-vaughn .
0	the nurse had no idea what i was saying and barely spoke english .
0	the location is in the ghetto but it is very contemporary designed and clean .
0	they took my sierra health and life ppo insurance .
0	what the hell is wrong with this place .
0	the ma taking vitals has no bedside manner for working with children .
0	and this place only serves children , so that 's a huge turn off .
0	the receptionist clearly wanted to be elsewhere .
0	the doctor was too fast .
0	i do n't feel like he spent even 5 minutes with us .
0	things were dusty , the floor needed a good sweeping and mopping .
0	but i do not recommend good night .
0	do n't waste your time .
0	go to urgent care clinic .
0	this place is ridiculous .
0	i was given a referral to this place for my son .
0	( already unprofessional venting to a customer ) .
0	why would i be told to call back today ?
0	are your receptionist to incompetent to schedule an appointment ?
0	which is fine because they definitely wo n't ever have my business .
0	omg i continue to punish myself and go here .
0	took 6 days to get a refill done for my son .
0	they blamed the doctor and the doctor blamed them .
0	5 visits and multiple calls .
0	and not just me but every single woman in line .
0	why oh why do i go here .
0	oh because it is a mile from my house .
0	i must like to be annoyed !
0	good thing happy was on the radio !
0	this office is very incompetent .
0	i would n't recommend this doctors office after my first visit today .
0	the ultrasound tech was pleasant also .
0	the finances generated from a maternity patient is a lot .
0	i 'm not certain this doctors office will meet your expectations .
0	this place is a zoo .
0	the lobby is hot and stinks .
0	just feels so unsanitary !
0	i had to use the restroom and that was a joyful experience as well .
0	also there were wads of wet paper towels stuck to the walls .
0	after about an hour and 1/2 we get called back .
0	i 'm not sure if a doctor or an arnp saw my husband .
0	she did n't introduce herself .
0	took about 5 min to examine his foot and ordered x-rays .
0	that was fine with us .
0	the quicker the better .
0	but we sat for another 30 minutes waiting for x-rays .
0	my husband is finally getting them done now so we 'll see .
0	i ca n't imagine i need to say anymore then i have .
0	all i can say is this place is really unorganized and filthy .
0	i bought a $ 29 groupon for this place .
0	i will not be returning .
0	i was expecting a hypnosis session with an actual person .
0	they then play a cd with a creepy male voice for an hour .
0	after getting up out of the chair i felt nauseous .
0	the blinking lights created a motion sickness feeling .
0	this did not work at all .
0	i would not recommend this place to anyone .
0	do not go there .
0	the worst service , administration and they do n't have any doctors .
0	they do n't care if you are dying or not .
0	however , the receptionist believe she is a diagnostician .
0	not to put down nurses but apparently she missed this .
0	i had already paid $ 159 for nothing .
0	keep away from this place you are sure to die
0	..this place is the worst .
0	then all i got was a `` sorry '' and she hung up .
0	i normally like marc 's but the lakewood location is godawful .
0	first off the parking lot here is a nightmare !
0	there 's several blind spots when turning out of aisles .
0	i believe this is one of the reason check out here is extremely slow .
0	i also suggest to bring your own bags .
0	the bags here are as thin as tissue paper .
0	i can only compare this store to the steel yard wal-mart .
0	if you are from this area you will understand the comparison .
0	i recommend not coming here after 4pm or around the 1st of the month .
0	you will regret it !
0	i decided to find a new dr since dr.mcghee left .
0	and i know many people that feel the same way : (
0	it is her assistant and office personnel that are very much lacking .
0	the ladies that check me out after a visit are great .
0	she has not returned my call ( or whomever should ) .
0	this has been going on for years .
0	am i expecting to much ?
0	is this where our system has taken us ?
0	i then contracted with sr. dimensions and as of now they are worthless .
0	i am paying more for things that i did not pay for before .
0	so my 1 star is for the staff at this diagnostic center of medicine .
0	i would never recommend going there !
0	i came to this ob/gyn when i was pregnant last year .
0	many times they had called me to reschedule .
0	she had told me she does a lot of c sections .
0	this was a hit and miss .
0	one specifically i do not like is connie .
0	do not use this place unless you want to die !
0	they have no clue what they are doing nor do they care .
0	these people should be sued for their practices or lack there of ! !
0	slow , un-educated , rip off artists .
0	stay clear of this place !
0	you have been warned .
0	i wanted so bad to demand my copayment back ! !
0	this place does not care about you or your illness , nor your pain .
0	they are the prescription police and you will be judged ! !
0	do yourself a favor and find somewhere else that actually cares about you !
0	my rating is very valid because it was my experience with your company .
0	as a customer , we decide where we want to spend our money .
0	looks bad from the outside & gets worse when you walk in .
0	rude employees & horrible bedside manner .
0	deserves a zero in my book .
0	if this is healthcare i 'd rather just die !
0	i would just like to say that dr.lee is awesome !
0	come to find out i receive a bill for $ 50 dollars ! ! !
0	to my surprise for a missed appointment .
0	first , she never even asked me for my name or account number .
0	that is when she informed me she was also the manager .
0	i was told that i would also be dismissed from his practice .
0	bu , t more so because of his very rude staff .
0	next came another assistant , andrea , to fit my mouth with the bridge .
0	she told me it would take 20 minutes to print and cool down .
0	an hour later they came in still cooling it off .
0	i refused and just powered through the pain of putting in the bridgework .
0	are you kidding me ?
0	i was there for a little over three and half hours .
0	this seems a bit excessive to me .
0	the absolute worst massage ever ! ! ! !
0	after our massage , the people demanded more tips ! ! !
0	ive never been to any massage place that does that !
0	do n't go here , its a rip off ! ! ! !
0	it 's terrible ive never been to any massage place that does that !
0	do n't go here , its a rip off ! ! ! !
0	it 's terrible ive never been to any massage place that does that !
0	do n't go here , its a rip off ! ! ! !
0	the worst urgent care office i have ever visited .
0	all of the employees are curt , rude , and uncaring .
0	they disregarded all of my concerns and are blatantly unprofessional .
0	there 's a reason this place is so cheap and always has openings .
0	i walked out without getting a massage .
0	big may be a big outfit but not better .
0	do n't go to jeffrey russ gunter at this office .
0	i went there and it was a horrible visit i will never go back .
0	he walked out so quickly that i did n't have time to stop him .
0	she looked as shocked as i did !
0	he looked at my face , zapped a couple places and left .
0	not sure she was even licensed to do that .
0	everyone should stay away from him .
0	i 'm no nail expert so i just went with it .
0	however as time went on i became more and more disappointed .
0	at one point she asked me `` is this wedding fancy ? ''
0	so i just cut my losses and went home .
0	i arrived here in agony , which just progressed into terrible agony !
0	they let me sit in agony for hours ! !
0	then walked away & left me crying for another two hours !
0	did they offer me the tylenol !
0	i take 60 mil morphine almost daily for severe back/leg pain .
0	when nurse failed yet again ( causing more pain ! )
0	and punch her badly ! !
0	after i begged i finally got some relief .
0	noise , bright lights every thing !
0	no rest at all !
0	hopefully i 'll get a room at some point tonight !
0	so i can get some actual rest .
0	it 's just a waiting game now ... to keep you posted .
0	they do not bother to call and tell you .
0	when you go into the store they treat you without regard or respect .
0	i hope they go out of business !
0	unfortunately the overall spa experience has gone downhill .
0	there were a few highlights , but overall the experience was disappointing .
0	we were overcharged a little bit for the treatments .
0	no one was around to ask .
0	it seems like there could be a sheet with pictures or a description .
0	we also had the hammam ritual treatment .
0	definitely not the same experience .
0	since we were on vacation to spend time together , i was pretty disappointed .
0	she did make it halfway through before having to go to her massage .
0	dr. westfield should be ashamed of himself .
0	co. lasted about 2 minutes .
0	but what a waste of my time and obviously yees time
0	i had a very terrible experience here .
0	i arrived the required 30mins early for my appointment .
0	after 15mins of waiting i checked with the other woman at reception for paperwork .
0	when called back the medical assistant was friendly and kind .
0	she was the best part of the place .
0	i saw the np .
0	there were no apologies or explanation as to why the assistant was even present .
0	this is the short version of my experience .
0	i will not be back .
0	do not go to them ! ! !
0	they charged me $ 2000 out of pocket for my surgery !
0	i work and go to school full-time .
0	my sinus have n't improved and i ca n't tell a difference !
0	would never go back .
0	i 've been ignored for almost a week .
0	i 've left too many messages to count .
0	no one has responded to any phone calls i 've been making .
0	that 's not right .
0	wholefoods is already overpriced and making the dish smaller too is not helping .
0	i used to have the dish for lunch and dinner on occasion .
0	now i refuse to pay the same price for 1/2 the product .
0	i saw lori hardacker .
0	they will not perform a wellness exam without first seeing something requiring a diagnostic .
0	this was the first red flag .
0	the entry is not welcoming at all .
0	it was crowded due to obvious overbooking .
0	her examination made me feel uncomfortable as she was clearly uncomfortable seeing a male .
0	i was then sent across the street for a blood test in another building .
0	all i wanted was a physical and to establish a primary care physician .
0	makes it very difficult to relax .
0	it was a horrible , horrible experience .
0	i could not believe it .
0	not good , especially when their were plenty of seats available .
0	what 's with that ?
0	2. the prices are not reasonable .
0	e.g : the salmon salad .
0	depending on the time of day , expect long delays .
0	overall , the food is n't bad , but the service is horrible .
0	with a few adjustments , i 'm hoping fresh can recover .
0	this place does n't even deserve a start .
0	i do n't recommend this place at all they are horrible .
0	this is the last time i go there !
0	what kind of dr. does this ?
0	( both her babies were in the low 7 lbs ) .
0	she was embarrassed and wanted to cry .
0	the dr. further stated she did n't need to have any more kids .
0	dr. kristin livingston 's , manner was very hurtful and demeaning .
0	my daughter will never go back there again !
0	i will copy my original review below , then add an update .
0	`` i followed my doctor to this office when he relocated .
0	the doctors and nurses are great , but the office support staff needs work .
0	except it 's not true .
0	healthcare in southern nevada is bad , but these clowns make it worse .
0	i will not suffer or waste any more with nevada orthopedic & spine center .
0	i saw doctor lee who sent me for an ultrasound and discovered a polyp .
0	we did surgery to remove it .
0	however , this did not help with my other symptoms .
0	he ran a thyroid t3 and t4 .
0	got an abnormal result but the retest was fine .
0	a goiter with 6 nodules , one as big as a golfball .
0	now i wait the result of my fna .
0	something like that does n't grow overnight .
0	not having my hearing aids has a very negative impact on my daily activities .
0	they are extremely slow in returning to emails and/or phone calls .
0	often two or more weeks .
0	their response is that they do not have enough employees .
0	this should not be the consumers problem .
0	do not waste $ 4,000+ on zounds hearing aids !
0	instead driver leaves with no attempt to contact .
0	absolute incompetence , pizza hut must not be hiring drivers .
0	i went to matthew serrick in pretty good condition .
0	i just had one ongoing issue that needed to be resolved .
0	after my adjustment my back was hurt .
0	he 's more concerned about his practice rather than his patients .
0	i ended up with more problems than i came in with .
0	i bought a groupon for a 90 minute foot reflexology massage .
0	there was only one person working there fri. night .
0	she new so little english i could n't communicate with her .
0	she finished the last few minutes with hot stones .
0	an excessive amount of oil was dumped continuously over my back .
0	i said fine , just keep the whole $ 20 .
0	crime is a problem !
0	my babysitter had her car broken into in the dowd parking lot as well .
0	both of these events took place within the last 2 months .
0	you eventually become a `` number '' to them and not a human patient .
0	i will never use the services at that facility again .
0	beware and stay away ! ! ! !
0	i have been going to forte family practice for a few years now .
0	i have had no bad experiences until today .
0	they often have long wait times but that 's expected .
0	he diagnosed me with bronchitis a couple days ago .
0	so i came back today .
0	he did not listen to anything i had to say .
0	argued with me about the fever .
0	i also asked for a dr note extending my time off from work .
0	he left the room but left the door open .
0	i could hear him outside the room talking unfavorably about me .
0	then gave me a note saying i could return to work tomorrow .
0	i tried to explain i needed more time .
0	he did not care and refused to extend my note .
0	he is a professional while still being approachable and open to the patient .
0	i would recommend dr jeppesen to anyone with foot or ankle issues !
0	his entire dress speaks arrogance right down to no socks with his shoes ?
0	please , that went out with miami vice .
0	the man had me dismissed a few moments after he walked into the room .
0	i was angry and upset because no patient should be treated like i was !
0	it was a very short meeting that i had the pleasure ?
0	of paying for what ? ? ?
0	i could not believe the treatment i received at the core by this person !
0	i will certainly not go back to see this person .
0	hard to title him as a doctor !
0	i also got my shoes stolen from the jacuzzi .
0	i would n't recommend it or go back based on this experience .
0	by far the worst doctor office i have ever encountered .
0	the only good part about that office is the doctor dr. garcia .
0	i will never go back there ever .
0	their scam artist who bill you for things that you do n't even own .
0	they make you wait 2 to 3 hours before you even see anyone .
0	heed my warning never go there they are awful .
0	i wo n't return and will find another psychiatrist to prescribe meds .
0	so unnecessary- just nasty .
0	let me start by saying that i really like dr. garcia .
0	there is almost zero communication .
0	what does she do ?
0	while there , i called my insurance company twice to confirm this fact .
0	three times i insisted my insurance be verified through my carrier .
0	she must of known she was full of it .
0	ps ... they scammed my daughter about a year ago .
0	do n't bother with an apology .
0	excuses mean nothing when it 's obviously not a true concern .
0	fix the core problem so fake apologies are not necessary .
0	coming into the clinic was not very welcoming .
0	the ladies did not look happy and were n't very helpful .
0	i waited about 2 1/2 hrs until i was called in .
0	i waited for about 30mins until i was called back in .
0	another 30min had past and she still had not return .
0	i never saw the doctor after that .
0	i would not return to this place !
0	if it were possible to give no stars i would ! ! !
0	they have the same staff that just rotate between the two offices .
0	after dr yee prescribe me a 3rd antibiotic , my condition worsened .
0	he is short answered , indignant and seemingly complacent about his work .
0	he is not the dr. to go to if you want answers .
0	do n't go to westfield eye center unless you want to go blind ! !
0	by far one of the worst clinic 's to go too !
0	like other reviews about this clinic .
0	the wait time is way to long !
0	waiting for 5 hours is unacceptable !
0	the staff is another issue .
0	most are spanish speaking and are rude .
0	for urgent care i keep my expectations low .
0	came here because it is very close to my job .
0	i was able to be seen quickly , i only waited about 15 minutes .
0	that made me a bit uncomfortable .
0	they need to put the care back in healthcare .
0	went in to get eye exam .
0	rushed me , and tried to pressure me with upsell .
0	she suggested i just use my current glasses until after i get surgery .
0	asked girl upfront if she could straighten glasses .
0	same girl that rushed me .
0	she grabbed the glasses , rushed again and was rough where she broke them .
0	i need the glasses .
0	i told her that they should pay for breaking my glasses .
0	they referred me to an eyeglass place .
0	it seems that they just want to get you in and out and upsell .
0	no customer service skills .
0	the absolute worst hospital experience ever !
0	unacceptable when you are screaming in pain ! ! ! !
0	who do they think they are ? ? ? ?
0	we called security and now there is an investigation going on .
0	pathetic excuse for a hospital ! ! !
0	on top of all this , the place is dirty .
0	the floors had the same dirty spots on it day in and day out .
0	in one room we noticed there was a red pill on the floor .
0	never , ever will we return to this place !
0	what 's ironic is that they offer an ethics class .
0	that would be like john wayne gacy running a pre-school .
0	it 's time to look for a new urgent care for my family .
0	the messages were great .
0	professionalism was just not good at all .
0	the lady messaging my boyfriend phone rang 5 times during our session in messaging .
0	cutting me short on time , as we `` finished '' both on time .
0	my boyfriend ended up getting them anyway as they did n't ask me .
0	if you are coming here for the experience i totally do not recommend it .
0	i 'm so very disappointed .
0	i 'm beyond disappointed 2 chances to wow me .
0	two total flops i 'm done
0	if i could give them zero stars i would .
0	never again will our family be coming here .
0	my advice to them is to overhaul their staff .
0	you need people who care in there .
0	att : parent 's do not bring your kids here terrible customer services .
0	am not bringing my children 's back to this place ever again .
0	however , the last few times have not been so terrific .
0	back in june , i brought my cat in for coughing .
0	i was seen fairly quickly but the whole check out process took forever .
0	i said to her `` you know my cat is sick , right ? ''
0	and she said that she thought the kitten had an uri too .
0	then my blood started to boil , how is that better ? !
0	do i think they meant to do harm ?
0	no , but they were extremely negligent with the life of my cat .
0	the best thing about fresh is definitely the location .
0	center if you 're a student without a car ) .
0	the food is very pricey and the selection is awful .
0	i almost never find what i 'm looking for .
0	will never go to this fast med again .
0	do not recommend her .
0	i do n't trust her medical opinion after everything i went through .
0	what was i paying them for ? ? ?
0	i think jude wants doulas so she does n't have to work very hard .
0	do not listen to her advice or recommendations !
0	at the end you seemed more concern .
0	i did contact you personally and told you how i felt and no response .
0	i 've never used vials so why was i given that ?
0	just the other day i was in the drive thru and was asking questions .
0	they told me there was a line and i was taking too long .
0	how rude is that ?
0	i was really impressed with the office staff while making my appointment .
0	the man barely spoke ten words to me .
0	i was to use soap and water .
0	they would send the results to my primary care in a few weeks .
0	his bedside manner really lacks on all points .
0	i will not go back , nor will my two friends .
0	i was very disappointed in the whole visit .
0	thank you for ruining a shirt , and thank you for wasting my time .
0	my pharmacy reported that they called 3 times with no response .
0	i am looking for a new doctor .
0	the office staff seems unprofessional and uncaring .
0	i should have changed doctors last year .
0	he stated `` nothing wrong with her , use eye drops ! ''
0	my mother fell , hit her eye on a table ! !
0	she is having pain , and it 's terribly red .
0	urgent care billing as er visits .
0	be careful when come here .
0	the female owner is not honest .
0	we turned off our phone but none of the workers did .
0	the two females constantly talking to each other while massaging .
0	i wo n't recommend coming here .
0	i find when i 'm insulted it makes the customer experience tainted .
0	if i could give 0 stars i would .
0	***but only after this email ! ! ! ! ! !
0	i though i was being fair .
0	sorry i did n't give you raving reviews .
0	but a three star is still good .
0	the only thing i did not like was the lack of privacy .
0	another customer ) may not accidentally walk into the room you are in !
0	i have actually referred people to your location .
0	i will do so no longer , sam .
0	you do know that most places do have doors right ?
0	not necessarily `` those '' types of places .
0	even lower scale places such as massage envy have them .
0	**folks : take note .
0	i was liberal and forthcoming .
0	as a non asian , it can be uncomfortable for some .
0	do not come here .
0	the management is insulting .
0	i did n't want to believe it .
0	in fact , i thought every other review was nit picking .
0	i was wrong ! ! ! !
0	his reply is worth reading .
0	this is not from me , but from the owner himself .
0	sam , you 'll never see green from me or anyone i know again .
0	unprofessional reception/front office staff .
0	it has that dirty grubby clinic vibe and the staff look pretty rough too .
0	the med care ... is ... horrible care .
0	the dr. misdiagnosed my 15mo .
0	old baby twice rsv , croup , whooping cough and pneumonia ah !
0	also , watch out for nurse nicole .
0	breastfeeding , sleep , etc . )
0	it 's like you are invisible .
0	entire rack right beside register marked with orange clearance tags .
0	you would think at least products near register would ring up correctly .
0	wait for pics then wait for refund .
0	i had been going to fresh since 1999 , when nothing similar existed .
0	also dr. requested prior copies of colonoscopies .
0	gave up after 2 weeks of unreturned phone calls .
0	never respond ! ! ! !
0	would not recommend this office .
0	hours are not conducive for the working class .
0	this medical group is a mess !
0	telephone system is horrible to reach actual human .
0	frequently get stuck in phone tree , voice mailboxes full or calls not returned .
0	i am so disgusted !
0	this doctor in cvs was amazing .
0	i 'm done with this .
0	all this place wants is your money .
0	avoid this dr and her practice .
0	you will be very disappointed and will end up paying more than needed .
0	seriously ... .anyone sharing a good experience is probably a friend of theirs .
0	this office does not care about helping people and are not experienced !
0	my boyfriend planned for a romantic couples massage for my birthday last saturday .
0	the day started off very rushed .
0	it made for a very uncomfortable experience .
0	upon arrival we found that there were no chairs available for us to enjoy .
0	they have certainly gone down hill .
0	what else can i say .
0	i set up an appt to get a nerve test done of my arms/legs .
0	and he said `` oh , you are having issues with your legs too ?
0	well we can make another appt for that '' .
0	we had , and it was supposed to all be done that day .
0	his office was unprofessional and disorganized .
0	i had vaginal bleeding for 8 months .
0	at my appointment , a pap smear and annual examination was done .
0	i told them i have a family history of estrogen induced breast cancer .
0	by the way , i 'm 36 , with no prior history or births .
0	at this point , my mother insisted i get a second opinion .
0	thank god for second opinions !
0	the staff is awful , does not communicate , and has no customer service .
0	they do not care about patients and just money .
0	no continuity of care here .
0	thanks a lot medisys .
0	what a waste of time and money ! !
0	if i could give a zero or even minus star i would .
0	upset and anger is all i got out of this visit !
0	apparently this is not an uncommon complaint which is really sad .
0	last chance they 'll get .
0	i 'm driving around the shopping center and ca n't find it !
0	i also feel bad for the therapist who lost the appt .
0	she was doing well for about four weeks and then it went downhill .
0	her cancer had spread and they were not upfront about that .
0	well that is just what happened .
0	my poor mother ended up having a bleeding ulcer on top of pancreatic cancer .
0	that was the straw that broke the camels back .
0	i realize that her chances of surviving with pancreatic cancer were slim .
0	shame on them ! !
0	still sore after two days .
0	if medium is going to leave one sore , that should be made clear .
0	dr. timothy came in with a `` why are you here '' attitude .
0	interrupted me when i was talking , talked down to me .
0	she said that this is what the dr ordered .
0	never coming back here and never recommending this place to anyone .
0	absolutely worst experience ever !
0	so many issues but space is limited .
0	after xrays she went over proposal .
0	in patient column was $ 400 .
0	she explained `` medicaid makes crappy/poor quality dentures . '
0	went in to try on prototypes for uppers only .
0	to my complete shock , no teeth showed !
0	went back to try on 2nd prototypes .
0	same thing , no teeth showed .
0	i 'm far from there !
0	again , i left disappointed .
0	no appointment was made as karen said the holidays were too near .
0	it scared me to death !
0	proposal shows 5 extractions needed , but at new dentist , only 4 showed .
0	the new dental office can do it all within a week .
0	i 've been there & have seen their work .
0	karen said she would talk to carol-ann .
0	never received a response , thus , a week later i call back .
0	karen said she had told carol-ann , but has not received an answer .
0	this time i had lumps on my throat .
0	their sitting on their butts while i 'm going thru dangerous mouth infections .
0	carol-ann came on phone saying they do n't resort to blackmail .
0	there is so much more that could be said .
0	apparently an appointment time is of no relevance .
0	made appt for 7:30 and lobby was full of about 20 plus people .
0	will be going elsewhere ... .
0	dr wang is really nice and listens .
0	it 's a shame that the front office receptionists are so awful .
0	absolutely zero customer service skills .
0	any questions you have you are treated like you are bothering them .
0	it 's so bad that i am switching doctors .
0	the staff was friendly , great doctor .
0	they did n't do much , regular check up .
0	i am used to paying $ 40 .
0	and they do n't tell u that in advance .
0	will never go back ...
0	this is the worst place to ever get a massage .
0	save your money and time .
0	my husband was in a car accident and i asked to reschedule .
0	this is the worst place .
0	i 'm far from relaxed .
0	offices like this are the reason our insurance rates are outrageous ! !
0	stay clear of money hungry warner family practice !
0	the doctor was great , the office operation is a nightmare .
0	never mind the endless frustration they 've caused me , they hurt my son .
0	the doctor prescribed a medication that required pre authorization for our insurance .
0	this usually takes a day or two anywhere else .
0	after weeks of leaving messages and even speaking to her nurse , no action .
0	my 4 mo old son 's pain got so bad he stopped eating .
0	three weeks of suffering and irreversible damage to my newborn son .
0	but there 's more !
0	we very painfully fasted my baby prior to the appointment per their instructions .
0	they had no record of his appointment .
0	needless to say we wo n't be back .
0	they do not prescribe pain meds as a rule .
0	went to the pecos office and they said i was n't scheduled .
0	the quality of customer service has gone down hill .
0	the only great staff they have is joshua and darryl .
0	i hope they get it together before they lose another patient .
0	i have been coming here off and on for eleven years .
0	did the med asst lie to me ?
0	kinda seems that way .
0	i 'll update my review if i ever get this pre auth approved .
0	after doing some research and having a consultation , i settled on laseraway .
0	yes , almost two months after my first appointment .
0	without much choice , i made the appointment switch .
0	basically , the answer was sorry , but yes .
0	after that exchange , i no longer even trust the place .
0	i will never go to laseraway again ... for anything .
0	this place has been my pc office for over 10 years .
0	definitely found a different place .
0	the bad : where to begin ?
0	the front staff was confused and flustered that everyone was getting impatient and leaving .
0	it 's the norm .
0	most walmarts are at least decent .
0	first off , no wood forest .
0	they have us bank .
0	okay ... so walk to the back to grab a snack .
0	found my drink , and saw a food snack .
0	okay , i 'm an adult , i can go to a price checker .
0	does north olmsted have a price checker theft issue ?
0	walk up front , to a speedy .
0	few registers open , but a short line for saturday morning .
0	cashier was courteous , but became too friendly .
0	so , i 'm almost out !
0	use the restroom , and both stalls are down .
0	my bigger complaint is the packaging taped to the door with packing tape .
0	really ... so wash my hands .
0	four sinks , one soap dispenser all the way to the left .
0	okay ... so no paper towels in the left dispenser .
0	then none in the right ... great .
0	it 's 39° out , so asked an associate for some .
0	bare essentials are there , but disappointing .
0	this place will try and cheat you !
0	do not support their shady business practices !
0	third flag - complete lack of medical supplies such as alcohol wipes .
0	glad we do not have to deal with them anymore .
0	do n't waste your time here .
0	and then melissa to try and blame her mistakes on you .
0	looks like you are unless you just keep your doors unlocked 24/7 .
0	today may my least favorite 4th of july ever .
0	i can not stand that places like this prey on the misfortunes of people .
0	not funny and you defently are n't an actor either .
0	i went to see dr. romo .
0	a week later she still had n't called .
0	this was n't the first time i experienced this with dr. romo .
0	and when i was charged she said she would try to help fix it .
0	could n't she have told me that 3 months ago ?
0	if she could n't help she should n't have said that she could .
0	did she even try ?
0	i have no idea , but i know i wo n't be going back .
0	i felt like they did n't care , i was n't their priority .
0	the ladies at the help desk were quite standoffish .
0	would n't recommend it .
0	i paid over $ 80 for the visit while in person .
0	nearly $ 300 for one visit ? ! ?
0	how can she feel comfortable with this way of making a living ?
0	i got pain relief , support and validation .
0	i would advise any pregnant woman to stay away from dr. kuty .
0	hours said open at 10am .
0	when i arrived , doors locked !
0	a hand written loose leaf paper says `` closed for now !
0	re-opening soon '' this was 10:50am !
0	i waited 20min ... no movement .
0	still closed at 11:10am .
0	this is the first time i have been disappointed in canna .
0	let 's hope this does n't continue .
0	extremely unprofessional front desk staff !
0	if i did n't already pay my copay , i would have walked out .
0	i came back today because another doctor said this other doctor is highly recommended .
0	if you 're rich .
0	he wo n't make it cheap ... and will make it sound dire .
0	it was the care that almost killed her .
0	did i add it was friday and pouring rain .
0	this was a new injury and they were going to kick her out .
0	only by screaming did she get admitted .
0	what followed was not .
0	which she did all over the place .
0	if that were it i could have not written this .
0	what followed almost killed her .
0	for the next 3 days they gave her that laxative 3 x a day .
0	bullying her like a middle schooler .
0	i had clearly told them there was nothing wrong with her mental faculties .
0	in addition my mom needs nitro as needed if she gets heart pain .
0	she is supposed to take it immediately .
0	i would never want to be alone in either place without an advocate .
0	i think the doctors are good .
0	just the all the rest .
0	i went in with a rash on my hand .
0	i normally have a great experience at other quest locations .
0	this location needs to get their act together .
0	i hate this place .
0	i go here as little as possible nowadays .
0	now if only i could convert my husband .
0	for instance , i have a huge craving for homemade spaghetti and meatballs today .
0	so i guess i 'm going by here today , dammit to hell .
0	it 's really delicious , or it used to be .
0	i have n't had it in awhile .
0	of course , all overpriced .
0	but i guess i 'm going to be a hypocritical asshole and go anyhow .
0	i 'm so ashamed .
0	very unfortunate professional for a management position if that .
0	at least have some respect and customer service mentallity .
0	very unfortunate organized and confused at their own job !
0	do not waste your time here
0	this was my first visit to this location .
0	the facility is excellent very clean and very welcoming .
0	the nurse was very helpful .
0	we were the only ones there .
0	the doctor sat on his lazy ass for over 30 minutes before seeing us .
0	sure , ahn facilities are clean but their billing is dirty .
0	i hate upmc but they bill your carrier once .
0	way to gouge the customer .
0	time to set sail captain tony !
0	wait times are incredibly long .
0	you 're easily looking at an hour or more with an appointment .
0	we 'll probably be switching pedatricians soon .
0	and while dr. kahane may be curt , the office staff is downright rude .
0	in my experience , they just do n't answer for the most part .
0	i waited a few days to hear back , and then called them again .
0	another week goes by , and finally jennifer calls me out of the blue .
0	i got everything else in the mail , mind you .
0	it 's more likely a clerical error on their part .
0	what does that even mean ?
0	why would n't they call ?
0	i called them again ( three times ) and they never returned my messages .
0	the fourth time , they picked up and hung up .
0	all in all , a wholly dissatisfying experience .
0	would not recommend this dentist to others !
0	so far so good .
0	of course it was after 5 pm when i received the message .
0	they were able to fit me in at 1:30 pm .
0	that all took about an hour .
0	( it had been over a year since my last cleaning ) .
0	i chose this dentist based on their location and the reviews on yelp .
0	i still love dr jianu , but someone in her office has issues .
0	i really loved this dr .
0	we were so glad .
0	please , save yourselves .
0	we feel lucky for the warning .
0	i used medshape a few years ago .
0	fast forward to now .
0	well , i 'd paid for it so i 'll finish the 4 weeks .
0	today i had a noon appointment .
0	when i showed up , they had probably 10 people waiting .
0	they 're overbooking appointments and then patients have to wait .
0	i do not recall that issue from my first try with medshape .
0	gaining the weight back was my fault entirely .
0	the staff is friendly and they try to be helpful .
0	otherwise , why bother to schedule appointments at all .
0	overall , lack of patient care !
0	the operation at body by kotoske is a complete joke .
0	the week postoperative appointment was also a nightmare .
0	i would never recommend anyone waste their money here .
0	the staff did n't know my insurance after being there three times .
0	the staff was also rude and insufficient .
0	the only person there that was customer friendly was jennifer
0	they are free of fault from any actions .
0	and they get snippy if you ask them to explain the form .
0	also paid $ 10 up-charge for what amounted to 2 minutes of hot stone massage
0	i made the mistake of coming here again really only out of being desperate .
0	it 's ridiculous ! ! ! !
0	they have no consideration of your time .
0	i can see why they are rated as they are .
0	i told them this but they insisted on doing the exam anyway .
0	and not to worry .
0	i sent the prescription that they gave me in , and had glasses made .
0	mind you i paid xx the first time .
0	they have a new type machine that reads it instantaneously .
0	i then asked them what the relevance was , getting no reasonable answer .
0	only that she would take it up with administration .
0	i got the impression that she was highly intimidated by them .
0	but you can rest assured , i will not let this happen again .
0	they are obviously more concerned about money than doing the right thing .
0	really how long does it take to swipe a credit card !
0	the pharmacy seems disorganized .
0	retail clerks are nearly nonexistent .
0	in general i like cvs , but this store is terrible .
0	i 'll be moving my prescriptions somewhere else as soon as i can .
0	an infection which was diagnosed in the emergency room .
0	i received 1 bag of antibiotics .
0	which i knew was a straight up lie .
0	that doctor discontinued my treatment .
0	now my doctor had to put me back on antibiotics .
0	worst experience i 've ever had with an optometrist .
0	administer an eye drop then wait another twenty five minutes .
0	wo n't be back .
0	best part , my kid does n't even need glasses .
0	she was quick , however , still time taken away from the massage .
0	rather a continual rubbing of scrub and lotion .
0	since the sign stated gratuity appreciated , it was clearly not a mandatory fee !
0	had i seen the sign i would have said something .
0	at that point i was done and knew that i would not be back .
0	discussing patient details without regard for who is around .
0	misrepresentation of clinical staff .
0	there are plenty of better options in the area
0	i would n't have given this place any stars !
0	well this is why .
0	do n't waste your time .
0	then after all that , the doctor wants to start from square one ? !
0	never ever go there .
0	completely rude and selfish staff and doctors .
0	we have been coming here for more than 2 years .
0	extremely disappointed in the customer service aspect of this business .
0	their recording advised my call would be returned within 1 hour .
0	it was not returned for 2 days .
0	any misunderstanding needs to be recognized and taken responsibility for by the representatives .
0	if you are going to be in partnership , you must work together .
0	it was not about the insurance- it was how i was treated .
0	very rude and condescending .
0	do not go to this clinic .
0	two doctors are very rude .
0	they spoke to me as if my questions were ridiculous to ask .
0	i was in the emergency room on monday night for 22hours before being admitted .
0	she was also busy and she complained to me very loudly about that .
0	my care shouldnt be compromised because they are busy .
0	the whole experience was terrible .
0	once i got to my room the difference in care was amazing .
0	the people working on the floor are so nice , friendly , and sympathetic .
0	the difference is night and day !
0	unfortunately , i have been to this e/r many times .
0	the thought of ever having to go back to this e/r worries me .
0	she also got solution in my left eye which stung very badly .
0	she mentioned she was unaware the chemical peel had a shelf life .
0	i left feeling uneasy and disappointed at spending over $ 100 .
0	the rest of my face is exactly how it is any other day .
0	there is no tightness or redness or flaking .
0	i picked this place based off of the reviews i found on yelp .
0	that 's not very authentic .
0	had a multitude of sub-par experiences here .
0	there are a lot of eye doctors to choose from in las vegas .
0	i 'll never go to this one again .
0	do yourself a favor and do the same .
0	all i can say is , ow .
0	these people do not study anatomy .
0	the woman was literally pressing her elbow into my spine for ten minutes .
0	( probably should n't have scheduled appointment the monday after a holiday weekend . )
0	avoid this hospital at all cost !
0	it 's almost like rating a restaurant just because it has food !
0	many of the halls are dimly lit compared to other toronto hospitals .
0	the hospital also does not have dedicated parking .
0	worst experience i ever ever ever had in my life .
0	this process took literally one year .
0	this office is very unorganized and very un-professional .
0	be wary of this place .
0	the dentist is awesome , but it ends there .
0	i had partials made .
0	the partials do not fit .
0	it is the middle of february and i am still waiting for their call .
0	at 3:05 i gave up and left .
0	until coming to fdgv i had always seen an md .
0	clearly that is not the case .
0	i 'm in the market for another doctor , starting now .
0	never trust this place ! ! !
0	tried to contact them through email and phone !
0	i really hate this experience ! !
0	my wonderful rn could not say enough good things about dr. crum .
0	i can not speak about any experience regarding paradise valley ob/gyn medial staff .
0	if there is such a thing as karma , it will be well served .
0	i can not comment on the medical staff as i never saw them .
0	do n't expect quality service .
0	i would give -4 stars if possible .
0	my advise is to stay well !
0	my experience was awful .
0	the staff is unpleasant and unprofessional .
0	made an appointment but they did n't know what i was in for .
0	4 hours for 2 fillers !
0	only one doctor that shuffles from room to room .
0	this place is a total joke .
0	if i could give it 0 stars i would have .
0	they have no respect for others time !
0	i will drive across town to avoid this place next time !
0	dr marcelo is kind and soft natured but often uninformative .
0	dr pham is more firm and comes off abrupt but is definitely well educated .
0	what ? ! ? !
0	no coo 's or giggles .
0	not interested in playing just sleepy and lifeless .
0	not to mention , still congested and coughing badly !
0	we are now dealing with this for almost 2 months .
0	i just do n't feel heard or well taken care of .
0	i immediately became frustrated at her tone .
0	there was no explanation or apology for me being told the wrong information .
0	i said , `` honey ?
0	did you just call me honey ? ''
0	and she said , `` yep , i sure did . ''
0	i said `` no , not you , but the practice .
0	plus i was overcharged at that .
0	she had me so flustered and in awe at her audacity .
0	she acted like a child .
0	not a representative i would want for my practice .
0	i have never been treated like this by a service provider .
0	this could have been avoided if they used standard billing practice .
0	they do n't bill , they want payment upfront even with insurance .
0	but they did not .
0	you do n't deserve to be working with the public .
0	wish i could get my money back , left worse than i went in .
0	tried 2nd time and left without any relief .
0	purchased a month of visits .
0	i have taken anxiety medication for almost 20 years .
0	however , it was only for 3 months .
0	she said `` sorry , nothing i can do '' .
0	now mind you , i am having an anxiety attack and am very upset .
0	she freaking hung up on me !
0	and did anyone call me back ?
0	i will spread the word to anyone who will listen .
0	do not go to phoenix medical group ! !
0	most unprofessional medical organization i have ever dealt with .
0	most tend to be a bit cold and rude .
0	after today 's visit i will definitely not be coming back .
0	completely unprofessional and gross .
0	updating my last review .
0	finally got to speak to someone in dr bradford group .
0	this store carries a good selection of frames .
0	that after two weeks of getting things fixed i decided against going back .
0	i wish i could personally suspend her medical license .
0	dr. , heal thy self !
0	waited 2 hours while dr. was running late in office .
0	needed path report on colonoscopy .
0	waited another 1/2 hour for them to locate it from surgery center .
0	bad news ... do not book with this office .
0	there were 30 people in the waiting area as i left .
0	they were waiting on appointments .
0	under staffed with very rude , inefficient people .
0	this place is horrible at appointment times .
0	i asked why and he replied you 'll need to fill out paperwork .
0	first : my son had an object lodged in his ear .
0	my son was in intense pain .
0	i stopped the efforts and went to our ent .
0	second : the nursing staff and doctors are all over worked and it shows .
0	their bedside manor tends to be terse and they seem impatient .
0	fifth : they never answer the phone ! !
0	folks this place is a factory .
0	then advertise your open till 7 o'clock and at 20 after six are closed .
0	do n't go there for a flu shot .
0	slow and incompetent staff .
0	left without getting a flu shot .
0	summary : sought help and then made to feel like a criminal .
0	first - like others this place was horrible on setting appointments .
0	are you kidding me ?
0	not that should really matter .
0	talk about a feeling of betrayal when you should be trusting someone .
0	what a horrible feeling !
0	i own my home , car , and practically am almost retired !
0	i am not selling these stupid medications ... who does this ?
0	so let me summarize ... redemption psychiatry first priority is protecting themselves !
0	i will take my business elsewhere !
0	if anything , i should demand a drug test from everyone there .
0	one of the worst pedicurist ive ever encountered .
0	i was one more poke in my cuticle to walking out .
0	i had to ask her more than three times to be gentle .
0	but boy was this horrible .
0	she left my left toe burning at the cuticle .
0	and he damn response was `` oh you 're sensitive huh ? ''
0	like no mam , be more gentle .
0	im never coming back .
0	the one star goes out to the guy who greeted us at the desk .
0	i 'm so confused .
0	is this how y'all really do it out here in vegas ?
0	the money gouging started before i received any services .
0	the employees are impersonal and could care less .
0	i received a free facial certificate and 125.00 gift card for mothers day .
0	i made the appt .
0	so i was charged 55.00 for the missed appt/free facial .
0	because i had now paid for the not so free facial .
0	i did n't receive a reminder call/text for either appt .
0	they stated they could n't get a hold of me .
0	instead of charging someone for a `` gift '' they have received .
0	short version : keep track of your sessions !
0	after my last review i was given two free sessions to fix my hairline .
0	i went in the for my appointment and the tech asked the usual questions .
0	the tech told me it needed to be longer more like 10 days .
0	so i wasted my gas and time .
0	i stopped the retin a all together just to be safe .
0	that was around the time i wrote my last review .
0	i have not received a call .
0	do not ever go to this place .
0	these people just want to make money.they do not care about their patients .
0	all they want to do is make money .
0	they suck ! ! !
0	they do n't care about their patients .
0	their ma staff is trashy and unprofessional .
0	they have no heart .
0	eff you cardiovascular consultants .
0	my experience unfortunately was not good .
0	i am writing this review as a word of caution .
0	this took almost 2 months .
0	no one even checked in on me until my hubby had to say something .
0	nine patients checked in after me and were seen within 15 min .
0	it seems that everything to be done is a big deal .
0	my mom , who 's a nurse ( !
0	i 'll admit , he was better , but not by much .
0	did she ever say why ?
0	it all just seemed very strange and i left feeling unhelped and uncomfortable .
0	so much for a pain `` specialist . ''
0	simple enough i figured .
0	so i 'm guessing it 's broken .
0	meaning , they do n't deal with court mandated assessment .
0	just wasted an hour and now they have all my personal information .
0	the receptionist said she did n't know !
0	there was no hostess and 2 waitresses who just looked at us .
0	our waters never came .
0	once the food came , she never came back to the table .
0	they were out of the gf vegan desert .
0	took forever to get our bill .
0	no one said goodbye to us .
0	it was awkward , too bad bc the food was ok .
0	my experience with their care was fine but their billing is a horrible mess .
0	this has cost me well over $ 1000 out of pocket .
0	i suspect the meat has expired and they change the wrap and label .
0	from then on , i always checked .
0	more of a retail operation than a medical practice .
0	the practice really is about which products and procedures she can sell you .
0	the waiting room reminds one of the cosmetic counters at a retail store .
0	always a bad experience , but never shopping here again .
0	i finally ga e in and bought it and it smelled like rotten eggs .
0	this is definitely the most unprofessional gnc i 've been to .
0	the owner is awesome and do n't worry she will tell you she is .
0	i found a 60 min massage with hot stones on groupon .
0	the worst massage of my life .
0	mind you this was not a deep tissue massage and it hurt .
0	not one part of the massage was soothing or relaxing .
0	and i get massages regularly .
0	i received a gift card as a gift for my birthday .
0	they stated the remaining portion was left as a tip .
0	a $ 38 tip seriously .
0	now they will not do anything about it .
0	this place is a scam .
0	do not waste your time or money
0	but definitly goin to call my insurance to let them know !
0	my one star is for the staff only .
0	i have no problem with either dr pierrend or dr yonan .
0	currently looking for another office to take my dad .
0	dr. gunter is very condescending .
0	i have been to this location several times .
0	never failed i always got super sick on the weekends .
0	my last visit here ended very poorly .
0	i got a pat on the back and nose spray just because .
0	the other 1-star reviews are not exaggerations .
0	i did n't appreciate being treated like a child by the doctor .
0	the doctor did n't even ask if i was okay .
0	he walked in , admonished me , and walked out .
0	their electronic portal is awful , too .
0	( about every other month . )
0	this place consistently makes me feel like a slab of meat .
0	it should not have been such a battle to have their mistake fixed .
0	( but it did get fixed . )
0	advice : do n't go here .
0	today , three months after service , i got another bill for $ 68.00 .
0	you 're kidding me right ?
0	i 'm not paying for their pretty little office in their pretty little building .
0	i was referred to westside at christmas time when my dentist office was closed .
0	i was in terrible pain and needed an emergency root canal .
0	unfortunately , i was wrong .
0	i will never go back here under any circumstance .
0	in addition they are very pushy about purchasing your contacts and glasses through them .
0	literally the slowest and most useless office staff i have ever experienced .
0	dr. singh is not very socialable and has a terrible `` bedside manner '' .
0	he does not show any sense of compassion or personality .
0	both billie baker and marie stephens however ... the pacs ... are amazing .
0	both are friendly , forthright and show concern and care about your health .
0	i will be finding another physican .
0	because of the limited hours baker and stephens work , i have no choice .
0	the operation at body by kotoske is a complete joke .
0	the week postoperative appointment was also a nightmare .
0	i would never recommend anyone waste their money here .
0	his tone and demeanor were unprofessional .
0	the test was completed and he asked her to sit up .
0	the technicians name was jim .
0	i called immediately once i got home to speak with customer service .
0	i spoke with danielle who was very apologetic and stated that she would address .
0	the people that come and see you are sick .
0	they do not deserve to be treated the way my mother was treated .
0	dr villalobos and this dental office the the rudest of all .
0	they only care about upcharging .
0	they will recommend the most expensive route of dental care .
0	she made no attempts to communicate with me..no email or phone calls .
0	i do not recommend this office or dr villalobos to anyone .
0	do n't go to desert dentistry located on chandler rd ! ! !
0	try dr. brown at c r smiles located in glendale .
0	for the two years i 've regularly sang praise about this clinic !
0	her staff , specifically stephanie is beyond slow !
0	such a huge waste of time .
0	i will never return or recommend this clinic again !
0	stay clear especially if you are looking for a kid friendly place .
0	management needs to get the sales clerks all on the same page .
0	my total ... $ 24.90 .
0	what can i buy for 10 motherfuckin cents ? ?
0	not accepting new patients .
0	why is it so hard to find mental health providers in las vegas ?
0	on november of 2014 , i gave him $ 1000.00 .
0	( dean o'connor did not perform this duty as hired . )
0	2. help guide valentyna through therapy to complete a good evaluation .
0	( dean o'connor did not perform this duty as hired . )
0	( dean o'connor did not perform this duty as hired . )
0	note : this was verbal and partly contractiual -not all wrote out .
0	obviously , the issues were already heard and denied .
0	( page3 paragraph 3 ) .
0	dean o'conner did not help guide valentyna through therapy to complete a good evaluation .
0	i chose dr. kovac specifically as a certified practitioner of art .
0	this is the most unprofessional company i have ever worked with .
0	do yourself a favor and stay away from this place .
0	it is horrible ! !
0	giving even one star is hard for me .
0	wish i would have read all these reviews before starting my experience with lifescape .
0	first appointment was to start the skyla birth control .
0	did n't realize as a customer i needed to do her job as well .
0	hoping no one has the same experience !
0	yet not receiving a refund !
0	this place is an absolute joke !
0	they do not assist you with job placement !
0	they do not offer tutoring !
0	we just have n't had a good experience with students from there '' .
0	awesome , right ? !
0	and if anyone is seriously considering becoming a veterinary assistant- do n't !
0	you are better off becoming a vet tech or an actual veterinarian .
0	i come here because they have my medical records .
0	i 'll wear it .
0	but this place is as bad as it gets .
0	i 've talked to a number of doctors and this is n't standard practice .
0	i would n't recommend this place to my worst enemy .
0	thanks for stringing me along another week guys !
0	guess it 's really time for a new office now .
0	i leave to go to college in salt lake tomorrow .
0	dr. yee 's mistake needs to be out there for future patients to know !
0	you sir should be a shamed of yourself .
0	the procedure was done quickly and he was done within 10-15 min .
0	we were told `` it 's a very simple procedure '' .
0	operator said he 'd have the doc call .
0	so we continued driving .
0	the nurses put pressure on his eye for 5 hours !
0	yes 5 hours ad having blood & blood clots pour out of his eyelid .
0	was treating my mother to a spa day .
0	# 1 : woman checking us in was very curt .
0	had to ask her to slow down .
0	# 3 the place is filthy .
0	good thing the lighting was low !
0	the bathrooms had no toilet paper with empty rolls and toilet paper strewn everywhere .
0	# 8 essentially demand a 20 % tip .
0	oh well , will not be going back .
0	save your money , go somewhere else !
0	they are awful at customer service .
0	this even after 2 long distance phone calls .
0	needless to say , i still do not have the medication .
0	am trying to find a compound pharmacy where i live .
0	shes quite the sales woman .
0	she wrote a few prices which seems sketchy .
0	i felt highly pressured to sign and get the process started .
0	very sad that i wasted so much on this .
0	i could have paid for other bills ! ! !
0	they all seem very nice but their motive is money .
0	though a few nurses are very sweet .
0	that day i was the only poc at the center .
0	i 'm just waiting .
0	i thought that it was normal that perhaps i needed time to heal .
0	hygienist rude and unprofessional !
0	i will not step foot in this office again !
0	this place is sketch .
0	if you need a clinic close to this location try new beginings counseling center .
0	the difference is night and day .
0	they actually care and have real life experience with addiction .
0	not just your 20 year old fresh outta psychology class counselor .
0	they even give free buss passes to those who are in need .
0	i wish i had started at new beginnings .
0	better late than never at least i found them now .
0	eastern ave. # 145 las vegas , nv 89169 ( 702 ) 538-7412 .
0	went into office for cleaning .
0	i have good insurance and they still wanted to charge $ 600 .
0	i 've been an accountant for 28 years they need to hire a knowledgeable .
0	person who can be polite and know simple math .
0	my five year old could do the job better !
0	definitely wo n't be back !
0	they consistently say one thing and then do the opposite !
0	last months delivery was 4 hours late and the man was really rude !
0	made an appointment a month in advance for urgent care .
0	they cancelled less than a week away knowing i am in extreme pain .
0	we had a big group coming in .
0	been going here for a year due to my limited choices through insurance plan .
0	if i had a choice i 'd be gone !
0	if it was n't for her i would not go here .
0	i wish i could compliment this hospital .
0	my mom was in the e.r .
0	and treated by trevelyn on 8/4/2013 around 4am .
0	my mom was very dissatisfied , because no information about her condition was communicated .
0	things just got worse when she was admitted around 3pm .
0	the entire staff lacked any urgency and real competency .
0	they could not answer simple questions or respond quickly .
0	her doctor was dr. achin , her demeanor is very unprofessional and derogatory .
0	after seeing my mom had pancreatitis she put her on a unrestricted diet .
0	you can die from pancreatits and are supposed to fast .
0	but she knew she had early pancreatitis .
0	we waited all night and no test .
0	i left my information with the nurse and was never called with any updates .
0	no updates from the nurse !
0	when i arrived at about 12pm .
0	my mom had just gotten done taking the mrcp .
0	i asked to speak to the charge nurse who was myra and patient advocacy .
0	mrya did not show any concern or care for my mom 's treatment .
0	she could not tell me anything .
0	( when the g.i .
0	she did call dr. achin who could not be reached .
0	is this even legal ? ? ?
0	she said she had no diagnosis and no plan .
0	myra was also present .
0	i asked dr. achin politely if she could slow down and clarify .
0	her english is a little hard to understand due to her accent .
0	i calmly asked her why she was getting an attitude .
0	she yelled and said she was n't .
0	i looked over at myra who rolled her eyes but remained silent .
0	my mom asked dr. achin when she thought she could be released .
0	dr. achin said if you feel better now .
0	dr. achin got even more defensive .
0	dr. achin just left the room .
0	i got my mom to calm down and agree to stay .
0	i said , `` excuse me you are blaming me ? ''
0	i said i wanted to speak to risk management and patient advocacy .
0	she called patient advocacy and got voicemail .
0	she said i could leave and they would call me .
0	i said i would not leave until i spoke to someone .
0	pat , a women volunteer called and got voicemail .
0	i told her i would wait .
0	about 15 minutes later barbara streyle came over .
0	she was very professional and listened to what happened .
0	she immediately knew who dr. achin was and described her beside manner as abrupt .
0	after running another test they still could not find anything other than pancreatits .
0	she was then discharged .
0	great job mountain view !
0	no problem , rescheduled .
0	this place has no regard for their patents time !
0	came in to get contacts & glasses prescription renewed .
0	came in a few days later ... another hour wait time .
0	the oakley glasses i purchased were $ 50 cheaper online .
0	paid the $ 25 for expedited shipping ... 4 days later the glasses arrived .
0	i rarely leave negative reviews , but this place deserves the 1 star rating .
0	if i could rate it 0 stars i would .
0	left on hold for 4 minutes which is considerably long nowadays .
0	that needs to be taken off the website . ''
0	asked for next available appointment , was told 2 weeks out .
0	asked about cancellations and immediately told none available and none for secondary office .
0	was sent here for and xray for my daughter .
0	told xrays are walk-ins .
0	returned the next day around the same time .
0	this time the wait was 30 minutes .
0	checked-in and proceeded to wait .
0	my daughter finally got her xray after waiting for an hour and a half .
0	that was another 20 minutes .
0	this clinic is a sham .
0	i purchased hair laser removal with groupon .
0	i did n't finish my last two treatments , or get a refund !
0	this is terrible service .
0	usually as a new patient they give you paperwork before entering the actual room .
0	so bring a 1rst time patient i arrived to see dr tanarya at 2:30 !
0	she gave me two prescriptions one for back pain and another for muscle relaxer !
0	no one 's answering the phone .
0	miss placed my drivers license and insurance card .
0	well my first impression is my last impression of that place .
0	lol also reported to ama
0	no this is not in regards to hippa .
0	it its in regards to unprofessional rude staffing .
0	hippa had nothing to do with it .
0	all hippa forms were filled out and on file you can check with brandon .
0	worst experience ever on the phone .
0	completely rude and had no care for a potential customer .
0	customer service starts from the very beginning .
0	i 'll drive 100 miles before i ever go to this place
0	in fact there are three of us going to her from the same household .
0	i had to cancel an appointment in february due to illness .
0	but ok i said i will pay it .
0	i 'm calling my insurance company to see exactly what they paid .
0	this place was more than awful .
0	i arrived early for my 2:40 appointment .
0	the woman also included all kinds of unnecessary charges into my price .
0	this was an overall horrible experience .
0	save your time , energy and money .
0	which is a real bummer because this was so convenient for me .
0	they did n't charge me my copay at the door but remembered weeks later .
0	overall , the lack of consistency and good customer service is annoying .
0	lets see , what am i in the mood for tonight ?
0	i think i 'll start with a run .
0	oops , all the treadmills are occupied .
0	no problem , i 'll just do the stair-stepper .
0	alright , hmmm , then i 'll hit some nautilus equipment .
0	ride a bike then ?
0	do sit-ups on the mats ?
0	free weight room literally dangerously crowded .
0	fine , i 'll just swim then .
0	i spoke to the doctor for maybe 2 minutes .
0	so minus another star for inconsistent billing and communication .
0	i 've had problems with ingrown toenails my entire life .
0	i finally decided to go to a podiatrist and see what my options were .
0	my first appointment was with dr. garza and he was amazing ! !
0	my left toe looks perfect .
0	my second appointment was with dr. brewer who was less than stellar .
0	he was very personable , but my toe looks like crap .
0	i was also told it would take a year to grow out .
0	5 stars for dr. garza , but only 1 star for dr. brewer .
0	i was so disappointed in my treatment .
0	complete waste of money .
0	my kids currently go to pediatrix but i am trying to find something different .
0	i think what is killing me is they are trying to automate appointments .
0	i also filled out the online appt request an no one called me back .
0	my first daughter passed away so i am really protective of my kids .
0	another time my son had an allergic reaction to a prescription .
0	i was told within hours it would clear .
0	then it got worse .
0	well why did you say to call if it got worse ?
0	i moved here a year ago .
0	my last pediatrician office was amazing ( as i realize now ) .
0	it was just nice to know she actually cared .
0	someone answering the phone to make an appt would be nice too !
0	no customer service and humanity at all .
0	save you time and money and find someone more helpful and care .
0	this is my first and last time visiting this urgent care .
0	the girl at the front desk was rude .
0	there was also a power outage for a few minutes .
0	do n't go there .
0	first off , i visited rc of nv .
0	this was at the sienna office .
0	the office staff is not friendly except for the hispanic girls .
0	the black girls and the white girls are very rude and condescending .
0	they show little concern for their patients .
0	never wants to talk about anything .
0	will not answer your questions .
0	again , dr. loo is your best bet .
0	but overall , i would not recommend this place to anyone .
0	i went in for an exam and buying a pair of glasses .
0	i selected a frame .
0	i looked as though they did not want to do business with me .
0	everybody 's time is precious
0	honestly i called 4 times this week have n't gotten a call back .
0	they seen me once and no follow up .
0	i 've requested several appts on the stupid portal and still nothing .
0	now i am 5 days without a refill .
0	do you guys realize how dangerous it is to stop taking medicine cold turkey .
0	so crazy because i seen all the bad reviews i should 've known .
0	hopefully i can find a new place .
0	he was texting and scrolling on instagram the whole time .
0	however , i found it incredibly rude and unprofessional .
0	run , do n't walk away from this clinic .
0	in the waiting room for 2-1/2 hours .
0	there 's no excuse for that .
0	office staff rude and unprofessional .
0	good for their bottom line but dangerous for patients .
0	was scheduled for a procedure .
0	i told her that i would not be going off any blood thinners .
0	she replied `` you have to '' .
0	at this point i should have cut and run .
0	what was i thinking continuing with this farce .
0	this procedure was a joke .
0	this happens as a result of improper technique used when giving im injections .
0	the procedure was rushed to say the least .
0	there was no test for retention done .
0	i vowed to never return but inexplicably discontinued the medication .
0	i know , what was i thinking ?
0	i just can not say enough about how poorly this clinic conducts its business .
0	they could 've cared less .
0	this place sucks , they cant even get their billing right .
0	you 'll see , go there .
0	i will never go there or ever recommend this place .
0	my mom & i came in for mani pedis .
0	all of the workers were very nice and welcoming .
0	we got our pedicures first .
0	a few days later the gel began to lift on the sides .
0	now a week later and they look terrible .
0	things get stuck under because they are lifting .
0	i 'm very disappointed in the quality .
0	staff are asleep at the wheel .
0	receptionists socialize at the expense of patients waiting to be seen .
0	be prepared to wait .
0	found this out the hard way .
0	still waited for over an hour after my set check in time .
0	she treated me as if i was the dumbest person she has ever met .
0	hopefully she does n't last long or they will lose customers .
0	i rarely go to the doctor and visiting this practice reminded me why .
0	i came in because i 've been having trouble sleeping .
0	i made an appointment with kate montgomery , rn , cs , fnp .
0	she was down right rude !
0	i will finding another doctor that is not so judgmental .
0	if i were you , i would pass on this facility .
0	i came in for some pain in my ear .
0	not take your time ...
0	i have been doing keto for over 6 months and having a stall .
0	my husband recommended a doctors review of my current situation .
0	i had an appointment booked almost a month out .
0	i was brought back before finishing the paperwork and met with kylie kersten fnp .
0	she was friendly , concerned and listen to my story .
0	asked a few questions and ran blood work .
0	did not mention or ask one keto related question .
0	neither negative or positive about this way of life .
0	i left feeling defeated and like i wasted my time .
0	the f/o staff did not have an opening for over three weeks .
0	i now have to wait 3 weeks to review my blood work .
0	not impressed with this office for my specific concerns .
0	this is not a keto/low carb option .
0	this place was absolutely the worst dental experience i 've ever had .
0	i have been going to the office for 4years .
0	i have never been treated so bad and with complete disrespect .
0	i had setup an appointment for may 21st , 2016 @ 1130am .
0	i could not believe how unprofessional and insensitive she was being .
0	i never said anything about my medication or what i was taking or needing .
0	she has no business working with the public .
0	she is an evil , cruel , no remorse having person .
0	mostly when dealing with peoples personal medical health .
0	i would never trust her with access to my medical records .
0	she is beyond untrusting and should never be allowed to over see other people .
0	the only plus to this place was the front desk 2as super friendly .
0	it wasnt anything serious so i didnt mind going to a nurse .
0	but his nurse didnt have very good bedside manners .
0	and she wasnt very warm when she entered the room .
0	i like a doctor/nurse to make me feel welcomed into their office .
0	i didnt get that feeling at all while in there .
0	i 'm going to try and find another doctor to go to .
0	we do n't know how long she was on both screaming for help .
0	however , i do n't believe that i did receive that .
0	i could have read that myself !
0	be aware of what can happen .
0	this is what happened to me .
0	i 've been there maybe four times .
0	each time i noticed my anxiety level would get higher .
0	the front staff are not terribly professional and had some attitude .
0	the hygienist christine is terrifying !
0	i am already nervous at the dentists .
0	all i wanted was my 6 month cleaning .
0	she tried to up sell me so hard i got up and walked out .
0	she kept walking in and out , turning the tv off .
0	she talked way to much and did everything but clean my teeth .
0	she 'd cleaned my teeth once before and was incredibly rough .
0	i was glad i walked .
0	there are several dentists in my area that take culinary ins .
0	dentists like tlc dental with very good reviews .
0	i 'll not be seen at happy dental again .
0	it sucks that my future employer uses this company for fingerprinting .
0	as if i interrupted her cellphone usage time with such an unimportant need .
0	i am 32 weeks pregnant with dr. tyre as my doctor .
0	this office is so disorganized .
0	i get to the office ... bladder full of water .
0	apparently they do n't tell you when they are running 45 mi nutes late .
0	the latest news came at this weeks check up .
0	anyway , the store was kind of dirty and sad to begin with .
0	i get my things , go thru the check-out line .
0	a modern supermarket that wo n't take my debit card .
0	silliest thing i 've ever heard in my life ... i walked out .
0	save yourself the trouble and go to a real store .
0	the staff is awesome , caring and very friendly .
0	the doctors are great , but the staff is horrible !
0	i had 2 appointments one in the morning and another one in the afternoon .
0	yet the dr. insisted on re-doing all of the same tests already performed .
0	great way to run up the bill ` ~~ ! !
0	the good : * you 'll be motivated to work out and eat right .
0	* some of the trainers are really cool .
0	* classes in the am or pm .
0	if this sounds good to you , you should definitely sign up here .
0	if not , there are dozens of training centers around town .
0	at first , they told me not to worry about it .
0	also , i never received an invite to take the program 's final assessment .
0	it 's worth it .
0	your insurance provider may offer nutritional counseling as part of your coverage as well .
0	the majority of your post is a lie .
0	integrity clearly is not a value of yours .
0	our culture at real results is better off without clients like you . ''
0	do n't waste your time ! ! !
0	patients treated like cattle ! !
0	i was there for 2 months ... saw dr tyre and her pa-c jessica .
0	tyre and jessica the pac very incompetent , ,informative .
0	wtf says that ? ! ? ! ?
0	then she left the room ! !
0	i was sitting there in my paper toga ! ! !
0	i was treated like cattle ! ! !
0	i ordered all of my records immediately and found another ob .
0	so please read yelp ! !
0	please do n't waste your time here .
0	the one star given was only to post ! !
0	wow and tyre and her pa jessica were arranging surgery for me ! !
0	i made an appointment online last week .
0	i showed up today and the appointment had not been scheduled .
0	i could have stayed , but there were fifteen people ahead of me .
0	i went to labcorp 's website and signed up for an appointment .
0	i called them to confirm my appointment and they confirmed it .
0	i was not impressed with my visit to stockton dermatology .
0	she was so rushed in my session it was over before it began .
0	they act like a smile would damage the face muscles .
0	read this for a true professional evaluation .
0	i was originally referred to the office to see dr. herrera .
0	this office will not treat multiple issues willingly .
0	in conclusion , this office does not work for me .
0	it 's like a honeycomb pattern of hyper and hypo pigmentation .
0	thank you guys for ruining my legs
0	he left off the line of what my vision is for both eyes .
0	trip and time wasted .
0	my prescription is n't right - things are blurry - bad .
0	i understand it might take a couple of tries .
0	i sure hope my file was n't sitting on the desk for two weeks .
0	as far as i know - they never found my file .
0	it was pointless since the doctor was gone .
0	does she have medical training ?
0	no option of negative rating unfortunately ! ! !
0	i bought a stair master on line , back in november .
0	paid by credit card .
0	had to call a few times to get a receipt .
0	i specifically asked and was guaranteed a home delivery .
0	i explicitly said that i can pay more just for home delivery .
0	we got into a she said/he said situation .
0	2 stars for falling out in 2 days !
0	i would never recommend this place to anyone .
0	this is the worst clinic i 've ever been ! ! ! ! !
0	because you still wait for almost 2 hours ! ! ! ! ! !
0	i dont think this is something that they should be doing .
0	there is no sense of urgency .
0	loosing documents that are supposed to be confidential and kept secured ? ? ? ?
0	is something that worry me as a parent .
0	if dr garcia will be reading this , please !
0	dont accept a lot of patients if you cant handle it .
0	*****keep the appointments on time*******
0	very difficult with a baby only few weeks old !
0	not boy that but waiting room is so tiny and always so full !
0	2. place is filthy !
0	i needed to make a bottle in exam room after waiting 2 hours .
0	so unacceptable for an exam room ! !
0	wish i had taken a picture , but new born was screaming mad !
0	4. staff over codes your visit to the insurance .
0	hubby needed underwear and insisted on penneys ( no idea why ! )
0	went up to the counter in the men 's department to pay .
0	the clerk seemed openly hostile .
0	husband asked , `` did we interrupt something ? ''
0	she said , `` no. ``
0	we wo n't be back ... .
0	the dr determine that i only needed steroids and cough syrup .
0	i knew i needed antibiotics but he did not prescribe them .
0	i am leaving this practice .
0	the epitome was when my pa said that he has problems too .
0	i tried and tried - longer than i should have to make this work .
0	i feel as though they are just a money mill .
0	if you go here be ready for long wait times and pointless appointments .
0	they only care about a copay here .
0	warner family practice is the most disorganized practice i have ever been to .
0	bad doctors , bad pt staff .
0	the doctors are a mob that want to make money .
0	dr. zoltan was curt and weird .
0	dr. armendariz was a jerk , period .
0	the pt staff does not do astem .
0	astem is a physical approach to fixing an ankle .
0	instead , all i did was strengthen to no avail .
0	so we set my appointment with her for the following friday .
0	there are tons of real spas in town , avoid this one .
0	i can see why this facility has a 2.5 out of 5 rating !
0	i called twice in one day to try and schedule a mammogram .
0	i arrive at 1:00 , was asks to sign in and take a seat .
0	five minutes later i inquired again .
0	she went in back and same story .
0	finally a woman approached the counter where i was now standing .
0	she said `` oh well we 're covering lunches right now '' .
0	that does n't sound like something that should become your patients ' problem !
0	they can do all sorts of things with computers these days !
0	i will not be returning .
0	there are too many other places in the valley that offer this test .
0	stephanie smith is a thief with horrific customer service skills .
0	i filed a better business bureau complaint , to which she never responded .
0	go elsewhere ... .please .
0	and when you are dissatisfied , please write to the bbb .
0	she does not deserve a positive rating .
0	horrible place to work ! !
0	should change their name to incomplete care medicine !
0	the medical assistant who did the lavage was terrible .
0	i guess it was 2 for 1 , an ear wash and a shower .
0	not only that i informed both the m.a .
0	can tell me this , but your pa ca n't ?
0	how can an emergency room visit take over 6 hours .
0	i have a 75 year old mother that fell and broke her ankle .
0	i have been in the emergency room since 5:30 it is now midnight .
0	how many rooms does a hospital have and why would it take 6 hours .
0	i got a standard size buddha bowl with rice .
0	there was nothing special at all about the bowl .
0	just fresh vegetables diced and marinated tofu .
0	when i get one it is just that , a splurge .
0	i work hard for my money and expect to get what i pay for .
0	my limbs received less than a minute of attention .
0	my feet and hands were 5-6 seconds each .
0	yes , i counted because my first arm felt very fast .
0	i figured it would get better when i was supine .
0	now , i used to do massage so i know this is n't correct .
0	i 've had them before and also know it 's not typical .
0	this was the worst i ever had .
0	again , i did not ask for that .
0	i know my back is bad .
0	please listen to me .
0	i opted for additional treatment on my feet , which was n't explained .
0	i thought it was a massage .
0	i did n't want that .
0	$ 20 down the drain .
0	not sure this will be it .
0	these services are too expensive to not get quality .
0	and the woman dealing with the lockers was so rude and less than helpful .
0	i feel it went downhill after that experience .
0	the hold time to schedule an appointment is beyond unacceptable .
0	i 've tried calling all different times and its the same thing .
0	i am certain you can throw down money to properly staff your call centers .
0	i will not be using simonmed going forward because of this .
0	i would give a 0 if i could !
0	i had to constantly follow up on my labs and request a call back .
0	i had labs done weeks ago and barely heard from their office yesterday .
0	only for them to refer me to urgent care .
0	the lab commented that this happens alot from derosa medical .
0	they were not real confident in handling this situation !
0	this is so dangerous !
0	they gave him very little information !
0	i had an appointment in march for some ear problems .
0	`` , she said , `` it 's for acid reflux . ''
0	ear issues are now acid reflux ? ?
0	you are kidding me ! ! !
0	i walked out of the office after 1 1/2 hours !
0	i then reported it to my insurance for fraud !
0	so that is our fault .
0	i have never received her call .
0	i would not refer anyone to derosa medica .
0	we are both looking forward to visiting with our new dr .
0	very uncaring and not loving .
0	your visit are less than 10 min .
0	pregnancy is a special time and you want to be treated with care .
0	i just found another doctor but at least client manage called me out of concern
0	this time it was extremely frustrating .
0	the techs are pleasant and did n't resolve my problem .
0	the office staff is incompetent in my experience .
0	i called 5-7-18 and left a message .
0	yeah , well bye dr scott lamprecht .
0	i will never know if you are a good doctor or not .
0	i ca n't even get mad at these people !
0	their office is run like a sitcom .
0	the receptionist was extremely unorganized - she forgot to place my order .
0	no apologies were made .
0	bad attitude and terrible customer service .
0	i 'm taking my business somewhere else .
0	i would not recommend this place to anyone .
0	may 4th i went in at 12:30pm for a physical and ekg appointment .
0	i paid $ 125 up front and got half the service i paid for .
0	3 people in lobby and 2 hours have already elapsed .
0	i advise another urgent care .
0	what 's that ? !
0	clearly we were not in need of veyo 's services .
0	i hope veyo in arizona is contacted and this issue is discussed .
0	thank you for your time and attention with this manner .
0	do not bring your loved ones here unless you want them to die .
0	my children lost their father senselessly .
0	i would not send your loved ones here ! !
0	hours are advertised as 8am to 8pm , monday through friday .
0	this is the last time we will try to take business to doctors care .
0	worst cvs i have ever walked into .
0	looks like i 'll have to take my business back to walgreens .
0	learn some basic customer service skills .
0	this is the worst eye doctor i have ever been too .
0	every single employee is so rude except for the young man named damon .
0	i finish and place packet in front of her .
0	5 minutes passed by and she did n't even touch it .
0	like as if my appointment was such an inconvenience to her .
0	they call me back and doctor is super nice !
0	do n't they want my business ? ? ?
0	i would never recommend this place to anyone seriously .
0	off putting staff is one of the worst things in a business .
0	i was n't impressed.the service was terrible .
0	she was 100 % correct .
0	just beware if you do decide to see her .
0	i have been here twice and they just rush you in the appt .
0	i asked if i can have a monday appt .
0	she said we do n't have any .
0	and her response was i do n't have any mondays .
0	i said i thought you were open mondays ?
0	just overall rude customer service and not helpful at all .
0	going to another place .
0	she had no idea what she was doing ! !
0	and had an attitude with me for it ! !
0	this place does n't get that idea ! !
0	very disappointed in the customer service here today .
0	the staff member then warned me to not wake up the ferrets , etc .
0	just a very strange interaction that made me feel like a complete moron !
0	this dentist advertises $ 39 x-ray and exam for first time patients without insurance .
0	i was quoted 99 dollars and that included the full x-ray and exam .
0	the front office completed the appointment card including writing down the price .
0	i completed the forms the day prior .
0	i will update this after i hear from the dr .
0	a request was sent to him to contact me via his web site .
0	some staff members seem to have difficulty acknowledging the patient .
0	this office is so disorganized and just unprofessional .
0	i have an auto-immune disease which requires monthly blood tests and daily meds .
0	new ownership is terrible ( north ) .
0	my son and i returned and she was eating a cob of corn .
0	she asked to walk on my son 's back .
0	never have i asked for a refund on a massage , but i did .
0	unfortunately , the owner would not even return my emails or phone calls .
0	sadly , no one is left from the original ownership .
0	i didnt see the doctor i came in for labs .
0	office visit and labs .
0	she also has an attitude !
0	that black lady should not be even working up front !
0	she did n't offer my arm like these other reviews .
0	i 'm not kidding when i say extension size pieces of hair .
0	my best friend immediately saw the chunks on my head .
0	this was completely intentional .
0	she should be hit by a truck .
0	i do n't really recommend this clinic at least for hair removal .
0	this place is the worst .
0	i dread my visits .
0	came in for an x-ray of my sons neck that was ordered stat .
0	office was not busy and was told it would be 20 minutes tops .
0	we waited over an hour before finally being called back for the xray .
0	made it very clear they do n't really care about business or customer care .
0	i have had better and faster service in a busy ed .
0	would recommend avoiding this office and choosing another location .
0	and insisted i stay for ten more minutes for the foot massage .
0	do not go there ! !
0	definitely would not recommend dr. kaplan .
0	all in all , this left me with a very bad experience .
0	they committed to do some work for us and then would n't return calls .
0	once they finally agreed to a start date they never showed .
0	we then set another date for the work and they did n't show again .
0	no advance notice that they would n't be able to keep their commitment .
0	on top of that , the quality of service here is pathetic .
0	i would n't come here again .
0	you have to leave a message each and every time ... and wait .
0	the morning of the appt .
0	no one attempted to show they cared .
0	stating that his appt .
0	needed to be rescheduled .
0	my dad received no such communication .
0	we were patients with pearl stein for a few years maybe like 3 years .
0	needless to say mothers instincts should mean something .
0	we have had the best care now with our new doctors .
0	or getting a second opinion go find the top doctors in town .
0	there are many peds that do see their own kids in at hospitals
0	do n't even waste your time using his service .
0	he never showed up and then stopped answering calls and texts .
0	nurses do not have basic skills of being able to communicate effectively .
0	came in at about 6pm on sunday evening .
0	they were the trays to refill and replace foods in the food bar .
0	the food bar also did n't have but a few of the dishes labeled .
0	it seemed no nicer than any other grocery store .
0	the check out stands were not neatly organized or clean .
0	it should be several notches above a normal grocery store in terms of presentation .
0	that cart of food i mentioned at the beginning ?
0	the ma takes me to the back , ask me why am i here .
0	i say chest pain , dizziness and issues with sleep .
0	she says and i kid you not , can you pick one reason ?
0	you have to make other appts for all the diff reasons .
0	i said but those are my symptoms ! !
0	appt over ! ! ! ! !
0	what the heck was that ? ? ?
0	i told her she was a horrible person and left crying .
0	i went there and got the full body massage .
0	we will never be back .
0	it 's a great classes !
0	but ! ! ! !
0	they will ask from you only $ 77 dollars for unlimited 28 days workout .
0	it does n't say that it 's only first month or for new clients !
0	this is the worst that i 've ever been to .
0	they should have at least put the shade down .
0	i left there feeling as stressed as i was walking in .
0	terrible service , all they wanted was a tip .
0	not worth the groupon i purchased .
0	they did n't even explain the detox process .
0	do n't waste your money here..
0	`` because the doctors were swapping systems . ''
0	they never even looked at the reason why were visiting either .
0	it was `` oh you 're wife is fat . ''
0	but we 're here about a boil on her leg ...
0	okay about my bill `` diabetes ! ! ! ! ''
0	and this ingrown toenail `` diabetes ! ! ! ! ''
0	or this weird hair `` diabetes ! ! ! ! ''
0	no they never actually looked at anything .
0	never saw jurani either it was always some backwards ass nurse practicioner .
0	so here 's the real question ?
0	why am i charged for only half the year ?
0	well you know the answer i got ... .
0	i have never really had issues here .
0	but the last two times i came here it was just terrible .
0	2 ) i just received probably the worst massages ever !
0	i am a member there and this was terrible !
0	if they can fix my issue that would be great !
0	do n't call them !
0	they ca n't even see if your insurance is covered .
0	they make you do all the work .
0	what a disappointment ! ! !
0	please do n't spend your money where they are so very un- generous .
0	the owner , he is not gracious .
0	support somewhere led by someone who cares for you while taking cash only .
0	our experience was extremely negative .
0	firstly , throughout the entire consultation we were exposed to observing medical students .
0	this is fine if one is asked first and then consents .
0	we were n't asked and did n't consent .
0	dr christensen essentially bullied us , insisting that they be present .
0	the patient did n't feel respected as a client .
0	but here 's the reason i decided i would absolutely submit a negative review .
0	the patient had suffered needlessly for months .
0	in fact we were quite seriously misled .
0	one star feels generous .
0	i have a problem with liars and not being showed respect .
0	i left their office shortly after as did my brother and grandparents .
0	do n't go here if you have a job ... or a life .
0	atrocious front office staff .
0	extremely unprofessional and need training .
0	no message to be found .
0	they could care less .
0	please please please avoid this place at all cost ! !
0	no problem with dr.hamburg 's care .
0	when i complained to the office manager , she was extremely rude ! !
0	because of her anti-patient attitude , i will not be back .
0	why will they not honor something i already paid for ?
0	i take sublingual allergy drops which require a number of special requirements .
0	i asked to be treated via this method because of my busy travel schedule .
0	however , it has proved to be nothing but trouble for me .
0	i was told by the lab it is a legal requirement to do so .
0	many of the site 's instructions and forms require a medical office membership .
0	i have not managed to find any such legal requirement .
0	neither seem to exist .
0	i would not advise anyone go here .
0	this place is the worst place to get scrubs ! !
0	the gentleman working was clueless and very inconsiderate ! !
0	this customer service is awful ! !
0	thanks for ripping me off !
0	i 'm just not a fan of marc 's .
0	whenever i go the queues are so long .
0	the `` new '' conveyor belts they got are old .
0	they need a self-check out lane and i might consider trying the place again .
0	i agree with corey , the office is very disorganized .
0	neither the doctor nor the nurse seemed to know what they were doing .
0	based on my results they prescribe you certain medication .
0	it was way 2 expensive but i agreed on getting it anyways .
0	the medication is shipped to u from out of town .
0	you do not even want to know how much medication costs .
0	its not like i have them lined up ready to go to his office .
0	that is his job ! !
0	the blood work is about $ 2000 and with insurance i paid $ 200 .
0	they just left me hanging .
0	i do n't know .
0	maybe cause i was n't doing his job ( promoting his business ) .
0	again , i do n't know .
0	i highly suggest to stay away from this place as far as possible .
0	they are very professional and have been doing this for a long time .
0	insurance is accepted ( unlike lifexmd shadyville ) .
0	this office has horrible customer service .
0	first off i had a appointment at 4pm .
0	they schedule 15 kids at the same time .
0	my name , which i wrote 30 minutes ago , is not there .
0	but wait i was never called .
0	omg i almost exploded .
0	how ridiculous and incompetent .
0	you can also expect the billing department to get it wrong too .
0	i recently had a baby and am not impressed with their care for newborns/babies .
0	i do n't recommend palo verde pediatrics .
0	everything they 've assembled is coming undone .
0	upon leaving my review , i was called by the owner and threatened .
0	we will be seeking damages for monetary loss .
0	months after we completed work and you may have asked for more .
0	please do n't makecthis hard on everyone . ''
0	he called me a crybaby bitch , a fuckin pussy , a woman .
0	all he wanted to do was fight me .
0	i told him i 'm not about that .
0	i think they have some major drug issues .
0	again , if stay away .
0	trampoline assembly and furniture assembly .
0	both owned by joe .
0	joseph eafrate is so rude and condescending .
0	he is not a good medical provider .
0	he does not listen to you when you are trying to explain something .
0	he is always in a rush and does not care about the patient .
0	in fact , shai/ shy ( spelling ? )
0	the negative attitude and competence here is shocking .
0	i would never recommend this place to anyone .
0	i would give them a zero star if that was an option .
0	do not waste your money here .
0	they also charge for a contact lense fitting like seriously ? ?
0	i 've been wearing contacts for several years .
0	nearly takes 3 weeks to get in .
0	not coming here again .
0	i never write bad reviews but man was i unlucky here .
0	this place is so slow !
0	it 's ridiculous how long the wait is ! !
0	how is it possible to run so far behind !
0	i have better things to do with my time away from work than wait .
0	worst customer service ever .
0	we regularly get $ 20 massages at other foot spas .
0	never again will we come back for luke warm water and dirty towels !
0	at the end the man at the counter asked , `` together ? ''
0	and my friend said , `` no , separate . ''
0	though she insisted on $ 18 , she ended up agreeing to $ 20 .
0	the massages were fine but not worth the frustrating experience of being overcharged .
0	did i already say that we will never again return to this place ?
0	use a different company if you can .
0	i also told them to ship it to my vet .
0	i was also told that the order would be sent out the same day .
0	i gave them the credit card billing information and thought i was good .
0	needless to say , this place needs help ! ! ! !
0	only gets 1 star because i ca n't leave 0 stars !
0	what a waste of time on my part .
0	i remember something like this happening before and i tell cigna this .
0	i explain that i do n't understand why they do n't receive these requests .
0	they do almost everywhere else !
0	anyway , this is totally a first world problem and i get that .
0	this is a patient mill .
0	i brought my girlfriend here because she was having complications after having a surgery .
0	i liked how friendly the staff was .
0	they took the time to remember my name and the scheduling was very easy .
0	i remember why i do n't typically have someone wax my body for me .
0	i got the extended bikini wax .
0	i will just continue to buy the in-store waxing kits and do it myself .
0	pros : -lovely spa interior and exterior .
0	-lovely front desk employees .
0	-experience was not worth the price .
0	and that 's why it get 's two stars from me .
0	this is how they take your hard earned money from you .
0	so my friend had to pay the office visit by herself in cash .
0	this is the new clinic inside walmart .
0	the quality of service is hit or miss .
0	just because you saw an episode of house m.d .
0	over the weekend , does n't mean you should apply it to your life .
0	according to my provider the image was not taken from the requested angle .
0	overall , not impressed .
0	we paid for expedited shipping and paid for the order via pay-pal .
0	that was five days ago and i have never heard back from them .
0	i am now trying to get a refund from liftchair.com .
0	do not order anything from this company .
0	this policy was never communicated to me as a customer either in-person or otherwise .
0	doctor was very nice though .
0	very dirty facilities , rude staff , horrible management . !
0	there 's even mold in the patient rooms.. !
0	please dont go here , dont send anyone you care about to this hell hole..
0	may be he should be practicing in hollywood or at the white house .
0	it is easy to pass the bucket .
0	you are still getting 0 stars from me .
0	i will not go back here and be treated this way again .
0	stay away if you can
0	this places employs people that prescribe medication for children that do not need it .
0	this place should be out of business .
0	i was really bothered by this practice .
0	she made me extremely uncomfortable and the entire appointment felt weird .
0	that being said , i will be looking elsewhere for my healthcare needs .
0	do n't bother making an appointment .
0	that to me is a little absurd !
0	the lobby is run down .
0	i 've been coming here for years .
0	i might have to give up soon
0	i 'll keep this short .
0	they also never answer their phone .
0	it would ring 10-15 times every time i called .
0	this is not a place to trust with your medical needs .
0	update 5/30/2016 : received a bill for $ 2.24 this week .
0	my bill also said 120+ days overdue .
0	refused to fix 1 nail .
0	broke a nail traveling and they refused to fix it .
0	never seen anything like it .
0	stay away from this establishment ! !
0	this place is worthless .
0	office manager is brainless and incompetent .
0	just the worst experience ever .
0	i cracked my tooth and he stabbed the numbing in me like a nightmare .
0	pulled my front tooth out so brutally .
0	i thought to myself this is how it should be .
0	he attempted to do a `` shallow '' implant .
0	? ? ? what ?
0	then his booking secretary ! ! !
0	i will never return and i will not refer anyone to his office ever .
0	i have to make a follow up appt .
0	you have no idea how this was a horrible experience for me .
0	very very rude staff ! ! !
0	i called to make an appointment and the receptionist was horrible !
0	i was told i would receive emails with information i needed .
0	if i could give zero stars , i would .
0	apparently whoever i scheduled with did n't really make my appointment .
0	they had a girl od ing in the bathroom .
0	i just want to speak with a doctor .
0	i would give her all 5 stars , she tries to get us seen .
0	do n't waste your time and money like i did .
0	look up mark fugit orthodics .
0	he custom makes them for your feet at less than 200 !
0	they would rather laugh and talk amongst themselves .
0	i was there one night and the fire alarm went off .
0	it was very loud , super disturbing and completely ruined my massage .
0	they took my name and number and i was told they would call me .
0	i was cancelling my membership because i was moving overseas .
0	i 'm so furious .
0	this makes me feel like the manager told me that on purpose .
0	the therapists are also very inconsistent .
0	find another establishment for massage .
0	this place will give you more headaches than it will take care of .
0	update : a manager called me and gave me 2 hours of massage credits .
0	this place is a complete money grabbing setup .
0	avoid at all cost .
0	i 've never had a worst dental experience .
0	tried twice at 8pm and 9pm and no bother to call back .
0	would never recommend this place
0	i was told a scheduler would call me to make an appointment .
0	remember , i have extreme abdominal pain .
0	they said they would have the scheduler call me right away .
0	i did ask for her name and number before hanging up .
0	her excuse is she does n't have a phone by her computer ! ! !
0	have you seen that multimillion dollar building ?
0	that was a line of crap .
0	this is unacceptable ! !
0	i ca n't believe how unorganized they are .
0	they were so limited compared to the ones i am used to in california .
0	i wish we had a better whole food close by .
0	even with the green and brown phlegm .
0	he prescribed me a steroidal nasal spray .
0	i knew something was n't right due to me coughing all night .
0	that 's why i 've been coughing so much .
0	it 's always unreliable .
0	also they had a child working at the front answering phone calls .
0	never going back again .
0	i would give 0 stars if i could .
0	i would give it 0 stars if i could .
0	they can barely handle making appointments .
0	i got a groupon for reiki .
0	the minute clinic is absolutely worthless .
0	she did n't even turn on the check-in kiosk until 10:10am .
0	first patient was seen at 10:25. wtf cvs , get your act together .
0	this place f***king sucks ! !
0	if i could give them a 0 i would .
0	they advertise themselves as urgent care yet they are n't .
0	i went there because i thought i had a bladder infection .
0	they told me i did n't .
0	i took my daughter there also and just got the same bill for her .
0	front office staff is very unprofessional .
0	i have had 3 appointments there .
0	i then explained my frustration from previous visits and the wait time .
0	i left the office and will not return .
0	it 's a shame ... .i really like the doctors .
0	dr. sharma has charged my insurance anyway ) .
0	my wife has almost lost her life due to inexperience of dr. sharma .
0	i am going to report her to authorities as well .
0	incompetent , and dishonest .
0	not in my case .
0	i am glad i got 2nd opinion from a professional periodontist .
0	dr. sharma has charged my insurance anyway ) .
0	my wife has almost lost her life due to inexperience of dr. sharma .
0	i am going to report her to authorities as well .
0	incompetent , and dishonest .
0	not in my case .
0	i am glad i got 2nd opinion from a professional periodontist .
0	i went in for the drug test & was unfortunate to get her .
0	i have long black hair .
0	it was n't even a clean cut .
0	before cutting my hair she kept telling me how beautiful my hair was .
0	i was so upset & i made sure she knew it .
0	her response was , `` i 'm sorry honey . ''
0	i find this very unprofessional .
0	i ca n't even get an appointment with these people !
0	my daughter 's pediatrician referred us here .
0	i 've been calling for 5 days .
0	i 'm getting a new referral .
0	i was told i needed lab work and needed to be fasting .
0	a half an hour went by , still sitting there waiting .
0	so i went to the front desk , asking `` how much longer ?
0	`` ... i had to get back to work ! !
0	do n't think they even noticed to be honest .
0	terrible customer service ! ! !
0	never going back there again !
0	extremely rude and condescending .
0	i have always had a great experience here in the past .
0	the reception was not only rude but uninformed .
0	had been seeing dr. kim , who is always prompt .
0	answered the assistant 's questions and given a gown to change into .
0	she left saying dr. r `` would be in in a few minutes '' .
0	okay , clearly i was n't the next person to be seen .
0	i 've had better experience in the other locations .
0	worst dr ever just wanted to do injections never even looked at my records .
0	follow up -- just got paperwork from my insurance company .
0	original price was set as an `` estimate price '' of care .
0	( while we no longer even live in the state . )
0	a bill from a professional is for services rendered .
0	i can not imagine we are the only family he has done this to .
0	sorry but i 'm done .
0	i 'll go somewhere else where they appreciate my business .
0	i would give this place a negative star if i could .
0	i went there for a simple medical visit , medication refill .
0	one of my medication requires prior authorization before the pharmacy can fill it .
0	it has been about 8 weeks since my visit .
0	save yourself the frustration , do n't go there !
0	no apology , no explanation .
0	went in again yesterday just to get labs .
0	the massage itself consisted of the few same movements over and over again .
0	most of which consisted of my butt area which was quite uncomfortable .
0	i will not be coming back !
0	i have had a surgery scheduled for over a month .
0	the billing person called to tell me i needed to pay up front .
0	i tried calling back repeatedly but only got voice mail .
0	who leaves work at 1:30 in the afternoon ? ? ?
0	it 's clear my time means nothing to them .
0	i 'll find another doctor who respects me , my time and her commitments .
0	complete waste of money !
0	i had close to no privacy ( second red flag ) .
0	this ended up being the worst part of all .
0	i was so confused .
0	shit , still am !
0	the worse in nevada as i have been there three times and no results .
0	i 'm giving 1 star for bad business practices .
0	i brought 2 daughters and myself for 1 hr massages .
0	i decided to stay anyway , as it would be the same price elsewhere .
0	if i could give zero stars , i would .
0	no one answers the phone .
0	they might call you back , if they get around to it .
0	but usually not , because they 're so busy .
0	the front office is the worst bunch of women i 've ever dealt with .
0	i put my total faith in doctor lundgren , that was a huge mistake .
0	i advise anybody , be careful what you sign , read it completely .
0	my first question was are you accepting new patient ?
0	response : hmm yeah with a not so nice tone .
0	second question do you accept cigna ?
0	uhhh yeah , hold on a minute .
0	before i could say anything i was placed on hold .
0	no no no ! !
0	i will not be scheduling a appointment here .
0	first encounter is front desk , the young ladies were very pleasant .
0	now it was a wait over an hour from our schedule appointment .
0	we watched as people coming in after us were immediately called back .
0	when she came to the room and asked why was she being seen ? .
0	wow , this place is awful .
0	this is a good store with good food .
0	the prices high and the manager is not friendly .
0	as a parent i showed up when instructed to by the staff .
0	i had to pay $ 100 for the third visit .
0	i openly expressed that i would need a cavity refilled when making the appointment .
0	i am only available on saturday 's .
0	when i went back to the chair , they took x-rays .
0	finally , the dentist came over and explained what i already knew .
0	for a cavity filling ! ! !
0	turns out , she does n't fill cavities on saturdays !
0	also , $ 250 to fill a cavity is crazy !
0	do not see dr freeman at this office !
0	the way i was treated in this office was worst experience ever .
0	it seems apparent now why they have to advertise so much .
0	i 've not shopped at wal-mart in about two years .
0	and what a chore that was .
0	she asked me to call back the following day .
0	the next day , my experience getting ahold of someone was about the same .
0	after all of this , i was getting pretty livid .
0	the following day i called wal-mart and demanded to speak with a manager .
0	i finally got one on the line .
0	she never called me back .
0	the next day was a nearly identical repeat performance .
0	i told her that a manager yesterday failed to get back to me .
0	she told me , `` i 'm going to take care of this . ''
0	she never got back to me .
0	i do n't recall her name .
0	so , there you have it .
0	for a lost bookcase .
0	i 'd still be waiting for the thing if i did nothing .
0	i 'll never make another purchase from wal-mart again .
0	very disappointed and short sighted .
0	i saw him once , after i registered as a new patient .
0	yes i believe he would probably be a great physician to have .
0	sadly , i ca n't make an appointment to see him again .
0	as a former patient at ctca , i know what dignified cancer treatment entails .
0	this is n't it .
0	mayo clinic here i come .
0	farida rassiwala was unprofessional and rude .
0	she ought to be reeducated about the patient 's bill of rights .
0	first line states , `` be treated with dignity and respect '' .
0	she disregarded that with me .
0	she just wanted her day to be over with .
0	tis all i can say .
0	the spa itself is a gross tired looking lavender colour .
0	front desk is beyond unorganized .
0	they all need to get on one system !
0	they are so unorganized ! ! !
0	i really hate this location .
0	i wish i was treated with more respect .
0	further , phone calls to ask questions about treatment were not returned .
0	the whole place is a big mill organized to make money for the practice .
0	stay away from westfield .
0	poor poor slow service today .
0	this place is horrible ..why ?
0	i 'm so mad at this place and would never return .
0	done and done -- happy to shop at more socially progressive grocery stores .
0	i will not be returning .
0	i wasted enough time , energy , gas , & paid time off already .
0	love whole foods , but not the people that go to this one .
0	trader joe 's has less stuck up people that think you owe them something !
0	love everything in here though !
0	my appt was at 330pm , and its 440pm , this is ridiculous .
0	something needs to change , maybe try not double book patients ...
0	ca n't get past the receptionist - she 's terrible .
0	call 2 : forwarded her the xrays .
0	i said i 'd get back to her once i checked with my insurance .
0	call 3 : just moved here , so got my insurance card from hr .
0	told the receptionist where i work , etc .
0	told her my health information .
0	she told me it was wrong .
0	... and continues to actively make fun of me on the phone .
0	it is literally traumatic to speak to her .
0	simply the worst service i 've ever had anywhere in any industry .
0	dr. richard lieber is fantastic and my review has nothing to do with him .
0	he clearly has too many patients already .
0	not to long ago , i was referred to dr. santucci .
0	my four front teeth had braces when i came here .
0	my front teeth had been straight and closed together .
0	i really did n't want oral surgery !
0	a few weeks after that we noticed my teeth separating from one another .
0	he then left with no explanation of what will happen next .
0	the entire staff was awkward and unfriendly .
0	i really feel like i wasted an hour of my life .
0	i just feel like the service is inconsistent .
0	all i got was an excuse that they lost a good employee .
0	im not angry just very very very unsatisfied .
0	go at your own risk .
0	my experience with this store was awful .
0	i will never go to this store again .
0	do not trust them .
0	they would probably give you the wrong prescription .
0	my compliant is in regards to greedy , unethical practices regarding that exam .
0	i called my insurance and confirmed this service was covered at 100 % .
0	i called wfp and scheduled `` my free wellness physical '' .
0	during the exam my doctor ordered multiple tests based on our conversation .
0	later i saw wfp had charged my card for hundreds of dollars !
0	that week i also receive another $ 200 bill for that one postponed test .
0	in total my free wellness examination cost me $ 600+ .
0	i had been going to this office for years .
0	until my dentist suddenly left and i was n't told .
0	no letter of introduction .
0	why am i to trust my care to someone i do n't know ?
0	the front office is a complete disaster !
0	their sensitivity to a patient undergoing 3 hours of dental procedures was abysmal .
0	then they charged me for something and it was incorrect .
0	willing to be accommodating , i said no problem just credit my card .
0	i was told they can not refund to a credit card !
0	i have never heard of that with any business !
0	i will never use this dental practice again .
0	ummm ... .no i 'm not .
0	i have no missed calls on any of my 3 phone numbers .
0	the '' office manager '' was the one that was saying all this too .
0	why would so show up late ?
0	their customer service has always been an issue with me from day one .
0	that was just the beginning !
0	so did retainer he have me that was supposed to be invisalign .
0	i do n't want to play that game .
0	i do n't understand how their staff ca n't answer the phone .
0	this place should be shut down .
0	the staff is horrible .
0	they are rude and do n't care about anyone .
0	the doctors barely speak english and make you feel uncomfortable .
0	do not go here if you care about your health .
0	the decor is beautiful but my experience was not that relaxed .
0	it was supposed to be a introduction .
0	she did n't even ask me if the bright light could be turned down .
0	i felt distracted by the other clientele coming in the room .
0	i did not feel like my belongings would be safe in the locker .
0	they are over priced and not very honest .
0	what a waste of my money .
0	( and no i did n't get there close to closing time ) .
0	ummm , seriously ? ? ?
0	get off my back !
0	i 'm paying you , so i can take as long as i like !
0	oh , & of course they rushed the paint job which looked atrocious .
0	it 's been 4 days and have had issues seeing .
0	thus place sucks and they are soooooo rude .
0	i 'd rather pay full price than go there for insurance !
0	this was not a good decision .
0	we then reiterated our desire for only materials that were covered by insurance .
0	we were ultimately given the option to reorder the glasses with the requested materials .
0	we agreed , and are currently waiting for the remade lenses .
0	needless to say , we will not be going back .
0	after being a patient here for years and years it was time to leave .
0	getting ahold of anyone in that office is an absolute joke .
0	communication is unbelievably low in this office .
0	i have been reasonably satisfied until today .
0	i will never visit this urgent care again .
0	the online `` reservation '' system is the biggest joke of all time .
0	a reservation that means nothing !
0	but does n't fully enter the room .
0	no apology , no nothing .
0	it was a bizarre experience !
0	the physical exam was very cursory - maybe 90 seconds .
0	and no answers to the symptoms .
0	the directions listed on the website were good and i found it quite easily .
0	i will not make this mistake again .
0	they do not have any cell phone reception in that building .
0	they discontinued their guest wifi to save money obviously .
0	is that the best place they have to refer ?
0	they have such old equipment .
0	i wonder if they give a kickback to the center for their referrals .
0	it makes me wonder .
0	the doctors do not care about the patients .
0	they do n't look too hard for any real issues you may have .
0	they are content to take your money .
0	that is the feeling i get .
0	the place is one big cash register .
0	go and see for yourself .
0	i personally will be switching to another office .
0	money , money , money .
0	they will not work with you and their payment plans are unreasonable .
0	me and my cancer will have to go someplace cheaper .
0	docs seem to be good and staff , but too expensive for me
0	i have received a promotional free class for a month .
0	i had to call in to register for a class .
0	i left a message explaining that i have a voucher for a free class .
0	have not received a call back .
0	why give out free passes if you can not honor them .
0	yes , said kirsten ... glycolic peels are wonderful for my condition .
0	i filled out all the paperwork and consent forms for glycolic peels .
0	she is a brilliant saleswoman , i will give her that .
0	approximately 3 weeks later it was time for another peel .
0	she exclaimed that my face was looking so much better !
0	was her memory about my particular skin condition that good ?
0	i said : `` i do n't know ! ''
0	**feeling especially naked without any make up on** .
0	he said : `` do you know you have a bacterial infection ? ''
0	me : `` whaaat ? ? ? `` .
0	like i said , she 's a wonderful salesperson , and she hooked me .
0	however , kirsten does not give refunds .
0	she has never given refunds in the history of her business .
0	i was mad at her attitude .
0	anyways , kirsten she hung up on me .
0	so , with kirstens math , i had 200 dollars left .
0	4 peels + 1 cleanser = $ 680 .
0	my friends in town who used to go to her wo n't go anymore .
0	beware of sales tactics , and what you 're signing .
0	this drastically delayed every process .
0	will the regional management step in ?
0	just went to this location for my son .
0	we got in quickly , waited awhile between nurses , doctor and x-rays .
0	overall , that part of my visit was a typical urgent care experience .
0	it was what came next that i felt was unprofessional .
0	we where misinformed while trying to get my sons records to our family doctor .
0	so i made many phone calls to figure out the problem .
0	the one star is for taylor , he was helpful and polite .
0	otherwise avoid this place .
0	they overcharge and never file the insurance correctly .
0	do not go here .
0	i ca n't believe they would tell me such a thing !
0	i would rather give zero stars .
0	this is the third time coming to this location .
0	the biggest mistake was choosing this place .
0	i signed up to yelp just so i can write this .
0	i left the office in tears this morning .
0	the receptionists are the worst .
0	the woman who answered was pretty rude .
0	i was shocked and i said well everything really .
0	she keeps leaving ! `` ...
0	please save yourself some pain/trouble and do not come here .
0	changed dermatologists , asked that all records be transferred .
0	much room for improvement in the services rendered .
0	tip is given for good service !
0	the masseuse did n't do a good job either .
0	she seemed new and inexperienced .
0	dr. jenny h. kim is the worst eye doctor ever .
0	if you have an appointment .
0	you can forget about being seen at your appointment time .
0	this will be the last time my family of 6 ate coming here .
0	my previous 4 visits over the past four months have been frustrating .
0	they can not keep up with their stock .
0	i think it 's time to take a break from shopping at trader joes .
0	i see internet based posting noting problems with infections - judge for yourself .
0	in my case he placed an implant which caused all sorts of problems .
0	nothing about the work brannon did worked out for me .
0	some of the other dentists , such as dr. bravara i would recommend highly .
0	she says think of sativa as a cup of coffee .
0	hybrid as lunch and indica a little heavier like dinner .
0	what does that tell me ?
0	not impressed at all .
0	i will stay on my side of town to shop .
0	every time it 's a horrible experience ( illness aside ) .
0	that said , i liked our doctor there .
0	i believe he 's retired now .
0	urgent care reception staff could use a morale boost .
0	but they do n't hide it well at all .
0	they are greedy and only look out to line their own pockets .
0	he wants the insurance money .
0	the receptionist went to ask him again and again he said no .
0	my recommendation for someone looking for a dermatologist who cares and is n't greedy ?
0	5 lawsuits in 2 years !
0	http : //www.superiorcourt.maricopa.gov/docket/civilcourtcases/casesearchresults.asp ? lastname= & firstname= & bname=global+pharmedica .
0	i would never come back here .
0	i feel rip off .
0	one guy said $ 40 and the other said $ 60 an hour .
0	i end up paid $ 60 an hour .
0	i have to agree with joanna .
0	we were not impressed with this office or dr. syms .
0	dr dao is rude and wo n't listen to any concerns you have .
0	he refused to read previous reffering ophthalmologist notes .
0	he checked my daughter eye and said it looks fine beside inflammation .
0	now let me remind you he checked her eyes in less than one minute .
0	uncaring doctors please pay someone else that truly care !
0	stay away from this place
0	for the most part the staff is not very friendly .
0	they act like you are interrupting their visiting time .
0	the only positive about this office is there is a large selection of glasses .
0	a bride 's worst nightmare .
0	this is my pretty middle finger in your face , joya .
0	i will tell everyone i know what a joke you are .
0	the products are marked up .
0	and the poor quality of services is awful .
0	you want to hear some drama ?
0	it 's crazy that all the notes from my reassuring phone conversations when amiss .
0	my facial was terrible .
0	when you come here you are truly just a number .
0	the lady never asked what skin regimen or products i use .
0	she just gestured to settle in and just started poking my face .
0	she was so rough and rushed .
0	oh really little girl ?
0	do n't go asking for bridezilla .
0	oh no you did n't .
0	you are damn right i 'm pissed .
0	the front office woman was nice and seemed quite competent .
0	she observed me from a distance with her arms folded .
0	their hours start at 7am .
0	the 5 people waiting by then , one tech .
0	then appointments started to show up too .
0	so another hour wait .
0	do n't use them without an appointment .
0	the lady said i had an ingrown toenail and ripped it out .
0	the next day my toe is infected and pussing like crazy .
0	this place is unclean .
0	wish i could upload pic .
0	i waited for a long time to see the doctor .
0	i wo n't be coming back again .
0	never go to this place .
0	not professional , not kind , poor knowledge .
0	we tried to contact them for the bill , but nobody answered .
0	at that point i told them to keep the watermelon .
0	never again will i be purchasing rotten fruit from whole foods .
0	there are two identical suite addresses within the same complex .
0	go to sprouts market first then angle south from their parking lot .
0	unbelievably ignorant location address conflict .
0	when you find the place , plan on insensitive , unisex service .
0	of course he 's fully dressed .
0	i backed up , shut the door and vowed i 'd never be back .
0	i told the female tech to get that man out now .
0	by this time i 'm really angry .
0	the insensitivity of these people shocks me .
0	you 're not running a car wash for god 's sake .
0	i have no idea how this place is in business !
0	i 've never been to a salon that wo n't accommodate their customers !
0	took a uber here and was turned away !
0	so not only did this place waste my time , but my money too !
0	`` we do n't do just 1 nail '' .
0	`` we can do , $ 45 '' ... .
0	they charge to remove color ?
0	what was unbelievable was they were not busy at all !
0	just sitting around watching tv .
0	just do n't go here !
0	this business is run very poorly .
0	i have no idea what has happened here since last year in er .
0	i was there 7 hours .
0	did not even get my medicines right tried to give me duplicate xrays .
0	did not see a dr for 3 hours .
0	guess what now they want her to fax a copy .
0	explained what i was looking for sold me the wrong thing .
0	explained why i was looking for it .
0	the sales rep still teied to sell me something else !
0	the sales reo told me thay what i was buying could be refilled .
0	it was only a refill itself .
0	ten min aftwr leaving i found out and called .
0	manager insisted he watched entire tramsaction and was there the whole time .
0	no one was near us at all !
0	i tried to explaon it had been ten min i needed to exchange .
0	he told me i could come in and buy a pen .
0	im not sure why !
0	manager ignored my requests .
0	manager kept insisting his employee gave me good info .
0	i was completely disgusted !
0	i wasted $ 30 !
0	wo n't be back !
0	a `` wellness '' plan does not consist of making me mad and tense !
0	this office has so much turnover of dentists and hygienists and i know why .
0	very unprofessional , long wait times and they are constantly messing up insurance .
0	i really suggest-go somewhere else ! !
0	i was referred here by my general dentist for my daughter for cavities .
0	2 hours after the dentist initially looked in her mouth to get the fillings .
0	at the second appointment we waited 40 minutes past our scheduled time .
0	if i could leave a comment without a star i would .
0	i was in pain for 3-5 days after my cleaning .
0	used to be an awesome practice when he first opened !
0	i was one of his first customers in those early months .
0	yeah i did n't love the quote system ... it was high pressure .
0	free whitening gimmick was n't really free .
0	they go through hygienists like tissues ... one you like disappears .
0	i think i need to look around for someone new .
0	we are leaving the practice .
0	they told me there was no one i could see until the following morning .
0	we did and she did in fact have an infection .
0	it took 5 min at an urgent care and a $ 300 bill later .
0	she would have had someone see her- really ?
0	it takes no time to run urine .
0	he ruined the entire unit worth $ 30k .
0	no remorse and no acceptance of responsibility .
0	i urge any and all to stay clear of this incompetent doctor .
0	it 's all about him , not his patients .
0	worst er ever ! ! !
0	if i could give this hospital zero stars i definitely would .
0	dr. miyake greeted me and listened to my heartbeat .
0	i am the patient .
0	i am in pain .
0	the staff was completely unresponsive until i repeated my request .
0	he handed me discharge papers and pointed me to the door .
0	not one staff member came to see how i was doing while i waited .
0	i am extremely disappointed in the lack of service and medical attention i received .
0	i think dr. ruggieri is an excellent doctor .
0	the issue i would comment on is his staff .
0	i found many of them to be rude or unprofessional .
0	the whole office seemed to have subtle contempt for the patients .
0	then there were a few incidents that pushed the envelope of professionalism .
0	i was left in an examination room for at least a half hour .
0	they were actually telling jokes about it and laughing .
0	i went to get the stitches out last wednesday .
0	when i said no , he fished around some more & found another one .
0	all the time he was wheezing up close to my face and coughing .
0	it was really uncomfortable .
0	not impressive , & these are just examples .
0	i have to say that the experience after visiting the facility was horrendous .
0	went in for consultation and treatment .
0	left unimpressed with dr david smith .
0	its good to raise your standards , but never lower .
0	the experience was well below sub-par to say the least .
0	i had a groupon with fk laser .
0	i agree with the other comments about dr. f 's communication skills .
0	also , the high pressure sales at the 1st appointment were definitely not appreciated .
0	however , all this would be manageable if the treatment was great .
0	it certainly was not the soprano one i 've experienced at other places .
0	i can recommend it either .
0	worst ever ! ! !
0	i had my eyeglasses ordered here last year .
0	unfortunately , the lenses were too thick and not the super-thin lenses i ordered .
0	i brought it back to have them replace the lens , which they did .
0	i went home and went to my former optometrist .
0	( my left eye needs a higher grade than the right . )
0	if i had not seen another optometrist , i would not have known this .
0	please be careful with the glasses you order from this shop .
0	i would recommend getting your glasses made elsewhere .
0	have been going to lenscrafters for years but will not be returning .
0	i would have expected this to be de rigeur !
0	slow , old , unclean .
0	this place.demonstrates the need for competition in imaging .
0	i will not come back .
0	small loud waiting area with a tv for extra noise .
0	i 'm sure i 'll get some cursory response from someone at the company .
0	we deserve better than this crudhole .
0	then she says he sees 60-80 patients a day .
0	whatever you do make sure to never have him as a doctor .
0	it 's been a mess .
0	to be fair i can not speak on any other dr in this establishment .
0	i hope this saves someone from a mess .
0	so i spent thousands of dollars on hair removal from brazilian to face .
0	every time i came here they tried to sell me something else .
0	it never did work better .
0	the employees are awesome , however the product is n't .
0	i went to valley pain and wellness center because they offered allergy drops .
0	now i know why .
0	i even discontinued my outdoor runs/walks because i thought i had bad allergies outside .
0	very nice staff but i 'm super angry i was so misled .
0	they no longer do reflexology type massages .
0	prices are similar to full body massages you can get at strip hotels .
0	too bad it was very nice here .
0	the customer service at this place is absolutely horrendous .
0	now i have to cancel my appointment and reschedule all due to their inefficiency .
0	if you can avoid this place , please do .
0	please whatever you do do not go to goodman and partridge !
0	are you kidding me ? ? ? ? ?
0	guess the drivers kept cancelling for a reason ? really ?
0	this is what you guys do to special needs teens ?
0	and no wonder the dispatchers would not tell me what was going on .
0	shady practices & people ! !
0	went here because they were highly rated .
0	they took x-rays did the 360 degree x-ray also .
0	$ 250 outta pocket that the insurance could have covered !
0	karma on these people .
0	****update had the owner of the business make contact .
0	would not recommend this business to anyone !
0	: ( wish i never messed with my veins ... ...
0	i joined my sister to celebrate her birthday at the joya spa .
0	when we arrived at the facility , there was immediate confusion .
0	i then ended up entering the yoga class late , which was awkward .
0	the yoga class was a little frustrating .
0	the instructor talked a lot .
0	the locker room was also very crowded .
0	she did n't even say excuse me !
0	slightly relaxing but i would n't say it was a `` good '' massage .
0	definitely not worth the money i paid for it .
0	i never did get my tour .
0	never got to do the crystal/rock thing that i read about online .
0	even the whisper room was full of super chatty women .
0	i would suggest joya spa amps up their customer service and overall customer experience .
0	the front desk personal should at least attempt to be cordial to the patients .
0	my fist 4 sessions were a waste of time and money .
0	they set the treatment too low to be effective .
0	it took 4 sessions of my complaining before they adjusted the treatment .
0	i would give this place -5stars .
0	the staff is rude and clueless .
0	she told me that they were already looking into it .
0	the last time i called to schedule she hung up on me twice .
0	their communication is very very poor .
0	i went in and all he could do was confirm that i did .
0	he gave me paperwork for another blood test and an ultrasound .
0	i do not even understand how this would be possible .
0	i left without any answers and even more confusion .
0	this place is a scam .
0	she just kept rubbing the same spot on my feet and arms .
0	i kept cringing because the repetitive rubbing just ended up irritating my skin .
0	on the wall , they suggest $ 10 for a `` happy experience '' .
0	as in `` i 'm dead tired ! `` .
0	oh and all these 5 star reviews you see on this page ?
0	people got $ 3 off to write them .
0	that 's $ 45 and 60 minutes i 'm never getting back .
0	my experience is extremely similar to michele h. 's below .
0	she was very rude and condescending and forced me to make an appointment immediately .
0	they immediately got defensive and questioned why i would want a second opinion .
0	they eventually agreed to send the xrays , but they never actually sent them .
0	luckily , i ended up cancelling my appointment and never had these procedures done .
0	please no one else go to this corrupt , unprofessional office !
0	they should be shut down !
0	your office needs to show some compassion dr. bartholomew !
0	i went in today for the first time .
0	i stopped giving my social to medical offices long ago with no problem .
0	this is by far the worst obgyn you can go to in vegas !
0	well things have changed for this doctor .
0	first of all , she is no longer with box canyon .
0	she now is with calderon medical on south valley view .
0	it 's very run down around that area .
0	the staff is rude and uncaring .
0	in fact one just seemed mean to one of the patients .
0	i had to wait for 4 hours and 15 minutes to see an assistant .
0	to see the doctor i would 've had to have waited another hour .
0	i seriously needed medication , but i ended up leaving , in tears .
0	i will never go there again .
0	this waiting room is by far the worst i 've ever been to .
0	waiting times are extremely long .
0	never ever ever go to becky gonzales .
0	switched to dr knapp-so far other than the aforementioned she has been ok .
0	the doctors used to be good .
0	lately , you can never get your doctor , always someone new .
0	random doctors you get do n't seem to be knowledgeable or care .
0	several times we 've gotten wrong diagnosis , including this week .
0	it is sad that this originally a very good office gotten so bad .
0	the place is understaffed and over crowded with patients .
0	we wo n't go back and wo n't recommend this place to anyone .
0	appointments : they wo n't answer the phone .
0	finally got the 2nd lab form !
0	lunch was at 1200-1 on the door .
0	i guess they do n't need the money ! !
0	unethical practices this pertains to some of their suppliers as well .
0	they continually sell moldy berries .
0	old wilted produce kept on shelve too long .
0	they will even say it is the suppliers fault for such item conditions .
0	stop selling stuff that you would n't take home to your mother .
0	i brought all 3 of my kids there at the same time .
0	two of my kids were scared and not being very cooperative .
0	because of her i am not sure we will be back .
0	today i learned why i 've taken that road .
0	yep , i ca n't even imagine how hard your job is .
0	what do i know .
0	i will be seeking out a new gynecologist , if it makes any difference .
0	i doubt they even know cpr .
0	they wash your linens , hand out meds , and wake you up .
0	on to the next explosive mess .
0	dr. horne , 190 years old and uses 100 year old techniques and remedies .
0	he prescribes the same medications for everyone !
0	it 's actually quite weird .
0	how can every patient need the same medications at pretty much the same doses ?
0	they ended up turning that shit on me .
0	like all other rehabs this place is an insurance mill ! !
0	they beat the same shit into your head every single day .
0	i am in disbelief that they are able to continue the way they do .
0	my boyfriend was in extreme pain and the customer service was atrocious .
0	this whole foods needs serious help with management .
0	i was here today with my 2 little ones .
0	i by honest mistake stood in the express lane .
0	then she started to mumble that how i could n't read the sign .
0	i asked her if there was a bigger problem .
0	she got really upset and called the manager .
0	you would think that manager will have some sense in calming her down ! !
0	manager started to yell at me .
0	my little one started crying and i was just left in complete shock !
0	all this for not reading a stupid sign !
0	mind you i have 3 graduate degrees and i can read .
0	one star for this place for many reasons .
0	i arrived and had a stylist work on my nails .
0	i needed two nails replaced while away at work ( thumb and index ) .
0	i requested sns dip powder .
0	i was n't happy with them when i left .
0	sns does n't peel .
0	manager was 20 minutes late opening due to his tardiness .
0	i 'm a flight attendant .
0	5. he said they did not refund , only fix .
0	i needed to head back to the hotel .
0	she said she could not refund .
0	7. the manager did nothing and ignored me .
0	8. no one would provide me with the owners information .
0	i am very disappointed with the way this turned out .
0	not turn the other way and refuse to listen .
0	one star because overall annie was nice .
0	and the place was clean and nice .
0	they also had quite a few options .
0	i called as a new patient to make an appt for july 7 .
0	i got a call that morning the dr beck was out sick .
0	i told them forget it i will find a different doctor
0	if you decide to use this location , do not see dr. syers .
0	i 'm 39 weeks .
0	and she would n't do it because my contractions were n't close enough together .
0	so they kept me 2 days and sent me home .
0	but there are mitigating circumstances that should change that .
0	much safer than sending a mother with epilepsy home .
0	if i were n't due in a week , i would change practices .
0	luckily , there are 2 amazing doctors in that office .
0	see dr. falcone or dr. freeman .
0	because this doctor has no clue what she 's doing .
0	and i will be contacting management regarding her ignorance .
0	it is cold and flu season , a particularly horrible one at that .
0	each time was a different random number .
0	invariably terrible customer service .
0	avella is a compound pharmacy , which makes prescriptions to order from a physician .
0	this is the most frustrating place ! ! !
0	i 've been getting compound prescriptions for about 10 years .
0	their customer service is abysmal .
0	typical wait time on hold is 20 minutes .
0	their compound content is good .
0	but the aggravation and delay when you need a prescription is inexcusable .
0	there are too many options out there , and i 'm moving on .
0	did n't even want it !
0	rip off report off .
0	against she had no footstool .
0	she continue to say things like i did n't give her a chance .
0	but she just kept insisting .
0	having been introduced to the bloor street fresh location , i expected great things .
0	what i got was a little less than that .
0	first off , the place did not appear to be air conditioned .
0	i got a wrap , not bad , but nothing special .
0	i 'm all about finding some good vegetarian restaurants .
0	on the occasion i visited this french location , it definitely did not deliver .
0	this practice 's front office has great customer service .
0	they require unnecessary visits and blood draws .
0	i guess no one told him part of medicine was helping people .
0	staff were very rude .
0	rude on the phone and im not sure if ive registered or not .
0	i have been a patient here for scheduled services and that has been ok .
0	but coming into the er is a nightmare .
0	i could n't i was severely dehydrated and in extreme pain .
0	it was beyond my choice .
0	ride or die , i choose to ride somewhere that could help me .
0	discrimination against doing work on a pregnant woman .
0	they wasted my time .
0	it would have been nice to get it done before my baby is born .
0	it is a very inconsiderate office .
0	they rather follow the their protocol than a patient in pain .
0	i come here for heel pain .
0	my doctor ordered an insole for my shoes to elevate the pain .
0	i would never recommend this office to anyone
0	awful on so many levels .
0	went in for the first time for an ear infection .
0	a simple ear infection turned into an hour and forty-five minute appointment .
0	not sure how they are still in business .
0	this place is ridiculous !
0	the office staff is borderline incompetent !
0	( the phlebotomist/front desk )
0	doctors are gteat , but the support staff and scheduling staff lack organization .
0	constantly making a mess of things .
0	it is impossible to call and actually talk to a person .
0	leave a message and 10 percent of the time they will call you back
0	i went for a pregnancy test after two positive pregnancy tests at home .
0	the wait is not worth it .
0	average 2 hours + wait time for scheduled appointments ! ! !
0	office staff was incredibly rude .
0	i just fired the doctor as my care giver .
0	place does n't even deserve 1 star .
0	i 've been a patient here for a few years .
0	unfortunately some policy change is putting people at risk .
0	i called today because i have a bad cough and am having trouble breathing .
0	she said it is the patients responsibility to remember to schedule it not hers .
0	and if i 'm worried about my cough i can go to urgent care .
0	i will never go back to skyline and i will transfer my care .
0	what an absurd policy that puts the health of people at risk .
0	what a huge sign that they do n't care about people at all .
0	just maximizing the amount of appointments they can get you in for .
0	i never write bad reviews .
0	upon reading other reviews it appears they 've done this to others as well .
0	had a pretty disappointing appointment with dr. tamm .
0	i 'm seeking help with chronic migraines , dramatic fatigue , and ear ringing .
0	he then proceeded to tell me `` you 're fine .
0	if it was something dangerous , you 'd already know . ''
0	which , by the way , is almost exactly what dr. tamm said .
0	i will not be returning to this practice .
0	i have been going to dr. cunningham and dr. karius for almost 10 years .
0	over the last year to 18 months it is gone downhill very very quickly .
0	they never even bothered to call me back .
0	the credentialing staff in provider enrollment that they have are very immature and unprofessional .
0	they would make insults calling our staff stupid , worhtless etc .
0	i went in to be checked on an emergency i was having .
0	he then told me i thought you were a tough girl .
0	has nothing to do with being tough .
0	turns out i am in agonizing pain for days to come .
0	days went by no relief .
0	he tells me there is no way that is possible .
0	i explain to the doctor that i was still in pain .
0	he told me there is no way that i can be in pain .
0	he did not give me an update on the status of my infection .
0	he did not tell me what to do next .
0	i asked him should i go to the emergency room .
0	he then said i think you need to find a new opthamologist .
0	he then said no comment .
0	and ran out of the office into his personal office and slammed his door .
0	i highly suggest avoiding this ophthalmology practice if at all possible .
0	doctor did not thoroughly assess issue with foot .
0	woo child where to begin .
0	called gave them the information .
0	did not hear back from them .
0	walked in on monday , they still had not verified my insurance .
0	ok so i 'm taking deep breaths , am trying not to be angry .
0	i 'm like but i did n't even get my cleaning .
0	she looks at the schedule and says ok the 9 am did not confirm .
0	come in tomorrow and we will get it done .
0	thanks i leave come back the next morning and jesus be a fence .
0	there are three people on the office .
0	and she says that i can reschedule .
0	i about lost it .
0	i just say thank you and leave because the nerve and audacity .
0	that is the only reason for the 2 stars .
0	they could n't even set up an appointment right .
0	my husband was spared from a visit .
0	we found a better dentist .
0	if the massage is good .
0	do n't complaint about the price .
0	**folks : takes note , i 'm also liberal and forthcoming .
0	any sexual solicitations are not tolerated and will be reported to authorities .
0	as we cleared state on website .
0	we are helping a customer find relief from anxieties and chronic ailments .
0	my uncle paid for the groupon .
0	that was paid with money .
0	that gives you no reason to be rude to customers or former customers .
0	you should have been happy with the review .
0	so i 'll forgive your misunderstanding .
0	i hope your business goes bankrupt due to your behavior on this site .
0	been with this office for 3 years and officially done .
0	1. get ready to wait for your appointment .
0	poor management leads to poor time management .
0	but god forbid you to show up in office later than appointment time .
0	they will refuse to see you completely .
0	i had a surgery performed by dr sikand .
0	i got ear infection , unrelated to my original surgery .
0	what a service ! !
0	walking extra mile to work with a patient lol no never heard of it .
0	i had last two weeks of previous insurance and was getting a new one .
0	never any other medical facility would not check .
0	no , it never happened to me before .
0	only in ent of nevada .
0	speaking of `` professionalism '' .
0	4. dr sikand will spend precisely 3 minutes of his time with you .
0	$ 700 honestly earned .
0	receptionist will make you feel completely unwelcomed .
0	i and my insurance paid thousands of dollars to this office throughout 3 years .
0	was very unimpressed with this place .
0	they kept switching doctors on me which i did n't like .
0	i was put on different antibiotics which also did n't work .
0	finally they referred me to an ent .
0	surgery took about two hours as expected .
0	i was told that they have a `` no visitor '' policy in recovery .
0	although both of my parents have had multiple surgeries at mt .
0	view and family was able to visit almost immediately after surgery .
0	i was not the only one that was furious with this policy .
0	this will be the last time mt .
0	view will treat any of my family !
0	i will never go back .
0	these people are heartless crooks who will overcharge like you crazy .
0	however , i would strongly encourage you to shop around for better prices .
0	stop using that type of sells tactic ... does not work
0	i have been coming here twice a week for several months now .
0	in the last two months , my average time spent per visit has doubled .
0	it seems like i see a smaller staff every time i come in .
0	the kiosk is the first thing you do .
0	if you forget something you 're screwed .
0	the system is also inefficient .
0	you have three things doing the job of one thing .
0	how on earth does it take 10 hours to be discharged from a hospital .
0	worst one stop location there is .
0	extremely rude manager , awful customer service .
0	a 5-10 min procedure took 30 minutes .
0	i was in tears and dr freeman was irritated with me .
0	i was like no , just so what you have to do right now .
0	why would i possibly want to endure this again .
0	she had not even looked at my chart .
0	i left in tears again .
0	i would not recommend her .
0	my np at mountain vista location is awesome .
0	if you think fruit-in-a-bag is fresh .
0	at home in seattle , they 'd be shuttered in a week .
0	warning : do n't go to this place .
0	they still scheduled me for next follow up .
0	the end : i went to the other doctor'office who is my insurance provider .
0	same number of donors , but now it takes over an hour at least .
0	there are usually at least 4 employees wondering around aimelessly while 2 actually work .
0	this was n't a 1 off issue , it 's constant .
0	mom & i were looking for roman shades .
0	i understand they are expensive , but i am looking for standard fitted ones .
0	jc penneys charges more for blackout or room-darkening blinds & shades .
0	i took pepcid and that did n't help at all .
0	then i took some tums , still nothing .
0	tried to go to bed and was tossing and turning all night .
0	finally woke up the next morning feeling a little better .
0	mani-pedi day at the spa for mommy and daughter this past sunday .
0	when we got there were greeted in a chilly manner .
0	the services were set up wrong with the wrong products .
0	the two ladies delivered the services like robots .
0	not what i expected ... not one bit .
0	you need to use the call ahead check in option if you go here .
0	that way you can wait at home until they can see you .
0	the staff is nice though .
0	they just need way more doctors available for busy times
0	i wish the appointment people would answer the phone .
0	left 8 messages and no one has called back yet .
0	unfortunately this is where my insurance wants me to go .
0	i love dr scott connell and tina !
0	this is why i wait to review .
0	i would n't believe anything that comes out of their mouth .
0	thanks for nothing summerhills dental ! ! !
0	the absolute worst experience i have received at a gyno .
0	ok , have a great day . ''
0	during my visits at absolute dental i never seen the same dr twice .
0	i was only aware of this once i did my annual credit check .
0	dr. c. gidwani was rude and abrupt in a saccharin sweet way .
0	and i still do n't know why i need a specialist .
0	4. now to tooth # 2/3 .
0	she then drills the tooth , slightly , and asks me to check it .
0	at that point , i just left .
0	thank you dr. gidwani for such a horrible experience !
0	i 'm sure my boys wo n't mind starting school without new clothes !
0	beware of this office !
0	actually.. beware of the office manager jc !
0	she literally was talking over me and not answering any of my questions directly !
0	how are u able to bill someone for service that was never completed ?
0	the best way to describe this place is `` ghetto '' .
0	this is at the eastern location .
0	i assume the others are just the same .
0	they gave me a little pat-on-the back and sent me on my way .
0	i just called to make an appointment .
0	i 'm already on the verge of breaking .
0	he wo n't see me because i take medication for my neropathy .
0	way to make me feel even worse .
0	i do n't even want to bother anymore .
0	some lady who walked in w/a cold went right in .
0	-- -- update after 2hrs finally got in .
0	the pa , alexandra leguire , was awesome .
0	would give her 5 stars .
0	very nice , professional , & thorough .
0	if you must go to this urgent care hopefully you can see her .
0	rest of this place , disorganized .
0	i 'm very disappointed with a final result .
0	i spent about $ 1800 and there is no difference at all .
0	i bought 2 voluma fillers and no results at all .
0	i 've been taking my son to .
0	mendoza for 8 months .
0	i kept giving dr. mendoza a shot .
0	this last visit i walked out .
0	i never walk out of appointments because i 'm in the medical field .
0	i understand things happen , you fall behind on your schedule .
0	but they are always behind .
0	schedule things better or hire an np to help .
0	i waited nearly 2 hours .
0	not to mention there office is dirty and outdated .
0	i brush it off .
0	fine , i 've ran behind on my mornings before too .
0	visit after visit , i knew appointments would last hours .
0	this last one pushed me over .
0	so my baby is behind on vaccines .
0	they rescheduled me because dr. mendoza wanted to leave early on my appt day .
0	it was st. patrick 's day .
0	you work hard , you should enjoy a green beer or whatever .
0	they said to come in wednesday .
0	it 's good to be early .
0	someone who came in after me was seen before me !
0	they call me back finally at 3:20. and i wait .
0	go to the scale at 3:30. and i wait .
0	it 's 4 and i 'm still waiting .
0	the poor medical assistant is running around like crazy .
0	i just lose it .
0	that means i wo n't be seen until 4:30 ? !
0	this is every single appointment people .
0	there offices are dirty , they need better paint .
0	from recommendation of all my mom friends i am going to dr. tenby now .
0	do not do business with this company !
0	run away fast from using this company !
0	it never hurts to price match ... even for the dentist .
0	they quoted me $ 300 for nitrous oxide .
0	i ca n't believe that i have already paid this to this office once .
0	both times they refused to contact my insurance for prescriptions .
0	have also never had any challenges ever in having a pharmacy call to verify .
0	they refuse to apply your insurance if you do not have your card .
0	both times i asked them to check with someone .
0	at $ 50 a month for my prescription this adds up .
0	i will take my business elsewhere .
0	the awesome lady chiro who used to work here is not here anymore .
0	how can they have this guy seeing patients ?
0	he paid no attention to me or why i was there .
0	told me i hav a cold .
0	how and why did i have to pay 60 $ to listen to that ?
0	this was the worst rmt massage i 've ever had in my life .
0	so both my sides can hurt ?
0	so i cut my one hour to 45 minutes .
0	i do not recommend this place .
0	lying face down was not comfortable .
0	so why only 2 stars ?
0	when i started , our classes were ran by a young woman name amy .
0	he was present and attentive .
0	justin stopped working there and it was back to amy .
0	perhaps the same thing happened with justin .
0	anyway , i did n't stay to find out .
0	i called 15 minutes after appt .
0	i have record of it on my phone .
0	i forgo a session so you do n't have to honor your session .
0	this is not good customer service !
0	just my two cents .
0	they delivered our baby and her sister 's baby .
0	unfortunately what prompted me to write this review is their office staff .
0	to say they are grossly incompetent is an understatement .
0	ya , that was n't going to fly .
0	she wo n't be going back .
0	they are killing your business reputation .
0	oh how do i do rate and review bright now dental ? ? ?
0	5 stars for that !
0	their over booking appointments and time delay brings the stars down .
0	the mass confusion my account also brings the stars down .
0	the confusion with my dental plan also brought it down .
0	i really appreciate that .
0	this being said , she brings the stars up !
0	i hope its a good ending .
0	i asked the receptionist if it was ok and she said yes .
0	again , is said no to her great idea .
0	we got into the room and she sat down and left me standing there .
0	i let her know that i did listen to it .
0	her main response was `` really '' to most of what i said .
0	she seemed to have a lot of negative comments and expressions .
0	i was shocked and did not fill the rx .
0	i would not recommend this doctor to anyone .
0	he was rude , pompous and egotistical .
0	he sure was n't interested in anything i had to say .
0	the results of the biopsy - inconclusive !
0	i have an appointment there in early january .
0	if they had my number they should have called well before now .
0	not the week of telling me i have until 2pm to pay .
0	i have never missed any payments whatsoever .
0	$ 40 are you kidding me !
0	if you had my number you should have called sooner .
0	lord knows they do n't call you until after 90 days .
0	not a fan at all .
0	but this is nothing in comparison to what came later .
0	i do n't get blood drawn well and it was always a huge deal .
0	what a great visit .
0	all around , not a great place to be .
0	that was the last straw .
0	no respect at all .
0	whether i am 21 or 35 , i deserve respect .
0	especially after reading other reviews , i am so glad i 've left .
0	my new doctor is sweet , excited , and takes her time with us .
0	skip ob pv if you really care about your treatment .
0	they are fancy and high-end but really not worth the hassle at all .
0	the clinic also seems nice and clean .
0	however , the clinic 's practises and policies have been incredibly enraging .
0	i even got a blood test once because i 'm paranoid .
0	i did n't notice until i got to the pharmacy .
0	i literally begged for at least six months , but walked away with three .
0	have not had a problem with any department except for the vein surgery dept .
0	due to care concerns , i moved my parent out of the facility recently .
0	bbq burger was pretty good with a great combo of texture and flavour .
0	was disappointed when i got the bill and saw the quick-pick tip amounts here .
0	her response was a dismissive `` well that 's standard '' .
0	this was easily the worst massage experience i 've ever had .
0	on the bright side , i guess my skin is quite hydrated .
0	at times , it seemed like the staff did n't know what to do .
0	maybe i got a rookie , or someone that just did n't care .
0	whatever the case is , i 'm definitely not coming back here again .
0	never again , made an appointment , got in , saw jen .
0	seemed nice enough , a bit rushed but okay .
0	so i tell the assistant ?
0	what my questions are , he scribbles them down .
0	so i 'm left sitting in limbo .
0	while i was there i got a prescription .
0	that was a few weeks ago .
0	i call today to find out that she did nothing with it .
0	so now i 'm almost out of pills and do n't have any coming .
0	i was promptly hung up on .
0	i can only assume that they cancelled it since i obviously ruffled someones feathers .
0	i really think this is an 'all about the money ' practice .
0	i will say that the nurses & doctors are very friendly & helpful though !
0	they really listen to your problem & do their best to access it .
0	that being said , the actual service here is ridiculous !
0	i did n't get seen until almost 1am !
0	aside from that , the waiting room is freezing !
0	multiple people waiting to be seen asked for blankets .
0	below i have shown emails from ms. perez .
0	amber perez warner family practice billing department ( 480 ) 831-8457opt .
0	4 -- -- thank you for your prompt response .
0	the policy number remains the same as i provided .
0	amber perez warner family practice billing department ( 480 ) 831-8457opt .
0	it 's hard to relax when doors are slamming and walls are shaking .
0	first time i went last year everything was good .
0	this year upon returning and totally regret it .
0	i wonder how many comments on groupon are really are from customers .
0	we really wanted to enjoy it like last year what a bummer .
0	the staff is friendly but the doctors are ridiculously cautious .
0	if you need meds for a cough or cold , this is your place .
0	parents - this is not the place to take your kids .
0	i do not like the service i 've gotten from this location .
0	the service is abrupt and abrasive .
0	there are no smiles , understanding or good service .
0	it 's quite obvious that their patients are not top priority .
0	it 's one extreme or the other .
0	but i plan to before my next physical .
0	this office as a whole is very unaccommodating and just rude to patients overall .
0	please save yourself the stress and do not go here .
0	this type of care is egregious and extremely disheartening .
0	at first dr. cotton will get you .
0	she seems nice and sympathetic and kind .
0	thousands in unnecessary `` treatments '' .
0	the work my daughter got done at dr cotton 's was subpar .
0	i 'm a student here currently enrolled this is what i have to say .
0	the school director is a joke he 's disrespectful and clearly hates his job .
0	i can continue with this but i think i got my point across .
0	idea of this place is great , but services are not .
0	i went with my mom and her massage therapist was amazing .
0	his cellphone kept going off and he rushed the services .
0	i ended up leaving the place in pain rather than relaxed .
0	also they do n't thank you for giving them a tip .
0	be prepared to spend hours here though .
0	the front office staff is n't very friendly though .
0	when all was said and done i had spent almost 4 hours here .
0	i am not sure that i will be returning .
0	my wife is now being seen at 5:45 and no one has an explanation .
0	this is n't the first time we have waited forever at this office .
0	the worst doctor ever .
0	he only gives you prescription and get you out the door .
0	i am very suspicious of all those good ratings about him .
0	went in 2015 for an exam and the staff was ok. dr was great .
0	the staff was n't so nice then .
0	they insisted i try using bausch and lomb again .
0	since my prescription changed , i was at their mercy .
0	i said i 'd purchase another sample set just to try them again .
0	i just want to see clearly !
0	dr. torres was absolutely awful to me .
0	i was so shocked i could n't say anything .
0	and then stood up and left .
0	seriously one of the worst manners ever .
0	i felt scared and confused and he made it so much worse .
0	i went home in tears .
0	i will never go back to him .
0	i love the convenience of marc 's in avon but i must change stores .
0	it 's just filthy .
0	the building is new - why is your store so dirty ?
0	garbage everywhere - floors dirty , produce awful .
0	it has the appearance of little to no maintenance .
0	seems like it would be an easy fix but alas not to be .
0	you 're convenience will be missed but i just ca n't do it anymore .
0	terrible communication amongst staff .
0	i think its telling that there are numerous similar complaints that wfp responds to .
0	my experience is similar to many other individuals who posted here .
0	my insurance covers routine exams at 100 % .
0	please be wary of this office and their practices .
0	my doctor sent over a referral for a procedure on 6/21/17 .
0	i called to make an appointment .
0	whoever does the referrals was n't available .
0	also , they did n't do the procedure , modified barium swallow test there .
0	they could n't get me in until august 14th at the earliest .
0	they would call when the referral came in .
0	well , it 's august 17th , so i thought i call .
0	this person was so nasty it was unbelievable ! !
0	i asked about what was happening and off she went .
0	telling me that she called me and spoke to me .
0	which she did n't .
0	i keep extremely detailed notes , plus i am not senile !
0	well he never received any notification .
0	i 've seen him several times since june !
0	she calls me a liar and was just unbelievably rude for no reason !
0	it 's not like i called screaming !
0	she really needs to find another line of work .
0	hopefully , one that has no contact with people !
0	it was great when i saw dr amy sparks for the 1st time .
0	imagine my surprise when i received a bill a year after that 1st visit .
0	the most i should 've been charged is the $ 14 copay .
0	? what about the patients who can not dispute ? ? ?
0	i argued with them for weeks until they told me to just ignore it .
0	that 's it , i 'm switching doctors
0	very rude and acts like she hates her job .
0	she forgets the meds she has you on .
0	worst psychiatrist ever with the worst attitude ever and she makes you feel uncomfortable .
0	run far away from this `` doctor . ''
0	the service levels are simply ho-hum to disappointing .
0	i do not recommend .
0	i should have read all the reviews before making an appointment .
0	their system said i had been called and i was not .
0	save your money ! ! !
0	totally not concerned about your needs .
0	it 's a facade .
0	nothing special at all with these ppl .
0	they mandatory want to keep you at least 21 days .
0	but it 's totally not worth the money or insurance cost .
0	this is the worst place for treatment .
0	i 'm a local and for this place to be called luxury is joke !
0	total fraud ! ! !
0	i will never get help here nor recommend this place to anyone .
0	dr nakhle is great but unfortunately the wait time to see him is hours .
0	in january i had an initial consultation with dr. mckenna .
0	i was fine with this initial delay .
0	especially because they were switching physicians due to their own scheduling issues .
0	sorry dr. richardson but your office staff cost you money .
0	bottom line - do not use valley ent .
0	lady booking appointments was very unaccommodating .
0	she said , `` well that 's what everyone wants . ''
0	there are now appointments from now until whenever , first thing in the morning ?
0	i would give this place no stars if i could .
0	we have been going to dr. steve since my son was 2 years old .
0	never any problems with him .
0	i went in expecting to schedule the root canal .
0	this is the only cavity he has ever had .
0	i left the office in complete shock !
0	just seemed a bit excessive to us .
0	my dentist was in utter disbelief .
0	he could n't believe the `` treatment plan '' that dr. parsa provided .
0	my dentist found 1 problem .
0	you read that correctly - 1 problem .
0	here we go again - for a 3rd opinion ! ! !
0	both my dentist and children 's dental village said that nitrous would be sufficient .
0	sure makes $ 637 seem like a `` good deal '' !
0	that is still $ 1,154.25 more than children 's dental village .
0	now , do n't get me wrong .
0	but why would we want to put him through more than is necessary ?
0	why would anyone want to do that ?
0	they really pushed hard for that .
0	i am so torn with this place as another poster has said .
0	last night was a different story .
0	he was walking out the door as i was still talking .
0	i could n't believe it .
0	and they were n't busy , like at all .
0	we got in and into a room in less than 10 minutes .
0	hence why we are here !
0	he 's violently coughing and complaining his chest hurts .
0	idk if i will come back to this location .
0	i did my research on dr. layton before going .
0	he has great reviews - all over the web , not just on yelp .
0	my appointment went well .
0	when did it get bad ?
0	the next day i got a call from evdi for my mammogram .
0	well - that 's news to me ! !
0	no , `` we should have called you . ''
0	that 's kind of a frightening call to get , for one .
0	and for two , what if i had gone and gotten a mammo ! ?
0	today was my second appointment after not hearing anything .
0	when i did n't go i expected a call .
0	that 's quite a big error .
0	maybe he does - but his shared office staff does n't .
0	( i 'll save that for another review ) .
0	so , i chose this dentist .
0	there 's no dental assistant , helping the dentist ! ! ! !
0	his equipment is outdated to the max .
0	ughhhhhhh ! ! ! ! ! !
0	what is with people and wanting what i asked for ! ? ! ?
0	good thing my friend is a dental assistant !
0	went to see angela derosa a few years back in the scottsdale office .
0	i do not personally recommend this woman .
0	pizza bar is disgraceful .
0	2 people ignored my family and i today .
0	i mean burnedwe order pizzas at a minimum of once per week .
0	lately , the people in this department have had poor attitudes .
0	lazy and ignoring customers .
0	but now it 's ridiculous .
0	also , veganaise and refrigerated sections are seriously out of stock .
0	only the basics we ca n't get anywhere else from now on for us .
0	and another voice responded `` no , probably just someone leaving . ''
0	all i get is `` sorry , we 're closed . ''
0	this time i get one word - `` sorry . ''
0	i look up to see faces of stone .
0	i get a short reply , `` 5 pm . ''
0	i then ask if they know when phoenix children 's urgent care opens .
0	it was like it wasnt the same doctor .
0	this er is horrible !
0	i 'd give it negative 5 stars if i could .
0	i brought her at 8pm on a monday night .
0	it took 4 and 1/2 hours before a doctor saw her .
0	the staff was unfriendly , not helpful & just horrible .
0	i would n't come here again if my life depended on it ... literally !
0	i took the day off work and arrived at the appointment .
0	incompetent staff just cost me a day off work .
0	took my best friend here for tonsillitis , absolutely horrible service ! ! !
0	waited over 3 hours and still never got put in a room !
0	the two nurses lindsey and amy were very rude ! ! ! !
0	evidently , the two other reviewers had a good experience with the office staff .
0	therefore , i quit going .
0	it did not matter that i had other serious health problems .
0	the staff reacted quite like bullies on the playground with sarcasm and hostility .
0	went in with aches and pains and left with the same aches and pains .
0	she would start to work a muscle , then stop .
0	one or two passes around a muscle is n't working it .
0	nothing got worked out , some areas like shoulders did n't get touched .
0	i feel like i did n't have a massage at all .
0	i suggest trying elements in summerlin for a completely different experience .
0	mmm , i do n't know about this place .
0	this was the regular diet meal , not a special diet .
0	several of the staff looked like they were on drugs themselves .
0	not much of any kind of activities for the residents to do .
0	however the tour of the inside was a different story .
0	nothing was said about not accepting them .
0	i said ok , but asked how much my secondary insurance would cover .
0	she said `` i have no way of knowing that . ''
0	i said ok , i 'd like to cancel my appointment .
0	bad experience and did n't even see the doctor !
0	today my wife wanted to change her appt .
0	maria 's conversation was harsh , rude and unprofessional .
0	i hope the manager will do more than just `` talk to her ! ''
0	maria needs to find another job !
0	what is my dentis going to do with those besides have a good laugh ?
0	steer clear of any dentist with low pricing .
0	it 's never a good sign .
0	it 's already 2am there 's still 2 patient still .
0	and she told us it 's also the same here .
0	so she said we 'd rather stay .
0	and i told her why do n't you hire more doctors .
0	and she answered me in a rude way that nobody wants to works nights .
0	this is the worts urgent care crew and staff that i ever encounter .
0	my second complaint is with the office staff .
0	even just calling for an appointment is a nightmare .
0	this is probably the absolute worst part about going here , in my opinion .
0	the staff is horrible .
0	my third complaint is with connie knapp , apn , and dr. torres .
0	connie is just unfriendly , and has a rushed , uncaring bedside manner .
0	but the real problem is dr. torres .
0	i saw him through my first pregnancy .
0	i ended up with a c-section .
0	i was so shocked i did n't know what to say or do .
0	the store definitely had the chain , mass-produced feeling .
0	how dare you ! ! ! ! ! ! ! inconvenience ? ? ? ?
0	my call was only returned 1/23 after leaving a long message .
0	imagine a mother hearing that ! !
0	told me to call him anytime i needed more assistance .
0	doctor said may take up to a year of using the eye drops .
0	how dare you just tell me `` sorry for the inconvenience '' ! ! !
0	up to now , i have not heard from dr nelson !
0	showed up for appointment where they photocopied my insurance card paid my copay etc .
0	if you go here call your insurance 1st .
0	this is by far the worst run medical practice in the state of nevada .
0	whoever answered the phone at 1953hours today , november 6,2015.. shame on you !
0	this place is not at all what they say it will be !
0	they say it 's free but i knew that would n't be the case .
0	i lost my weight but never got my money back .
0	simonmed must hire anyone with a heartbeat .
0	my doctor could n't even use the info from the ct scan .
0	that was a week ago ! !
0	will never use simonmed again !
0	for me.like many.rather die.before seeing him agsin
0	the office is huge and only 1 young dentist works there .
0	private practice is the only way to go .
0	i 've always loved banner facilities but my experience here was horrible .
0	i went in with a sore throat.the front desk process was pleasant .
0	i gave it one star as i had a decent parking spot .
0	i have used this location about 6 times as it 's very convenient .
0	each time they are rude and incompetent at best .
0	my bad for continuing to try every now and then .
0	i do really try to give people the benefit of doubt .
0	my daughter was fasting for her test as well .
0	patronize this location at your own risk .
0	you have a child become so upset and agitated ?
0	purely pathetic and insensitive .
0	i have spinal stenosis and arthritis in my knees .
0	i have been going to the henderson facility for almost three years .
0	today was the last straw .
0	please avoid this hospice company , and instead choose hospice of the valley .
0	the nurses seemed like lovely people and seemed very concerned for my dad .
0	he was aware of this and did not object to it .
0	i understand that hospice provides end of life care and makes patients comfortable .
0	as soon as he was stable enough to leave serenity house .
0	i called elizabeth myself to clarify what she 'd told mom .
0	i had to leave a message .
0	elizabeth-there 's a thing called number blocking .
0	your vacation is not my problem .
0	you might deal with people dying every day ; i do n't .
0	now they 'd downgraded themselves to really tacky people in my opinion .
0	having a loved one die is a naturally stressful time .
0	go with hospice of the valley .
0	my kids loved it .
0	i decided to schedule my regular cleaning here and i was very disappointed .
0	the hygienist named barb i believe was very rude and unfriendly .
0	i was very offended and ca n't believe how unprofessional that was .
0	i was so irritated that i just left and told them to call me .
0	i probably will not go back here .
0	worse doctor visit ever .
0	the receptionist mixed up my daughter 's chart with someone else 's .
0	like i sed worse doctor office ever !
0	i paid $ 40 for dr. arvin tounian to check me .
0	i waited for 6 weeks ( ! ! ! )
0	t. nguyen could see me , and she put the new retainer on .
0	she did sloppy work , and only 3 weeks later my retainer fell down .
0	i was n't even eating , it just fell down by itself .
0	in real life , it lasted 3 days and the retainer fell again .
0	this time dr. tounian referred me to another clinic - cheyenne dental group .
0	they did n't had my retainer ready , and not even my teeth impressions .
0	there has to be better places .
0	i have been going here off and on for over a year now .
0	tried 7 or 8 therapists .
0	therapist quality here is very hit and miss .
0	i laid on the table getting more and more frustrated .
0	i do acknowledge that the location is convenient and the premises is clean .
0	i was proffered a disingenuous and cursory apology .
0	i paid for the massage and left .
0	i will forget these loss-leader discount places that hire neophyte therapists .
0	the cost is just too high .
0	i was told that amy , the team leader , would call me .
0	what is the point of having team leaders if they do n't follow up ?
0	i 'm cancelling my account .
0	i do n't want to deal with this company again .
0	this place is so unorganized .
0	we moved from florida 18 months ago .
0	what is needed for public school should n't be out of the ordinary .
0	each visit was met with the same lecture and often double teamed .
0	it was beyond exasperating .
0	constantly told what i was doing wrong and my concerns fell on deaf ears .
0	worst urgent care ever .
0	was told and given paperwork by them for my high blood pressure .
0	waiting over a month for my results and still nothing .
0	these people are idiots !
0	horrible service do not go here ! !
0	that was three years ago .
0	fast forward to today .
0	i have been given anti-anxiety pills .
0	tynara is absolutely the worst pa i 've ever been to see .
0	courtney was awesome but left .
0	other pa 's have been great and have moved on .
0	i love dr. ram , he is excellent and very well-trained .
0	i think josh is good but overworked .
0	at least i know my care will be consistent .
0	i hate to leave after 15 years .
0	it is scary to wait much longer .
0	not worth the hassle !
0	way better staff and service !
0	will never use this urgent care facility again !
0	huge mistake coming to this urgent care !
0	it was n't busy and very few people were in the waiting area .
0	groupon promises that medication is included & it is not included !
0	i will take my business elsewhere , this place is completely dishonest .
0	oh this month is a guaranteed win it 's tax month .
0	its a revolving door of of practitioners coming and going .
0	the only positive experience i had was my initial visit .
0	since then , it 's been a nightmare .
0	i would never recommend anyone going here .
0	there are many fine , qualified physicians in the area .
0	robert newman , md , an ob gyn should not be your choice .
0	the lady that answered the phone when i called was horrible !
0	i will never go to this nationwide again !
0	they do n't even deserve 1 star !
0	i will not return .
0	the woman went outside .
0	secondly i was informed i needed an mri .
0	after one week i called back .
0	nothing had been sent .
0	then next day i called .
0	they claimed they sent it to a different diagnostic center .
0	this was not a new prescription !
0	i had left so many voice mail messages to so many different people there .
0	i do n't think they ever listen to them ! !
0	finally , i needed my mri results but my doctor was out of town !
0	i was assured i would be contacted .
0	it 's like a bad dream dealing with that office !
0	a few days ago i got a rash of some sort .
0	so really they just wan na keep making money off of me .
0	brcause they just want my money !
0	i will not be returning to this practice .
0	and i was the only one on the schedule .
0	this place gave me the creeps for a medical clinic .
0	even if it is a abortion clinic they should give you a comfortable feeling .
0	i 'd rather have my miscarriage at home than a creepy place like this .
0	i would not recommend this office for your children 's pediatric care .
0	this was at a 6 month appointment !
0	you guys i ca n't make this stuff up !
0	do n't do it .
0	it was possible that the teeth supporting the bridge could rot if not cleaned .
0	first of all , dr rowe has her desk sitting behind the receptionist .
0	yes , this all boils down to the bottom line , money .
0	i most certainly wanted to find a trusting dentist .
0	one that i felt comfortable with .
0	unfortunately , this was not the case in the office of dr rowe .
0	the dental assistant , super friendly and sweet .
0	i do hope she gets a degree and gets paid what she is worth .
0	actually the rudest staff i have ever witnessed .
0	you do n't have privacy .
0	your in a room full of people .
0	the `` vip '' room is a stupid little room .
0	would never go back .
0	i didnt want to leave a tip .
0	then , without going into details , dr vesna violated patient confidentiality .
0	so we left and are now seeing another doctor we trust .
0	i purchased a groupon for a couples massage .
0	i found that odd , but we proceeded with the massage anyway .
0	once we entered the room we were asked to undress in preparation .
0	my massage was n't horrible but felt rushed and awkward .
0	at one point they massaged our legs with rocks .
0	she kept hitting my ankle bone with the rocks .
0	at one point she lifted and dropped my legs ?
0	i do n't know if she thought that would loosen me up ?
0	please tell me what part of that would be relaxing ?
0	as she continued on to my back it was the same thing .
0	as she rubbed my back her stomach was hitting my head , repeatedly !
0	this was the worst massage i 've ever had unfortunately .
0	both masseuse 's completely ignored massaging our thighs .
0	my husband specified some problem areas which was completely ignored .
0	on my sheet i wrote all areas as i had no target areas .
0	once again here they were shoving those intro papers into our face .
0	now i knew what the preset tips were about .
0	they have you `` rate '' your experience .
0	i did n't want to be rude and planned to tip regardless .
0	obviously i would n't rate my experience great by any means .
0	to me this tactic is very tacky !
0	my husband tipped them $ 25 and we left !
0	unfortunately our search continues for a really good spa ...
0	this was an extremely negative experience .
0	i am a banner employee .
0	i waited and then the girl cam out and said the nurse said no .
0	after $ 9000 paid i was told my son needed braces again .
0	they accused him of not wearing his retainer which he always did .
0	and , then they said he needed braces for another $ 3k .
0	well , let me see , it was n't my son making the payments .
0	2 stars are for fantastic nurses .
0	hospital gets no stars .
0	wife arrived by ambulance at 5 on thursday with broken ankle .
0	emergency room doctor saw her and put in a splint for surgery on friday .
0	did n't get into surgery until 5 pm , full 24 hours after admittance .
0	in pain the full time .
0	no way to run a hospital .
0	go to centennial or summerlin .
0	i did not feel well and was not ready to go home .
0	we will not return .
0	this place is by far the worst !
0	they make sure to collect your copayment before hand .
0	unbelievably the worst customer service .
0	the selection of clothes is not very good and the staff ignores you .
0	she replied that it would be extra $ 150 for a nice full set .
0	that is on top of the $ 50 i had already spent on groupon .
0	now i have to call american express cancel my charges an informant groupon .
0	i would just beware .
0	what if you needed a fill ?
0	i wish i had read reviews before i wasted my money going here !
0	i was assured i would .
0	i went and lo and behold she was n't .
0	she was a nurse practitioner ! !
0	she had a kind if all attitude which i was not impressed with .
0	i 'll never go there again !
0	i am a senior citizen with a bad right knee .
0	shame on you for such poor customer service and caring !
0	seeing dr. paige was an extremely disappointing experience .
0	it was n't until then that dr. paige finally came into the room .
0	not a call , text ... nothing .
0	not very friendly not very helpful .
0	yes they did answer my questions and they do have some great products .
0	sorry folks i ca n't give you a good rating on this one .
0	i would rate in the negative range if i could .
0	andrew was super nice but the hypnosis was more like a relaxation meditation .
0	i felt kind of nice afterwards because it was relaxing .
0	just left about 4 hours ago .
0	the doctor did not exam me in a way that i most doctors would .
0	i got vitals taken by a nurse who were really awesome .
0	he asked a lot of questions for 5 min .
0	i paid $ 85 since it was my first visit .
0	he did not explain how to use my prescription .
0	so i called their office and asked how .
0	the doctor we not willing to speak on the phone w me .
0	i do n't recommend this place to anyone .
0	for the sake of your health and finances please avoid
0	i went yesterday for mothersday and took my mom for the first time .
0	read some reviews seemed like it would be a nice relaxing time .
0	i was very disappointed .
0	their massage techniques were terrible the worst i 've felt .
0	we both need another massage .
0	i 've definitely been to better spas .
0	the pa and medical assistant were terrible .
0	it 's so upsetting .
0	also the bathroom was filthy and the trash was overflowing in the room .
0	horrible ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	rude ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	and only $ 20/hr !
0	this dentist is way too busy working on too many patients at one time .
0	the dentist seemed bored with the whole procedure .
0	i can understand being busy , but honestly they have no excuse .
0	there was 1 person in front of me .
0	there were no patients besides myself & the other person .
0	this is n't the first time this has happened either ... .
0	was 20 minutes early for appointment .
0	waited another hour after appointment time to see dr toth .
0	dr too busy to see me .
0	i would not recomnend this practice .
0	do not think they really care about patients , especially after surgery .
0	staff did n't even tell me my doctor was running behind .
0	this made me late for work .
0	doctors charge us if we are late the same should apply to them .
0	what i did n't know was : 1. the dr. is n't really available .
0	it felt like i was visiting some sort of high school work program .
0	pa is physicians asst which is a nurse with some advanced training & licensing .
0	i do n't have any reason to go back .
0	not helpful at all , do n't come here .
0	do not go here ! ! !
0	i do n't think that she knew what she was doing .
0	she did n't even look at my tongue .
0	i have had a lot of acupuncture .
0	what kind of customer service is this ?
0	we 've been going to them since moving into the city 6 years ago .
0	this place is terrible .
0	dirty , unsanitary place with rude people who half ass do their jobs .
0	he has fallen out of his bed easily at least 15 times a week .
0	this place is done .
0	patients beware this is day light robbery
0	went in late around midnight - they are open until 4am .
0	everything was going decently until he stopped to answer his phone .
0	will never go back ! ! !
0	deeply disappointed with this practice and medical advice .
0	i had double pneumonia for 2 months that they did n't diagnose .
0	i will find a new primary care physician
0	scheduled a massage for my elderly father .
0	he could not find the location .
0	he did not have the number to inform them .
0	getting a person on the phone is almost impossible at sw kidney institute .
0	i am trying to pay my bills and ca n't seem to get anyone .
0	i ended up leaving a message for call back .
0	seki should install an on- line payment system like some.of the other medical organizations .
0	i am receiving invoices when i paid in full on my visit ! ! !
0	so annoying ... ... and the prescription is the worst i have ever had .
0	they tried fixing it and still not right !
0	dont go there ! !
0	do not go to this place .
0	it takes three to four weeks to get your glasses .
0	and the prescription was not right .
0	i paid over $ 700 and the prescription is not right .
0	i 'm 61 years old and have worn glasses for over 20 years .
0	this is the worst prescription i have ever had .
0	pros : friendly staff , state-of-the-art equipment and gadgets .
0	cons : everything else !
0	thanks but no thanks !
0	i rest my case : http : //www.smartmoney.com/plan/health-care/dentists-drill-for-dollars/
0	when asked why , '' well i can guarantee it 's fine `` .
0	with him being the only doc i 've seen/primary care for about a month .
0	i have had my glasses for about 2 years .
0	they look more like some film is coming off .
0	i had to beg them to replace them the last time .
0	now it 's doing it again .
0	they said there is no film on them .
0	she will not give you a straight answer for price .
0	she is a con artist .
0	she will keep on calling you honey and honey that with broken english .
0	she will also try to use her broken english to cheat you with price .
0	what a shame because frank was very good .
0	find a different place to work for frank .
0	i got there and the receptionist was very nice and accommodating .
0	i expect to see a chiropractor 2-3 times a week for my current issue .
0	i 'm not going to wait this long each time .
0	came here with my husband who has neck pain from a car accident .
0	this dr is clearly about the money , not about the injury .
0	he should be there to treat your injury , not push attorneys .
0	walked out and wo n't look back .
0	$ 275 in copays equals to zero functioning glasses at optic gallery .
0	i visited the office to request a pair of prescription sunglasses back in may .
0	they recommended single vision glasses with eyezen and polarized .
0	when these glasses arrived i could n't even see thru them .
0	it was like everything was fluid .
0	they repeated the lens order just to have the same effect .
0	the doctor double checked the prescription and recommended progressive lenses .
0	when i returned to optic gallery after struggling with the glasses for a week .
0	do n't go here if you 're paying cash .
0	that 89 dollar coupon is a scam .
0	they told me i needed a `` deep cleaning '' .
0	`` how much is it ? ''
0	`` that 'll be shown in your treatment plan . ''
0	i laughed at it , and then walked out .
0	did the work in one cleaning .
0	cost : $ 95 .
0	we found a tiny table .
0	the server asked for my cc i gave it to him .
0	where 's the card ? ``
0	asked me this so rudely ! ! !
0	he eventually finds my card and charged me for someone else 's food .
0	nobody has yet to call me and i still have charges on my card .
0	she made me feel like i was a bother to her .
0	i gave her my work order then she said you fasting ?
0	she need to learn more on how customer service works very unfriendly .
0	everyone there was polite and good with my 2 year old son .
0	my problem rested in the cost .
0	it was $ 162 for a `` cleaning , exam and flouride . ''
0	we were in the exam room for maybe 8 minutes .
0	went there on 12-4-2017 due to severe pain in my left elbow .
0	could not bend my arm under any circumstances .
0	so he just took `` straight away '' shots of the elbow .
0	2 1/2 hours wasted .
0	`` never again ! ''
0	i was guided to this practice when my usual doctor retired from medicine .
0	the woman i spoke to on the phone was terry .
0	terry 's attitude through the entire phone call was snappy .
0	she cut me off every time i started to speak .
0	i signed in and was given the usual paperwork .
0	it made it extremely hard to hear what terry was saying .
0	oh yeah , god forbid you have to explain something twice .
0	you do not know the specific circumstances surrounding my situation .
0	her lecturing me made me feel even more anxious .
0	i was so glad it was over .
0	when i went to pay i had to go to terry .
0	funny , when she was taking my payment she was remarkably pleasant .
0	this place just made me feel so uncomfortable .
0	***went to pick up my prescription today , dr. stephens prescribed the wrong pill .
0	do not go here , it 's an utter disgrace .
0	did not provide adequate instructions pre-surgery .
0	had to wait 2+ hours after scheduled start time to start the surgery .
0	i scored a groupon for i think $ 39 for a hour .
0	the facility is clean , very new and well appointed .
0	walking out was just like walking in , just a bit cleaner .
0	the receptionist was unfriendly , and very short in her answers .
0	really did not seem to care about anything .
0	went back to see the doctor , very impersonal .
0	i 've never felt so used before .
0	worst of all , i feel like i 'm in worse pain than before .
0	i only went to them because they were close to me at the time .
0	next time i will travel to what i see as the better location .
0	i really wanted to like this place .
0	i went to the dentist and they took an xray .
0	my husband specifically informed them on the phone to look for an abscess .
0	this all happened last week .
0	well flash forward to this week and my pain is increasing .
0	i was unhappy about this but i trusted them .
0	i thought wow , this must be tmj possibly .
0	i was in severe , severe pain .
0	how did your dentist miss this ?
0	you need to find a new one immediately . '
0	he then got me into a dentist to perform an emergency root canal .
0	how cherrington saw none of this is beyond me .
0	stay away ! ! !
0	i have never in my life heard of such nonsense !
0	i was waiting for my pedicure as this was going on .
0	this is so wrong and cruel .
0	stay far away from this office
0	we had to tell her this & avoid re-filling patient information .
0	i went last year and the girls were incredibly rude and unhelpful .
0	i ignored them and did n't complain .
0	i also wo n't be going back .
0	i thought `` sure why not '' and this place had good reviews .
0	no foot included which was weird considering it was a reflexology specialized place .
0	dropped two more dollars and got out of there .
0	i will not recommend this place .
0	their appointment system is sham .
0	they never keep to their appointment time .
0	you wait like 40-45 minutes before you are called in .
0	then they will make you wait at the dentists chair for another 20-30 mins .
0	my wife went twice and it was same story of long wait times .
0	dentists are no good either on both bedside manners and medical treatment .
0	they are rude , start treatment without telling you what they are doing .
0	we had to go in again to get the same problem fixed .
0	lilly , .. the makeup tattooing lady was very unprofessional .
0	it was painful as well and she said it would not be .
0	i 'm very very dissappointed in my experience with lilly .
0	and she was rude and also very argumentitive .
0	not ones that are rude and money hungry .
0	we were seated immediately , no menu .
0	we looked at the girl and made eye contact .
0	we watched the other girl make 3 smoothies .
0	we looked at other people looking back at us knowingly .
0	eye contact again with the hostess , waitress , whatever -- nothing .
0	17 minutes later we left .
0	we never even saw a menu .
0	they dont have a separate table for body massage .
0	only foot massage chair that lies down .
0	not what im used to from cali .
0	the front lady was also very rude with her attitude .
0	came in to see a pa , she was fine .
0	peggy at the front desk however has grown quite unpleasant .
0	she said , `` no , there will be no switching .
0	she was 12 and they cancelled her .
0	i felt badly for her .
0	if you do n't care , do n't do patient care !
0	i also had another time when i had a diagnostic mammogram to be ordered .
0	i called back for 3 months before the radiology center finally received it .
0	i ended up needing surgery !
0	do n't waste your time seeing dr. nahkle .
0	he might be knowledgeable but i never saw it .
0	his bedside manner is deplorable .
0	i waited 2 weeks for nothing .
0	worst experience with a doctor .
0	i hate that this information is not updated .
0	yelp , can you be taking businesses down that are not around any more ?
0	i 've gotten an mri before and paid a small copay .
0	these people do n't care either they are just paid to take your money .
0	go somewhere else before you visit this corporation .
0	a few weeks ago i stroll into whole foods looking for some supplements .
0	not a head nod , no eye contact , nothing .
0	perhaps my expectations are too high for this establishment .
0	so i wander around looking at items and looking for my supplement .
0	i 'm asking too much are n't i ?
0	i need to become a whole foods snob , right ?
0	well the cashier was n't the nicest .
0	the wait at this office is the worst .
0	i waited over 1.5 hours to get in and i had an appt .
0	i made appointment for beyond fabulous facial .
0	came on time and confirmed with the front desk .
0	i needed to get cash since everything fell out of my wallet at home .
0	a big fee upfront and then an additional fee that your bank charges you .
0	i had a cornea transplant done by dr. dow 3 years ago .
0	he also did a cataract in my eyes at the same time .
0	he managed to well my iris to the lens with the laser .
0	he did seem to think this was an issue .
0	his answer to everything was just get a contact lens .
0	i was recommended by an optometrist to go see another doctor for a consultation .
0	i would let dr. dow lance a boil on my dog 's ass .
0	probably my fourth time going there .
0	still contemplating whether i give them a second chance or just move on .
0	my husband found his massage satisfactory and it was still a good price .
0	this place is a joke .
0	they have one person in the office .
0	she is trying to check everyone in and do all the testing .
0	if you have time on your hands this is your place
0	the fees they charge is a complete rip-off .
0	this is a scam .
0	these guys are crooks .
0	dr. damian is inconsiderate and unprofessional .
0	my first appointment i waited 4 hours to be seen .
0	the staff was not very pleasant either .
0	if you complain they make you feel like you did something wrong .
0	if i could i 'd give no star i would .
0	supervisor was rude when returning an item .
0	threw my groceries i was purchasing around .
0	worst pharmacy ever ! !
0	my doctor sent a prescription for an antiobiotic to this pharmacy on thursday .
0	when that pharmacy tried to fill the prescription , guess what ? ? ? ?
0	they could n't because cvs had already filled it on friday .
0	i 'm only thankful that the prescription was not life or death !
0	do not go here .
0	deceptive business practices in place .
0	do not sign up for trial or sign any contracts .
0	i repeat do not do business here !
0	expect to pay a ton if you go here .
0	i 've never paid so much after insurance for an xray .
0	we went there for suspected hip dysplasia .
0	my daughter is fine but my bank account is not .
0	we will not be going back , unless i want to go bankrupt .
0	she used way too much lotion .
0	very sloppy and seemed like their routine could use some straightening up .
0	the gilbert office was booked so we were referred to the chandler office .
0	two things that i would assume to be common since .
0	2.5 hours total time out for 1 newborn doctors appointment .
0	be prepared to wait an hour after your appointment time before you get in .
0	also , everyone in the waiting room was complaining about waiting so long .
0	office staff is rude as well .
0	i really should 've looked at the reviews before coming here .
0	all the other complaints are very similar to mine .
0	i was one of those people .
0	i came in they were extremely nice and took care of me .
0	i had a tooth that needed to be pulled that was very loose .
0	so i told them i would start there .
0	let 's get my tooth pulled and see how i feel after .
0	the only problem i had was my loose tooth .
0	i just left it alone .
0	i controlled what would happen and i 'm okay now .
0	but just today my wife went in to have two teeth pulled .
0	for 3 teeth ( implants ) they were charging 10,000 with insurance .
0	everything is always put on the screen for us to see .
0	with a final number of almost 3,000 for 3 plastic teeth .
0	when asked how the number jumped so high .
0	they should try to be more understanding to what the client is going through .
0	they clearly have a problem with customer service as well as ripping customers off .
0	they are very nice as long you pay what ever they ask .
0	we will never come back here again .
0	i hope this helps others .
0	just pay attention and ask questions .
0	it 's not fair to over price and take advantage of customers .
0	the staff said that there was not an appointment available for 2 months .
0	she was absolutely horrible .
0	i had a horrible experience with this office .
0	i wanted to try their another flavor but they would not honor their coupon .
0	what poor customer service .
0	pinching penny 's just to loose a good customer .
0	got one filling fixed at the new place for 150 bucks .
0	and if you have kids , do n't even think about it .
0	i would give a `` 0 '' if i could !
0	are you serious ! ! ? ?
0	ca n't wait to finally be in a new office !
0	she kept leaving during my massage .
0	we paid for a 70 minute massage and it was less than an hour .
0	then when we were leaving the lady told me to tip her more .
0	do not go to this sleezy place .
0	so many other reflexology joints that are worth it .
0	i guess they do n't need my business !
0	they wo n't match prices .
0	their version of customer service = conceited indifference .
0	stopped by here today for some protein powder .
0	they have a great selection of products crammed into this little spot .
0	and , the staff seems really knowledgeable about supplements too .
0	their response : i was waved off with contempt .
0	but , it 's my six dollars , and why waste it unnecessarily ?
0	i 'm sure you can figure it out .
0	i went here for a crown and i never saw the same dentist twice .
0	the first one did the mold .
0	he drilled the back of the front teeth and left them feeling awful .
0	now my bite is off and ruining my front teeth alignment .
0	i am going to another dentist to hopefully get this corrected .
0	they have their money and that is all they are concerned about .
0	i am warning anyone considering on going here to not go .
0	it is awful ! !
0	they also try to up sell you every chance they get .
0	most of my fees were paid by my insurance and wsib .
0	the clinic could have pulled my report for my contact info .
0	this place is terrible i do n't recommend it !
0	i do n't not recommend this place what so ever ! ! !
0	was going to make an appointment .
0	i got an awful first impression of whoever was on the phone .
0	she sounded irritable , gave me one word answers and just sounded completely unwelcoming .
0	i think her name was jessica or something .
0	you just lost a customer .
0	detoxification is not good .
0	you wear a weird wristband connected to some machine that does seemingly nothing .
0	abc of massages is direct contact .
0	the owner gave me a sour look and said it was too low .
0	within a month , both nose pieces broke .
0	i 've never had this happen on any frames before .
0	i was required to drink 32 oz of water 1 hr before my test .
0	now it 's been 90 minutes since i drank the water .
0	mother nature is calling and they do n't care here .
0	with all of the skilled doctors they supposedly have -- whats the point ?
0	this dentist office is the worst .
0	that was the last straw for me .
0	this dentist is only there for show since the technicians do all the work .
0	any place is better than this dentist office !
0	after several years he closed his small practice and moved to cardiovascular consultants .
0	cvc could not give me the required reports and information .
0	cust service not friendly .
0	a place u dread to have to go .
0	understaffed in all areas .
0	i would never come back .
0	i love my primary barbara hoose , but i will nvr come back here .
0	charged my card on file without my permission which caused me to overdraft .
0	i came to this salon because of the high ratings .
0	they even offered me a discount since i was unhappy with my french pedi .
0	the facility is clean and has a very relaxing atmosphere .
0	one of the lines came out slanted .
0	the lines on some of the toes vary in thickness .
0	overall just not very clean or neat .
0	i did n't want to take the chance .
0	so perhaps the other services are good ; i honestly do n't know .
0	what i would n't recommend is getting any french mani or pedi there .
0	the staff are all friendly which makes an office visit much more pleasant .
0	i will not return to even try to have them fix it .
0	better to cut and run .
0	wish i had been a yelp user before i went there .
0	if i could give 0 stars i would .
0	they were booked but said they would call if any cancellations .
0	they sent a reminder text on the sunday and again on the monday .
0	i thought ok this is great !
0	i have never done this treatment and was really looking forward to it .
0	then she says can you come thursday instead ?
0	like my time and my appointment was not important or a priority .
0	i said no and why are you cancelling my appointment ?
0	i will take my time and my money elsewhere .
0	beware..this is how they treat new customers .
0	i 'm sure they are all very nice people .
0	but i should of walked out when i had the chance .
0	i scheduled a chem peel at the last minute on a saturday .
0	finally i get in to see the person i had the appt with .
0	she was really nice but was having an off day it seemed .
0	then she started going `` serum '' crazy .
0	like serum after serum after serum .
0	one was a vitamin c serum .
0	and it turned me oompa loompa orange .
0	but all the serums start coming off and its just falling off in chunks .
0	gave me a .25 oz sample size and charged me $ 5 for it .
0	my skin did look pretty good .
0	and the next day it was tight and dry .
0	but i never peeled .
0	and that $ 5 lotion ?
0	instead of peel , i broke out like a mo fo .
0	i 'm going to try a dermalogist instead .
0	good night pediatrics gets no stars from me !
0	what happened to you good night pediatrics ? ! ?
0	we have been coming to good night peds since they opened .
0	our last visit was horrible .
0	staff is so unfriendly with no personality .
0	dr gave us 5 minutes of her time and left .
0	plus they misdiagnosed my daughter !
0	do not bring your children here .
0	they really scraped the bottom of the barrel when hiring staff here !
0	not going back there again !
0	worst of all , his hands reeked too , as he is a smoker .
0	could hardly move the entire day today .
0	unfortunately , it was an experience i would want to forget forever and ever .
0	the longer i wanted my nails i it would be 10 $ extra ?
0	vacationing from hawaii and i can find better services in hawaii .
0	i 've been with this doctor for the last 5 years .
0	i do n't know what happened but i can not book an appointment anymore .
0	the appointment was made for the next day .
0	dr. vazquez was so , so rude .
0	wish i could do more than just write a bad review .
0	she 's the best ! !
0	this place has horrible service in pharmacy !
0	! ! ! ! ! warning ! ! ! ! ! !
0	if you value your limbs do not get seen by dr. robert evans .
0	he should not be considered a doctor .
0	he and everyone in his office are below terrible !
0	let me break down what happened to my dad , in a nutshell .
0	keep in mind my father has diabetes .
0	two days later it is now oozing puss !
0	this was her response : `` looks infected .
0	needs oral antibiotics no doubt .
0	higher infection risk with diabetes too of course . ''
0	evan 's assistant says it is not infected .
0	we are irate at this point and take him straight to the e.r .
0	to see a competent doctor .
0	i would not recommend robert evans or anyone at his office .
0	if you choose to , see him at your own risk .
0	side note- the er we went to was mercy gilbert and highly recommend them .
0	i agree with maria p- the schedule reflects their care for their patients .
0	i always here these stories yet trusted their recommendation .
0	i would give it 0 stars if i could .
0	they can barely handle making appointments .
0	had an appointment yesterday for the first time as a new patient .
0	after an hour wait i saw the doctor .
0	if we did we would be out of a job !
0	worst customer service ever !
0	do n yourself a favor and find a different group !
0	needless to say , i will not return to this office ever again !
0	great experience with the optometrist !
0	that was not an issue at all .
0	it was the `` upsell '' of items when looking into purchasing glasses .
0	we walked and shopped around .
0	anytime that i can save $ 390 dollars i am going to .
0	seems shady and i wo n't trust them or be back again .
0	i called a total of 6 times .
0	the first two times i was disconnected .
0	i hung up and called back , three more times .
0	never got through to anyone again .
0	i guess that 's too much work .
0	lesson learned : always yelp first ! !
0	finally went here to see what it was all about ... .very disappointed .
0	it was a very messy , dirty store and extremely small aisles .
0	they sell a lot of expired products .
0	it was rude , so i brought my stuff to another cashier .
0	i would rather go to tutti frutti where the prices are a lot better .
0	you can be saving up to $ 5- $ 10 at times .
0	like some of the other negative reviewers , i also share a similar complaint .
0	their thing is to always get payment regardless .
0	my 9 yr old son needed to have a tooth extracted because it broke .
0	that was on 1/2/13 .
0	they would ve gotten payment from me and from the insurance .
0	my 2 kids had dental appointments tuesday and i was running late .
0	stephen answered the phone when i called to say we would be late .
0	i asked him how much that was .
0	he told me $ 25 per kid , so that would be $ 50 .
0	if we were one minute late we would be charged a late fee .
0	we ended up not keeping our appointment with that outrageousness .
0	they were just too lazy to do this .
0	i paid about $ 90 for the services .
0	the insurance paid $ 113.81 .
0	brooke told me that the late fees were $ 70 , not $ 50 .
0	i told her that that is what stephen told me they were .
0	she said he is wrong and i owe the $ 70 .
0	we have been going there for 2 yrs or more .
0	so , we had to reschedule .
0	dr. cotton had to fly out the day of our appointment .
0	our appointment was already set .
0	brooke should ve honored what stephen said .
0	rather , it appears that they are upset at me and just finding reasons .
0	yes , this is a pediatric dentistry .
0	when you have kids , things happen , but that doesn t matter .
0	for those good reviews , well , wait until you have an issue .
0	it will not be pleasant .
0	me : nope receptionist : did they tell you they were running late ?
0	even my experience with the closed mri was much more friendly and gentle .
0	here it was sorry lady .
0	bah i will not be back .
0	this place is only good for people who ca n't afford insurance .
0	i do n't know what the fuss over fresh is all about .
0	we walked in and were squeeeeezed into our seats .
0	it was very uncomfortable .
0	the food is blah as well .
0	boyfriend ordered the thai curry ( buddha ) bowl .
0	i ordered a the phytosalad .
0	i probably preferred the salad to the curry bowl .
0	they were both ok. i would not come again .
0	i went to this dentist for a regular check-up/cleaning as a new patient .
0	a new client should clear their whole day for this place .
0	what dentist keeps a new patient waiting 30 minutes ?
0	there were no other clients in the office .
0	how desperate can a place be ? ! ?
0	i will not be going back to this place .
0	no dental appointment should ever take 2 hours .
0	they have to keep up their state of the art equipment ... ..
0	do not go here ! ! ! !
0	they do not care ! ! ! !
0	i came here & was being treated by dr. jung .
0	i called in last week to tell them i still need my prescription .
0	here it is a week later & still no prescription .
0	why is there no doctor there on a friday ?
0	if no one can help me ?
0	thanks for caring about my mental stability ! ! !
0	oh and btw , not the first time they did n't send a prescription .
0	if its brand new it should be good right ? ''
0	this was probably the single worst dental experience i 've ever had .
0	the one good thing was that i got an appointment for the next day .
0	good quickly turned to bad when the assistant came in to take my x-rays .
0	after the cleaning came the real pain .
0	the dentist came in to do some drilling and fill in a cavity .
0	ive had a torn meniscus for a year and then he just says reschedule .
0	we have gone here for years .
0	they are very disorganized and lack customer service skills .
0	as for the providers , the wait time is unacceptable .
0	yes , we have the appointment cards on these and they clearly state 8/14/2018 .
0	no , we never received a call that their appointments had changed .
0	his appointment was confirmed for 8/14/2018 at 8:30 a.m. and no labs were needed .
0	appointment was confirmed a week before ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	i called the office on 8/14 and asked for the office manager .
0	as of 5:28 p.m. 8/15/2018 i have not received a returned phone call .
0	8/27/2018 at 10:17 a.m. my mom received a call from kim .
0	she said she was the office manager .
0	what happened to tammy and/or shannon ?
0	anyway , she explained and felt as nothing was going to happen .
0	i laid into her about the issues .
0	my husband felt dr. stern an adequate provider .
0	my father did not like him at all .
0	the problems in a nutshell : not gentle , not thorough !
0	unfortunately , this was to the detriment of my dental health .
0	the inflammation went away on its own but came back a few months later .
0	the next time i went in , i told them about it .
0	as well , i had fillings twice .
0	i have a hard time opening wide - it really hurts my jaw .
0	that 's when i realized i had the wrong dentist .
0	i switched to another dentist - female that also works on children .
0	they found two spots where this had happened .
0	now i know - a bad dentist is a really big deal !
0	i need to speak to mary montes .
0	she has no clue of my situation or the insurance system , apparently .
0	my name is joy alberico .
0	i would give them zero stars if i could .
0	why would anyone want to go to this place ?
0	i have never encountered such rudeness .
0	the receptionist was condescending and belligerent .
0	do not waste your time calling .
0	you wo n't regret it .
0	she 's thorough and she listens and the kids really like her .
0	we really liked her .
0	they treat every interaction with you like you are inconveniencing them .
0	the appointments average two hours .
0	our quickest appointment was one hour .
0	our longest was three .
0	( well appointments , not sick . )
0	i wish dr garcia would get new employees .
0	until she does do n't go here .
0	can not say enough about how disappointed i am in this chain practice .
0	i would not recommend this disrespectful practice to anyone .
0	thank goodness i called because they informed me i did n't have an apt !
0	i said , i never canceled .
0	finally i said what can we do to fix this .
0	she was still focused on reviewing her `` notes '' .
0	she again read the `` notes '' that said i canceled .
0	i had a breast augmentation and lift.this doctor was charming and i was inexperienced .
0	a doctor not telling a patient of what could go wrong seems like malpractice .
0	i would never recommend anyone to this doctor
0	this store is a sh ! thole .
0	the staff is friendly if you can find them .
0	the company chooses not to employ anyone at this location .
0	the shelves are picked through and not restocked .
0	the merchandise looks tired and aged .
0	if you continue to not serve our community appropriately .
0	please shut down and let another group service us .
0	did i mention my wife was high risk ?
0	there were complications which i attribute to the long wait .
0	do n't do it ! ! ! ! !
0	can i give zero stars ? ? ! !
0	get ready to be treated like a transaction rather than a patient .
0	it 's like they 're all robots .
0	no one cares if there is an issue outside of their daily standard procedures .
0	it 's as if they will do whatever to charge a patient extra money .
0	i rescheduled to april 7th .
0	no apology , no compassion- he just acted like a moron-what a jackass !
0	he was clueless and apathetic at best !
0	they will not get another penny from me !
0	horrible customer experience ! ! !
0	walked out not buying anything .
0	i have never been disappointed at t.h.c the holistic center
0	i saw dr. torres .
0	i had heard he was a decent doctor .
0	i was not satisfied with his service or that of the entire office .
0	he told me it was n't necessary because it was n't my history .
0	she did n't answer any of my questions or give me any information .
0	they scheduling person never has any clue what is going on either .
0	they are not that friendly either .
0	i would never do business with this company again .
0	however , my major complaint is that i was not given my prescription .
0	eventually i was in for a contact fitting and asked for a print out .
0	i had the same issue with my contact fitting .
0	needless to say no one called me back .
0	skip these guys and go elsewhere .
0	this place does not even deserve one star .
0	i 've come 2 times .
0	and another 20 mins in the room before seeing the doctor .
0	she has taken her phone out 2 times to google things .
0	i know doctors do n't know everything but that just is unprofessional .
0	i 'm disgusted and so disappointed with this clinic .
0	it 's not only me .
0	waste of time and money
0	pushed my sons dairy allergy off as dry skin/eczema .
0	took him in today .
0	he 's been sick and i was just diagnosed with double pneumonia .
0	he diagnosed my son with croup .
0	i knew this was n't true so i got a second opinion .
0	my son has pneumonia as well !
0	you are a god damn idiot ! !
0	and i will never be back here .
0	think twice about bringing your kids to this shitty place !
0	i never once had my lower back touched ! !
0	horrible experience through and through .
0	first off , they are remodeling and it 's confusing which door to enter .
0	root canal was done wrong by dr trujillo .
0	he did n't numb me enough and started working and i screamed and cried .
0	there was no laughing gas .
0	she said she would call me `` in the next few days '' .
0	it was wednesday and now it 's tuesday of the next week .
0	after calling today , the receptionist got back to me and left a message .
0	my urgent care dr said he would never prescribe 800mg ibuprofen ! ! )
0	and finally , there was a cockroach in the back of the new office .
0	i want my money back there is no appointment with specialist .
0	i needed an x-ray on my right wrist .
0	i called 4 times to schedule an appointment .
0	when i finally got through - `` oh , x-rays are walk in .
0	no appointment necessary '' .
0	i have always received speedy service at valley .
0	that was a 5.5 hour wait .
0	this place solicited me to leave were i was to come to them !
0	i did not seek them out they solicited me out !
0	what a big mistake ! ! ! ! !
0	i have severe hip pain from radiation i had 2 cordizone shots scheduled .
0	i called my provided they said i didnt need prior .
0	we had a bad conversation i got rude and so did they !
0	a bunch of nit wits !
0	this post is more about the office itself than the doctor .
0	then i waited over an hour to see the dr. beisbroeck .
0	the office also failed to even apologize about this whole horrific experience .
0	i re-explained the situation and said that i was frustrated about my whole experience .
0	if i could give them zero stars i would !
0	yep this practice is horrible .
0	always wait 30 minutes past appt time , constant turnover .
0	front staff is clueless , never follow up .
0	weeks to get referrals , etc .
0	run do n't walk away from this place .
0	i do n't recall ever getting a prescription filled on time by this pharmacy .
0	every time you call , it 's a different a excuse .
0	i had cool sculpting done without results .
0	i 'm 5 ' 3 and 124 at the start of the treatment .
0	sadly i see no results now 4 mths out .
0	i wish they would have said i would n't see results at the consultation .
0	the lack of results has made me depressed .
0	it was an extremely expensive $ 1200 lesson on body exceptance .
0	i 'm not perfect but i 'm pretty damn lucky to look this way .
0	also ... .thank goodness high waisted jeans are in fashion
0	in hindsight i 'm kicking myself for not driving elsewhere .
0	a few weeks down the road however , the pain was back .
0	so i call them back .
0	i went in for my appointment and everything actually went amazingly smoothly .
0	they told me the only part my insurance does n't cover is $ 154 .
0	all is good right ?
0	nope , sorry , your insurance did n't pay .
0	okay ... so i call my insurance company .
0	so i call the dentist office back and explain this to them .
0	`` well , do you want to get paid or not ? ''
0	well , they failed to put most of their info on it .
0	in the meantime the jerks try to send me to collections .
0	they send me nasty letters in the mail about every two weeks .
0	every time i call and they deny sending anything .
0	i have the freaking letter in my hand !
0	bottom line , do not ever go here to get anything done .
0	their front desk and billing staff are horrible .
0	the x-ray tech was really nice .
0	it took forever to book a family doctor .
0	i went in for a couple of times for walk in .
0	i was pretty upset with that visit .
0	but i am willing to give it second try .
0	i was surprise they did n't tell me when i booked my appointment .
0	i suppose this is not the first time it happened .
0	and this only means i have to wait however long to book another appointment .
0	also i never get a call back for an alternative arrangement .
0	i do n't argue further guess it 's not a good fit for me .
0	not at all impressed with the gilbert office on mercy .
0	not kid friendly or cozy environment- especially waiting room .
0	md mckenna not touchy feeling ( maybe a bad day ? )
0	and made us wait 25 min in the room until she came in .
0	then spent under 10 min with us .
0	chandler office is a better environment .
0	np was very helpful and nice .
0	a lot better service and attention .
0	these 5 star reviews have to be fake .
0	i found bow valley massage online and thought i 'd give them a try .
0	my massage was with a lady named linda .
0	what i got was a very light massage with her elbows only .
0	i do n't think her hands ever touched me .
0	i will not be returning .
0	their webste evn advertises lower than emergency tom costs .
0	i went twice with my sin and paid 160.00 more than i planned .
0	do not go here to save $ $ $ $ $
0	the worst women 's healthcare you will ever receive .
0	i will never return to this women 's `` healthcare '' facility .
0	i was incredibly disappointed with this place .
0	it was so ... wrong .
0	i did n't but i did want to get out of there fast .
0	i will continue driving to my favorite place on the westside .
0	it 's cheaper too .
0	seriously misled ... 4 stars ?
0	very disappointing visit for pch .
0	we have never had a bad experience with them until last night .
0	the lack of communication and organization was sad .
0	all the while my son does not even have a diaper covering him .
0	the school itself , is another story .
0	the plumbing was always out of order .
0	water was flooding the hallway and classes had to be cancelled several times .
0	i do not know if it has been fixed since i 've been there .
0	we got yelled at that it was not professional .
0	of course i do n't look like it .
0	but that was n't allowed .
0	our lab had freezing water as well .
0	the bullying was horrible .
0	so much for their no tolerance on bullying .
0	i never thought too much about which dentist i go to .
0	unfortunately , i needed a deep cleaning .
0	i was quoted a certain price after they looked at my insurance .
0	i 'm just out of college and a public school teacher .
0	i could not afford this !
0	the actual dentist was an absolute jerk to me .
0	basically insulting my intelligence !
0	the dental hygienist actually apologized for him !
0	she was professional , thorough , and extremely nice !
0	she was the only reason i stayed as long as i had .
0	i do n't understand what the motivation is for this .
0	she demanded i pay full price and ca n't use the voucher .
0	something came up and i asked to reschedule .
0	she refused to let me reschedule .
0	i 'm sorry i could n't make it .
0	this was such an unprofessional experience and just wasted $ 139 .
0	the procedure took all of 2 minutes .
0	felt like was behind a curtain in in emergency room .
0	the photos on yelp and the web site are deceiving .
0	the video was taken someplace else .
0	could n't do much with my feet in a bucket .
0	some people like this deep stuff , but not me .
0	next i was escorted to another room with curtains for a body message .
0	they were under towels but it was too awkward for my taste .
0	i felt like i was walking through the men 's room to leave .
0	i wo n't be returning .
0	horribly disorganized place , do n't even bother !
0	complete lack of customer service .
0	mind you they still have 15 minutes before the store closes .
0	never again will i go to massage envy at rock springs .
0	the service has really gone downhill .
0	all the good therapists have left .
0	trying out boca park next week .
0	happened to you ? ? ?
0	i hope you got a restraining order against him ' ... type of shiner .
0	my eye was/is literally black .
0	and my face wo n't move to this there is no excuse .
0	there was also no follow up call as was promised .
0	on the up side .
0	the facility was clean and cherry .
0	the front staff very nice .
0	dr t ... . forgive me ... .. i strayed ... ...
0	my first appointment was great !
0	i left feeling very optimistic and excited to finally be rid of my allergies .
0	complete waste of time and i ended up late to work .
0	really makes me feel cared about .
0	one of my concerns is that i 'm dealing with depression .
0	for the month i was on it , the results were great .
0	as a result , i am now looking for a new medical office .
0	i waited for the doctor for an hour and 45 minutes .
0	they always seem to run behind .
0	parking is horrendous too .
0	i never want to go back .
0	how can i rate them 0 ?
0	they 're greedy and do n't listen to me .
0	i 've switched psychiatrists with no hope .
0	i 've been misdiagnosed for years as well .
0	how many people have they killed ?
0	do n't expect to be seen anytime near your appointment .
0	thought i could drop in on my lunch .
0	do n't , do n't , do n't go here !
0	especially an 1 1/2 hours before they close !
0	avoid this place ! !
0	i do n't recommend coming here .
0	i waited almost an hour after my appointment and still was n't helped .
0	dr. lokey was rude and condescending .
0	she made snide remarks on multiple occasions .
0	our family and our friends have since changed and are much happier .
0	save your time if planning to donate goods .
0	i called them ... they give an all day window for pick-up..great !
0	next , driver shows up and takes out a branch on my tree..wonderful .
0	now they start to examine and cherry pick what they want .
0	none of this was worthless junk mind you .
0	do n't waste your time with this chapter in cleveland .
0	call goodwill ... they 're helpful and grateful for donations .
0	this office is terrible .
0	i was in the hospital and saw a dr from this group .
0	i was told to schedule a stress test when i was released .
0	well that was impossible .
0	so i left without scheduling .
0	do you know what 's slower and more inefficient than calgary laboratory services ?
0	very , very disappointing service .
0	i went last fall for a teeth cleaning .
0	today i went in for a teeth cleaning that i scheduled 4 weeks ago .
0	i never got a phone call , email or text from them .
0	now it 's too late to schedule anywhere else .
0	i 'm very disappointed in the lack of professionalism .
0	i 'll be choosing a more reliable dentist from now on .
0	that 's where the positives end .
0	i went there for a skin check by the doctor .
0	she performed cryosurgery , which has left a noticeable scar on my face .
0	i wo n't be going back .
0	this is the worst office i have been to .
0	be aware if you are on medicaid , they are the worst mco ever .
0	you will end up paying cash for every doctor you see .
0	whatever doctor we find on their list tells us to pay our own bill .
0	it happened every time .
0	avoid them ! ! !
0	once you pick them , your nightmare will never end ! !
0	i ca n't believe i have to give at least a star ! !
0	this should be a negative star place ! ! !
0	i just got out not even 5 minutes ago .
0	then we wait for the doctor to come right , ? like usual .
0	by this time its maybe 3:40pm .
0	these kids are 12 6 7 4 and just got out of school .
0	there hungry and cranky !
0	and i have other things to do .
0	im sorry but i got other things to do and feed my kids .
0	then the doctor was only in there for less than 5 minutes .
0	if i could give this place a zero i would ! ! ! !
0	i went there one time .
0	er wait time was 5 hours .
0	spent a total of 16 hours in er ... staff extremely rude
0	it was like it wasnt the same doctor .
0	edit- they tried to fix the situation with a free massage .
0	i have yet to receive that massage .
0	i called my doctor to refer me somewhere else , never this place again .
0	soooo that pretty much means there is a bi-annual admin fee charged .
0	awful communication between staff , security , and visitors .
0	again , i had problems with security .
0	i explained i did n't have a vehicle to lock them up in .
0	they told me they do n't hold those items at the desk .
0	they scanned me with a wand and i went through .
0	the nurse explained it was okay .
0	30 minutes later while visiting security asks `` what 's in your pocket ? ''
0	i told him `` my wallet . ''
0	so i ask security `` why did the e.r say that i could ? ''
0	a female security guard asks `` who told you that ? ''
0	i told her `` you did . ''
0	because she was in the lobby when i first arrived with another security personal .
0	i gave her my wallet and told them they need better communication between staff/visitors .
0	he worked himself up during an outburst into an asthma attack .
0	i told her needed treatment , a nubulizer , an inhaler or something .
0	ca n't you see he 's having an asthma attack ? !
0	can you get someone ? !
0	he ca n't breathe ! ''
0	the doctor decided to do an x-ray on his lungs .
0	i am changing my review .
0	i still think dr. cotton is great with kids chairside .
0	first , they insisted that my daughter have nitrous oxide for sealants .
0	the cdc and the ada were at odds with this last i checked .
0	it causes fluorosis , and even the ada recognizes this .
0	to be clear , i 'm not anti-fluoride .
0	my kids get fluoride treatments , and i 'm ok with that .
0	agree with her , or disagree .
0	we were running a few minutes late for our appointment .
0	nine minutes to be exact , as i pulled into the parking spot outside .
0	two hours on the road was totally out of the question .
0	i was scheduled at 11:30 , and lunch apparently begins at noon .
0	i told her we 'd be finding a new dentist instead .
0	first off , it was nine minutes .
0	i 'm thinking they 'd have a pretty empty schedule .
0	running a practice is n't just about what happens in the treatment room .
0	did the 60 minutes foot massage .
0	not only it was the worst massage ever .
0	it was the most ridiculous experience ever .
0	the masseuse demanded a 30 % gratuity .
0	i have never heard such a thing .
0	lots of bells and whistles , not all necessary .
0	all the x-rays and photos of my teeth took forever and were torture .
0	my cleaning was pretty painful .
0	they were very careful and sweet w my son .
0	i do n't feel what they prescribed was necessary .
0	my husband had a horrible experience w them so we wo n't be back .
0	it 's time to change doctors .
0	my mother uses this doctor .
0	i think i will be reporting them .
0	this is not the only issue i have with this place .
0	the dentist , dr. kim blanding has no business being a dentist .
0	my so called well woman exam was a joke .
0	no introduction no pleasantries .
0	he gave me a breast exam and that 's it .
0	i would never recommend this doctor .
0	here is how my office visit went down .
0	arrived and filled out their paperwork .
0	one page asked all the usual medical questions .
0	office worker called me into a room .
0	took my contact lenses out - we ran some tests .
0	i am in an eye doctors office - right ?
0	i go into another room and run through the eye chart - lens tests .
0	then they dilate my pupils .
0	i sit in the waiting area -not too long .
0	go back into other room - dr runs more tests .
0	then they bring me back into the first room for another test .
0	she says - ok then you do n't need to take this test .
0	i tell them again - i ca n't see anything .
0	they said - oh - you are done with your exam .
0	can i put my contacts back in ?
0	the doctor came out and explained everything to me .
0	i paid and left .
0	i ended up buying them online for about $ 80 total .
0	i also had to call 2x to get them to fax me my prescription .
0	outrageous billing , especially considering service i received was just horrible .
0	i would not recommend going to them at all .
0	so why are they using this as a method to diagnose the problem ?
0	i have given this facility three tries .
0	first time was a 3 hour wait .
0	it was busy , so understandable that it could be that long .
0	but i could n't help but feel there was an extreme lack of urgency .
0	staff was ok. not bad , not great .
0	4 freaking hours of waiting till i saw a doctor .
0	while they were apologetic , it does n't excuse the experience .
0	my third and final visit is simply , my last .
0	what in the hell is going on at this place ?
0	it 's not some run down , pop up urgent care .
0	one tip for this place ... set better expectations with your patients .
0	update-i am still trying to resolve incorrect billing issues from 8 months ago .
0	the phone number is out of order .
0	no other information listed for another number .
0	waiting for a reply from groupon customer service .
0	the food is somewhat average .
0	black bean burrito was a 2/10 .
0	quinoa onion rings are pretty delish and the deserts are to die for .
0	this place made me feel like i was at the dmv !
0	they take their sweet time with their costumers sitting behind their desk .
0	they do n't even have a big selection to choose from !
0	well let me tell you !
0	do n't believe me ?
0	then go to pearl vision to compare the cost .
0	avoid this location at all cost !
0	staff is rude , inconsiderate , loses paperwork , very unprofessional !
0	there are several locations in town , visit another one !
0	this place will and has always reminded me of a used car lot .
0	it 's a franchise and the receptionists are friendly , fake and inexperienced .
0	not sure i will return !
0	i visited this urgent care in july of 2014 for dehydration .
0	i asked for a saline iv drip and the pa agreed .
0	i would not recommend this urgent care for anything beyond a prescription fill .
0	he then forgets to put my points for the two smoothies as well .
0	i 'll make sure not to come in when he 's there .
0	i honestly do n't even need to write a review .
0	just look at the ones already written .
0	completely speaks for itself .
0	i could n't understand one word the in-take person said at the counter .
0	please put someone at the counter customers can understand .
0	just tell everyone they need an appointment .
0	they just took people as they came in for appointments .
0	this place is terrible .
0	i work on the same industry i never seen an unorganized health facility .
0	high end optical store .
0	they did not understand my insurance benefits .
0	i am only giving one star because i ca n't give zero stars .
0	i did not put the iv in my arm !
0	plan on waiting 45 minutes even with an appointment booked in advance .
0	i got my nexplanon implant removed $ 234 .
0	i also got the depo shot $ 89 .
0	so why did they charge me $ 383 instead of $ 323 ? !
0	you knew i was getting both services from the beginning !
0	i was told 3 different times that it would be $ 323 !
0	i even asked when making my appointment if there was any other fees !
0	i would of just got the mirena if that is the case !
0	i think it is under new management .
0	was looking for a new pcp .
0	this is n't the place .
0	was early for appointment and had to wait over an hour .
0	front desk staff and intake staff friendly .
0	physician ( janet pragit ) was awful !
0	i needed prescription refills and brought in my old prescriptions .
0	then she proceeded to write one of my prescriptions for 2x/wk instead of 2x/mo .
0	they then billed my insurance company $ 370.02 !
0	if you value your health - stay away !
0	do not go here !
0	dr. robi burns was the most uncompassionate doctor i have ever dealt with .
0	not impressed with office at all .
0	it 's more like a free clinic than a doctors office .
0	transferred me to a another line .
0	i do n't have time for all of that , not returning .
0	secondly , they do n't do substitutions .
0	is n't the vegetarian mentality to love animals and eachother ?
0	or is the hippy kitchen staff too stoned to handle a distinction like that ?
0	the only thing fresh truly has to offer is the coolness factor .
0	love terry and dr tummala but have had recent issues with office staff .
0	i recently changed insurance plans and called to ask if they accepted my insurance .
0	i was told they did and scheduled my appt .
0	they never called my insurance and will not take responsibility for their mistake .
0	this practice looks down on mothers .
0	dr. scott firczak has no kids .
0	he compares raising his dogs to raising children .
0	he insults those that sacrifice so much .
0	there are tons of good chiropractors out there .
0	on another note : the parking lot is awful !
0	came to vegas last weekend to enjoy time off .
0	we bought the $ 29 figures it would a better deal .
0	there was no back massage like other places ive been too .
0	the worst part of themassage was on my feet .
0	i got 30 minutes of barely good massage and a foot massage to remember .
0	maybe next time i will pay regular price instead of using groupon .
0	you have been warned .
0	i 've been a patient of dr. wyse for several years .
0	there are some rare services or individuals that are worth the extra wait .
0	this , unfortunately , is not one of them .
0	such a big carrier with a huge number of subscribers is not accepted ?
0	i 'm sure they 've got their reasons but i 'm really disappointed !
0	the facililty was very clean and orderly .
0	i honestly do n't think the dentist knows what she 's doing with invisalign .
0	i 'm sorry , i just have to be honest .
0	i compared my teeth now versus before , sadly it is too late .
0	please save yourself the heartache of a bad outcome and go to another dentist .
0	i went because i was having a rapid heartbeat .
0	they saw me and determined it was n't an emergency .
0	really ? ? ? ?
0	they could n't have told me that at the beginning ?
0	i could have gone elsewhere .
0	anyway , the entire visit was $ 15,000+ .
0	it 's nothing but pure legal robbery .
0	they should be ashamed of themselves .
0	soup is rarely fresh .
0	seems like it has sat there for a while .
0	there was no one to help either .
0	will i be whole after i eat food from whole foods ?
0	she actually never said `` hello '' and never smiled .
0	ca n't say this was a good experience and i wo n't be back .
0	look for a doctor who thoroughly explains what she is doing and why .
0	i expected better quality of service during my visit but was very disappointed .
0	first problem is price .
0	you will be paying the highest prices anywhere .
0	dentists do n't last long here .
0	we were here two years and are working on our third dentist .
0	3rd problem : scheduling .
0	appointments are constantly cancelled and rescheduled weeks out .
0	i was trying to get my son 's treatment completed since march .
0	i also complained and requested that dr mugelsten ( the owner ) contact me .
0	not a big deal or red flag .
0	i said politely , `` to make an appointment . ''
0	she hung up on me .
0	they took my number and nothing ever happened .
0	at 4:00pm took my dog to stonecrest animal hospital .
0	we got in right away and the staff/doctor were awesome !
0	we had no issues !
0	hope my experience is a single , isolated incident .
0	i feel like a number here and have decided to go some where else .
0	i highly do not recommend this place .
0	do n't let yourself fall by all the toys they have in the clinic .
0	looks can be deceiving .
0	do n't trust this company/location .
0	no issues what so ever .
0	who does that ? ? ?
0	ironic i think not .
0	always get a second opinion ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	and preferably by someone who is not a scam artist .
0	i purchased a cartridge and two dab buckets ( bogo ) .
0	i drove back to the store with the hope of simply exchanging the cartridge .
0	not to mention , why does my 14 day allowance matter ?
0	all in front of an audience of people .
0	i 'm so embarrassed ...
0	all dr. hopkins does is sit in his office and collect his paycheck .
0	i even contacted the college of physicians and surgeons to file a complaint .
0	find a different doctor .
0	you deserve to have your health concerns addressed .
0	i called my insurance company & they verified everything on my card was correct .
0	they helped every single person who came through prior to getting my stuff done .
0	if you have a choice , steer clear of this gym turned frat house .
0	the only thing going for this gym is its location .
0	real attitude problems amongst its staff members .
0	you might even catch them talking behind your back right in front of you .
0	life is too short to be a wynn fitness member !
0	go at your own risk
0	the absolute worse pedicure i have every gotten - especially for $ 35 .
0	the gal actually cut my large toe by too aggressively using the callus pumas .
0	four days later it is finally healing .
0	pay the extra and go to one of the hotel spas .
0	this place is a no go .
0	when are day shift working relatives supposed to see patients ?
0	calloused and arbitrary much , are we ?
0	i ran fast after one initial visit .
0	and not let me stay with him .
0	i switched to boyne and she did n't even use laughing gas !
0	( and let me stay with him . )
0	she used her great bedside manner to put him at ease and distract him .
0	harder work than the easy way out of sedating .
0	food came out barely warm and mediocre .
0	it is vegetarian and vegan friendly but skip it if you have other options .
0	there is no dialog with her .
0	she barely listens and then tells you to let her talk .
0	my concern about side effects i am experiencing totally brushed aside .
0	she talked at me for most of appointment and barely let me talk .
0	if your looking for a good school to better your self run !
0	i went to this school in 2010 and it was very unprofessional .
0	so here i am with 6000 dollars in deat and no degree .
0	burst fracture of my l1 3 weeks ago .
0	had major back surgery and was told that hanger was `` world-class '' .
0	well not quite sure who made that decision for the `` world-class '' part .
0	brace was improperly delivered to me at the hospital .
0	it did n't fit properly and they sent someone to `` fix '' it .
0	then tells me `` appointments take two weeks '' .
0	i would never recommend hanger to anyone .
0	poor quality , poor attitude , and terrible service .
0	i visited pearl med spa because i received a coupon for a free facial .
0	when it was time to pay they charged me $ 12.99 plus tax .
0	$ 14 for a damn glass of juice ! !
0	also the daves killer bread is almost $ 2 more than frys .
0	bathrooms always have lavender soap .
0	at this point if yelp would let me put no stars i would !
0	this place is horrible ! ! !
0	which you would think is great right ?
0	i mean this is so unbelievable avoid at all costs .
0	these people are awful !
0	the company is run like uber or lyft without the professional service .
0	the drivers use their own private vehicles .
0	unethical , unprofessional , and unreliable .
0	stay away ! ! ! ! !
0	apparently they were on lunch break and never communicated this to us .
0	very unprofessional and will never recommend this office !
0	i have a love/hate relationship with the ubiquitous wal-mart .
0	and the prices are usually decent .
0	this was a bad move on their part !
0	my most recent bad experience there was recent .
0	beware on returning products ! ! ! !
0	a few months ago , i purchased an item at the fashion show mall .
0	i did n't like the product .
0	the manager or owner was so rude ! ! ! !
0	he got mad because i bought the item at fs mall .
0	he told me i should go to fs mall to return it .
0	i got there right when it opened .
0	buyer beware ! ! ! !
0	hopefully you will never have to return anything you buy here ! ! ! !
0	i will not be returning to this location !
0	the manager working on friday night 4/18/14 was very rude ! !
0	i had just given the coupon and knew it was in her register .
0	i then asked for a manager .
0	i said that is wrong .
0	most cashiers return your manufacture coupon if it is right in their register .
0	he then just walked away from me and did not resolve the problem .
0	later , i called the cvs i usually go to .
0	be careful about this when you are shopping in this store ! !
0	i found them to be rude , no bed side manners at all .
0	i do n't recommend this doctor or the staff .
0	i wanted to leave their immediately .
0	i was told sign the clip board and to take a seat .
0	i did n't get my paperwork until 8:20am and it was 6 pages long .
0	really frustrated by this time .
0	3 different people by this time ! ! !
0	and the third and final person once again ask me about xrays again .
0	can i say lost of communication again ... grrr !
0	the massage was excellent and my masseuse was amazing ! !
0	it was the `` manager '' my friends and i had a problem with .
0	i told him i already tipped and my masseuse nodded in agreement .
0	if that was the case , the tip was still within their expected range .
0	went there for a second opinion and what a shock .
0	that 's nearly $ 16,000 worth of work .
0	wanted to get it done within 1-2 weeks .
0	he does have lots of fancy equipment .
0	her immediate response was `` do you want to leave now ?
0	i have been with her for 3-4 years .
0	she was obviously peeved at getting feedback from a lowly customer .
0	waited over an hour and a half with 4 people in front of me .
0	receptionist was nice but that 's all .
0	no urgency with my 103 degree fever and chills .
0	i have seen dr. maduka and some of the physician assistants .
0	he has helped me so much with all of my pain problems .
0	so today , i went into the office to do so .
0	mercedes at the urgent care front desk was extremely rude and unprofessional .
0	she told me she would not even so much as show me my results .
0	she said she did n't care because she ca n't find them anyways .
0	so unprofessional and annoying .
0	total wait time in the lobby was about an hour .
0	( did not put me at ease .
0	he did n't really seem to take in what i was saying .
0	and based off asking me my previous experience just prescribed me something similar ?
0	not sure if i was properly helped like i could have been .
0	i wo n't be coming back to this location .
0	this place is so expensive .
0	which ended up cutting way too close to my wedding date .
0	this place is more affordable than others , but not good quality work .
0	i usually crack 6-7 , of 8 attempts elsewhere
0	ive been a patient for over 15 years .
0	i made an appointment for today .
0	when i woke up this morning our apt .
0	and then my phone service was also down .
0	and that i also was out of blood pressure meds .
0	weve had nothing but damaging storms where i live .
0	i have no control over this .
0	ive been a loyal patient for 15 years .
0	it really hurts my feelings .
0	for fifteen years ive always kept my appointments .
0	of course there have been times when circumstances have made me call to reschedule .
0	my sister has cancer .
0	no one to help her .
0	i dont know , why did they get upset .
0	they make me feel belittled .
0	and that im a bad person .
0	thats really sad after 15 years with dr. vasireddy .
0	long waits even when slow !
0	was at er for over three hours and there were two people there .
0	watched a full shift change .
0	it was a painful procedure and my veins are still clearly obvious .
0	see the pictures in my review and read about what happened .
0	they then had a collections agency double the bill with service fees .
0	and that 's legal ? !
0	that is where our power over the institution remains .
0	i told them that they were kidding , right ?
0	she was my my primary physician .
0	any time i mentioned anything , i was thoroughly tested for it .
0	she would do these shots for me and knew my history .
0	it was completely humiliating for me .
0	then i received that $ 700 bill in the mail .
0	besides being treated crappy , her billing was always wrong .
0	always being over billed and double billed .
0	all the things in all the other reviews are true .
0	she is all about the money and prestige and fame , all ego .
0	she will unnecessarily test you to make that insurance money .
0	i guess i will update my post when my daughters glasses are finally received .
0	this store really lacks selection .
0	this was an aggravating experience and we never stepped foot into an office .
0	could not get an appointment scheduled sooner than a month later .
0	and he 's decided he only wants to work three days a week .
0	working in community behavioral health myself , i understand the frustrations of staffing issues .
0	but that is n't actually what 's happening .
0	this place is a falsely advertised urgent care facility .
0	i went in for the flu .
0	i am going to fight this if i can because this is ridiculous !
0	i am looking into asking my regular dr. to refer me to someone else .
0	the shit hit the fan , whoop .
0	then she says `` so , what did we do ?
0	what treatment did we take ? ''
0	-read/review your patients chart before you open your mouth .
0	otherwise , people start to lose confidence in whatever comes out of your mouth .
0	i do n't heart you , i do n't even like you .
0	super expensive for honestly no service .
0	my therapist geriann was amazing !
0	perfect pressure where needed very professional and attentive to my needs .
0	my anxiety was rising and the massage efforts were fading .
0	i had some mango smoothie here .
0	it tasted nothing like mango .
0	it may have made my experience a bit better .
0	another girl prepared the drinks .
0	`` you 're welcome ! ''
0	that you expect as a norm from any customer service position .
0	kinda warm in there too .
0	i would never stop by in the summer to cool off .
0	in short : do n't come here .
0	first i heard of it so i was alil irritated .
0	i have never met such an incompetent family practice .
0	avoid this place at all costs .
0	she seems to know what she is talking about and is well learned .
0	but these are the only things good about this place .
0	my family met with dr. sparks once .
0	we had to wait over 2 months for an appointment .
0	after waiting that long , one would think they would get some individual attention .
0	that 's a negative .
0	dr. sparks did not take any interested in either my wife or i personally .
0	she was unable to take time for us on any occasion .
0	instead , we had to meet with a new doctor hired by dr. sparks .
0	both times , we had to wait over 45 minutes to see the doctor .
0	this is completely unacceptable .
0	we made freaking appointments .
0	showed up at least 10 minutes early .
0	then had to wait 45 minutes until we were able to see a doctor .
0	there is no universe that this is acceptable .
0	this practice has so many operational issues , not to mention priority problems .
0	this was my first time at massage envy .
0	translation , not a sketchy massage parlor .
0	the introductory price was another bonus .
0	you could tell the masseuse was fairly inexperienced .
0	the massage was pretty generic .
0	i probably would n't return .
0	be prepared for the member spew when trying to pay for the one visit .
0	decent prices , but very disorganized .
0	i got 3 different methods on how to treat a nail removal .
0	appointment was at 2pm .
0	it took them 55 minutes for a dentist to see me .
0	45 of those spent in the lobby waiting area .
0	irritated that i wasted 2 hours of my saturday here .
0	i wo n't be back .
0	claimed my daughter had cavities upon a 2nd review proved she did not .
0	we will never go back there again .
0	this doctor is a complete crook .
0	not only was she late to the appt , she did nothing .
0	my primary dr refered me here after an abnormal pap .
0	talk about unprofessional ! ! !
0	so i got no pap , nothing but a bill for 100 !
0	i wasted my insurance here .
0	i have none left .
0	i thought this appt was about my body ?
0	do not go here shes so unprofessional .
0	there are plenty of other obs in the valley who are more attentive .
0	i do not recommend this place to anyone ! !
0	then his glasses broke in half while he was trying on glasses there .
0	`` but your ad right here says you offer 1 hour service ! ''
0	she would n't even check to see if the frames are in stock .
0	completely lack of customer service .
0	other salespeople are just standing there .
0	i go to the back to wait for my husband to get done .
0	doc is not rude , just apathetic .
0	no apology for poor customer service .
0	while my husband is finishing up his dilation , i start to google .
0	found a nearby lenscrafters , called them , they had the lens in stock .
0	we jet over there , one hour later , my husband has his glasses .
0	better frames , decent service and a decent price .
0	there was no excuse .
0	went in on a monday , and the doctor wrote me a prescription .
0	i 'm told the doctor needs to see my insurance formulary .
0	so i take it there , and am told they will call me back .
0	and i 'm told they 'll call me back .
0	do not use this place .
0	i made my final purchase there .
0	customer service is not their strength .
0	the day prior to his appointment my sister receive a call stating the appt .
0	when i arrived i was told my appt .
0	was at 10. which now push me back and made me late for work .
0	i was advised by receptionist that fitting if a crown would not take long .
0	it 's been over 2.0 hour .
0	unbelievable ... .. horrible service .
0	i 'll be taking my brother somewhere else ... , stay away .
0	the waiting room chairs are disgusting .
0	i go to the office on teneya .
0	i was n't told by his offfice i would be seeing a nurse practitioner .
0	even their answering machine is rude .
0	i see the p.a .
0	she has given me new outlook on life .
0	if she leaves i will not go back .
0	no letter , text , or phone call .
0	14 months , seriously ! !
0	i never regretted being to any doctors office before .
0	there is an elder lady right now who is having issue finding her paper .
0	there is 1 and 3 but no 2. what a joke !
0	negligent and irresponsible staff ! !
0	have already reported and filed complaints to allergan and the arizona naturopathic doctors .
0	frozen is a movie ... not what i asked for .
0	plus my eyebrows are uneven .
0	sleazy sales pitch after sleazy sales pitch .
0	am i at a medspa or a dirty used car lot ?
0	over priced membership package ?
0	more botox ? ! ? !
0	are you serious ? !
0	should have walked out then .
0	outdoor sign says botox $ 9/unit .
0	tried to charge me $ 14/unit .
0	complained to owner , she said staff would reach out and apologize .
0	ca n't teach class .
0	doctor 's here are good .
0	but they make schedule for their doctors overlapped in-between patients .
0	no enough time in-between patients for doctor 's to breath .
0	another you have to wait for a long period of time to your appointment .
0	they have a horrible answering service ! ! !
0	it just keeps on ringing
0	i am never coming back here again .
0	i arrived more than 10 minutes early for my appointment .
0	i had to leave because i had other affairs .
0	i will never come back .
0	rude horrible service do n't come here ! ! ! !
0	i arrived shortly before my scheduled appointment .
0	the waiting room was jammed packed .
0	i was not happy with the hour+ long wait i experienced .
0	i took that opportunity to ask what the hold-up was .
0	i was pleasant when asking , not rude .
0	dr. kim 's pa rushed through my exam .
0	specific questions i wanted to ask were left unanswered because of the hurried pace .
0	i will be returning to my former doctor for my next screening .
0	however , this visit was a waste of my time .
0	i 'm a paying customer/patient .
0	spectrum 's administrative staff needs lessons in courtesy and organization .
0	when i got the receipt , it said $ 75 .
0	well , this is my very first comment on yelp .
0	i went to this location today .
0	me and my boyfriend wait there for 20 mins with no one come .
0	i go every month to labcorp for my blood test .
0	here i did one blood test and well the picture speaks louder than words .
0	note im a pretty happy camper with mostly 5 stars kind of guy .
0	this doctor was horrible .
0	i would give zero stars if possible .
0	my second visit just got worse .
0	she had no compassion during a time of loss .
0	to be told what i already thought i knew .
0	thus prolonging my torment .
0	my interaction just went down hill from there .
0	she then did not follow the comment up with a reason ! !
0	because she clearly did n't know `` why '' herself .
0	i had to see her weeks later in order to have surgery .
0	she would not release me to see another doctor prior to the surgery .
0	in the end she suggested i find another doctor !
0	are you freaking kidding me ?
0	as if i would ever allow her to handle my medical care again .
0	i found this place on group-on .
0	the voucher cost $ 39 for a 60-minute massage with an insurance receipt .
0	had to call multiple times .
0	answering machine comes on , but does n't allow you to leave a message .
0	i was a little annoyed because i had informed them i had a group-on .
0	it was their duty to ask if i needed a receipt .
0	i did n't know that they had multiple group-ons !
0	c. the place was filthy .
0	i admit that it 's winter and we all get muck on our shoes .
0	but the floors were disgusting !
0	d. i was shown into a room .
0	and what do you know , a male therapist walks in !
0	i am a woman .
0	i am not comfortable with male therapists .
0	so i proceeded to have the most awkward massage of my life .
0	he kept telling me to relax my muscles , but how could i !
0	i was so uncomfortable !
0	to give him credit , he did keep most of my body covered .
0	i asked him only to do my upper back , neck and legs .
0	he did a decent job .
0	overall , i kept getting a creepy feeling about this place .
0	my husband was laughing when i told him about my experience !
0	i would not recommend this place for a woman for sure .
0	this was my first experience .
0	however , that was a huge mistake .
0	i later emailed the pa to get the results .
0	they billed me and would not discuss it ?
0	but md24 is a really lousy choice in my experience .
0	this was the weirdest couples massage ever .
0	the massage itself was good i guess .
0	the atmosphere and everything else was like something from the twilight zone .
0	the employees at the front are so unprofessional .
0	they were arguing loudly in front of us while we waited for our appointment .
0	he barely looked at me .
0	the glasses arm was broken .
0	so , not professional looking .
0	i got wired up for the weekend long test .
0	the tech who did it was nice .
0	gave me different info than i was told later .
0	i had some nurse that spoke to me like an auctioneer , no kidding .
0	i got nowhere with this place .
0	removal is defined as eliminating .
0	after nine treatments , i still have hair .
0	i would no longer need to shave or wax .
0	that is not the case .
0	the goal of ideal image is to remove 80 % of hair .
0	however , that is not stated in the contract .
0	should n't the lifetime membership kick in years later after the last treatment ?
0	if you want all of your hair removed then continue looking for another company .
0	try your local dermatologist office .
0	he showed me imperfections in my bite , etc .
0	finally , it clicked that they were recommending this for a completely different issue .
0	so finally , they sent me back and they executed the cementing quickly .
0	they never once checked my bite to verify before letting me go , either .
0	they are only in business because they very obviously cater to children .
0	i can not in good conscience even rate at one star .
0	this office has very few good points in their favor .
0	no one answers the phone , the reception person is beyond rude !
0	we will be taking our business elsewhere .
0	find ? ? ! !
0	if i could give no stars i would .
0	sad because this is the first negative review i 've written smh .
0	following the apple-green awning to this fresh lively waiting room .
0	there are many reasons to go to a dermatologist - mine ?
0	after chatting about my little dot we decided i needed it zapped .
0	i passed on the biopsy knowing the risks but taking them on anyways .
0	it will reduce the dot but could take a month .
0	so why two stars ?
0	is this priceness due to the convenience of uptown ?
0	if i need more treatments , i will definitely price out other locations first .
0	my vet recommended this pharmacy and they seemed ok at first .
0	you had to call in and place the prescription and they were very nice .
0	when i went to refill , i waited like 2 weeks and got nothing .
0	i tried contacting them through their website as it is difficult to call sometimes .
0	what was the point of putting my credit card info on their website ?
0	well , i went to their website and put in the refill .
0	so i sent them an email through their webiste ... again ... .nothing .
0	well , its been almost a week and still no drops for my dog .
0	that was 2 months ago .
0	i think this will be my last order .
0	1st time , shame on you , 2nd time - shame on me .
0	that 's a rip off ! ! ! !
0	and hey ! ! !
0	the time starts when you are undressed and in the bed ready for massage .
0	it 's a whole hour ! ! !
0	i felt like he was pulling my teeth out .
0	i called and cancelled my next appointment .
0	i have never had a bruise from going to the dentist !
0	i only had x-rays done and 3 cavities filled ! !
0	i will not be returning to them or recommending them to anyone !
0	i would not recommend this office to anyone .
0	this office is not honest .
0	i went there for a routine eye check up .
0	i showed my id and insurance card .
0	just told me after the service is done .
0	i could have gone somewhere where i 'm covered .
0	they just wanted my money .
0	it does n't matter if i signed a financial responsibility .
0	worse pharmacy in belmont .
0	customer service = nonexistent .
0	i highly recommend the walgreens right across the street .
0	the ladies in there did n't have respect for customers .
0	they kept giggling and talking to each other .
0	the girl that i had was veryy lazy about the massage .
0	there was no pressure , as if she was just touching/ rubbing my skin .
0	just a waste of time and money..
0	i told them no , but i was calling in about it .
0	so , yeah -- all extremely important to an extremely ill cat .
0	end of that week -- still no meds .
0	overnight shipping on a friday night ?
0	guess what -- i 've never heard back from them .
0	big time fails through this whole process and zero contact from them .
0	i will absolutely never use them again after this .
0	oh -- and just as an update .
0	nothing is our fault . ''
0	great customer service road runner .
0	what a crappy uncaring company you are .
0	you should be ashamed .
0	would give zero stars if possible .
0	called my insurance and they told me office claimed me for a deficiency .
0	no call or anything .
0	also they sent me to the wrong place ( twice ! )
0	do n't waste your time and money on this place .
0	this is plain crazy .
0	the pharmacist is trying very hard to help the customers .
0	the customer service of the front staff is horrible .
0	sorry but find another pharmacy .
0	i waited another 10 minutes after before being seen by the doctor .
0	the front desk call service is the worst .
0	the doctor experience was decent , however .
0	this dentist is a crook !
0	glad to see his office has closed !
0	i had only had one my entire life !
0	i moved out of gilbert and just went to a new dentist .
0	crazy enough he did n't find a single cavity ! ! !
0	i called and made an appointment on the 12th for 8:30 on the 21st .
0	that 's insane i thought !
0	i have never met the doctor .
0	i did n't know if they would be male or female .
0	the only response they gave is , `` it 's the doctors policy '' .
0	but , not for me .
0	we will never set foot in this place again !
0	charging seniors $ 4 for parking ?
0	why gouge and double dip against seniors on pension ?
0	dr.armagon is two faced and an insensitive person .
0	the manager alice needs an attitude adjustment .
0	we despise your success to the dismay of seniors hoping for compassion and care .
0	unacceptable ... avoid at all costs .
0	so i hoped for some improvement in the office procedures .
0	even the pt office had been watching for a referral .
0	so much for continuity of care !
0	i 'm unsure of how this man receives any positive reviews .
0	he may have prescribed me with useful medications , but he is horrible .
0	they feel their time is more valuable than ours .
0	the receptionist is awful .
0	she crossed her arms and zoned out when talking .
0	so glad my 30 days is done - never again !
0	so much to say about this place and not in a good way .
0	so the spa is located inside the hotel .
0	easy to find and right off the highway .
0	the ambiance and entrance of the spa is great .
0	the space is large and comfortable .
0	the room was also spacious and well laid out but it was cold .
0	i asked about the heating which i was told could not be adjusted .
0	i was offered an extra towel but i remained cold the entire service .
0	strange enough i noticed an electric fire place but it was never turned on .
0	i had a combination relaxation and hot stone massage from an esthetician named ruby .
0	her pressure techniques were strange and a bit unpredictable in a bad way .
0	i did n't feel like i could relax during the service .
0	i also felt like there was no practiced method or organization to the massage .
0	in addition she was using too much oil .
0	i felt like a fire hazard with the amount that was used .
0	unfortunately i do n't think i will be back .
0	the spa is out of my way and it did not meet my standards .
0	i went to a real dentist , and guess how many cavities i have ?
0	yup , that 's right , none at all .
0	i am horrified to think of all the people they have probably ripped off .
0	it really is hard to find a quality dentist that you can trust .
0	would not go back , not recommended .
0	dont believe the reviews .
0	the technicians do poor quality work here .
0	the salon is nice , the technicians suck !
0	a basic gel mani 2 hours and did n't even include a hand massage .
0	i had to repeatedly ask the technician to trim my cuticles back .
0	she argued with me on that too .
0	overall a f experience .
0	go anywhere but here !
0	jesmina shrestha , nurse practitioner seemed nice , but odd and nervous .
0	she had a tablet with someone over video transcribing the visit .
0	thankfully i got the labs done elsewhere and got my results online .
0	waste of money and wastw of time .
0	my hair is black and course and i dont have a hormonal imbalance .
0	that was a lie .
0	most of the staff of nice but not all .
0	since thet dont eant to help i will be making this a legal issue .
0	i do not recommend them ! ! !
0	trying to get an appointment at this place is near impossible .
0	their online system is a joke and the reception never answers the phone .
0	terrible manners and the receptionists are basically useless .
0	never coming back to this place .
0	i went back 15 min later and it was done and on the side .
0	i asked if anyone else could help and they said no .
0	honestly , i was just over it .
0	i paid for my $ 350 in groceries but will probably never go back .
0	this location needs to have a chat with their employees regarding customer service .
0	they do n't even deserve a 1 star .
0	jenelle in the front office is rude !
0	too bad her attitude shows lack of education .
0	what century is this ?
0	people at craft fairs accept credit cards .
0	drug dealers accept credit cards .
0	prostitutes accept credit cards .
0	what the hell is a `` discover card '' anyway ?
0	it 's like the american dream .
0	i tried this place out b/c it 's close to my house .
0	the massage was alright , not enough pressure for my liking but not terrible .
0	the reason for one star ?
0	$ 7 was nearly 20 % .
0	i was horrified that she would even ask such a thing .
0	i stated $ 7 was enough and left and i will never return !
0	health partners of nevada has the most unprofessional doctors .
0	dr. jasper liu is the most rudest doctor i have ever come across .
0	he has no people skills .
0	yelled at me like if i was a child .
0	he assume that i went to see him for my pain medication .
0	i told him that was not the reason why i was here for .
0	then he went on to say he wo n't be seeing me any further .
0	it 's the way he yelled at me .
0	i called for my refills and my pharmacy gave me meds .
0	from him last month .
0	whish was a shock for me .
0	how can anyone allow such a doctor to practice .
0	he is rude and very racist doctor .
0	i hope he loses his license as a doctor .
0	otherwise i would n't have put any !
0	okay so the foot massage was wonderful ... the back massage was terrible .
0	very disappointed in the dentist and staff at affordable dentures .
0	i had my mother go there because of the high ratings in yelp .
0	my mother explained she could n't t eat with bottom dentures .
0	they sent her home with no teeth .
0	elderly people need extra patience .
0	very very unhappy with this company .
0	this store must have the angriest employees i 've ever witnessed .
0	so miserable and unfriendly .
0	if looks could kill , well you get the point ... .
0	staff friendly but no matter how good , no excuse for waiting .
0	and i 've had about 10 appts over the past three years .
0	none were under three hour wait .
0	certainly do not care about the value of patient time .
0	today i had a 3:10 appt .
0	it is 5:40 and i 'm still in the waiting room .
0	i 'm very disappointed in this office .
0	had i known this policy prior , i would not have chosen this office .
0	dental practices have taken a serious downturn the past decade .
0	there is a lot of hard sell now and questionable practices .
0	i have several issues with hudec .
0	moreover , my teeth are just not prone to cavities .
0	so i setup an appointment for simple teeth cleaning and checkup .
0	this poses a problem because they do not divulge costs consistently .
0	make sure you know before you agree to anything .
0	i feel like the hygienist receives commission for procedures that she performs .
0	super deep cleaning which costs over $ 1000 .
0	i remember teeth cleanings used to be way more thorough .
0	i felt worse after the massage than i did going in .
0	i emailed solescape with this information/feedback on oct. 12 and they never responded .
0	this is honestly the worst dentist i have ever been to .
0	sure enough ca n't take it .
0	do not go here !
0	i ended up going to another dentist to fix that .
0	front staff very rude and lacking training .
0	my therapist was nice but massage was very robotic and repetitive .
0	lacks the spa environment .
0	horrible front desk and management .
0	if i owed this store i would fire all of them .
0	the massage therapists are amazing .
0	why was n't i called for the opening .
0	then , conveniently the manager was n't in again .
0	i was told to call back .
0	then , she said the manager was n't available .
0	it 's evident to me that the managers and receptionists need to be fired .
0	bad place to going dr goodman is not a good obgyn !
0	office told me they thought it had gone out but it had not .
0	he wrote the check for me it would be mailed today .
0	i thanked her for the update .
0	this tells me my patronage means nothing .
0	i would called my client immediately .
0	but that 's just me .
0	i do n't expect from others what i do n't expect from myself .
0	this is the worst place ever .
0	if you are injured , please do not bother to come here .
0	i split my elbow open while on vacation in las vegas .
0	unfortunately this was the first place we found .
0	there was no sense of urgency .
0	not even a little sympathy .
0	no one was bleeding or looked in pain .
0	after about 1 hour of waiting ( maybe longer ) .
0	i finally was put into a room to wait for the doctor .
0	i waited another 20 mins for him to arrive .
0	i was taken to another room to have the stitches done .
0	waiting another 30 mins .
0	waited another 45 mins .
0	please do not go here .
0	they trap you in a year long contract and wo n't let you cancel .
0	not worth the money .
0	i was sent to dr. cooper by my primary p.a .
0	i needed blood work to check my hormone levels .
0	i have been having a lot of health problems , so my p.a .
0	wanted me to have bio-identical hormone replacement therapy .
0	supposedly , dr. cooper was one of the few specialists who could help me .
0	well , dr. cooper refused to do anything .
0	i did n't just walk in off the street !
0	this is something my p.a .
0	she spoke to me as if she thought i was stupid .
0	i have never had a more unpleasant experience in a medical office .
0	if you value your time and mental health do not go to this practice .
0	the staff is absolutely incompetent .
0	the burger was tall and thick and difficult to eat .
0	there was a strong after taste of thyme that over powered the burger .
0	the fries were good though .
0	the kaleslaw was definitely interesting , and not in a bad way .
0	the concept is great but over priced and not executed well .
0	however , the wait for this place is ridiculous .
0	i was wrongly diagnosed by my urgent care doctor .
0	the entire interaction with the urgent care doctor was approximately two minutes or less .
0	a very long wait for such a short examination .
0	i would n't recommend this place if you can wait .
0	i only went because it seemed like an emergency .
0	i have not had any acknowledgement or response .
0	i can understand being busy , but honestly they have no excuse .
0	there was 1 person in front of me .
0	there were no patients besides myself & the other person .
0	this is n't the first time this has happened either .
0	it was someone else who was extremely rude over the phone .
0	she was talking to me as if i was stupid .
0	i am talking ? ! ! ''
0	i can not believe how disgusting this lady was .
0	i am never coming here ever again .
0	not to be treated like shit .
0	do not come here .
0	they are incompetent & disgusting .
0	extremely over priced , go to the spa for this price .
0	in my opinion , i really had high hopes for this place .
0	after another customer complained , they finally did something about it .
0	the menu was huge and i needed help navigating it .
0	whoa ! ! ! ! !
0	not what i want at all .
0	i ended up with a pounch burger sized shake and a huge bill .
0	it just did n't live up to the expectations .
0	maybe it was a fluke .
0	next time i am by , i will try again .
0	this is probably going to be my last visit here .
0	i disagreed with her .
0	as she was at this last appointment .
0	so , i declined and said that i was n't coming back .
0	which , really , i have no intention to return .
0	i will be taking my business else where .
0	i went in with a pain in my back upper molar .
0	they got me in quick which was awesome .
0	then i was scared into a extraction .
0	then i actually communicated with them about my problems with the price .
0	i miss my tooth and this is going to lead to problems .
0	looking into further action .
0	just know your expecting a 1+ hour wait !
0	check in process is slow !
0	would be nice if they had a sense of urgency with their guest .
0	last time at this location !
0	and third i did n't see his license on the wall ?
0	i do n't recommend it at all .
0	i decided to take my business elsewhere !
0	what a fucking joke !
0	are you fucking kidding me ?
0	than there was another women scheduled for 11:15 who also was waiting forever .
0	are you fucking kidding me ? !
0	my head feels like it 's going to explode .
0	my pain is n't just physical , it 's mental .
0	depression and migraines combined are literal hell .
0	i do n't want to live like this .
0	i just wanted help .
0	i left in tears .
0	both physical and emotional pain .
0	i ca n't handle this anymore .
0	what a fucking joke .
0	if i could give it no stars i would .
0	they market a birthday gift basket for uw students .
0	i confirmed that the order was received .
0	it was never delivered .
0	now i get my credit card bill and i 've been charged .
0	i really like dr. yu and the back office .
0	the front office fills me with such rage .
0	where do i even start ?
0	they most certainly did not .
0	the only phone call i got from them was confirming my appointment .
0	the very same 'coordinator ' that didnt return my calls for five weeks ? !
0	i figure at this point i had better just call the pharmacy myself .
0	the botox was never even ordered !
0	they did not even have my new insurance !
0	nobody from my drs office has even contacted them ! !
0	it appears to be absolutely nothing ! ! !
0	i love dr. yu but i am absolutely fed up with the front office .
0	so if you like spending thousands of dollars for nothing pay them a visit .
0	after one time management decided to revoke what they had promised .
0	not good business practice in my opinion .
0	ill be canceling soon .
0	i was basically told the same thing with no resolution .
0	the supervisor even apologized to me for not returning my call .
0	she said she was , ironically , out sick .
0	ok so let me first say that the massage was ok but not great .
0	massage tables are very hard and uncomfortable .
0	not to mention the lotion that used smelled like clay .
0	then two of the employees were fighting not even 10 feet from me .
0	but dr. kuty seemed to be concerned with your treatment plan .
0	will never bother stepping inside this place again .
0	bought a pair of sunglasses at saks .
0	i also offered to pay for their time .
0	the woman working there was super rude .
0	she complained i should take them to original store .
0	she insulted me and said the sunglasses were wrong size for my face .
0	she refused to adjust them .
0	i went to specs on queen st two days later .
0	super friendly and nice staff .
0	and way more helpful .
0	will def never go to owl again .
0	they were super friendly , down to earth , and helpful .
0	complete opposite service that i got at owl .
0	and owl 's choices of frames was pretty lame anyways .
0	on my street is another eyeglass store .
0	owner super helpful and also highly recommend .
0	horrible customer service at the front desk .
0	come to find out , they are not .
0	this place is only interested in robbing people of their money .
0	showed up for a massage that i booked .
0	i have filled out numerous pregnancy waivers and received massages .
0	extremely disappointed in this location .
0	just me , hubby , and our baby who was in carseat .
0	also fine , but after the whole experience every little detail sticks out unfortunately .
0	ordered a `` new mom '' smoothie & hub ordered a black coffee .
0	oh well we laughed it off .
0	food came shortly after ... that too was excellent .
0	small portions but very tasty .
0	no napkins or forks etc .
0	we had finger food but we would 've used a napkin .
0	i was done then .
0	pharmacy closes at 8:00 pm .
0	getting ready to move prescriptions someplace more reassuring and helpful .
0	dirty exterior and grounds too .
0	i 'd give this place zero stars if i could .
0	we were in town on vacation and i needed my nails done , stat .
0	found this place with , what looked like , great reviews .
0	the gentleman on the phone said , `` we have plenty people to help .
0	just come in , we 'll take care of you . ''
0	came in about 3:30pm on a tuesday to an empty salon .
0	two workers working on one client .
0	my mistake for not asking how long .
0	i picked my color and sat in the waiting area .
0	they were told the same thing .
0	maybe they were trying to make sure she was well taken care of .
0	they lost my service .
0	i do n't know if they ended up losing the other .
0	i do n't care .
0	huge waste of time .
0	pretty sure i just got ripped off .
0	there was no promotion and it was wildly expensive .
0	almost $ 6,000 for laser on my legs .
0	( i thought this was a corporate legit company .
0	so i did n't want to insult the manager by doing that ) .
0	i was suppose to notice a significant difference and i do n't .
0	my biggest mistake was not doing the research before the consultation .
0	i attempted to make an appointment online .
0	it stated someone would call me to confirm my appointment .
0	guess i 'll take my money elsewhere .
0	they are excellent -- at wasting time !
0	had to leave work early and drive across town .
0	they really did n't care .
0	they charge $ 50 for the first visit too .
0	the nurse kindly offered to contact banner hospice .
0	the hospice nurse was nice .
0	she said all the right things and i believe she was sincere .
0	i asked for a manager .
0	i spoke with the hospice nurse .
0	she did n't know why i needed to speak with her .
0	she had n't heard from the manager .
0	i had to keep after them and get it handled .
0	i do n't think so .
0	she 's not even awake at 6 am !
0	i , once again , called the banner health hospice manager .
0	i could n't convince banner health hospice that they made a mistake .
0	i called banner health hospice again and again .
0	they did n't want to deal with it .
0	i had to handle it .
0	i was lucky enough to be with her , holding her hand .
0	banner health hospice made a sad situation horrible and stressful .
0	in every situation , they made things worse .
0	letting others that just arrived go b4 me .
0	i do n't recommend u go here .
0	the people r friendly but now it 's like .
0	oh he has a purple folder so make him wait .
0	the customer service in this place is horrible .
0	brick and mortar chain druggist .
0	that being said they do occasionally have some decent specials/sales .
0	they have a $ 100 cancellation policy if you cancel less than 48 hours .
0	its too bad they want to lose patients over this : (
0	waited 1 hour and 50 minutes despite showing up 20 minutes early to appointment .
0	purchased a groupon for microdermabrasion .
0	( this is the yonge-eg location )
0	if i could give this zero stars i would .
0	he told me what i already knew did nothing to help .
0	waste of time and money .
0	i will never go back
0	seriously , your focal point is `` skin '' .
0	the phone rings and rings .
0	you can never get through to scheduling .
0	beware when using this service .
0	i got my teeth whitened over 2 months ago and they still hurt .
0	rethink using this service .
0	i had two visits with jaqueline .
0	the first visit was ok she seemed to care and offered ok advice .
0	the 2nd time not so much .
0	never coming back again .
0	abandon hope , all ye who enter here .
0	i have never had a good interaction with the staff here .
0	nothing is ever done in a timely manner .
0	doctors are okay , staff simply do n't care .
0	i felt like i was an animal at a vet clinic .
0	went in for my initial teeth cleaning after moving to this area .
0	dr. was not personal and busy with other things .
0	waited for 30 minutes to see the doctor .
0	they wanted to remove my gold fillings and replace them with porcelain .
0	i needed 2 root canals and had cavities inside recent fillings .
0	feeling a gut instinct , i did n't make another appointment .
0	before any work was complete or appointment made .
0	so very very disappointed in this dentistry .
0	if you decide to visit , get a second opinion .
0	i guarantee they have lied .
0	apparently the only person that had keys was about 30 minutes late .
0	the appointment did n't go that great either .
0	the technitian treated me like an idiot because i had questions ... never again .
0	two girls who we there could nearly speak few words english .
0	i read few good reviews about this place on yelp .
0	i went here because the doctor i was seeing supposedly had good reviews .
0	i wish i would have looked here before i wasted over two hours .
0	i handed the girl my paperwork and proceeded to wait for over an hour .
0	they finally pulled me back and forced me to answer questions about depression !
0	i left the room too and told them i was done with the appointment .
0	they just want to push antidepressants on everyone that comes in .
0	doctors like this should be ashamed of themselves .
0	i 've never had a cavity before , so 4 was quite the shock .
0	i declined filling and 6 months later went to a `` real '' dentist .
0	this dentist confirmed i did n't have a single cavity .
0	how the dc dental dentist could find 4 is beyond me .
0	you can find a better dentist , keep looking .
0	expect a 2-3 week turn around time on glasses .
0	they will not accept returns even if you deny the merchandise as unacceptable .
0	the staff and the whole system there is complete trash .
0	then i needed an extraction and they lost my referral and files .
0	how do you lose my files .
0	then today was the last straw .
0	i made an appointment for last week and they made me reschedule for today .
0	they did n't even call me to let me know or anything .
0	this place is complete trash .
0	to re-do my lashes .
0	at time of appt .
0	i was still charged a $ 40 difference for the volume set .
0	i did n't want to hassle and just happily paid the difference .
0	only hoping that this time around it would be done correctly .
0	david , kayu and staff are all very nice wonderful people .
0	so i 'm pretty much back at the same spot .
0	with the same problems as stated above only with longer lashes this time around .
0	in january , i went in for my annual appointment .
0	i asked for a couple of blood tests , a request that was accommodated .
0	apparently they expect their patients to have esp !
0	the exact same thing happened for the second appointment .
0	i called billing , got voice mail , and left a detailed message .
0	so , call the insurance company i did .
0	i received the bill from twhs in august .
0	i 'll be heading to another gyno to get better care .
0	the only reason i visit here is because my insurance forces me to .
0	some partnership bcbs has with cvs .
0	no benefit to the patrons in this area .
0	honestly , their service is n't much better .
0	the individuals up front are actually fairly pleasant .
0	i visit often enough to notice several changes in personnel .
0	i have to call my prescription in and speak to a tech or pharmacist .
0	to do that , i 'm often on hold more than 10 min .
0	the hold music is n't even interesting enough to bop along to .
0	just wish there was a way around using either cvs in my area .
0	both are poorly managed and just need an upgrade in all aspects .
0	make sure you get a second opinion .
0	tanya their dental assistant is great though .
0	i do n't even know where to start with this horrible unethical doctor .
0	i brought my son here because he was having seasonal allergies .
0	all of this they were able to decide without the help of the doctor .
0	my son has seasonal allergies not a rare disease only found in foreign counties .
0	how anyone gives this hell hole a good review is astonishing .
0	i stayed for 2 weeks and left .
0	the treatment is really bad ! !
0	they basically just the place is disorganized and just in total disarray !
0	nobody knows what is going on at this place , no one !
0	if you need anything , good luck !
0	very disappointed in the non-urgent care that this dr. did not provide to anyone .
0	btw ... this place was not busy at all .
0	true fail on behalf of this urgent care facility .
0	dr is great and very knowledgeable .
0	staff on the other hand is ridiculous ! ! !
0	when u get there that 's when they actually get shit ready .
0	`` hello , dr. linder 's office . ''
0	me : `` hello , i 'd like to schedule an appointment with dr .
0	have you ever seen dr. linder before ? ''
0	me : `` no , i have n't . ''
0	`` okay , what were you hoping to schedule an appointment for ? ''
0	dr. linder is not accepting any new patients at this time . ''
0	me : `` okay , so ...
0	however , the office staff is rude & not helpful .
0	even as checking in and they need to talk to me .
0	it was covered all along .
0	why would the do it this way ?
0	bigger profit always drives business practices .
0	just another reason we need single payer in usa .
0	i gave up after two weeks .
0	some shady billing/insurance issues going on .
0	this business has incompetent people working for them .
0	i canceled my yearly membership .
0	they charged my card 2 additional times .
0	i was told it was n't done .
0	they need to hire a manager who works regular hours or more competent people .
0	stay away and go somewhere else , it 's just not worth the effort .
0	if you love your child do n't take him or her here .
0	i received a letter from the state saying 4 shots behind .
0	i go in at 1pm for appointment and left at 2:30 without being seen .
0	doctor was not even in the building .
0	he was at lunch .
0	why the @ & $ ?
0	i got a call from them two weeks later stating my payment was late .
0	i advised them i cancelled and the girl said she would look into it .
0	i got a call two weeks later from them stating my payment was late .
0	i again advised them i cancelled .
0	they said they would look into it .
0	this place is a total scam .
0	stay away from this place at all costs .
0	and by the way , my massage from helga the destroyer was terrible .
0	the staff shelving and on the floor are helpful and nice .
0	the selection of organic and natural foods is good .
0	the store has been very clean each time i went in .
0	the staff in the deli/bakery are awful .
0	more than once i have given up and walked away .
0	no reason to put up with being ignored .
0	got there 130 ca n't find did you call ?
0	no they called me .
0	have a seat i 'll find out .
0	about half hour she said in lab just a few minutes .
0	overall about an hour .
0	off to vet she called we did not order twice .
0	so far , the longest i have had to wait is about 1 hour .
0	normally we have to wait about 15-20 minutes .
0	the assistants r just okay .
0	worst customer service and most unprofessional `` urgent '' care i have ever experienced .
0	find quality care elsewhere .
0	trust me , i only leave bad reviews when it 's due .
0	i responded to the facebook ad that advertised a free 6 week camp .
0	went to the informational session , where 5 different people gave testimonials .
0	i do n't see the appeal in being penalized for life happening .
0	the camp is n't my cup of tea but kudos to those who do .
0	i would chose to actually give this place no stars .
0	my first visit to the office was awesome .
0	i believe that i know my phone number and email address .
0	i got a `` ok '' .
0	worst place to get your contacts using your insurance .
0	customer service is so poor here .
0	i would never recommend this place .
0	waste of time , money and energy .
0	i can not give my story , as it is way too long .
0	please listen to me .
0	never bring them here .
0	you get what you need .
0	the staff is not helpful locating anything .
0	in fact the staff was just downright rude .
0	i got what i needed and left .
0	hopefully i do n't ever need to go back there .
0	beware of security camera in `` private '' massage rooms ; what privacy !
0	posted prices are also ambiguous .
0	not worth what was spent and certainty not going back .
0	they were all busy and was referred to this zen location .
0	wife had a $ 30 combination foot and body for an hour .
0	they may as well hope their business can survive in this culture .
0	for me , what is a few extra dollars ?
0	on the package it says give up to 5 days to receive a refill .
0	when i called they admitted the mistake but forgot to send the needed medication .
0	i cant get that to happen no matter how many times i ask .
0	i always have to call a second time and request it separately .
0	sometimes i receive a large dog toy which is worthless to my cats anyway !
0	chose this location as it was covered by my insurance .
0	had appt on 1/23/18 .
0	my appt was at 4pm and got there @ 3:30pm to fill out paperwork .
0	why is this necessary ?
0	sounded shady so i refused to sign it nor did i give my social .
0	this place caters to mexicans .
0	i will never ever return to this facility .
0	and did absolutely nothing to help me with the pain i was experiencing .
0	will not be going back there
0	i was not impressed with the facial i received here .
0	i found priti to be unprofessional .
0	i was really disappointed because she came so highly recommended .
0	sadly , i ca n't recommend her services .
0	wonderful doctors and fancy offices do n't make up for their rude admin staff .
0	not losing sleep over losing this place .
0	here 's a head 's up of what went on in nutshell .
0	i initially decided against that .
0	i was told that it would be possible for at lease 4-6 weeks !
0	why was n't i told this when i specifically asked during my consultation ?
0	this left me speechless !
0	why wait till my last procedure to tell me this ?
0	7. out of the four procedures , there was partial success .
0	that was a result of an `` oops .
0	he and dr smith were speaking about something unrelated to what smith was doing .
0	his focus was pulled and i got burned .
0	i was injured by accident and did my best to be understanding .
0	i left this office livid .
0	her response was that it was her job .
0	i responded ... not in this case it was n't .
0	the front staff needs some training and dr. mccord was less than helpful .
0	only the nurse does ears .
0	wrong ! ! ! !
0	he had a two hour wait to be seen ! ! ! ! !
0	our time is as valuable as yours , dr .
0	i wo n't recommend them again .
0	disrespectful and blatantly dreadful organization .
0	i 'd give zero stars if i could .
0	imho , i tipped much better than what was deserved .
0	not going to be a return customer .
0	apria uses a 3rd party billing company called care centrix .
0	we laid out hundreds of dollars for a device that was prescribed in error .
0	it 's like talking to a brick wall .
0	their `` online '' patient portal of little help either .
0	time to get a clue on customer service !
0	next time ... .mayo !
0	service was fast and good .
0	however , not very pleased that banner could not bill insurance correctly .
0	i have definitely experienced better .
0	i 've had 2 surgeries with the clinic .
0	they mess up the schedule and do n't tell you .
0	they leave the stitches in too long then have to go dig them out .
0	i 'll not go back .
0	eventually needed a root canal .
0	on the way home , i pulled over 3 times to throw up blood/bleach .
0	i had a bloody nose from all of this too .
0	this was the worst experience ever .
0	our company provided colmedlabs with their fleet vehicle washing ( detailing services ) .
0	i called sam 5 times and left voice messages .
0	guess what `` no call back '' now being 6 months later .
0	total charge was $ 80 each visits , and total charger being $ 320 .
0	horrific patient financial services .
0	carla and her sidekick badgered my husband prior to his surgery .
0	like he did n't have enough to worry about .
0	after surgery his dr called to let me know he was fine .
0	i asked when he would be discharged and was told an hour .
0	give me a friggin break .
0	at a time when we needed to be together .
0	we heard one patient asked if he could die and was told yes .
0	imagine hearing that right before your procedure .
0	using his full name no less .
0	i 'd be fired in a heartbeat if i ever did that .
0	thank god this was a minor surgery .
0	definitely not happy with customer service experience from financial services and the postoperative stay .
0	find somewhere else who have more loving doctors care for your precious children .
0	these doctors are n't the most knowledgeable nor the most compassionate .
0	i started looking into electrolysis a little over a year ago .
0	this encounter stood out !
0	for my first appointment i scheduled a 15min procedure .
0	i did n't mind initially because this procedure is quit painful .
0	this is a costly procedure and every minute counts literally !
0	this place is horrible .
0	my company switched insurance & my current obgy was n't accepting aetna .
0	fast forward a month or so later when my bills start piling in .
0	why am i getting these bills ? ?
0	so basically , im sol .
0	bad service , liars & cheats .
0	highly discourage this facility ! !
0	try another pharmacy that wants your business .
0	there were no customers in the entire store at 7:30 am .
0	i 'm going to keep my prescriptions where they are after all .
0	too bad , this pharmacy is in a much more convenient location for me .
0	the staff was friendly .
0	it was disgusting ! !
0	i recommend going to another building if you need to go .
0	any massage is a good massage , right ?
0	actually i wish i had skipped this one .
0	my friend did n't mind hers , though .
0	seemed good at first they rushed us into a semi private room .
0	there was no reflexology done .
0	why make an appointment .
0	i can only imagine what it 's like when they are behind .
0	what a joke of an office .
0	i scheduled my appt 1 week prior .
0	the front desk woman was rude and nonchalant about it all .
0	this is a huge inconvenience and highly unacceptable .
0	patients need to be seen and given advance notice of changes .
0	at least offer another doctor to accommodate .
0	i will not be a new patient here .
0	super sketchy part of town .
0	they hang outside smoking which blows back into the shop .
0	it was the worst day of my life .
0	we paid cash copay everytime we was here .
0	i came to ask the receptionist the reason why we waited too long .
0	holly did promised she taking care .
0	i also will report this matter the nevada business bureau soon when i can .
0	i arrived at 10:13 ... 3 minutes past their 10 minute rule .
0	when you walk through our doors , we 're glad to see you .
0	when you call , we do n't keep you on hold .
0	when you leave a message , we call you right back .
0	no manners as soon as i walked in .
0	the nurse who assisted dr. schlotterer was rude and seemed to have an attitude .
0	will not be returning back .
0	i attempted to call again to no avail .
0	this is definitely the last interaction with oasis and dr. bellota .
0	uhh you just saw him and knew he had n't been seen .
0	i even gave them 3 chances to get it right , it never happened .
0	i will be going to a different doctor from now on .
0	i hope dr pragit will move to another clinic .
0	the name should be `` my doctor no ''
0	nevermind on the previous post .
0	it 's not hard to prove you have stage 4 bone cancer .
0	he basically just treated me like a drug addict .
0	ignored all the paperwork which is valid .
0	i even asked him to call the ny doctors and he refused .
0	it 's very simple .
0	call the centre ask if i 'm a patient .
0	i want to go to the hospital .
0	pay 1000 for a scan just to throw it in his face .
0	how can you hold a medical license when you refuse to help people .
0	especially a dying person .
0	the front office supervisor is incredibly rude .
0	thankfully that guy saved my tooth .
0	then i was sent a bill for the work that he messed up .
0	i have developed a fear of dentists since seeing this guy .
0	the facility is very mismanaged .
0	you walk around asking where to go .
0	the administration is rude and dismissive .
0	it seems clear they want your money and nothing else .
0	their website touts lots of amenities that they do n't have .
0	they do n't care about you or your sobriety .
0	it was a nightmare .
0	i left after 4 days and got into a good facility in pasadena .
0	the doctors and staff at this place clearly have none .
0	reception staff was exceptionally rude and the overall experience was entirely unpleasant .
0	like all other massage envys , the therapists are a mixed bag .
0	many newbies so there 's a high amount of turnover .
0	i 've seen a couple good ones that i hope will stay awhile .
0	this location is particularly bad compared to my `` home '' dobson location .
0	the staff was accommodating and i did n't wait long to start my massage .
0	she was excellent , the massage was so relaxing .
0	if you want a massage go see milena !
0	i would n't go back , the groupon was definitely a good deal though !
0	ob patients please avoid dr deka .
0	i was coldly misdiagnosed with a miscarriage after my first apt with her .
0	she performed the ultrasound herself .
0	within 2 minutes she coldly concluded that i had lost my precious baby .
0	she ordered hcg l levels `` to confirm '' .
0	i spent 3 days in a deep depression thinking i had a miscarriage .
0	i am currently 17 weeks pregnant with a baby girl !
0	my baby would be dead if i took her `` expert '' medical advice !
0	going to this hospital had to be the worst experience i have ever had .
0	the vet recommended a 3 day stay to monitor her and printed the estimate .
0	it was $ 5000 .
0	my son and i were in tears .
0	this included giving her antibiotics .
0	my pet is doing fantastic .
0	the brush run vet , dr foil , is very caring , straightforward .
0	brush run really cares about your pet .
0	the vet hospital is just trying to get your money !
0	i went here for their new customer cleaning discount .
0	i made the appointment last week .
0	i showed up 15 minutes before my 2:00 o'clock appointment as requested .
0	i have never seen such colossal unprofessionalism .
0	judging by the other reviews here , i clearly dodged a bullet .
0	worst decision i ever made was get a membership to massage envy .
0	save your money and do n't waste your time .
0	i took my daughter to dr. rowe she was a provider under my insurance .
0	we started with 4 fillings and paid over 500 for them .
0	ridiculous treatment , waste of my time and money .
0	i felt as though they took my cold as a joke .
0	beware of this place , no bedside manner !
0	you really ca n't expect much from sql i have come to realize .
0	i went in to have some blood work done for my one year old .
0	um ok. the process was like a scene from a scary movie .
0	horrible experience with dr. meger .
0	he botched my rhinoplasty ( took off way too much from the bridge ) .
0	he would n't even do the right thing !
0	maybe he just needs to stick with breasts !
0	do n't let him touch your face ! ! !
0	the worst service i have ever experienced in my life !
0	never able to book an appointment when you call or email .
0	and if you want a refund because you are not getting any service ?
0	they messed up my appointment .
0	their behaivor leads me to believe this is a frequent occurance .
0	worst place for stat orders .
0	came in with ultrasound stat from my dr. for inguinal dvt .
0	then told to walk next door to valley radiologists .
0	even they were shocked at dvrs lack of response and care .
0	this has to be the worst hospital around .
0	the staff is below par .
0	overall i give it 1 out of 10 goiters .
0	she cracked my tooth while doing a simple filling .
0	geez i wonder how it got there .
0	perhaps it was the metal clamp you put on my tooth !
0	if i had not signed a waiver i would sue her .
0	i had perfect teeth ... had .
0	it turns out the one good therapist is nearly impossible to book .
0	the others i saw were mediocre at best .
0	recently , a service issue developed that i tried to resolve .
0	there are plenty of other great therapists in the area .
0	do n't waste your money or time here .
0	staff is horrible they 're customer service was pathetic .
0	this was removed originally from the pearson eyegroup .
0	the doctors were excellent .
0	the used car salesman tactics at lenscrafters should be illegal !
0	my original post follows .
0	the eye doctor was excellent , efficient and knowledgeable .
0	the glasses selection process is a scam .
0	i picked out some frames and was quoted a price of $ 550 !
0	after insurance it was $ 510 !
0	that right there is a $ 90 discount .
0	i wo n't even go into the rest .
0	the glasses should have been around $ 300 tops .
0	i do n't know .
0	beware and stay away .
0	this office is very disappointing .
0	the doctors are nice enough but the front desk staff is cold and incompetent .
0	the assistants are rude and inefficient .
0	they do n't know how to bill or schedule appointments correctly .
0	the office is nicely decorated but the equipment is outdated .
0	with tony , i felt that i was an inconvenience and wasting his time .
0	i honestly felt worse about my self after seeing him .
0	this is a failure at all levels , not only with tony .
0	i was on time and filled out same paper work i did two earlier .
0	sat in waiting for 45 min with no one saying anything .
0	the worst experience i have ever had at a dr 's office !
0	the pharmacy is 24 hours and generally always busy .
0	normally i 'm sure this place is great but today was horrible .
0	who wants to hear your vomiting and rabble while i 'm getting a massage .
0	bottom line if you want a quality massage this is n't the place .
0	i checked into the e.r .
0	the wait room was disgusting .
0	their assistant wendy and marilyn however seemed to always be confused and forgetful .
0	their guest came in @ 10 am and left 10pm .
0	admitting nurses great everything else was ok @ best i 'd go somehere else
0	i have had 3 appointments here .
0	i 'd like to give it no stars .
0	the front desk is very unprofessional .
0	the wait times are excessive .
0	i was there for an annual pap smear today .
0	already it 's an embarrassing and vulnerable situation .
0	the doc asks all the same questions she asked in the other appointments .
0	she asks about birth control .
0	i do n't need a sex ed lesson !
0	i have n't taken hormones for 10 years !
0	this is why i 'm seeing this doc .
0	this is why my appointments have been so close together !
0	so let me set the scene !
0	i stopped her , i said excuse me ?
0	she says `` what ?
0	just do n't get pregnant . ''
0	that 's very rude of you to assume .
0	she even tried to turn it around `` you should leave !
0	fully nude argument with a doc holding the door open !
0	but i would like to save others from having this kind of experience .
0	does n't even deserve one star !
0	if you can get an appointment elsewhere , do it .
0	one guy got in ahead of us for an mri .
0	he was in the back for 55 minutes for an mri .
0	2 people literally took almost 90 minutes .
0	others were sitting around .
0	she said `` good luck - i 'm leaving . ''
0	several other people showed up after that , and immediately left .
0	there were several older people , a couple of women with children .
0	and a couple of men ... all left .
0	from now on , any mris or x-rays will be done at the hospital .
0	this was useless and annoying.. very poor scheduling .
0	i even said no to a pap this year just in case !
0	i do not recommend this place at all !
0	when we entered , we were greeted by this younger lady who spoke english .
0	( on the flier it says 10 min head..etc ) .
0	we situated ourselves and they brought out the hot water .
0	way over priced and the proceudre was painfull adn showed no results .
0	do not go to her .
0	save your time and money !
0	do n't ever go here .
0	i went to this location for a time sensitive lab test .
0	saw multiple patients show up and have issues with their appointments scheduled .
0	and definitely do n't need medication .
0	use at your own risk .
0	not sure why they even schedule `` appointments '' they 're more like suggestions .
0	i had a 5 hours tattoo and it was a painful rib tattoo .
0	what kind of customer relation/ service is this ?
0	then he suggested i buy a h2o care kit .
0	i denied since this was not my only tattoo .
0	what ? ? ? ? ?
0	it took 20 minutes for a front desk staff to even check me in .
0	after that i waiting for another 30 minutes .
0	once i got in i had a nurse practitioner see me .
0	i was prescribed my birth control and was done .
0	waited 50 minutes for a 5 minute appointment .
0	but 2 months later same thing happened .
0	they said my insurance does n't pay for the services i requested .
0	my parents were livid !
0	my friend and i wanted to try this place since we had a groupon .
0	we decided to stop by after our pilates class .
0	i have been here once and i honestly will never go here again .
0	i will find a new doctor .
0	or even have the receptionist call me and let me know ?
0	this is so beyond ridiculous and i would never recommend this practice to anybody .
0	i had a groupon so i came here with my sister .
0	the drinks ( plural ) nope .
0	apparently they were serving fruit with a burger today .
0	hmmm one strawberry nd pickle literally half the size of my pinky .
0	are u kidding me .
0	i would give it no stars if i had an option .
0	never again will i come to this place .
0	i would recommend against it in every way .
0	the food ( cajun burger ) had no flavor to it at all .
0	i see doctors almost weekly and this has never been an issue .
0	i called my insurance company and they said everything was fine .
0	the front desk lady finally had to let me go back .
0	i get to the back and i wo n't get weighed .
0	due to this they now refuse to see me .
0	you have been warned !
0	update- vanessa is the front desk person .
0	she was so extremely rude .
0	i ended up leaving and asked for my filled out paperwork back .
0	i told her i did not trust her .
0	she said she did not trust herself either .
0	the massage was not relaxing because it was barely a massage .
0	definitely a place to avoid .
0	do not take time off work to come to this waste of an outlet .
0	my dad and sam are probably not even friends anymore over this .
0	in my book that is racism , not that i care .
0	please dr webber learn bedside manner !
0	today i had to come back for a missed test .
0	i protested and said that i was right on time .
0	this ai n't no micky-ficky airport ! ! !
0	your office does n't and did n't .
0	basically- their inner-office snafus wasted my morning .
0	i was still trying to make sense of what 's going on .
0	c'mon , get it together folks ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	i should n't have had to come back to be tested today .
0	the wait at this place is ridiculous .
0	this is getting ridiculous .
0	they are extremely slow .
0	i will never go to any simon med imaging again .
0	these folks are notorious overbillers , and everyone should be very wary .
0	i hit my family deductible early this year after a couple of surgeries .
0	i get home , and look up my claims with my insurance provider .
0	my portion is zero ?
0	so i call my insurance provider and ask them for their thoughts .
0	`` you should n't have paid anything .
0	we 'll call simon med and request a refund . ''
0	well folks , guess what ?
0	ask your insurer for help .
0	i 'll never go there again .
0	if this happens to you , do n't blame me .
0	you have been warned .
0	this place is a joke .
0	none of them bother using gloves or washing there hands .
0	stay as far away as you can from this place !
0	the doctor did n't even spend 2 minutes in the room with me .
0	place is awful ! ! !
0	i urge you to stay away ! !
0	also good luck understanding them .
0	it 's very difficult if you are older .
0	it 's become like a meat factory herding people through .
0	it 's really gone downhill ! !
0	i have visited this spa from time to time when in vegas .
0	this time the masseuse was 50 min late .
0	i was booked for a massage , wrap and a facial .
0	i left feeling disgusted and ripped off .
0	made an appointment at the dysart location .
0	( i know exactly which location i called .
0	he would not listen to me at all ) .
0	i knew this was going to be awkward and weird again .
0	a lady comes out , also does n't speak english barely .
0	she starts asking me if i received a call from them .
0	no i did not receive a call from them .
0	she keeps arguing with me .
0	i told her nevermind , i 'm not interested .
0	she followed me out , chased me to my car .
0	wtf ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
0	the emergency room referred me to the core institute with a possible fracture .
0	when i asked if i had it correct , he seemed very aggravated .
0	that was about the greatest ounce of courtesy i received .
0	really i felt totally blown off and like my pain was n't real .
0	i was in the exam room for maybe 2 minutes .
0	the doctor glanced at my elbow x-ray and told me to start physical therapy .
0	at least with this visit i felt like i got somewhere : physical therapy .
0	right where the emergency room said it was !
0	i feel like i have totally wasted my time and money at the core .
0	and this is 3 months later !
0	never would i recommend going to the core !
0	they will rape you and your insurance company .
0	i went in for a broken nose and came out $ 10,000 in debt !
0	i spoke to a human for a total of less than 5 minutes .
0	i was left in a room for 4.5 hours .
0	i would rather die than ever set foot in the hospital .
0	terrible business practice to turn away customers before posted hours of business .
0	will be using amazon online ordering from now on .
0	the girls at the front desk are really nice .
0	they do not have moderately priced glasses .
0	i have n't seen a frame under $ 200 .
0	then add lenses and everything , you 're lucky to spend under $ 500.00 .
0	frames are limited as well .
0	i am extremely dissatisfied with this with this clinic .
0	on another visit , i was told that my results would take two weeks .
0	in the meantime , my symptoms are worsening which has resulted in terrible discomfort .
0	i am desperately seeking a new ob .
0	got a groupon deal for their laser treatments .
0	not happy at all .
0	i can not believe the glowing reviews this place has .
0	i had the worst experience with my first prenatal visit .
0	this is my second pregnancy so i know what good prenatal care is .
0	the only person that seemed competent here was the ultrasound tech from valley perinatal .
0	she was friendly and reviewed everything with the baby .
0	we were very pleased .
0	the place does n't have enough rooms ?
0	her responses just showed that she was inexperienced and not knowledgeable .
0	she fell short of answering my questions .
0	she never reviewed the ultrasound or determined my due date .
0	my husband even agreed that she did n't seem very competent .
0	how is she in this profession ?
0	she also had no personality .
0	she did not make any efficient use of the appointment time .
0	but , she asked if i had done blood work .
0	i was sitting around waiting for her that i had n't .
0	this is where everything went downhill .
0	the lady that did my blood draw was horrible !
0	my whole arm went numb !
0	she must of hit nerve twice !
0	i felt like i was going to pass out !
0	i have never experienced such a bad blood draw .
0	no problems at all with my first pregnancy .
0	this lady did n't know what she was doing .
0	my arm was sore and tingling for at least 5 days after .
0	i changed offices the same day .
0	there is definitely better care out there .
0	they use a yahoo.com email address for communication .
0	i just wanted to confirm that they transferred my medical records .
0	the girl answered and then hung up on me .
0	finally , someone else answered and took care of me .
0	what is wrong with this place ?
0	we thoroughly searched for a doctor while expecting our first child .
0	we interviewed with dr. garcia and she was great .
0	took her time , answered all of our questions and was down to earth .
0	i hated the wait , but she seemed worth it .
0	baby was only 3 months old ! !
0	i should have switched doctors then .
0	rude , rude , rude & rude .
0	i personally like eric wolson very much .
0	i have reported her to his upper staff for the past 4 1/2 years .
0	i am done trying to get past this imbecile to get proper medical attention .
0	i hope that you read your reviews and take action .
0	it was very quiet & foot soak/massage felt nice .
0	then escorted to massage table room & seemed to go well .
0	dr appts , rx & sleepless nights w/ itching .
0	please clean your upholstered couch/beds & linens ! ! !
0	no wonder it 's dark & they try covering our faces .
0	this turned out stressful , painful & humiliating .
0	needless to say , we left pretty upset .
0	i came by again on wednesday at 11:45 to find the place closed .
0	the sign says closed on mondays .
0	there were employees inside ignoring us .
0	how do you think you got through nursing school if you had adhd ? ``
0	as if those with adhd are too ill to be successful in nursing school .
0	he was profoundly belittling and condescending .
0	physician heal thyself ... .a tad bit cluster b perhaps ?
0	is n't that what yelp is for ?
0	be wise when choosing a dentist !
0	another example of why we have happily switched dentists .
0	this is not towards any of the doctors or anesthesiologist i have dealt with .
0	only the nurses afterwards .
0	i finally gave up without speaking to a human .
0	i wo n't be returning .
0	nurse who had me was throwing the f-bomb everywhere and the s word .
0	took them two hours to get me in .
0	fyi we were in the walk-in office .
0	waited two hours to get into the actual exam room .
0	doctor did n't show up for another 15 minutes .
0	so unprofessional and disorganized .
0	definitely would not recommend to anyone at all .
0	not recommended , unless you like waiting and poor quality treatment .
0	2 stars might be generous .
0	three phone calls and two emails have all gone un-returned .
0	this company is shady in their billing practices and ethics .
0	currently researching if there is any legal recourse i can take against these people !
0	they charged the maximum obviously .
0	i am wondering what kind of things they can follow up .
0	i even told them that i only used contacts couple times per month .
0	if you want to go that place for convenience , be careful .
0	they may just charge you without telling you .
0	anyhoo , i really wanted to try to start donating again .
0	i called to make a first time donor appointment .
0	apparently they do n't take appointments ... .it 's first come first serve .
0	no problem i guess .
0	got there at 0645 , thinking i would be one of the first ones .
0	boy was i wrong .
0	the waiting room was already more than half full .
0	twenty five minutes later they called me .
0	i was told i signed the wrong sign in sheet .
0	i had to resign on the `` new donor '' sheet instead .
0	for another 40 minutes .
0	apparently i got moved back to the bottom of the entire list .
0	so i just left .
0	so there he was again .
0	seems like a pretty unorganized system .
0	horrible place from scheduling , to billing , to customer service .
0	scheduled ortho appt only to find out the orthodontist did not come in .
0	not good business at all .
0	i have used wellish for 8 years .
0	i have never heard back ! ! !
0	cvs pharmacist called and no return call but i 'm in serious pain .
0	i called the office and was hung up on twice .
0	my first appointment i arrived at 1:15pm and i was not seen until 5:00pm .
0	sorry , i had to write this review but this is not good healthcare !
0	and no other doctor here .
0	waiting room full of people .
0	not sure this is how this is supposed to work .
0	i can , however , speak for my experiences with their laser treatments .
0	in a word , horrible .
0	everyone there seemed to care less about my pain .
0	they appear to be across the street from one another .
0	my appointment here had to be the worst i have ever had for anything .
0	they 're incompetent and make fun of the dying patients in the icu !
0	unless you have a death wish , stay far away ! ! !
0	it was a lie .
0	i figured it out before i went to see them .
0	this office appear to be so techy with their tablets and stuff .
0	overall , not impressed .
0	if only a minus score could be given .
0	dr gross was highly recommended to us .
0	when i read the other reports , i wonder how can this continue ?
0	value your eyesight , do not go to this person .
0	i brought my 11 month old here for some labs .
0	i was expecting a couple pricks on his fingers or feet .
0	instead they put a needle in his arm .
0	maybe that 's the way it needed to be done .
0	then instead of putting a wrap on his arm she put the tape .
0	which is the hardest to get off .
0	the lakewood location is by all definition slower , dirtier , and less organized .
0	and what about those check out lines ?
0	slow is n't even the word at those registers .
0	i kill them with kindness to hide my frustrations .
0	i also ask if i can bag .
0	it 's just quicker .
0	the closeout aisles however are always loaded with random cheapy deals .
0	it 's hard to pass them up .
0	i wish they had negative stars .
0	had spine surgery by a neurosurgeon 6 days later .
0	i told them i was fine with that .
0	it is now 1:28 pm and still no doctor .
0	all this for a simple procedure which will take no more than 5 minutes .
0	never coming here again !
0	have been using veyo for a while , rotten service .
0	lately when i telephone they are having problems .
0	not reliable , sometimes have to wait close to an hour to get picked up
0	i 'm sorry this is a bit long but hear me out .
0	here goes : i moved to arizona from hawaii 8/2014 .
0	i sought out dr. kale in the gilbert/mesa office .
0	thank goodness for my nurse ... she was a sweetheart and a half .
0	well , other than that , my delivery was quick and perfect .
0	with her being in the hospital , i had to rent a breastpump .
0	i rented the breastpump for 2 months .
0	my baby came home and she took to breastfeeding with no problems .
0	i had no problems with that .
0	i contacted goodman & partridge and spoke with a nurse explaining my situation .
0	obviously those dates would show i no longer need the breastpump .
0	so i coughed it up as a loss .
0	it was n't worth my time anymore for a mere $ 70 .
0	i 'm so over them .
0	just had to write this review for all to see .
0	thanks for looking ... find a small practice where they care about their patients .
0	they barely restocked their supplies .
0	the pa was trent blake .
0	his demeanor was sort of friendly , but his execution was lacking .
0	he had no concern for anything that might cause me pain .
0	stay away from this place .
0	all for what amounted to a 2 minute visit !
0	i 'm getting a new doctor .
0	rude ... i 'd rather be told we 're closed ... .
0	3 people in lobby .
0	they do n't take appointments for x-rays .
0	here with a child , this will not go well .
0	receptionist called neighboring simonmed .
0	40 minute wait , why do n't you go there .
0	forget that , 10 minute drive almost same time .
0	why is place understaffed ?
0	why do they want to get rid of patients ?
0	would not recommend to anyone .
0	i would never recommend anyone go to this doctors office .
0	takes weeks for people to call you back .
0	the run around you do and the wait time !
0	no one values a patients time !
0	i sure as hell am !
0	this place has been closed permanently and their phone number is out of service .
0	although this website is still up and running - it 's a farce !
0	the place has shut down with no forwarding address !
0	ca n't stand places that do n't answer their phones .
0	i call at 5:40 and the answering machine says i called after business hours .
0	they close at 6 ...
0	they offer empty apologies , without any change to their program .
0	what happened to `` glasses in about an hour ? ''
0	officially convinced , lenscrafters is sham .
0	find another low cost solution for tattoo removal .
0	do not be fooled .
0	after treatment 6 is has barely faded .
0	this place is a rip off .
0	they should be ashamed of themselves !
0	he was never given a smock to change into .
0	this entire facility should face legal action and be shut down .
0	i had my 10 week pregnancy check-up .
0	it bothers me a lot .
0	she did n't give me any estimates citing different insurances billing differently .
0	nobody mentioned the costs , even dr. swarup .
0	ca n't you have a little more compassion ? !
0	i just lost my pregnancy , you piece of crap !
0	nurses were moody and could n't explain which cups to use to urine samples .
0	when i called nurses and front desk , they were acting all arrogant .
0	what about me , the patient , and my availability ?
0	you know , i have a life with responsibilities too .
0	on-call nurses do n't know anything , googling stuff is more accurate .
0	she did not even cut some dry skin between the corner ! !
0	hate this place ! ! !
0	i wish i could rate them 0 star ! ! ! ! !
0	that is so rude ! !
0	i have to ask her 3x to do it !
0	never had bad experience like this from a nail salon !
0	i already told my family friends stay away from this nail salon ! ! !
0	your review that stated that we will fix the problem , fix what ? ?
0	i just want to let the customer know to stay away from this salon !
0	i saw dr. khiani for over a year and his treatment worked great .
0	i had the most allergy free summer in my whole life .
0	he advised that they do n't have a method to do so .
0	i came here in physical pain and i could barely tolerate it .
0	worst case of empathy .
0	there was never a smile in this woman 's voice the entire time .
0	i almost felt like i was bothering her !
0	she quoted $ 55 for an hour of massage or facial .
0	not a good first impression folks .
0	when we decide on a spa day , we will be looking elsewhere .
0	i felt so talked down to for needing an antibiotic .
0	i sadly will be looking for a new doctor 's office .
0	i work walking distance from this office .
0	the location is pinned incorrectly on maps .
0	i got there at exactly 2:30 and was told my appointment was cancelled .
0	no emails , texts or calls i received mentioned getting there early .
0	she had no empathy and did nothing to make it right .
0	what a terrible experience .
0	how does this place stay in business ?
0	because there are people like me who fall victim to their sales pitches .
0	people like me who are in pain and will try anything .
0	it seems too good to be true , because it is !
0	for about $ 300 , i got a pair of little plastic pieces .
0	they will try to sell you three for close to $ 1000 .
0	what a fool i am !
0	i should have left then .
0	learn from my $ 300 mistake .
0	do not go to good feet !
0	she retorted , `` your teeth are all going to fall out '' .
0	did n't you hear me the first time i explained it ? ''
0	i still have no idea if she 's licensed or properly trained .
0	if you provide any intelligent/questioning thought , you might be ridiculed and/or berated .
0	is there a rating less than one ?
0	worst dentistry ever ! !
0	is that a joke ? ?
0	really.. receptionist is unprofessional and rude .
0	how long will it take the doctor to approve and release my xrays ?
0	dont ever visit this place again !
0	this place has given me so many problems !
0	i waited again and they finally arrived at my house .
0	i finally made an appointment for today .
0	i told him that i could n't afford it .
0	i wo n't use avi again !
0	they have too many problems with the competency of their staff .
0	i have been holding off writing this review for months .
0	they performed a skin prick test which came back negative .
0	they diagnosed me with idiopathic anaphylaxis .
0	they officially diagnosed me with a dairy allergy .
0	i was switched from dulera to qvar .
0	20 minutes later i was having a serious allergic reaction .
0	i was given a `` dexamethasone sodium phosphate 10mg/ml injection '' to my ass .
0	i was told to never take that breo again .
0	i called tottori 's office and alerted them to my reaction .
0	they prescribed me spiriva respimat as a last ditch effort .
0	over the next few days my symptoms were getting worse .
0	after a day or two my asthma symptoms were starting to diminish .
0	i was able to go over a week without using my ventolin .
0	i was taking 200/5 dulera , they submitted 100/5 dulera .
0	i now have to call and get this fixed .
0	my only question for tottori is `` where is the accountability ? ''
0	office personnel never pick up the phone .
0	you need to reach .
0	very frustrating when it 's important to get in touch with someone .
0	i do not mind seeing pas imho .
0	perhaps if i firmly asked three times i will get what i asked for .
0	this is apparently a suggestion in my opinion .
0	i think this is unacceptable for a medical facility .
0	overall , very disappointed and will not be returning .
0	had an okay experience here , and would not consider going back .
0	the whole appointment felt rushed .
0	the hygienist was not gentle .
0	lenscrafters should not cost more for a visit to their store .
0	will not be using them next time .
0	i didnt even want to give 1 star !
0	i will no longer take prescriptions there .
0	i even took the time to contact there corporate headquarters in illinois !
0	i have 0 confidence in them .
0	i have been with this office for 13 years .
0	i have never liked the office staff .
0	i scheduled an appointment doe today .
0	i took my child in for a routine physical .
0	i am expected to believe they all can be seen at 130 ?
0	i am tired of this office and will not be returning .
0	billing coordinator is never available , and claims are incorrectly processed to insurances .
0	all in all the office staff needs to be reevaluated or cut .
0	i bought a groupon for 6 laser hair removal sessions on my lower legs .
0	receptionist and space is nice .
0	my first session i went home with a burnt mark near my ankle .
0	the machine is painful and i 'm barely seeing results .
0	especially the pharmacy department , where they only hire rude , incompetent people .
0	we went to refill a prescription that had previously been filled at another cvs .
0	when we asked her to recheck , explaining our situation , she refused .
0	that request was also denied .
0	`` they are unavailable . ''
0	we will never return !
0	i was transferred to his voicemail .
0	who am i to hold responsible , walgreens or healing hearts ?
0	yours truly , a dissatisfied arizona parent .
0	will never go back .
0	in addition , when i was initially diagnosed they scheduled a followup apt .
0	i am extremely disappointed in choosing happy dental .
0	here for the first time with my dad for his apmt .
0	can u say hipa violation ?
0	they do n't take patients based on their apmt times .
0	several people with times after our apmt were taken in ahead if us .
0	why even have apmt then ?
0	the nurse who took my dad back was very rude .
0	she looks at me and says you ca n't come .
0	no reasons no explanations just a no .
0	even another patient mentioned that it was rude !
0	i would never ever recommend this lab to anyone .
0	look for another option .
0	this is the last time i get my prescriptions here .
0	i would recommend not coming to this cvs ! ! !
0	if i could give zero stars i would .
0	tough approach , yes , uncaring , you betcha .
0	this woman was imbalanced , i reported her .
0	it was a nightmare .
0	then the word part ... les than 5 minutes with the doctor !
0	i got some new glasses here this past fall .
0	that appointment itself went well and i really liked dr. sorensen .
0	things happen ... .no big deal .
0	sadly the glasses have never fit quite right .
0	they fit nothing like the sample pair they have there .
0	that is true , if you can get them to wait on you .
0	the customer service for adjustments is terrible .
0	it more often than not i just give up and leave rather than wait .
0	i want to give my business to someone who wants my business .
0	this place is terrible and deserving of its low rating .
0	however , i 'll now suffer with ungroomed eyebrows before i go back .
0	you usually end up with a nice shape .
0	she was the last one i saw .
0	however , my last service is n't the only thing that turned me off .
0	and when i say push , they push !
0	i do n't care if you have the ultimate hair removal machine .
0	i do n't trust you !
0	fix the fundamental issues first , and then get into promoting services like that .
0	half the time this meant i would n't tip .
0	fat reduction , wrinkle removal , etc .
0	go in and see for yourself .
0	- they 're definitely pricey , but do n't provide value .
0	but that also means that customers expect a higher level of service .
0	anyway , i think i 've said enough now .
0	my advice is to stay away from this place if you can .
0	do n't do it moms , do n't schedule an appt here .
0	this place has a ten dollar canceled appt fee , i get it .
0	they are covering their own to stop ppl from flaking .
0	every policy needs wiggle room .
0	they lost our business completely .
0	i have to agree with these reviews good and bad !
0	her staff who answers the phones really should be counseled or fired .
0	she is short and just does n't leave you feeling warm and fuzzy .
0	getting my b12 shot is fast and efficient !
0	i am in and out in 2 minutes !
0	i called and cancelled , was informed of the 25 dollar cancellation fee .
0	maybe when hubby gets home i can get a ride from him .
0	case by case and be strict for abusers .
0	wish me luck and i will keep you posted !
0	the secnond opinion took full x-rays and cleaned my teeth .
0	it felt like you were in an emergency room of a hospital .
0	not a good atmosphere for a quiet couples massage .
0	then the massage started and that 's when it got interesting .
0	due to the sinus massage i have had difficulty breathing from my nose since .
0	then she left for about 2-3 minutes .
0	comes back and gives a half assed shoulder/arm/leg massage then leaves for 5 minutes .
0	she stands up on my back .
0	this goes on for 5 minutes or so then she leaves .
0	at this point i 'm just ready to be done .
0	i came here for a sleep study .
0	the lady that took me to the back was not very personal either .
0	i assumed she had a bad day and left it at that .
0	i got taken back and setup along as other people .
0	one of the other clients played his tv super loud .
0	i could not sleep till like 1 am .
0	i did not sleep at all really after that because mask was so weird .
0	bed was like soft prison bed .
0	sheets were even less desirable along with pillow .
0	ive been to 10 sleep clinics since high school and this was the worst .
0	the er sucks majorly !
0	thanks for the tylenol , jerk .
0	oh , the piano music and guitar in the lobby was nice and cheerful !
0	was not impressed with integrative .
0	love my regular vet but they do n't do acupuncure .
0	i called and made an appointment for an office visit .
0	just wanted him to check my dog and tell me their protocol .
0	vet techs do teeth cleaning .
0	also not something i was thrilled with .
0	i have always worked with doctors who did this themselves .
0	since he specializes in chiropractic , it seemed that 's what he talked about .
0	staff was pleasant but the wait was unreal .
0	i have an appt th but do n't know if will continue there .
0	we came about 9pm right after my surgery .
0	anyway we went through the drive through .
0	had a bad attitude from the get .
0	she told me ( even more rudely ) '' move along now ! ''
0	and she shoo-ed me away with her spastic hand motions ... how rude !
0	hello people do n't usually end up in the pharmacy at their best right ?
0	`` hahha oh ok miss ( ssss ) , guess what ?
0	now i do n't feel comfortable filling this . ''
0	`` i do n't like you so that is my right . ''
0	you do n't like me ?
0	`` too bad here is a cvs down the street . ''
0	she said , and she waddled away .
0	that is when i flipped .
0	`` please do n't complain . ''
0	she said , '' i 'll give you a gift card ! ''
0	`` i 'll fill your prescription . ''
0	`` sorry it 's just store policy . ''
0	whatever she rectified it .
0	still , it that was my grandma she was treating like that ?
0	i just would n't want to have not done my part .
0	i 'm still going to complain ... 1. to you , fellow yelpers !
0	there are too many other people who need good jobs !
0	i will never go back to the chubacca cvs .
0	not even to use my $ 25 gift card .
0	i will take her advice and go to the one down the street .
0	and when i stop for gas ?
0	go talke some customer service classes you rude mean person .
0	see , i can be mean too !
0	but i did n't call you chubacca once !
0	attitude is everything folks .
0	i feel much better , thanks yelp !
0	ridiculous it 's been a month .
0	nobody calls me and when i call them they do n't seem to care .
0	terrible terrible service avoid at all costs .
0	very surprising from a business that seems to be soliciting yelp reviews .
0	dr jawadi was very personable on my first visit .
0	i was going to have test so we scheduled for the next visit .
0	i will admit i was nervous about it all .
0	my sister had a procedure done and stated it was very painful .
0	this increased my anxiety .
0	the procedure started and i jumped .
0	dr jawadi stayed i could not feel what was being down .
0	well yes i could .
0	she told me i needed to be ready for the next procedure .
0	she pointed her index finger at her head and said in you mind .
0	speaking down and curt to me like i was stupid .
0	actually i was afraid and anxious .
0	she must have missed the class on bedside care in school .
0	so i was late to my appointment .
0	i was informed they had a 15 min rule .
0	well no one shares the rule and it is not posted .
0	i patiently waited for my turn before and paid my money to be seen .
0	there was no discount because she was late .
0	the receptionist would not even ask if i could still be seen .
0	it is our policy that if you are late you have to reschedule .
0	i asked for the report of the previous test .
0	they gave me the results with no explanation and i left .
0	i came back and canceled my appointment .
0	i then returned to get the rest of my chart .
0	i said you just had my records .
0	the receptionist said you are not getting your records today .
0	we have 30 days .
0	i understand you are upset .
0	i told her she did not understand .
0	do n't take it out on me .
0	i left and then i remembered i owned money .
0	i offered to pay what was owned .
0	the receptionist informed me that i did not owe anything .
0	she looked at me and turned and walked away .
0	i guess she missed the communication and courtesy class too .
0	i am very disappointed in her and her staffs behavior .
0	i am a new patient that just moved to the area .
0	i have been with laura waggener , np , for 15 years .
0	i followed her from ingrid haas ' office when she joined paradise valley obgyn .
0	i liked her and felt comfortable with her .
0	i was told to get dressed and leave .
0	this was the most humiliating experience .
0	needless to say , i left there in tears .
0	i could understand it if i came in off the street .
0	laura was the only `` doctor '' i had known .
0	the renovations are now impacting the quality of my ymca membership .
0	there is no classes between 12:30 and 4 pm ?
0	what a joke ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	i 'm about to cancel my membership .
0	my family goes to this facility .
0	we have only seen dr mickus .
0	he referred us to a dermatologist .
0	his nurse called and gave us the appt time and location of the dermatologist .
0	we ended up in the emergency room .
0	he is starting antibiotics now .
0	horrible service ! ! ! !
0	i sure do n't think so .
0	i have already reported the review as a fraudulent review because it truly is !
0	shake my head ranch dental plaza !
0	2. on my ranch dental plaza paperwork .
0	3. by a person who works there that i 'm friends with on social media
0	altaf did n't know what robaxin was for .
0	i also know it makes me feel bad .
0	she wanted me to take more and add another muscle relaxant to this one .
0	she also decided she knew more about my pain than i did .
0	how is that possible ?
0	a pain threshold is held by the person with the pain .
0	this is a `` medical group '' with around 20 physicians .
0	i called to schedule an appointment with a different doctor .
0	when she asked questions , she spoke over my answers .
0	you ca n't hear what someone is saying if your mouth is moving .
0	and it 's rude to interrupt .
0	i 'm the one trying to get better .
0	they are authoritarian and indifferent .
0	they lack empathy and compassion .
0	are they working in healthcare just for the pay scale ?
0	i followed up after my appointment , first thing the next morning .
0	this is the middle of the second business day .
0	they wont speak to me , and have not returned answers to my questions .
0	this location is dirty , smells , and has an interesting staff .
0	this place is terrible and so was the doctor that saw my grandfather today .
0	we had to wait 2 hours to be seen .
0	after each question he answered , the doctor would ask `` why ? ''
0	in such a condescending tone .
0	anything but `` why ? ''
0	`` why '' is such a silly question . ''
0	wow did this guy get defensive after that .
0	i just gave him a blank stare .
0	you should learn a little compassion and talk to your patients with respect .
0	you go there for headache they send you right away to allergy test .
0	horrible horrible horrible customer service ! ! !
0	do not purchase from liftchair.com or liftchairexperts.com ! !
0	vegans / vegetarians beware ! ! ! ! !
0	there were items marked vegetarian that were actually vegan .
0	well , this is a yes and no answer .
0	now , the reason for the one star .
0	this kind of defeats the purpose of being vegan / vegetarian .
0	the cleveland va being rated so high is a joke .
0	this hospital is a dump and their employees dump on you .
0	i am so sad to have to write this review .
0	my boyfriend and i visited here for spa week yesterday and were really disappointed .
0	unfortunately , the joya spa did n't live up to my expectations .
0	after looking at pictures and reading reviews , i was still excited .
0	upon entering the spa , we checked in with a smile-less hostest .
0	they swept us off into opposite directions so we had to coordinate via text .
0	the facilities are nice and i liked having my own personal locker with keycode .
0	my therapist joel came to get me 5 minutes after my scheduled 1pm appointment .
0	joel took me back to the treatment room and the room was pretty uninspired .
0	service was slow and my turkey burger was pretty bland .
0	i was served my salad in a bowl where the sealant was coming off .
0	he just said 'okay ' .
0	maybe we just had a bad experience because of spa week ?
0	i 'm not going back to find out .
0	terrible service ! ! !
0	if you can find another place ... ..do n't choose this terrible ortho dentistry !
0	it might be cheap but is not worth it .
0	please do n't waste your time and money .
0	first , you wo n't be welcome by receptionists .
0	they are too busy with whatever to give you any attention .
0	you must speak up for yourself and let them know you are here !
0	i wo n't be back .
0	i went in here with my husband several weeks ago .
0	after the eye exam , i heard him speaking to his receptionist about us .
0	i wasted 4 hours of my time today to be denied service i requested .
0	the impact of my current condition is both physical and emotional .
0	used them for several years and they were fine .
0	they just said no .
0	they do n't do refunds and said they 'd send the right medication .
0	we 'll , it was obviously a rush , right ? ? ? ?
0	they still refused to refund any money and blamed it on my vet .
0	so do not use this pharmacy .
0	dr. bijan ahrari is not a very good doctor at all .
0	do n't waste your time or money .
0	you are better off googling your issues and resolving them that way .
0	i worked here and only lasted six weeks .
0	my lead supervisor was cold , indifferent and unfriendly towards me .
0	this adgitated her and she got an attitude with me .
0	this was an overall very disappointing and somewhat humiliating experience .
0	i went in for fillers under my eyes , my lips and smile lines .
0	also botox and thermage .
0	my eyes and lips look worse than before .
0	actually want my eyes undone if that possible .
0	it took months for the swelling and bruising to go away .
0	had to go back 3 times to get the botox right .
0	this place is the poster child for how not to run a medical office .
0	i just said okay and hung up to do my research .
0	the doctor was great and full of knowledge .
0	i had no choice but to say yes and go see his replacement .
0	then the dr. should stay home and you receptionist should n't schedule anything .
0	they have me so upset .
0	i swear these reviews are fake as hell
0	two crowns for a total of $ 4000 .
0	i got a second opinion and got two fillings for less than $ 150 .
0	i thought i would wait awhile before writing this review .
0	the previous one star review on yelp uses the words `` money hungry '' .
0	you be the judge $ 4000 vs $ 150 .
0	i 've been a patient of dr dalley for several years without complaint .
0	however here lately their office is extremely difficult to reach .
0	they tend to overbook patients .
0	i had to wait about 40-60 minutes every single time i went there .
0	you will wait 10 mins first to see a nurse .
0	your actual time with a doctor is about 10mins .
0	no wonder every one has to wait a long time .
0	i do n't like a place that seems to be very profit driven .
0	update : just got my lab bill .
0	roughly 4 months later .
0	this incompetent medical practice pulled $ 1000 worth of blood work .
0	they should change their name to slowmed .
0	honestly this was a pretty terrible experience from start to finish .
0	after sitting in the room for another 20 minutes the dr came in .
0	she 's like `` yea . ''
0	the most insulting experience ever ! ! ! .
0	if there were 0 stars they would get that .
0	i have been coming here for 7+ years .
0	after reading all these other reviews i see that 's a common trend here .
0	he volunteered to call for me .
0	my new dr got me in within 3 minutes of check in .
0	new horizons averaged about 1 hour even with an appointment .
0	so bring a book .
0	i liked my therapist , and i enjoyed the therapy process .
0	however , they screwed up my billing .
0	do not go here .
0	i got my breads and desserts elsewhere .
0	i think the overall feel from staff in the store is impersonal .
0	i can get organic anything elsewhere with much friendlier service and cheaper prices .
0	i may return if i hear they improve on customer service .
0	do n't waste your time .
0	your time does n't matter here at smile brite dental .
0	dr vu schedules way too many appointments at once .
0	i 'm so disappointed with the staff .
0	the dental hygienist rushes through my cleaning every single time .
0	wow , so unprofessional .
0	if you love your teeth and your time is valuable do n't come here !
0	it 's not just this location it 's all of them .
0	worst hospital i 've ever been to !
0	we waited 4 hours with her crying out in the emergency room .
0	she was never even offered a blanket .
0	she said she had never seen anything like this !
0	i got the coldest answers from the front desk .
0	they were the most unsympathetic people i have ever seen .
0	they were laughing with each other and then ordered a pizza !
0	i had been talking with a woman waiting to be seen about my daughter .
0	it was one of the woman behind the desk .
0	she said `` you need to sit down .
0	she also told another person to be quiet .
0	i felt iike i was in kindergarten , not an adult .
0	she was talking about me !
0	i was so embarrassed !
0	i later received a call from a customer relations person for the hospital .
0	no complaint form , just a `` sorry about that '' letter .
0	my tattoos did not even have color .
0	when i said something to the manager she suggested i buy more treatments .
0	i only bought the other 3 because they said definitely they would be gone .
0	i was also told to drink more water .
0	i have been dealing with these tattoos for almost 3 years .
0	that was 3 weeks ago .
0	i have not heard back from them either .
0	i wo n't be finding out .
0	why would i drive 3 cities over .
0	yet when mentioned to the manager she just suggested i purchase more treatments .
0	now i 'm off to delete in phoenix .
0	other then that there 's not anything too positive to say about the place .
0	the guy at the front desk could n't have been any ruder .
0	he never even looked up at us .
0	the doctor was ok i guess .
0	this is a very nice looking place .
0	last time it was about an hour .
0	folks , this place is not big and i was the only customer there .
0	the just seem really clueless which is great since they handle my meds .
0	the absolute worst ! !
0	avoid at all costs .
0	i would absolutely discourage anyone from becoming a patron here .
0	even if you 've contacted them before using text .
0	their bogo deal is no deal at all .
0	spent $ 360+ on 2 pair which both broke within 1st year .
0	got a great pair at costco for $ 190 .
0	will never shop there again .
0	i 've been waiting for 1.5 hours to check in .
0	there are only 4 total people in here .
0	( cheyenne location ) not a very good experience with scheduling .
0	so , i called the office to schedule an appointment .
0	they use a specific system that my doctor does n't use regarding referrals .
0	one call after another .
0	so much red tape .
0	my son finally gets his appointment .
0	i drove across town to be told that they canceled my appointment .
0	i never received a call .
0	now im looking for another doctor .
0	do not go here !
0	read other reviews from actual patients .
0	no follow up and you can not get carmen on the phone .
0	front office is a disaster .
0	i had been in the chair for 3 hours and just wanted to leave .
0	it 's a shame because i like curtiss , the hygienist , very much .
0	called ahead 12:00 gave me a time for 2:45 .
0	3:00 they called to come down .
0	4:30 i 'm still waiting .
0	that was the quick service ? .
0	it was n't even busy .
0	the antibiotic has a listed complication .
0	oh yeah , we 'll have to retype the prescriptions .
0	the staff spent more time on insurance billing codes than patient needs .
0	a sharps box ( used needles ) on the floor .
0	nurse tells kids stick hands in `` all the time '' .
0	do n't let your kids stick hands in . ?
0	what is the box doing on the damn floor ?
0	i would n't even take my dog to this place .
0	once you get in to see the doctors , everything is great .
0	we especially love dr. winterland .
0	however , the ladies up front are terrible .
0	we have never had a good experience with them .
0	our must recent bad experience happened today .
0	we kept the same appointment time with another physician .
0	we checked in on time , and then waited and waited and waited .
0	after 30 minutes of nothing , i went to ask how much longer .
0	`` oh , he 's running an hour behind today . ''
0	we have a one and a half year old .
0	they need to seriously clean house up front .
0	needless to say we left .
0	come here if you have nowhere else to go .
0	apparently , 9 bucks were n't enough for her .
0	where 's that attitude coming from ?
0	that was the first and the last time at that place for me .
0	for the most part the office employees were friendly .
0	i should have read the reviews before booking with this dr 's office .
0	do not go to see doctor hamburg or anyone else at this business ! !
0	so thank you so much , you pompous son of a bitch !
0	i sincerely hope you rot in every hell .
0	i was recommended dr kootman by my eye doctor due to dry eyes .
0	meridian valley labs ) $ 154.85 directly as opposed to $ 650.00 .
0	this dental practice has very unfriendly service all around .
0	i have n't gone back and i will not recommend anyone to this practice .
0	everyone was nice , but at what cost ...
0	do not use this outfit !
0	terrible customer service and cavalier with customer 's time .
0	will not be going back .
0	i wo n't be back .
0	my fiancé was experiencing extremely bad abdominal pain .
0	we got there and everyone was very friendly except for one nurse .
0	she ruined the entire experience .
0	i liked the doctor , but the office staff is rude and condescending .
0	really ? ! ? ! ?
0	why should i have to prove i was right ? ? ?
0	we did some research and discovered we had paid the bill .
0	insurance had finally gotten it put through in feb 2016 and we immediately paid .
0	i told her i could still dispute it with my cc company .
0	she said they would mail the check that weekend ( it was wednesday ) .
0	i asked her to refund the card , which she supposedly did .
0	i also asked her to send email confirmation of the refund .
0	do not trust these people
0	( although better but not right ! )
0	another chat with my insurance company is again informing !
0	swdg still did not follow through with my advise and filed incomplete claims .
0	~ she finally filed correctly ! ! !
0	which i knew was coming but why so much ! ! ! ! ... .
0	can you believe it ! ! ! !
0	how shady can you be ! ! ! ! !
0	needless to say ... i 'm only paying the cost share and nothing else !
0	sooooo long story short beware ! ! ! !
0	i decided to give the new doctor a chance ( dr.rosario ) .
0	never again will i step into that office .
0	i was extremely disappointed with how i was treated .
0	bought the groupon for exam , x-rays , and 3 adjustments .
0	setting the appointment was quick , easy and friendly .
0	the video was of testimonials saying how awesome this new nucca chiropractic treatment was .
0	wow , he was 20 pounds heavier on his right side .
0	so we set an appt for the next morning .
0	by then we already knew we wasted the $ 45 on the groupon .
0	so finally time for the `` adjustment '' .
0	the adjustment did absolutely nothing to my spouse .
0	so for some , the mind funk obviously works .
0	thanks for reading ; )
0	this office is so unorganized and unprofessional .
0	i am very disappointed with my experience .
0	they had no idea how to help me with my tooth pain .
0	i do not recommend his place .
0	please read the yelp reviews !
0	it would have helped me to make a better decision .
0	i too , purchased a groupon and over paid .
0	i felt so embarrassed .
0	the tip suggestion started at $ 15 for just good .
0	i felt the massage was counter productive after that .
0	i just moved and we are on a budget .
0	i paid for the actual service , so do n't suggest a higher tip .
0	i rather they hike the price but that 's their game i guess .
0	get you in the door and then after , surprise ! ! ! !
0	please let me know !
0	sorry , i wanted to write something amazing about you guys .
0	i was excited but i ended up feeling insulted .
0	beware of dr sharif ! ! ! !
0	beware of this `` doctor '' !
0	his office and him are extremely unprofessional !
0	it has been hell from the beginning with this surgeon !
0	for starters my mother checks in for surgery , 6am .
0	the chicks in his office confirmed the week prior they will get them .
0	and he obviously shows up to the hospital without the mri or prepared .
0	no one called or advised her they needed it or did n't have it .
0	he walks out to call his office .
0	i run and go get the disk , come back .
0	he tells us , i cant do the surgery .
0	this is too rushed and i just cant do it today !
0	and mind you my mom is in excruciating pain and desperately needs this surgery .
0	he has to follow up on the surgery he preformed .
0	this surgeon could n't care less about his patients !
0	and will kill or paralyze you .
0	if at all possible see a different doctor !
0	my 6yo son went in for a filling and 2 root canals .
0	he was nervous , but everyone promised him it would n't hurt .
0	he gave 5 novacaine/lidocaine shots .
0	2. charlie brown just proceeded to drill without testing for numbness .
0	he proceeded to drill again , and my son screamed again .
0	dr. brown 's frustration was obvious .
0	again , no test for numbness .
0	my son screamed again , and was now crying .
0	i was frozen in shock , and regret not interjecting .
0	dr. brown drilled again , and my son freaked out , sobbing .
0	nope , not numb .
0	this injection was more painful , and again , no topical anesthesia .
0	that 's when we realized the bites were way off .
0	who does crown work and fillings without bite adjustments afterward ?
0	it was short notice , and the earliest i could get in was noon .
0	we had to wait until monday .
0	my son cried a lot in his sleep that night .
0	not enough to wake himself up , but just soft sobbing throughout the night .
0	it was heartbreaking to hear .
0	he 's super diligent about flossing and brushing now .
0	anything to avoid going back to the dentist .
0	correction i asked for the paper work in may , got charged in june .
0	requested paperwork again then did n't retrieve the email .
0	then finally the 3rd time requested email .
0	girl up front not very interested in helping .
0	i asked if they could call in and have someone help her ?
0	got more sassy attitude and she spoke to me like i was not intelligent .
0	i guess im crazy .
0	left immediately and wo n't go back to a location that hires rude idiots .
0	i was forced to come here during a short vacation .
0	they tried to connect with me and make sure that i was comfortable .
0	i had sat in my room waiting for the results of my blood test .
0	is n't that how you ended up here in the first place ?
0	this nurse had no right to say that to me .
0	i just wish that she would have been more polite about it .
0	that is no way to treat a patient that is paying for their stay .
0	anyway , my experience was eh .
0	i really liked this office on my first visit .
0	now i am beyond frustrated .
0	not sure how they stay in buisness .
0	easily the worst doctor i 've ever been to .
0	she does n't listen and only pushes birth control on you .
0	the staff rarely answers the phone .
0	i had an issue last year and she was sent for an ultrasound .
0	now less than 6 months later the issue has returned .
0	i would not recommend this place for anyone .
0	very rude receptionists ( not all but some ) .
0	do n't take it personally !
0	also the deli is having very limited number of choices for the crowd .
0	for me this is not a recommended place .
0	i went in for an x-ray at this facility and that went fine .
0	there was a wait but whatever ... the real pain came after my appt .
0	it has been a joke .
0	i wish i looked at the yelp reviews before switching to this location .
0	compare offices..mesa has the worst rating .
0	( i 've never had a problem with the scottsdale office ) .
0	their office staff has zero empathy .
0	*do not visit this office* i needed to be seen for 2 things .
0	1. foot pain 2. tb test .
0	then they sent me a bill on top of that for $ 139.86 .
0	further- dr. patrick tested my thyroid and the test came back normal .
0	i was then referred to a thyroid specialist by dr. patrick .
0	when i questioned this he stated i needed to see an endocrine specialist .
0	it 's not the first time i 've had to remind them either .
0	i am saying this because i went somewhere else and it uncompareable .
0	i had previously written a good review but i am changing that .
0	no prelude , no explanation , nothing .
0	so this can drag on ?
0	i am sorry but this is my life , my baby ! !
0	hello anger & frustration , there you are .
0	a few things about this clinic that gave me a negative impression .
0	the reasons i was given did n't add up .
0	my advice : install the 'calm ' app on your smartphone .
0	you have the app with you as long as your phone is with you .
0	i wish i could have given a zero star .
0	i went there with severe throat pain due to pharyngitis .
0	i was seen by mr peter who behaved very rudely with me .
0	i spent so much money to hear these things .
0	very ill mannered and rude physician .
0	my wife made an appointment after finding out she was pregnant .
0	if i could leave less than one star , i would .
0	i dont know who tge 4 star reviews are by .
0	they must be relatives of the owners .
0	this place was the worst place ever for my mom .
0	my mom was the very first resident at hacienda .
0	i began complaining about issues happening .
0	they did not bandage huge open wounds that got very infected .
0	several times i visited my mom and there was blood all over the floor .
0	but was dried so it had been there for a while .
0	there is so much more .
0	if anyone wants more info , you can email me at thegiftingstore @ gmail.com .
0	dr. delee isnt the problem its the front office .
0	i like dr.delee but after my twins im switching to another ob .
0	his front office is just horrific and rude .
0	i listened to it .
0	so , i got a second opinion .
0	i did just say that .
0	there is no cavity .
0	the tooth is literally fine .
0	and as for the other two fillings dr. keller told me i needed ?
0	that was one thing that this new dentist could agree with dr. keller on .
0	and i had her fill it , and she did an amazing job .
0	so , dr. keller should be embarrassed .
0	heck , i would be .
0	i would never lie to a patient .
0	get your wallet out !
0	this has been my dentist for five years !
0	five years , my kids and i have come to this office .
0	now i call and ask what the balance was for ?
0	well , the insurance has not paid .
0	i ask them to call the insurance company .
0	so i call and stated i need to speak to the office manager .
0	i leave a message .
0	she never calls back .
0	five years i have been coming here .
0	i explain that i have- how did all the other bills get paid .
0	did they check in on the reimbursement ?
0	no they did not .
0	i state they told me they would- i 'm told that 's my job .
0	when i call i am left on hold .
0	my emails are unanswered .
0	no one answered , thus leaving the bill unpaid and a balance for me .
0	so many fake reviews ! ! !
0	i ca n't stand that .
0	i went to this place for contacts .
0	seems a bit expensive overall .
0	if you like care salesman tactics this place is for you .
0	it 's all about selling you !
0	i was ignorant towards this type of `` business '' .
0	they convince me i need major testosterone !
0	money hungry businesses that 's who !
0	never a discussion further .
0	i made one last attempt to go i to the office three weeks ago .
0	this was the worst experience !
0	my blood pressure is 184/111 dangerously high !
0	what do they do ?
0	he said it did n't matter i still owe it .
0	he walked out , now i 'm in the .
0	what real dr does this ?
0	plus never explaining what the additional charge was that they were demanding me pay .
0	i have contacted an attorney who says i have a solid case .
0	this practice should be ashamed of themselves !
0	please stay away read all these complaints on yelp .
0	this office does the same thing to everyone !
0	go to to an md who is not a quack !
0	it feels like the staff does n't care about their patients .
0	i am fairly disappointed with custom eyes in general .
0	so obviously , with the information given , you plan your day accordingly .
0	the person with the key arrives few minutes late .
0	i go in to check-in and sat there waiting .
0	he was thorough and was explaining what each machine does .
0	she apologized for her tardiness .
0	she was knowledgeable and informative and asked if i had any questions for her .
0	in the end , i left the office at 11:30am .
0	made an appointment the day before was sent the email that confirmed the appointment .
0	that morning i was offered an on call shift at work .
0	when arrived they had no record of my appointment .
0	even though i had text a message confirmation and email confirmation .
0	cost me big money .
0	the girls all were very rude , and took no responsibility .
0	it 's time to look into a receptionist .
0	the results of a 24 hour urine test were reported on myquest.com .
0	i called quest to explain the error .
0	my trust in quest is seriously eroded .
0	i can only wonder at the quality of the results from other tests .
0	practice is 4.5 stars ! !
0	but dr. mckenna should receive zero stars for bad business practices ! !
0	if you care about ego , status and popularity then go for it .
0	saw the nurse practitioner who was great !
0	she diagnosed the issues and recommended treatment .
0	next appointment was with dr. mckenna since he would be performing the treatment .
0	standard doc ... friendly , knowledgeable .
0	nothing special that would wow you .
0	she said she would call us with a potential date .
0	being popular among rock stars ?
0	not ent patients ? ? ? ?
0	i do n't care about a rock doctor !
0	i care about my step-daughters issues ! ! !
0	i have been going here for three years as a self pay .
0	i am never greeted by the girls at the front .
0	i now have insurance and am currently looking for a new doctor .
0	i have never felt so undervalued .
0	no bedside manners and extremely dissatisfied for life with the services rendered .
0	this place is a joke .
0	after 3+ hours waiting to see the dr , i had to leave .
0	i had no choice i had to get back to work .
0	i had a bad a experience with this place some months ago .
0	literally an hour later still did not get called back .
0	so , i just left .
0	they never called or e-mailed me to apologize .
0	i was there for a free consultation .
0	if possible to find another neurology center , i would recommend doing so .
0	i was diagnosed with sleep apnea years ago .
0	i need a cpap machine .
0	i started the process with them in march .
0	it is now july , and i still have weeks more to wait .
0	you guys deal with sick people all day .
0	do you like working here ?
0	her attitude changed really quick .
0	extremely inconvenient and literally no regard for my moms and my time/ money .
0	surprised this place has no reviews .
0	maybe they pay to have them removed .
0	i received the initial consultation at the desert location .
0	everyone including the dentist seemed professional enough .
0	by the looks of the office they are by no means a high-end facility .
0	they picked me up which i thought was a nice service .
0	i heard everything i needed to hear at this point .
0	i decided i would not continue with the advised plan .
0	super shady and i will be letting the insurance company know about these scammers .
0	seriously i had an 8 am appointment and it 's been nearly an hour .
0	there is literally one woman tuning the show .
0	she is checking in , doing the paperwork and then sucking the blood !
0	worries about the quality of anything and tired of waiting ! !
0	joke of an office .
0	if you can avoid it at all , never go here .
0	office staff that is rude and does n't care .
0	they ignored a lady crying in a wheelchair in the office .
0	i had to help her pull out her dl and insurance card .
0	they could n't have cared less .
0	she actually wrote resolved for the vertigo on my check out sheet .
0	tell my body that , you half wit not even a nurse .
0	now there 's dr. yu .
0	who at first seems okay .
0	very thick accent , but does n't seem to remind repeating things .
0	because their are n't , for him .
0	he 's not taking it so he does n't care .
0	six ? ? ? ?
0	one or two i could see , but 6 ? ! ? ! ?
0	guess he 's weak in math , as he is in being a neurologist .
0	they had my vertigo as resolved ( spoiler alert : it is n't ) .
0	how stupid are you , dr .
0	yu ? ? ? ?
0	how much do n't you give a fuck ? ? ? ? ?
0	i 'll be `` short '' about the wait times .
0	they 're fucking forever .
0	if you get in by 8 a.m. you might get out by 11'ish .
0	have an afternoon appt ?
0	hope i 'm alive to get her call .
0	seriously , what a shitty office this is .
0	my name is renee noyes this place dragged me along for over two years .
0	sat there and argued with me that i always had scoliosis .
0	they write stuff to cover their own butt and dr. daftari is the worse .
0	he refused to help me with pain .
0	i can not walk or stand with out pain still to this day .
0	i can not sit because of my tailbone pain .
0	i can not look down because something is wrong with my neck .
0	i do not recommend going to them .
0	i do not trust them .
0	i finally have pain doctor that is helping with pain .
0	dumb jerks i tell them that because i am home bound and hurt .
0	why even give a star .
0	worst place to come to .
0	staff is very unprofessional .
0	but yet everyone that came in after you is seen .
0	the staff should be more courteous and people friendly .
0	instead of seeing you as a disease .
0	well-oiled machine my foot .
0	i asked for a referral and the referral department has yet to call me .
0	it has now been three weeks .
0	also , the billing department attempted to double charge me for my copay amount .
0	most importantly , dr. irene delorenzi has some serious likeability issues .
0	rather cold bedside manner and a condescending nature .
0	time to switch pcps ... again .
0	thanks for the runaround , wfp .
0	the waiting at this facility is unreal .
0	i have donated several times and it seems like the wait time has doubled .
0	it 's is closer to 4 hrs now .
0	they have no sense of urgency .
0	their workers will stand around and chat .
0	i do n't understand why they allow this behavior to continue .
0	it 's sad that they are okay with that kind of customer service .
0	the people who work here even seem to hate their job .
0	i would never recommend this place to anyone .
0	it 's not worth the little money you get for the time it takes .
0	he offered a $ 20 consult .
0	i purchased the option for me and my husband .
0	he used a divide and conquer sales method .
0	this place feels like a mult-level marketing scam !
0	we have since found a reputable provider .
0	please , please , i beg of you go somewhere else !
0	note : this review is for the billing department only .
0	the doctors and medical staff are excellent ( 5 stars for them ) ! !
0	i 've already filed a complaint in bbb because of that .
0	i saw dr. robert j hamburg , md ( great doctor ! ! ! )
0	please note that the medical performance date is 11/3/2011 .
0	one year after the service date , i finally knew such bill existed .
0	beware of the billing department and any bills from this clinic .
0	hope this review helped .
0	and again , i do recommend dr. robert j hamburg ! ! !
0	he 's very very nice , kind , patient , and knowledgeable ! !
0	and so she set up the appointment for my 2nd sleep study .
0	i 've been waiting for over a month now .
0	i 'm just hoping that i will get my results read this month .
0	for the meantime , i 'm still waiting ( sigh )
0	i agree a lot with sarah louise .
0	i love the exterior and the storefront .
0	like sarah , i found the instruction to be below average .
0	i will likely use up my groupon but then move on .
0	i had an 8am appt time .
0	they were already more than an hour behind for walk ins .
0	she tries to put my info in the computer and it does n't work .
0	their computer system was down .
0	i waited two weeks to get a morning appt .
0	i took time off from my job to do this lab .
0	another useless big corporation not caring or making any effort to actually help people .
0	this location only staffs 1 person to do all the jobs at the lab .
0	i would give it negative stars if possible .
0	i agree with katelyn b review .
0	the place is pathetic as i wrote before .
0	which mind you was pre approved by them ! ! ! ! !
0	i am an 800 credit score .
0	i paid every office visit when they asked .
0	they handled this situation in a very unprofessional matter and were extremely rude .
0	including the head person linda who was just not nice .
0	she will come off very nice but she is not !
0	remember my previous review was deleted because they were being exposed by me .
0	do not go here !
0	this should be illegal .
0	do not go here ! !
0	absolutely no way i would have my exam started within an hour .
0	this is why i scheduled my appointment .
0	never seen this office so disorganized and uncaring .
0	i left and will not be returning .
0	however , in our very next appointment , they make us wait for 2.5hrs ?
0	how unfair is that ! !
0	i 'd complained about allergies all my bleeping life southwest medical just gives pills .
0	got ta call tomorrow and that 's okay , it 's almost 5 pm .
0	to just summarize it all .
0	slow service they seem to drag things so you pay another co-pay .
0	i find them incompetent .
0	this place was just awful .
0	the whole time i felt like i was getting ripped off .
0	will never come back .
0	we knew everyone there and service always great .
0	since avella bought it the operation has been chaos .
0	not good medicine and not good business .
0	going to walgreens down the street .
0	can not believe this place is even open
0	the dentist was very quick-almost made me feel like a number .
0	the hygienist was downright rude .
0	each visit brought on multiple issues with their staff acting unprofessionally .
0	will never recommend anyone in serious pain to this hospital !
0	brought my nephew in today because he has a fever .
0	we were told that a pediatrician will be available to see him .
0	after checking in , we were seen by a nurse practitioner instead .
0	then recommended to insert a catheter to draw his urine to check for uti .
0	we disagreed & asked to see s pediatrician .
0	for ear infection , i already know the doc is amoxicillin .
0	they did not even asked for these symptoms .
0	yes , he has dry cough .
0	so we refused catheter insert for uti test .
0	i said no , it 's otc & we already have it at home .
0	omg , otc advil/tylenol/motrin is q4h or q6h .
0	where is informed consent ?
0	no one bother to follow this as health care providers .
0	i 'm a health care provider myself but not in pediatric .
0	u just do n't try to shove medications or procedures on to patients .
0	so glad i came with my nephew today .
0	when you love your market you love it , it 's simple .
0	then at the juice bar they no longer take punch cards , why ?
0	i will not be going back .
0	my insurance covers a standard exam , including dilation .
0	both her and the paperwork made it sound like it was basically mandatory .
0	finally , they refused to tell my inter-pupilary distance .
0	their refrigirated section is discusting .
0	it has not been cleaned in eons .
0	needless to say , i wo n't be going here anytime soon .
0	there 's a giant eagle in the same area .
0	i ask myself why i did n't go there ?
0	but then after meeting the doctor my mind definitely was change .
0	so i guess they did n't want my money .
0	i wanted the 2 for $ 70 glasses with the included exam .
0	i just do n't get it .
0	honestly the whole thing was really stupid .
0	definitely not going back here .
0	the staffs in this loblaws are very unfriendly .
0	they ignore customers , give wrong information , and yell at customers .
0	it 's always freezing here , bring a sweater .
0	wait time is really long .
0	hmmm what about drs orders ?
0	i did everything he asked and ordered .
0	nevada healthcare needs to step it up a few notches .
0	horrible `` dr '' .
0	hopefully you wont make the same one .
0	this plan is unhealthy .
0	and most of the meals are just bland and fatty .
0	they all have this similar taste which gets revolting after a few weeks .
0	went today and i have insurance with a copay .
0	i did n't consent to it , so they would n't see me .
0	as long as someone else is paying they are fine .
0	called to make an appointment because i read such great reviews .
0	which one was it ?
0	lost my interest in this place that fast .
0	my midwife was lisa , the founder of the company .
0	despite being a late transfer , i felt confident in my decision .
0	however , this is when the first red flag flew .
0	this is when things went wrong .
0	it is only a strip after all .
0	still she was not concerned .
0	`` i do n't like to do internal exams .
0	you look alright to me '' .
0	i left feeling unheard and slightly embarrassed .
0	about four hours in , i developed a backache .
0	i dealt with it for an hour but it progressively got worse .
0	i also developed nausea and fatigue .
0	maybe i 'm just sitting wrong ?
0	all in a condescending tone .
0	we got a hotel .
0	i was there thirty minutes before i knew something was terribly wrong .
0	they took me to the nearest er .
0	i was admitted for two miserable days , fighting pain , fever and nausea .
0	my poor baby had to be monitored due to high heart rates .
0	after all this , i simply ask you proceed with great caution .
0	you may be lucky and nothing goes wrong , but god forbid it does .
0	indeed , they are a business despite trying to appear otherwise .
0	proceed with care sisters !
0	thanks for reading this review .
0	do n't be fooled by their fancy office , and their well-dressed receptionists .
0	they still owe me 1000
0	speed read 1 ) made from real beans , right there .
0	2 ) i do n't like their sale tactic .
0	when i buy take out , i usually do n't examine what 's inside .
0	i bought it from here many times .
0	well , some time i am not happy with what i got .
0	stay away from this place unless you have time gas and money to waste .
0	# 5 the listening sessions only give you a glorified nap .
0	plus they repeat these listening sessions .
0	i 'm not the only one see online for more reviews .
0	waste of time money and additional stress .
0	walk away - you could get a good 5 star vacation for $ 1500 .
0	dr. steinbrunner needs to take a patient/ doctor communication class .
0	be honest , explain treatment , results , possible risks and outcome .
0	how do you know a week later that i have a bad infection ?
0	that was the end of our relationship .
0	do not go here ! ! ! !
0	now they say no that it goes toward next service .
0	do not use this voucher .
0	i tipped her $ 20 too .
0	she entered the room and went right to work , which felt very uncomfortable .
0	so i 'm giving her a star for her time .
0	worst company ever to deal with ! ! !
0	stop over treating ! ! !
0	this place is a joke !
0	do n't recommend ! !
0	my primary care doctor advised that i see both a neurologist and ent specialist .
0	they had recommended phoenix neurological associates .
0	when i called , we went through standard information gathering .
0	then the scheduler asked me what i was being seen for .
0	my gp advised that i see a neurologist for a reason .
0	poor customer service and very rude .
0	the guy that helped me had a cup in his mouth the entire time .
0	he hurt my arm as well .
0	will not be returning to that location again .
0	i had $ 120 and that was it .
0	today , i stopped in there because i really need new glasses .
0	my current pair was about 7 years old .
0	i picked out a $ 150 frame and brought it to the counter .
0	now it 's a different lady at the front .
0	why do n't i have an eyeglasses script on file ?
0	i guess the $ 200 dollar eye exam did n't include an eyeglasses script .
0	my script has changed very little since early 90s .
0	i did not need another exam , i 'm tired of this highway robbery .
0	this place seems to really like the money grab so beware .
0	in response to dr. rios ' angered reply .
0	why doe n't $ 200 cover for a glasses script ?
0	what lobbyist out there wanted a state law to renew eyeglass scripts annually ?
0	can you say `` special interests '' ? ? ?
0	where do you see blackmail ?
0	that statement about blackmail alone makes me think you are wacko .
0	i am completely satisfied with my new glasses and i see great .
0	thanks for your concern about the health of my eyes , though !
0	how would he know if my script was the same since the 90s ?
0	he only saw me once and i brought no previous records with me .
0	i do have an exuberant personality , i do n't deny that .
0	when i got the the counter it was twice that amount .
0	he mentioned that the `` eye care community '' had recently discovered this information .
0	let 's divide their services .
0	their technicians , on the other hand are excellent .
0	duh , maybe because it was never written up ? ? ?
0	they 've been able to take care of almost every problem i 've had .
0	maybe $ $ $ ?
0	i have been on hold trying to schedule an appt .
0	for over 33 minutes now .
0	you guessed it - scheduling .
0	i 'm right back where i started .
0	if i could ... i would seriously give this place 0 stars !
0	this is a medical center !
0	very rude service being that they are working at a medical place .
0	i suggest or recommend to go to a different medical center / hospital please !
0	i am doing everyone a favor out there .
0	if there was a no star it would be my choice ! ! !
0	i have kept quiet for months & i 'm done .
0	after waiting 3 months to get my dentures i have had it .
0	today 's visit was icing on the cake .
0	tried to fit me today with my completed dentures .
0	the lowers are looser than the ones i have .
0	the tech kept grinding the dentures trying to get the bite right .
0	i was told they would be fixed & done by wednesday .
0	well i 'm not going back .
0	they sure have almost $ 2500 in their pocket tho .
0	i will be pursuing any & all resources to get a full refund
0	i was just standing there waiting to be acknowledged .
0	hope you can resolve this issue asap !
0	thank you but no thank you .
0	good luck to you i hope your experience is a better one .
0	they have compensated me for my gas given vip cards and everything !
0	i purchased a groupon and scheduled an appointment online .
0	the appointment was confirmed and i arrived 15 minutes early .
0	luckily , groupon is awesome and refunded me .
0	the ladies at the front desk are completely rude and unprofessional .
0	i live about 30 minutes away from the clinic .
0	came in 30 minutes before closing .
0	mind u drove all the way there again .
0	just completely rude and unorganized .
0	need to staff and system and a better team .
0	i went to my appointment today .
0	one of the workers came in to do another eye exam .
0	what is the point of having him there ?
0	i told her to get the doctor .
0	i walked into the waiting area furious .
0	it does n't make any sense .
0	she has to call the main office to get my money back .
0	steer clear of this place unless you like to waste your time .
0	***their office called me today - said they wo n't refund my money .
0	i literally signed up for yelp just to leave this review !
0	i could not agree with her more ! ! ! ! ! !
0	i 'm shocked because she described my experience as well !
0	i mean zero interest ! ! !
0	she was combative and dismissive the entire time .
0	do not waste your time or money ! !
0	all they seemed interested in doing was writing prescriptions .
0	this was the most god awful medical service i 've ever had .
0	i could have received more insightful health information out of a vending machine ! !
0	we hope you feel better .
0	the back area is very smelly as well .
0	have had better service honestly but the gel was painted decently .
0	we live far & have been with clinic over 3 years !
0	french manicure was carelessly applied .
0	dr. leroy kareus was my initial doctor , but sadly he passed away .
0	in my own opinion , he was the 'gentle soul ' of that practice .
0	my appt was sch late afternoon the day prior by the orthopedic office .
0	i knew and the orthopedic office knew my insur required referral approval .
0	no on answers and a mesg comes on advising their closed .
0	really smh , so what exactly happened ?
0	how was that over looked ?
0	definitely improvements needed in that dept .
0	5 to the gal up front , thx !
0	worst of all : they expect a minimum tip amount .
0	they expected a minimum of 30 % .
0	they kept shouting at me that they wanted more tip .
0	and then they said it was a required tip minimum .
0	are they crazy ? ? !
0	do n't go to this place .
0	i was very unimpressed .
0	i used a groupon that i got for a 60min swedish massage .
0	i would n't say it was worth even the discounted price .
0	the woman who did my massage was not friendly at all .
0	she barely said anything and was somewhat snippy and cold throughout .
0	it just felt very cold and sterile .
0	i would n't return for a massage .
0	the man who worked there seemed nice , though !
0	my dog went four days without her chemotherapy as promised .
0	roadrunner did not process my order for five days because of their oversight .
0	i called multiple times to get my dog 's chemo .
0	shipping is advertised to be free and in three days .
0	my first and last experience !
0	stay away ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	he does n't deserved a star but i have to put one to proceed .
0	2 ) they lost my script .
0	who has the answer ?
0	your guess is as good as mine ! ! !
0	lost of a script is unforgivable ! ! !
0	major disappointment ! ! !
0	same company , two totally different experiences .
0	clearly i will be taking my business to the one that deserves it .
0	i went to this dentist yesterday .
0	though i will never go back to them they had an extremely nice staff .
0	i loved the receptionist , dental assistant and doctor .
0	do not walk in to this `` walk-in '' clinic .
0	arrived the second they opened , still waited 3 hours and had to leave .
0	way overbooked and only care about the copays .
0	currently have an infection that showed up a few days after my vasectomy .
0	procedure went well and there was no pain during .
0	i 'm sick and need medicine , get some pep in your step !
0	honor your appointment times !
0	from the moment i walked into this place , i felt some off vibes .
0	the counselor i was set up with was awfully judgemental and made me uncomfortable .
0	she was prying too much into religious views and such .
0	just another one that doesnt get that not everyone is religous .
0	i 've been going to this practice for over a year now .
0	this is the second time they have charged my card without permission .
0	charges and overdraft fees because the money was n't there .
0	i am done with this office !
0	when they were at their old offices service was great .
0	never had to wait more than 10 minutes beyond my appt .
0	when they moved to a larger office it all changed .
0	three weeks ago i went in for a 10:30 appt .
0	she asked if i wanted to reschedule and i said yes and left .
0	yesterday i went back for my rescheduled appt .
0	i now have a recommendation from my doctor for a new dermatologist .
0	i had my appendix removed earlier this year by this doctor .
0	it was the worst experience of my life .
0	well guess what ... he did n't care .
0	he instructed his billing department to move forward with billing me .
0	please email me privately for that website address .
0	do yourself a favor and run from this doctor .
0	do not let him operate on you .
0	or you only have yourself to blame if you do .
0	never had such bad food in there
0	my initial thought was this is a really nice pharmacy , esthetically .
0	however , it be better managed .
0	i was in the area and had my drs .
0	i was not feeling well .
0	two medications were called in and i was instructed to start them immediately .
0	this pharmacy was close to closing and my drs office had already closed .
0	she said they can call it to my local avella pharm near me .
0	i then had returned to the cashier line to pay for my item .
0	she paused awhile and asked the pharmacist if she could do that .
0	i mean seriously ... rocket science here or just common sense ?
0	she finally checked me and the other customers out .
0	i wish avella would have been up front with my drs .
0	office from the initial phone order .
0	i would have gone to another pharmacy to get the meds that were prescribed .
0	the doctor seems like he just rolls out of bed and comes to work .
0	good thing i use a new doctor now .
0	do n't waste your time people .
0	i have enjoyed this place in the past .
0	unfortunately on sunday i had a miserable experience .
0	i was told i would be contacted and never was - very poor service .
0	once again i got burned by this location .
0	i always say i 'm not going back but somehow end up there .
0	today put me over the top .
0	the parking lot is hands down the worst in the city of cleveland .
0	i almost got hit 3 times by other drivers .
0	they need to have separate cashier who only deals with this form of payment .
0	i can not recommend them based on this .
0	so we got there around 10pm and it was not that busy .
0	service there was two ladies and one guy .
0	they could not really understand english so they there was a language barrier .
0	they we 're all nice but i did n't feel welcome .
0	i guess that 's better than massaging soft .
0	overall i would not return to this foot massage because i got ripped off .
0	the guy stopped us and said we had to tip a minimum $ 10 .
0	this is the worst most unorganized slowest cvs i have ever dealt with .
0	this particular visit i set in the drive-thru for at least 14 minutes .
0	cvs at 44th street and bell please get your act together !
0	if i could give this dr a negative 5 , i would .
0	he is the worst doctor i have ever came across .
0	i would not recommend this doctor to my worst enemy .
0	unfortunately , as a 40 year old male i had my first er visit .
0	unfortunately , it was at mountainview hospital .
0	they took over 3 hours to provide any treatment of any kind .
0	i felt very alone and helpless in their care .
0	not a very compassionate hospital .
0	it felt like that was the accepted culture at mountainview hospital .
0	this is only a summary of my experience .
0	stay away if you can !
0	the office manager amanda has no idea what she is doing .
0	i tell her that is the definition of insanity .
0	doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result .
0	do not ever come here for help or treatment in the medical field .
0	the worst run doctors office i have ever seen .
0	i see better management and workmanship at a mcdonalds or mexico .
0	receptionist had very poor phone etiquette !
0	no customer service at all and absolutely no aloha .
0	place seems like a serious scam !
0	i was told they only accept new `` functional medicine clients . ''
0	besides the fees they would bill my insurance .
0	what a joke ! ! !
0	craziest first phone call i 've ever had to a `` professional doctors office ''
0	you can go to a fine clinic just up the road for $ 39.00 .
0	so happy i will only have to be here for one test .
0	nice jennifer main piece and others i 'm not familiar with
0	staff were unhelpful from the first call to until my appointment departure .
0	dismissive staff , terrible communication .
0	had to pay for parking to be dropped off ! !
0	avoid if at all possible .
0	this dentist office is a joke .
0	i paid and left .
0	there she did not feel the pain and was numbed correctly .
0	i know saturdays are convenient but i recommend waiting and getting into another office .
0	one of them then proceeded to ask me why i was visiting today .
0	i was n't too sure if i missed something .
0	ever since dr. doyne passed away this place as went to poop .
0	they dont listen to your needs .
0	which i found out by personally calling my quest .
0	the answering company answers the phone more than they do .
0	and no the answering gas service will not pass on the message .
0	i would n't recommend this place for my worst enemy .
0	it had went so far down hill that is not even funny .
0	i did n't feel like they even tried to help .
0	the absolute misleading place i 've ever been to .
0	i was quoted 2 different prices 2 different times .
0	this place does dishonest business .
0	the staff is unprofessional .
0	smirked the entire time and looked like she was about to laugh any minute .
0	is this how you treat all of your patients ?
0	sorry , i just ca n't recommend this place .
0	the doctor was great but the staff was awful .
0	three weeks later , i was still trying to track down my order .
0	you 're supposed to guess when your prescription comes in .
0	i left with all the knots i came in with .
0	the massage therapist kept walking out of the room .
0	i gave her a good tip on the original amount because i felt bad .
0	the service did n't deserve a tip at all .
0	it was n't even close to the full length of time , but whatever..
0	this urgent care is the worst i have ever been to ! ! ! !
0	i would never recommend this place to anyone .
0	so bring a 1rst time patient i arrived to see dr tanarya at 2:30 !
0	she gave me two prescriptions one for back pain and another for muscle relaxer !
0	no one 's answering the phone .
0	miss placed my drivers license and insurance card .
0	well my first impression is my last impression of that place .
0	i 'm sure this is a more profitable area for them .
0	had a groupon to this place .
0	she disnt speak english so i could n't really have a conversation with her .
0	i sat there for about 25 minutes and finally somebody walked in .
0	then my 30 minute detox was 20 minutes .
0	i never recieved the email .
0	this place was horrible and far from relaxing .
0	i recommend not coming here at all .
0	shame on devin luzod .
0	i saw dr. chasby today and left crying and frustrated .
0	i am now permanently marred by his animal .
0	i booked this appointment a few weeks ago and have been waiting .
0	no sir , i am not requesting that .
0	this experience was completely unprofessional on multiple levels .
0	thank you for wasting my time today dr. chasby .
0	i 'm reviewing the minute clinic .
0	i went in for an ear infection the other day .
0	i think i 'd only go here for vaccinations , if that .
0	what a ridiculous way to run a business .
0	sorry to cut down on spreading germs .
0	will not be returning here .
0	scheduling staff was unfriendly and lacked compassion .
0	do n't waste your money .
0	i do not recommend this plastic surgeon .
0	never had this happen in my life before .
0	massage was good but pricey .
0	staff is rude , loud and obnoxious !
0	they curse out loud ! !
0	waiting room is old couches and chairs that are ready to fall apart .
0	tv has a dial and antenna .
0	rooms are small with no decor .
0	the doctor is up front and fast .
0	tell her what you need and she will give you a perscription for it .
0	be very skeptical of this establishment if you get your teeth cleaned here .
0	' ... yeah , right .
0	i was also charged a $ 30 co pay for virtually nothing .
0	no mention of periodontitis or cavities .
0	the 2nd dentist never told me that i needed laser gum treatment .
0	they will likely try and sell you expensive dental services you do not need .
0	dr. prabhu is terrible and his staff is even worse .
0	another doctor used to work here who was much , much better .
0	i did n't get to work with him very long , because he quit .
0	you look like a bunch of fools every time i come in .
0	i ca n't wait to find a new doctor .
0	you 're the worst in las vegas .
0	you need to write your cpap prescriptions for a full year or a lifetime .
0	i actually use mine every single day and need it to live .
0	you should be ashamed of yourselves .
0	you 're not medical professionals in my mind .
0	all you do is rip off and inconvenience everyone who walks in here .
0	you deserve to go out of business .
0	i visited this center twice .
0	both times , i felt dismissed and not heard .
0	`` essure '' in my fallopian tubes .
0	the doctor never called to consult or ever followed up .
0	i 'm truly grateful i did my own research and changed the plan .
0	oh , i wo n't be returning here .
0	ive been coming here for over 3 years now .
0	pros : doctors are nice and helpful .
0	assistants are great at blood draws and pleasant , kind .
0	cons : absolutely horrible communication regarding payments and insurance .
0	front staff is rude and does not know how to explain anything regarding insurance .
0	never told me there was a check in time and an appointment time .
0	never calls back when they say they will .
0	ca n't keep track of client history .
0	is my mental health really that much a priority to them ?
0	obviously i will be finding a new doctors office .
0	one of the most uncomfortable , unprofessional experiences i have ever had .
0	but , i paid what i was told what i owed .
0	then out of the blue , they billed me for over three hundred dollars .
0	there was no reason why , just a bill .
0	save yourself some trouble and go somewhere else .
0	the worse service i had ever received .
0	save your stress level and pick a different office
0	the staff is nice , but the wait times are *ridiculous* .
0	my husband saw dr. bradford 14 years ago and had a wonderful experience .
0	it 's a shame that the medical profession has lost all compassion and understanding .
0	there is no paul b , owner .
0	the practice is owned by dr. bellota and her husband dr. a. bist .
0	unethical behavior should not be tolerated .
0	i have screenshot and documented all correspondence with this office .
0	do not accuse me of making things up .
0	my appointments were all 5 mins long !
0	do not comment on my mental health .
0	do not assume i expect to be cured overnight .
0	first , do no harm !
0	that 's a medical malpractice suit waiting to happen .
0	this just adds on to the incredibly unprofessional and subpar treatment i received .
0	the beaurocracy here is absurd .
0	i have nothing nice to say about their service .
0	if i could give this business a zero , i would .
0	i had extreme dizziness being on their program .
0	it was to the point that i could hardly go to work .
0	i saw two different doctors and they confirmed it was due to the program .
0	my experience was not as positive as that of the other reviewers .
0	he seemed rushed and disinterested .
0	i 'll give you a referral . ''
0	and then he was gone .
0	he practically left skid marks .
0	he was a real jerk with no bedside manner at all .
0	i felt sorry for the women working in his office ; they seemed nice .
0	he was a real asshat .
0	have had to use them for just about 2 years for regular supplies .
0	both derms suggested i increase the rx .
0	i would n't recommend spectrum to anyone .
0	just remember that this is your journey and your child .
0	who enjoys seeing negative online reviews and ratings about his or her business ?
0	is now heading towards an evening appt . !
0	they said they were still pending insurance verification .
0	why does this process take so long ?
0	so , i waited another week or so and i called them again .
0	( when was somebody going to call me and let me know this ? )
0	there is no available appointment time .
0	i never heard back from them again , so i called them again .
0	this is where i am done .
0	i will find a place that can manage it 's business office .
0	your office practices have caused a serious delay in my son 's care .
0	0 stars is more like it .
0	new parents , do n't waste your time this place is a joke .
0	this happens to my husband and i every time .
0	are you kidding me !
0	i called my location for the document for a reason !
0	providers are wonderful but do n't expect to see the same provider ever .
0	even if you schedule out , something always seems to go wrong here .
0	again do n't waste your time with this awful staff .
0	wish i did not have to rate this office .
0	sending us to the 3rd dr to see if someone can correct it .
0	dr knows both hips are having issues but wants the insurance money first .
0	they are interested in money and only money .
0	your first visit is just a questionnaire which you would normally fill out yourself .
0	i should have left then .
0	he is all about money .
0	this is total bs as many of you know who are on adderall .
0	i asked do you give them medical treatment other than the chiro treatmen .
0	i was like wtf dude !
0	like helllooo , i am so sorry i wanted soup .
0	worst experience ever with a psychiatrist .
0	and he is a therapist ?
0	i tried to discuss symptoms with him when he suddenly announced i was depressed .
0	i am not depressed .
0	i have extreme anxiety .
0	do n't waste your money or what is left of your sanity .
0	never ever go here .
0	i had two different tests done here .
0	this place is an absolute joke .
0	there are many other places in town , go there .
0	wish i had read the other yelp reviews of people with similar experiences .
0	stay far away from this office .
0	had a horrendous experience just trying to make an appointment .
0	this is my first introduction to this office .
0	i finally got the receptionist and she said i needed a referral .
0	i explained i have a ppo plan that does not require referral .
0	when i questioned her , she hung up on me !
0	i find this behavior rude and unprofessional .
0	why should making an appointment be this difficult .
0	i was referred by a pediatrician to see this md .
0	i am new to the area and i had no idea what to expect .
0	i had reserved my judgment of the area -- -they could be good .
0	my first visit was good , but odd .
0	i was not told i would see a physician assistant until i arrived-not cool .
0	i am trying to go with the universe .
0	i did my labs on the property-yes !
0	and when you ask questions to the staff , they know nothing .
0	i just ca n't with them .
0	my health insurance listed them as an in network doctor .
0	thank the heavens i do not need referrals .
0	i am going back to the one medical group .
0	shows they did n't care about my business ! ! !
0	do n't dare go to this hell hole .
0	they ripped me off and the owner is a liar .
0	its been 6 months and my mouth is still in pain .
0	i have filed with the state board over my situation .
0	save yourself heartache and aggravation ... do n't go here .
0	i had a membership and recently canceled .
0	my therapist was very pleasant , and it started out great .
0	it did n't happen .
0	i was very disappointed and it was the worst massage i 've ever had .
0	it 's saturday , not a phone call or follow up to be had .
0	let 's be honest , shopping at marc 's is awful .
0	they have the most inconsistent inventory ever .
0	but the absolute worst part is check out .
0	and what the hell is up with their bags ? ? ?
0	how is that cost saving ?
0	in sum , marcs -- the necessary evil for the cheapskate shopper like me .
0	what an awful experience today at this visionworks location .
0	talk about zero personality .
0	honestly , i think the whole experience was a crock .
0	horrendous place to go too ! !
0	probably not even real doctors .
0	bad experience with a female dentist there .
0	the female doctor there is lazy .
0	it was so painful that the horrible pain kept me up all night .
0	i would not recommend her to anybody !
0	not ever going there again !
0	definitely suggest retraining bad attitudes only get you so far ... ... never again
0	the place is clean and the staff is cordial .
0	they are not about serving their patients .
0	i have been going to the 4c medical group for quite a while now .
0	he 's a child .
0	they get sick sick .
0	i wish i could give this dental practice zero stars .
0	very sarcastic also , in an failing attempt to be funny .
0	then finally they did and mailed my mom her check .
0	new dentist likes to recommend unnecessary dental work to everyone .
0	i highly recommend anywhere else .
0	i called 2/22/18 to make an appointment .
0	i gave them all my info to get prequalified for my procedure .
0	was told i would get a call back the same day .
0	completely unprepared for thanksgiving rush .
0	every department in disarray .
0	the office staff is either incompetent , or they just do n't care .
0	not just a delayed response , zero response .
0	last time it was 1.5 hours .
0	dr. aragon seems knowledgeable , but i find her cold and distracted .
0	does n't make eye contact , does n't seem like she 's really listening .
0	office is officially closed .
0	it 's been a nightmare .
0	my daughter starts allergy shots soon .
0	so far the office has been great to work with .
0	one lady turned to another and said they 'd been waiting 90 minutes .
0	well , to be accurate , 57 minutes .
0	( yes ) and then asks if it 's metal ?
0	and i just look at him very level .
0	and i tell him , very quietly , `` no .
0	i do n't have any extraneous metal hair ties . ''
0	this comedy show goes on for a while .
0	at no time does he come in and say anything .
0	like- did we have to start over ?
0	did something go wrong ?
0	at no time did he offer assistance .
0	well , no it was n't .
0	i know , because i can math .
0	good job , simonmed .
0	i was highly recommend to dr cummings in this group .
0	he did not order any diagnostic imaging for the first 3 months .
0	i was only prescribed physical therapy .
0	when that failed he ordered mri imaging for my elbow only .
0	over 6 months later i got surgery on my elbow only .
0	when that failed to produce real results he suggested injections in my shoulder .
0	do n't even think about using them for any work related injury .
0	not worth a single star !
0	not the greatest service here .
0	the meat and seafood departments rock but the others , not so much .
0	i have so many of those stories where people just do n't care .
0	the one on the strip is superb .
0	they have their a game going , too many tourists not to .
0	there is a wonderful lady at check out counter in henderson .
0	i 'm going to get her name .
0	she 's happier than a pig in mud every time i go to her .
0	she makes my trip to whole foods worth it .
0	always smiling and happy to have a job .
0	dr. sabouri is a great dr. and person .
0	i gave been a patient for glaucoma treatment .
0	i cancelled my appointment for july , manager refuses to return my phone calls .
0	dr. wellish , your reputation going down for $ 15 .
0	do n't buy a groupon from this place !
0	my group of friends & i got screwed !
0	we were under the impression that there were several employees who could provide service .
0	first of all : `` vom fass '' ? !
0	what did you just say ?
0	and i 'm 30 years old .
0	fortunately , i heard about this place through word of mouth .
0	to me , this felt like a pretty disingenuous business strategy .
0	just do your homework before you buy !
0	i didnt see one white person in sight .
0	the produce looked ok ... . i would buy that if it was on sale..
0	stay away from this pharmacy .
0	i would give it zero stars if i could .
0	the medication came and the capsule is over 1 cm long .
0	i asked for a small courtesy discount , they refused .
0	wished i could give no stars .
0	1. clothes on during massage .
0	2. mandatory tipping 3. no one speaks english ! ! !
0	4. not licensed masseuse 5. unprofessional beware ... do not waste your money .
0	my friends and i will never revisit this place again .
0	i cant tell you how awful this was .
0	i was `` seen '' yesterday .
0	1 ) i cant rate a doctor i did not see !
0	recently moved to a new town , new vet .
0	called roadrunner to change contact information , shipping address and credit card information .
0	vet then called in our order .
0	dog just had a checkup .
0	vet called in order already .
0	taking our business elsewhere .
0	would make ordering so much easier for everyone .
0	save your money and go elsewhere !
0	my lashes coming into this place looked so much better .
0	i did n't understand .
0	she claimed it was because she did a classic set on me .
0	regardless , i usually always get classics done and they never looked like this .
0	they were so short and spaced out .
0	3 days later everyone ... smh..
0	came in at 6 pm and was seen at 12 am .
0	does n't make any sense .
0	once i had to tell him what i think he should be prescribing me .
0	i do not trust this facility with my healthcare at all .
0	this place is a joke .
0	my advice is to run , find another doctor .
0	anything is better than this .
0	the front office staff was very professional .
0	the reason i see a professional is to get there professional opinion .
0	i 've never been charged extra to receive this information .
0	she then proceeded to touch the protective plastic that went into my mouth .
0	somehow things got worse .
0	no cash out , i asked what happened .
0	they said the bank system was down all day .
0	i find it odd that they were n't telling people that from the beginning .
0	especially since it had been happening all day .
0	i heard talecris was better and had better new donor fees as well .
0	fyi watch the pharmacy techs max and brenda .
0	she does not communicate well at the drive thru window .
0	she has messed up our prescriptions in the past .
0	god forbid you call her out on the phone she yells and becomes argumentative .
0	brenda is mostly there during the day avoid her .
0	will not ever go back there .
0	we are now in may and still do n't have my glasses .
0	i have been dealing with headaches and having to work straining my vision .
0	all because of the lack of responsibility and professionalism of this place .
0	i wish i would 've read the reviews prior to giving them a try .
0	waiting a month and half for it is unacceptable .
0	i asked for a refund but was told that all sales are final .
0	do n't waste your money , time or energy here
0	i have been a patient of dr. sparks for over 10years .
0	i have been on physical disability for 22 + years .
0	2017 was the first year i asked for a pain med ever !
0	so i went to the pain doctor .
0	after she parted ways with ( humana ? )
0	she changed her practice .
0	she became holistic , and blames all sicknesses of any kind on gluten intolerance .
0	she pushes homeopathic medication that she sells her self .
0	updated-after i saw the doctor ?
0	they ended up finally taking me to the back to see the doctor .
0	and i waited another 35 minutes and still no doctor .
0	i ended up walking out as i stated before i had work .
0	these ppl are a joke !
0	u might catch their laziness , incompetence and stupidity .
0	sucks does n't it ?
0	so what happens now ?
0	did they warn me ?
0	it took me over 30 minutes to fill out the paperwork .
0	yeah she was extremely helpful ... .can u read my sarcasm ? ? ?
0	so yes i 've been waiting over 40 minutes now to see the doctor .
0	am i going to be late to work ... .no why ?
0	i 'm not waiting past another 30 minutes to see the doctor .
0	cuz that is over an hour that once waited for the doctor .
0	and i think that is enough .
0	they should have warned me to come in earlier to fill out the paperwork .
0	they should have done a lot of things differently .
0	but i would not be holding my breath .
0	we did a walk in .
0	been here several times before with ok service .
0	it 's been 3 hours now and still 2 people ahead of us .
0	i had a horrible experience with dr gross .
0	i would never recommend him and i hope others stay away .
0	this place is a joke .
0	i remember when it opened and they were so accommodating .
0	i used to live around here but now i dont live close .
0	so i do n't go often .
0	i walked in today and was on the phone .
0	coco said `` it 's okay there 's no one here '' .
0	she asked how long did i want .
0	then before i could answer she said do you have an appointment ?
0	i told her no .
0	i am so pissed .
0	what kind of company turns away customers .
0	worst customer service ever .
0	to make matters worse , the next morning one of her brackets fell off .
0	was n't that the point of the mold during the first visit ?
0	at this point , i am so confused .
0	why would we expect her wire to fall out again ?
0	and why is it my job to fix it ?
0	her orthodontist takes an hour and a half to even enter the room .
0	i have so many concerns and questions at this point .
0	why isnt the orthodontist more involved with her patients ?
0	why are dental assistants doing all of the work ?
0	there is absolutely no communication at all .
0	it has been a complete nightmare ! !
0	i was expecting so much more .
0	i 've just decided to contact the better business bureau .
0	i would not go back here and would not recommend this dentist !
0	the patient portal is very useful .
0	$ 50 is excessive ... but there is value in it if used correctly .
0	my complaint is the communication or lack thereof .
0	i 've seen dr. goldman and my wife has seen dr. archabeck .
0	the doctors are great ... their staff is not .
0	also ... here 's a negative to the portal .
0	we received a call from the office to call back asap .
0	every time i go for a cleaning have a new cavity !
0	( you 're right because i wo n't be back ! )
0	after going to another dentist he didnt find any cavities !
0	so what was the dr going to fill if there were no cavities !
0	will not be back !
0	i ordered a vanilla smoothie with almond milk and vegan protein .
0	umm , excuse me , did i ask for sugar free ?
0	they should have told me it was sugar free before selling it to me .
0	they laughed at me .
0	i am so disappointed in their lack of customer service .
0	i ended up throwing the second drink away - awful taste .
0	i 'd probably get better nutrition eating bark off of the tree outside .
0	you could n't pay me enough money to ever come back to this place .
0	if i could give no stars i would .
0	a lot of `` i do n't knows '' .
0	front staff very very rude , unorganized and unprofessional .
0	i was very surprised because sante spa in mission is the exact opposite !
0	this medical facility is an utter disasterous joke .
0	then today it was reported to me by my pharmacist that my d.o.b .
0	was incorrect on their records received from wfp .
0	my family has been going to this practice for more than 10 years .
0	depression ca n't wait .
0	this practice has become machine .
0	get in line and wait to get processed thru .
0	does the doctor get a kickback ?
0	i had already informed him of my current brand which is fantastic .
0	eye doctor tried to push back on this brand he suggested a second time .
0	i said i would try , once i put them on they sucked .
0	the lenses i have are silicone hydrogel .
0	finally he said they would order them .
0	he changed the damn script on me .
0	so we had to look through the lenses again .
0	i think they got a trial box .
0	i only came here because my eye insurance changed .
0	never again , i 'm going back to central phoenix eye care .
0	i 'm changing employers and insurance anyway , might as well lump this in .
0	i wo n't be back .
0	this review is for our experience 9/2015 .
0	no problems setting an appointment or being seen in a timely fashion .
0	i decided to just go somewhere else to fill the cavity .
0	and now my wife has to wait again ! ! ?
0	and walmart is faster and they give you a courtesy call .
0	last time i will be here .
0	i do not recommend this place .
0	if there was a no star button i would 've gave it no star .
0	waste of my damn time .
0	and i paid in full right away .
0	now the worst part for me is trying to get a refund from him !
0	`` , just because i said that i felt i should do a review !
0	what a terrible dr ! !
0	we brought our toddler in with thrush .
0	the website is substandard by 1992 standards .
0	there are forms for download , but they are the wrong forms !
0	my wife and i were going to be seen here because we live close .
0	she said , `` probably not '' .
0	i told her that my wife wanted to be evaluated for braces .
0	we would have had to re-register with a whole new dentist .
0	the ledgers are completely in medical coding , mind you .
0	not to mention that she asked extremely personal questions to everybody that walked in .
0	`` are you married ? ''
0	`` what happened to your girlfreind ? ''
0	`` what do you do for a living '' etc .
0	this dentist office is bad .
0	so , so bad .
0	edit : this review was meant for the office on desert inn road .
0	worst bowling alley i 've ever been to .
0	the lane was extremely greasy , way to much .
0	the bowling balls were covered and grip of the ball was limited .
0	it was about 90 degrees inside .
0	i hit the help button after our lane froze up and nobody came .
0	( it was us ) .
0	bad experience all around .
0	bought the groupon for $ 15.00 .
0	wo n't be going back .
0	however , this surprisingly was n't what made me find another dentist .
0	worst dr office i have ever been to !
0	if i could give less than one star i would !
0	now i 'm told there are two people ahead of me !
0	the same thing happened when they did my colonoscopy .
0	they did n't even start the procedure until 4 ; 15 !
0	this appears to be a pattern now !
0	my time is valuable as well ! ! !
0	if you have a choice use someone else who perhaps respects their patients !
0	do n't do it folks , it is noting but one huge headache .
0	ps amanda - i am not wasting my time reaching out .
0	please feel free to have someone from your office contact me .
0	brooke d. can let you know how to reach me .
0	your life is worth way more then a bill .
0	they checked me out , said i had a uti and sent me home .
0	again i went back to mountain view .
0	where upon telling them my symptoms they told me i was deyhrated .
0	i had just told the nurse i was unable to keep anything down .
0	it was even hot to the touch .
0	but no one touched me .
0	that day i researched my symptoms online .
0	i concluded i had appendicitis .
0	but twice i was told by medical staff that this was normal .
0	but i knew in my heart that it wasnt .
0	so that night i made the decision to go to another hospital .
0	i was rushed into emergency surgery .
0	i had a c-section and my appendicitis removed .
0	after mine and my child 's recovery we went back to mountain view .
0	you decide for yourself .
0	does n't even deserve one star .
0	my sister had genetic testing and found out she had lynch syndrome .
0	wait until i get a chance to speak with them face to face .
0	my guess is we are not the first family to experience this .
0	the most rudest staff and filthiest facility i have ever laid eyes on .
0	not to mention they gossip and laugh about patients diagnosis .
0	i really like tom willim which is why i give 2 stars .
0	the office however is like dealing with a bureaucracy .
0	no one is treated as an individual just another number coming in the door .
0	they do not listen .
0	i am so disappointed - really disappointed .
0	now i may have to search elsewhere .
0	really - they need to be reminded that their field includes compassion and caring .
0	do not go here ! ! ! !
0	i think their reviews are by their employees .
0	and said , 'no , i looked longer than i normally would ' .
0	i asked for a refund and left .
0	i am reporting him to the medical board .
0	its a terriable allergic reaction , not scabies .
0	i ca n't believe this man is licensed to practice medicine .
0	only one star because i had to , but o say zero
0	now i 'm super annoyed .
0	one of my prescriptions was called in for the wrong dosage .
0	i kept checking with the pharmacy .
0	called both yesterday and twice today .
0	it has not been corrected , nor have i received a call back .
0	i never was able to speak with anyone or make an appointment .
0	after reading the other reviews here , i think i will choose another pcp .
0	was referred here by my orthopedic surgeon .
0	suppose to have an appointment with kayla .
0	kristin willis of planet beach is the reason i 'm writing this negative review .
0	she refused and said i can help you im the manager .
0	i left and will never return .
0	the staff that works the front desk are always super welcoming and friendly .
0	with that being said , the pharmacy is a totally different ball game .
0	i went in the other day , needing something from behind that counter .
0	ugh , are you kidding ?
0	never going to this specific pharmacy again .
0	i had very high out of pocket costs .
0	i do not recommend going to this clinic .
0	if you are in a hurry , forget about it at this place .
0	that is all i can say .
0	this is a long review so stay with me !
0	i began to see dr. deka for my first pregnancy in october .
0	before i had even met the doctor that would be delivering my baby .
0	fine , i thought .
0	this was my appointment with the np .
0	the next app was with dr. deka herself .
0	she seemed nice , knowledgeable and genuine .
0	ok , i thought , doc knows best right ? ) .
0	all we covered was that i want a natural birth .
0	she did not seem interested in anything else i had to say .
0	day of the delivery : i went into labor at 39 weeks .
0	my contractions were getting stronger and coming faster .
0	the nurse was pissed .
0	dr. deka was pissed .
0	i did n't care .
0	my labor was progressing normally and naturally .
0	she even called it a `` textbook '' delivery .
0	sounds like some money making tricks to me .
0	the front office is the best part of the entire practice in my opinion .
0	they answer your questions , are pleasant and remembered me every time .
0	it 's the only reason i 'm leaving a two star review .
0	and no one did .
0	either way , really terrible customer service and phone skills .
0	we will never return .
0	was told this place was amazing and i will never return or recommend .
0	made me wait two hours and were nothing but rude the entire time .
0	almost walked out several times .
0	visited twice and they got nothing done both times .
0	would n't wish this place on my worst enemies .
0	beware : unprofessional and in it for the money .
0	she never asked when i spoke to her on the phone .
0	her attitude about it was very accusatory and rude .
0	why would i pay out of pocket ?
0	they were n't needed and my insurance only covers one every 3 years .
0	i wasted time there and was not able to get a cleaning .
0	simply because she wanted money to do an x-ray .
0	i 'm glad i figured this out before having them get near my mouth .
0	now i get a message they have reinstated blue cross ?
0	what 's up , warner practice !
0	this was my first time visiting a psychiatrist .
0	i came in seeking help for anxiety and depression .
0	then she asked which one i think i have ?
0	and the treatment plan ?
0	`` there are mood stabilizers and anti-depressants .
0	here 's what each one does .
0	which do you think you want or need ? ''
0	nut shell fragments in my salad almost caused serious dental problems .
0	we are not talking about large , obvious pistachio shells .
0	would not come here again .
0	i ca n't inspect every single bite before i eat it .
0	eating is a major hassle if i have to do that .
0	do n't go with the older guy with glasses .
0	he kept falling asleep during my one hour foot massage .
0	bought a vegan cake for my sons birthday .
0	asked if they could write happy birthday on it .
0	woman tells me ca n't i 'm not a cake decorator .
0	this store gives zero shits about the customer experience .
0	they are sending me away and really acting like i am bothering them here !
0	btw there is nobody else here , not like they 're busy or anything .
0	just wanted some help and this urgent care failed 100 % .
0	i have n't had a great experience here .
0	i didnt even get a crappy prescription for my pain .
0	so waiting for the weeklong process was uneccesary .
0	i honestly feel neglected because i 'm generally 'young ' and 'healthy ' .
0	otherwise it would be $ 50 .
0	my dental hygienist also put barely any effort at all into cleaning my teeth .
0	i do n't know if it 's because it was around lunch or what .
0	one of the most horrible receptionist i have encountered .
0	her name is tram .
0	awful , unproffesional , rude , impolite .
0	taking my business somewhere else because of her !
0	all they care about is your money .
0	do n't waste your time and money .
0	they do n't try to help you .
0	they 're the worst .
0	we went to elixir with high hopes given their menu and approach to food .
0	we arrived and were one of two groups in the entire restaurant .
0	when the food came it was pretty good .
0	the only guests in her new restaurant and could n't come out .
0	i ca n't even begin to wrap my head around that kind of mentality .
0	then to not come out and introduce herself under these circumstances - just mindblowing .
0	to have a brand new restaurant opening and not want to come out and greet
0	we planned a girls day for a friend 's birthday .
0	they were fairly unapologetic about it .
0	they need to get it together .
0	their services are way too expensive to have to deal with all the drama .
0	save your money and your time , go somewhere else .
0	during this time , some movement in his lower teeth occurred .
0	he also stated this was all because my son was not wearing the retainer .
0	i went to this provider about 3 years ago .
0	i had my teeth cleaned 5 times within 8 months .
0	the other dentist i went to was awesome .
0	i told the dentist that the first cleaning was fine .
0	then she would charge my insurance as a teeth cleaning .
0	so she said i needed 3 deep cleanings .
0	that would be 9 visits .
0	my insurance would only cover 2 cleanings .
0	so after the second cleaning , which was the other side of my mouth .
0	i had to pay full price which was around 150.00 dollars or more .
0	i still have all the receipts of all the over payments !
0	i was referred onto dr. yasmin ismail-juma .
0	on a separate instance , she messed up the routine filling job .
0	then to fix her error , she offered to perform a free root canal .
0	beware : i feel demeaned , can not trust yasmin ismail-juma .
0	shame on the dental practice !
0	i was visiting las vegas and desperately needed a mani-pedi and a bikini wax .
0	based on reviews , today nails looked like a good prospect .
0	really ? ? ! !
0	extra fee to take off gel polish .
0	extra cost to cut down nails .
0	extra fee to do ombré gel on nails .
0	then made them wait 40 minutes or more .
0	an expensive lesson learned !
0	i do n't know but seems fishy , wo n't be back .
0	then they want to prescribe medication that alter your state of mind .
0	culinary uses them as a main provider .
0	it 's a cash cow for harmony .
0	avoid them do your research .
0	do yourself a favor .
0	today was the last straw !
0	the markings created were not wiped off/removed .
0	overall i would not recommend going here for anything .
0	my wife went for a cleaning .
0	they said she needed a deep cleaning and would not do a regular cleaning .
0	we paid $ 95 for a smile save plan .
0	i 've asked for a refund and disputed the charge .
0	i feel like they were trying to rip us off with the deep cleaning .
0	i 'll be upfront ... i really do n't like no frills .
0	but sometimes the price is too good to pass up .
0	ataulfo mango for 30 cents each ? ?
0	then i remember that i do n't like no frills .
0	dr. sakias it 's very unprofessional and very cocky .
0	his staff was rude they left me in the room with no explanation .
0	also i supposed to have a prescription nobody ever called it in .
0	a doctor that ca n't read an mri disk .
1	dr. j. phillipp is a great dentist , very friendly and professional .
1	i highly recommend this office for the nice synergy the whole office has !
1	together with their agape team are caring , professional , thorough and knowledgeable .
1	each visit is carefully tailored to your current state of being and needs .
1	the doctors have always been super nice .
1	my daughter had stitches done , and she was a nervous wreck .
1	it was very nice .
1	we have had a wonderful experience with dr. beals treating our son .
1	i love this place !
1	this store carries products that i ca n't find anywhere else besides online .
1	organized , clean , and a huge selection .
1	best service i 've been in las vegas !
1	everyone are so nice !
1	and all the design are perfect
1	i so disagree with a couple of the reviews i read .
1	she is very detailed and shows concern regarding all aspects of my health .
1	i have referred several people to her .
1	only one word - fantastic !
1	his staff is excellent , and his art in dentistry and patient care unsurpassed .
1	cut and dried - dr. goth was outstanding .
1	he is the man to see in the pittsburgh area .
1	anthony `` tony '' walker and jennifer hannon are a great team .
1	they really know their stuff .
1	beyond knowing their stuff is their continual dialogue with patients .
1	then we would get into planning for that day and going forward .
1	i was involved in the therapy .
1	and we continued in this joint planning over a month of treatments .
1	good resource for most all of us .
1	she is a great technician to boot !
1	i needed a quick appointment and did n't want to wait several weeks .
1	i took a gamble and picked first available , which was dr. chuang .
1	i could n't have disagreed more on the negative reviews .
1	both valley ent and dr. chuang were professional , courteous , thorough and friendly .
1	i will enthusiastically recommend both to anyone looking for quality healthcare .
1	i strongly endorse them .
1	yes , this is as good as it gets !
1	the whole staff is very professional , kind and accommodating .
1	not to mention happy !
1	the hygienists are just the best , as are all the staff .
1	i highly recommend this whole office to anyone needing work done !
1	you will not be disappointed .
1	honestly she did n't even go over it all the way with the laser .
1	there 's quite a bit of the tattoo that 's untouched .
1	i 'll be going somewhere else for the remainder .
1	dr. bang is by far the best chiropractor i 've ever been to .
1	we actually did n't start adjusting joints until my 4th visit !
1	my experience with dr. malek has been nothing short of fantastic .
1	dr. malek was kind while retaining a very professional demeanor .
1	everything was very upfront .
1	there were zero hidden charges or unexpected costs .
1	the results are incrdible .
1	today my friend and i came in for a body massage .
1	let me tell you !
1	very relaxing and clean .
1	i did n't get my misuses name but she did a fantastic job .
1	i am so happy my friend and i chose this place .
1	i highly recommend this chandler crossroads me .
1	it 's clean and inviting .
1	the front staff are very helpful , polite and always have a smile on .
1	rooms are clean and welcoming .
1	there are plenty of therapists each with their own strengths and all very competent .
1	i always look forward to my next visit .
1	check this place out .
1	you 'll leave relaxed and well taken care of .
1	all of the dentists and staff are so professional and kind .
1	we absolutely recommend this to all of our family and friends .
1	he is the nicest , most caring sweet attentive doctor i 've ever seen !
1	i do n't know what i would do without him !
1	michael tucker is the best !
1	yes it might just be rice and steamed greens but their sauces enhance everything .
1	when i come for healthy vegan food , that 's all i really want .
1	i just wish there was somewhere like this in calgary .
1	woke up earlier this week with a crazy case of torticollis .
1	went to the joint on wednesday , thursday , and friday ( today ) .
1	quick , easy adjustments and i 'm back to *almost* 100 % .
1	today , i mentioned offhand that i 've had tmj for 3 weeks .

1	they are down to earth and reasonable in their prices .

1	my only disappointment was my purchase on a whisker for the matcha tea .
1	it was $ 20 and it did not work .
1	hence why it was n't working the way it was supposed to .
1	we thought about returning it - but change our mind on our way there .
1	we will order another one via amazon , no biggie .
1	i learned so much with just one trip .
1	the shoes are pricey but it 's totally worth it for the comfort !
1	plus they are n't cheap made in china shoes so the quality is excellent .
1	i only used the travel clinic here and could not be happier !
1	they had flexible hours that worked with my schedule ( open weekends !
1	can you believe that ? ! )

1	he is located in the tall building on the children 's sunrise hospital property .
1	i have had nothing but terrific experiences here .

1	those get kinda claustrophobic feeling for me .
1	each room also has beautiful wall art .
1	that 's usually what i spend my time doing while waiting .

1	the quinoa onion rings are delicious - order it with chipotle mayo .

1	my siberian husky was diagnosed with valley fever and prescribed fluconazole .
1	( sometimes a toy , sometimes treats . )

1	then i got the price for a month supply of fluconazole .
1	same pills , same dosage , triple the price ! !
1	we took our dog to the animal hospital as a last resort .
1	every vet who saw her x-rays said we needed to do surgery immediately .

1	i have nerve pain in my feet and the sea salt massage is wonderful .
1	i go there now after every work out .
1	the food here is really great !
1	i had the falafel tacos and quinoa onion rings .
1	the tacos are super messy .
1	they also have really good hot sauce .
1	once i got my food though , the service was pretty nonexistent .
1	this place also gets pretty packed .
1	they do have a patio to sit outside as well .
1	i 'll be back , and hopefully service will be better next time .
1	probably one of the most unique spa experiences i 've had .
1	i had the one hour reflexology ( whole body ) plus shampoo .

1	they first go over your problems so they can focus on a specific area .
1	i have referred several people to the joint .
1	i had a broken wisdom tooth with a cavity .
1	i was in and out in less than an hour .
1	everyone was friendly and professional .

1	he walked us through everything and talked to us throughout the procedure .
1	always helpful , knowledgeable , kind , and gentle .
1	it took a day to get a call back to schedule .
1	we waited a little while in the office too .
1	that 's worth waiting for .
1	overall , they work like a well-oiled machine .
1	we got to meet the whole team , including their on-site lab techs .
1	every single person met us with a smile and kind words .
1	i can not thank dr. athari enough for creating an environment like this .
1	that 's a major difference worth noting .

1	anyway , again , sending a huge thank-you to dr. athari and his staff .
1	you guys are beyond awesome .
1	the staff at spectrum dermatology is wonderful , everyone is so kind and helpful .

1	the tea that they had tasted artificially sweetened .
1	i was horrified , as i stay far away from unhealthy preservatives .
1	i stuck with water .

1	dr. cherrington recommended a crown for me based on an x-ray he took .
1	i believe there is a high level of integrity here .
1	the place is soooooo nice .
1	the decor , the ambiance , the space itself make you relax .
1	i 've got the indonesian package : facial , body scrub and massage .
1	i ca n't say i got the best massage ever but it was good .
1	the scrub was very interesting .
1	they offered me a snack and a tea after all .
1	i lounged in the beautiful rest area .
1	every body who works there is so nice and attentive .
1	i would definitely go back to that spa .
1	dr. aseem and his staff are wonderful .
1	lynda may be the nicest person i have ever meet .
1	i highly recommend bella smiles .
1	the front cashier greeted me when i entered and when i left .
1	amy the fnp was great !
1	had my first appointment today as a new patient .
1	everyone in the office was welcoming , friendly , and professional .
1	i bought the groupon , and got an appointment right away .
1	they start out with a 20 minute foot soak and then a massage .
1	i liked that the masseuse did not try to engage me in small talk .
1	i will definitely go back .
1	i always tip at least $ 20 for a massage anyways .
1	i know that all massage therapists have to pay taxes on their tips .
1	i am a tipped employee so i get that .
1	i think with the groupon , that made the total around $ 60 .
1	a good price for a massage anywhere in this town .
1	i am also a real person .
1	: ) and proud of it .
1	and a glass of champagne each .
1	dr. donna was super awesome as was deirdre at the front desk .
1	awesome people , plenty of equipment , and good energy !
1	lots of class options as well as open gym time .
1	dr. martin is wonderful !
1	her medical assistant and the nurse practitioner at this office are also fantastic .
1	i have had horrible experiences with cvs-just the pharmacy , not the store itself .
1	rude pharmacist and techs .
1	that are just flat out mean !
1	if all cvs pharmacy staff were like her i probably never would have left !
1	making your company and store look amazing !
1	the latter is true of dr. douglas ' staff .
1	thorough is the first word that comes to mind !
1	one time i did have to wait for a bit in the exam room .

1	anita is the first person you will meet .
1	she 's just wonderful .
1	she 's sweet and knowledgeable .
1	from there the service continues , from quick xrays , down to the cleaning .
1	dr. nestlerode does the cleaning himself !
1	you get personal service here .
1	how many dentists do their own cleanings these days ?
1	he also does the cleanings by hand .
1	no ultrasonic machines , which makes most people wince .
1	hand scaling is more acurate .
1	all with a no-pressure approach .
1	with my busy schedule , this is a great service for me .
1	once you see dr. nestlerode you will wonder why you ever went anywhere else .
1	i 'll have to ask about that next time .
1	they strive for comfort , affordability and creating a beautiful smile in everyone .
1	i certainly believe that !

1	she was very cautious about my sensitive teeth but also very thorough .
1	pity , i wish they still had this around .
1	the thing i usually get when i come here are the bowls .
1	most of the time i get the macro greens .
1	i 've had other bowls , but i kinda like this one the best .
1	another thing is that they have daily soups that they keep changing up .
1	fresh is one of those places that 's good for everyone .
1	i 've been with dr. vicuna for over a couple of years now .
1	she 's definitely knowledgeable and friendly .
1	i received a massage from james today and it was fantastic .
1	he is a very talented therapist and will definitely be returning !
1	so i stopped going .
1	i decided to hunt down a new location and grouponed for brazilian waxes .
1	i lucked out w skin of dreams and had sandra as my waxer .

1	it can be a bit nerve wracking to say the least .
1	doctor racanelli makes it so easy to get dental work done .
1	when you find a good dentist , you know .
1	and you follow him ! ! !
1	my results have been impeccable .
1	this man and his incredible staff have literally brought my dreams to life !
1	i could n't be more ecstatic !

1	i felt prepared and confident i was under the best care possible .
1	the hours in the dental chair flew by !

1	2 hours later the wife feels great and rejuvenated .
1	i had a great visit with dr. cheree and her assistant dina this week .

1	the staff is great with the kids , friendly , and generally pretty quick .
1	my children never complain about going to the dentist .
1	fabulous doctor , fabulous staff .
1	incredibly knowledgeable , and amazing bedside manner .
1	he also performed my hysterectomy .
1	he obviously has an incredible reputation in the medical field .
1	dr raia was so great and so was the staff at their surgery facility .
1	it was quick and comfortable , with an onsite cafeteria .
1	the doctor explained everything .
1	overall i will be back for another .
1	i cant wait to see my baby !
1	i know dr. leah wingeart as a colleague .
1	i would definitely recommend her as another professional in the mental health field .
1	i have n't met a friendlier staff .
1	everyone i talked to was kind and made my experience great !
1	i 'm so excited i found i dentist i want to go back to .
1	i had a good experience here the other day .
1	i was assisted by darion .
1	he was kind , patient , and professional .
1	he helped to get the lens replaced in my eyeglasses and sunglasses .
1	all of the employees i encountered were very nice .
1	there were only 2 employees available to adjust the eyeglasses that were ready .
1	dr. pozun is great , one of the better doctors i 've had .
1	the only reason i give them four stars instead of five is the staff .
1	others do n't return phone calls promptly .
1	i want some ! )
1	but the other front desk staff are generally unfriendly if not rude .
1	as i wrote earlier , very much recommended .
1	dr bigler and his staff have been wonderful .
1	i 've been a patient for 2 years and have excellent service .
1	i would highly recommend this doctor to anyone
1	i received a recommendation to southview from a coworker and so glad i listened .
1	if that is the case , check out southview !
1	barely visited this store in the last couple of years .
1	have within the last year rediscovered the store , as prices seem more reasonable .
1	some items are actually the same or cheaper than longos and loblaws .
1	i was super shocked .
1	what sets it apart is the service .
1	there is almost always someone i 'm there you help you .
1	they will ask you if you need help as well !
1	rare for a chain grocery store !
1	this one time , there was n't a sample i could try .
1	i asked and the associate there quickly opened a bottle for me to try !
1	that 's customer service .
1	items are in stock even on weekends and weekend evenings .
1	check out never takes too long either .
1	they always open up new lanes and the cashiers are so friend .
1	they go above and beyond to tell you info or talk to you !

1	however they did notice a fluid build up in her abdomen .
1	my husband was satisfied with the service he received during that visit .
1	she was very thorough and advised is daily about her condition .
1	i completely understand their reasoning .
1	pvsec is a fantastic state of the art facility with wonderful providers .
1	it 's worth every cent .
1	i recently moved here and have kaiser .
1	that being said there are no kaisers in nevada .
1	luckily healthcare partners of nevadas urgent care on wynn accept kaiser .
1	besides that great fact , they are fantastic there .
1	they also have great prices for the medications they prescribe .
1	since i do have unacceptable insurance at most places this is great news .
1	i would really recommend anyone go here .
1	i absolutely adore all staff here .
1	either dentist is a great choice .
1	my biggest fear is being judged for how bad my teeth are .
1	i dont like going to the dentist .
1	so i usually dont .
1	i have a habit of waiting until im in excruciating pain before caving in .
1	after one visit to this place , you wont ever go anywhere else .
1	i literally drive all the way across town .

1	i was there when a patient threw a clipboard at their front desk person .
1	and she was pregnant .
1	the pas are all wonderful as well as the physicians .
1	it 's a busy practice .
1	they spend a lot of time with you compared to other places .

1	i could n't climb a flight of stairs without being out of breath .
1	i had joined 24 hour and quickly became disappointed with the trainers .
1	july 12 , i will be competing in my second mens masters physique competition .
1	stephen , seth , aaron , steven q. , jayson are the absolute best .
1	i have met a lot of wonderful people there .
1	everyone has a story to tell .

1	helpful employees and fun place to visit .
1	if you have n't heard- you get all the samples of oil/vinegar/wine/liquor you want .
1	in fact , they are encouraged .
1	some of the stuff is pretty reasonable .
1	for example , the calamondin vinegar is amazing .
1	it has like a citris/lime flavor and is like nothing i have ever tasted .
1	also , give the pumpkin seed oil a try .
1	way funner than the `` oil and vinegar '' stores in the mall .
1	soon they will add liqueurs to their portfolio , which should be very exciting .
1	also , small selection of wine there .
1	tip : bring your own containers ( can you ? )
1	because those add up .
1	and , ask the staff for pairings .
1	for example : mango vinegar and chili oil .
1	i had my implants done at layman shirman and associates .
1	always a pleasure to work with dr. shirman and their staff .

1	when i left i actually could n't wait to return for the other visits !

1	the visit to get my braces applies also went well .
1	i am glad i chose this establishment to go on with my braces journey !
1	this place is hugh !
1	staff is friendly , doctors are great , very patient and caring .
1	how i found andrea is quite the story in itself .
1	i was willing to settle for anything - it was an emergency ! ! !
1	from the minute you meet andrea you feel like you 're right at home .
1	she 's super warm and makes you feel very comfortable .
1	i started out with just my brow waxing then moved onto her fab facials .
1	andrea is honestly the best !
1	two weeks later the doctors performed a mid calf amputation .
1	after a difficult two months , she was ready for her first prosthetic .
1	pro care was a few blocks from our home .
1	first visit she carried her leg in a bag .
1	not a good start .
1	therapists do n't accept excuses .
1	pretty soon he was pulling the walker to make her keep up .
1	each visit the therapist introduced new exercises to get ready for the next steps .
1	now , he follows critiquing each step .
1	steps and curbs are a particularly terrifying obstacle .
1	going to be walking from now on .
1	success and end of professional therapy is walking with a cane .
1	looks like that is a week away at this rate of improvement .
1	it 's been a physically exhausting , a little painful but mostly terrifying journey .
1	miracles take work sometimes .
1	the therapist and staff at pro care work miracles daily .
1	it 's been an amazing transformation with a motivated patient and expert care .
1	customer service is the best .
1	he never rushes and is very knowledgeable .
1	my daughter feels comfortable and he makes her smile .
1	the office is always clean and the staff is always polite .
1	literally stop here daily !
1	always so friendly and helping me get exactly what i want .
1	friendly and knowledgeable staff .
1	my 7 yr old felt very comfortable as a patient there .
1	i really love this store !
1	this pet store really cares about customer service to the fullest .
1	i think that is awesome !
1	this could be by far the best place to get a massage at .
1	i paid $ 80 for a deep tissue massage in may this year .
1	i cant rememebr my therapists name , but she was amazing .
1	her hands were perfect .
1	got to spend my birthday here .
1	what an amazing day !

1	just got my first section done today .
1	really happy about the result so far .
1	really clean place and friendly staff .

1	i started seeing her during my pregnancy .
1	everyone i 've ever sent to her absolutely loves her and feels immediate relief .
1	she is an artist and master of her trade .
1	i am so grateful to have such an amazing practitioner for my family !
1	i wanted to give a shout out to the camp transformation center !
1	he wears many hats ... and he wears each one exceptionally well !
1	his office staff is pleasant , efficient and accommodating .
1	... and now , all is well .
1	... he saves lives .
1	and tip the ladies at least $ 10 .
1	they do an incredible job & for the price , they definitely deserve it .
1	they even use hot stones on your back .
1	it 's pretty great .
1	wow , where to begin ?
1	this woman is amazing !
1	i had back pain for 8 years .
1	personality aside , ashlee knows what she is doing !
1	by week 6 my pain was gone ! !
1	but that is how engraved the pain was in me and even my mannerisms .
1	now i carry him around all day and never feel a thing !
1	thank you pch for your help .
1	dr. foreman made the dentures fit very well in my mouth .
1	he was amazing ! ! !
1	he was professional , friendly and respectful to me .

1	the best ymca around ! ! !
1	they have two indoor swimming pools .
1	they also have a fabulous sauna both dry and wet .
1	they even have a jacuzzi for your enjoyment .
1	they have a few rows of showers and an exit directly to the pool .
1	one of greatest things that is cherished by many guests are the laundered towels .
1	you can enjoy as many as you like during your visit .
1	no problem - your in luck ! !
1	they have a store that practically has everything you could dream of wanting .

1	i 've had brookstone dental as my dentist for fifteen years .
1	i 've always hated going to the dentist , like most people .
1	i never wait more than five minutes to be seen .
1	dr goldring and his staff are very personable and fun to visit .
1	i highly recommend brookstone dental .
1	i have changed primary physicians 3 times in as many years .
1	not because of the doctors , but because of terribly incompetent staffs .
1	hilcrest dental really is as good as it gets !
1	extra kudos to dental hygienist sherlisa !

1	and i thought they were expensive 90 days ago !
1	i have received calls from the doctor 's office with updates of test results .
1	thank you dr. jigna patel .
1	fell in love and went again 2 days later .
1	the main takeaway though is the damn quinoa onion rings !

1	note that its $ 6 and they legit only give u like 5 rings .
1	whatever , well worth it !
1	the grilled veggie n pesto wrap is my fav .
1	like who does n't like pesto right ? !
1	i have tried it in the tortilla and on a bed of lettuce .
1	the side of kale slaw is nothing great .
1	the fries are also amazing here !
1	shocker - the regular ones are better than the sweet potato fries .
1	do not get the cornbread ever though , its dry and nasty .
1	the doctor talks with you and makes you feel comfortable during the adjustment .
1	had a wonderful foot and body massage .
1	very professional and price is within the top 10 spa 's in vegas .

1	i was very happy with my experience .
1	a whole new concept in the world of chiropractic care !
1	come on people , not everything is reheated with a microwave oven .
1	luckily for us , we got the joint .

1	she is that amazing .
1	i can not recommend her enough ! !
1	: ) : ) : )
1	absolutely love the girls st skin laundry .
1	everyone has commented on how amazing my skin looks !
1	i definitely recommend checking them out and trying it for yourself !
1	the elite family is friendly and willing to answer any questions .
1	honestly the most helpful and qualified gym staff i have encountered .
1	i am in training club which is offered at various times of the day .
1	stockton dermatology is the best dermatology office in the valley !

1	love the people there so i give them 5 stars
1	dr. beaty was very pleasant to deal with along with her front office staff .
1	along with the glare reducing coating .
1	she pushed and she pushed .
1	she made me uncomfortable and while i 'd visit the office again .
1	i would not allow her to assist me again .
1	i got a 1 hour massage from brian and he was very good .
1	i 'll absolutely come back again .
1	dr frankie is the best ! ! !
1	2. you want the best post-natal care in the state .
1	the office and exam rooms are beautifully maintained and feel warm .
1	the colors and fabrics are a far cry from the traditional doctor 's office .
1	the birth center is just absolutely beautiful and cozy .
1	that 's how you put a diaper on !
1	i had no idea about the stages of labor !
1	( yup , all of it was news to me . )
1	following my birth , babymoon inn continued to be supportive .
1	the help i received with lactation consultation was invaluable .
1	what you choose , when you choose babymoon , is community .
1	dental office as a whole from start to finish was great .
1	all staff was friendly and knowledgeable !
1	both my children 7 year old and 3 year old loved it .
1	dentist was great with both kids !
1	i 'm always on the hunt for healthy food places !
1	i ordered a greenhouse bowl ( ? )
1	she also gave me a free drink card !
1	tempeh flavour and texture were spot on .
1	nevertheless i felt very satiated ( not bloated ) .
1	our food arrived quickly and i was blown away by the cornbread/soup/salad combo .
1	the portion size was perfect .
1	my split pea soup was hearty and very umami-filled .
1	the cornbread ( with flax i believe ? )
1	was excellent and it tastes 10x better than its classic butter-laden cousin .
1	it is my new favourite casual restaurant .
1	i agree with a previous reviewer saying that it 's `` unpretentious '' .
1	dr. plorde ( spelling may be off ) was fantastic .
1	i would recommend this place to anybody wanting good quality dental work .
1	probably the best facial i have ever had .
1	i first went with my daughter and then went back for myself .
1	she takes the time to understand your skin and offers healthful suggestions .
1	the only drawback is that her location is in sort of a weird complex .
1	i have spent more time and money here than i care to admit .
1	i 've even come to prefer vegan cupcakes to their more fat saturated counterparts .
1	i miss this place when i go home to the states .
1	i wish they delivered .

1	i had the best cleaning and exam .
1	the hygienist was patient and gentle .
1	he provided pain free dental work and completed it fast .
1	everyone thinks i 'm weird because i actually enjoy going to the dentist .
1	it 's because i 've gone to dr. j. since i was 5 !
1	( i 'm 25 ! )
1	he is amazing and his staff is incredible too .
1	they are always so friendly and welcoming !

1	i lost one pair of hearing aids and they replaced them very quickly .
1	malisa at miricle ear in henderson nevada is outstanding .
1	i made my appointment online .
1	i went in to be seen for a sore throat and possible sinus infection .

1	one of the best dentists i have ever had , very thorough and gentle .
1	the staff including the front desk and dental hygienist are very friendly .
1	! ..recommend the deluxe with hot rocks !
1	i had sinus and deviated septum surgery completed by dr. weingarten .
1	finally i can stop looking for a new dentist !
1	it was off a regular price that was already $ 550 less ! ! !
1	it includes retainers and all your visits , no hidden fees .
1	i can not say enough about how excited i am to have found them !
1	i will be recommending them to all my family and friends .
1	you 'll see i 'm right !
1	today was my very first full treatment appointment with dr. wrye .
1	without question dr. wrye is tremendously skilled in many treatment methods .
1	i had a great experience from start to finish with ttw .
1	when we arrived , we were the only customers .
1	this store is n't just about retail , it 's an experience .
1	the hygienist was one of the nicest i 'd ever met .
1	the new patient exam was thorough and included a short medical history .
1	he did n't believe that gum recession was caused by aggressive brushing techniques .
1	if you go to this location , request her you will not regret it .
1	i left feeling completely pain free .
1	so ... add $ 27 to your gel manicure or pedicure .
1	they never answer the phones , which can be frustrating .
1	however : they are nice .
1	they know what they are doing .
1	dr. hofflander was referred by my gp .
1	he got me in fast for a consult and scheduled surgery conveniently as well .
1	i was very happy with the surgical center staff and dr. hofflander was great !
1	great produce , good selection of healthier brands of food and health products .
1	employees seem happy and willing to help .
1	got the head and reflexology combo and the ion detox .
1	i absolutely loved both services .
1	for two hours , i was pampered beyond belief .
1	i felt like i was in a state of bliss .
1	this beats those burke williams any day .
1	in and out in 20 minutes with no appointment .
1	friendly team , clean and comfortable waiting area .
1	we tried a few locations before finding this one .
1	i 'm sure with an appointment this location would be a breeze .
1	one issue is no one actually monitors the front desk .
1	i 've been visiting this dentist for almost 10 years .
1	i actually go from california to las vegas to get treated every year .
1	i ca n't trust anyone else with my teeth .
1	dr. alemi is very kind and i find him to be very trustworthy .
1	he is always honest and communicates and educates me a lot on my teeth .
1	his staff is also very present and kind and the clinic is always clean .
1	i trust him more than i could trust anyone else with my teeth !
1	he tries to be very flexible and accommodating !
1	i was skeptical at first , but i was willing to try it out .

1	he 's that good !
1	i 've been coming here for specialty prescriptions for the last 2 years .
1	they are always friendly and provides good customer service .
1	this is a truly excellent doctor but his office needs major help .

1	preparing myself for the horror of a dental appointment , as i recall them .
1	i did n't feel anything at all getting the shots .
1	ok. i 'm impressed but we 'll see how it goes .
1	so , i honestly felt like i was in the chair 15-30 mins .
1	i was confused at the end like `` we 're done ? ''
1	yeah , we were done .
1	spoiler alert : it went great .
1	i felt no pain .
1	i felt pressure , sure but trust me that is definitely not pain .
1	recovery : after the anesthetic wore off i was actually fine .
1	the tenderness is gone and the stitches are pulling themselves out a little .
1	`` are you sure it 's ok for me to swallow ? ''
1	`` what if i sneeze ? ''
1	they worked seamlessly with my insurance .
