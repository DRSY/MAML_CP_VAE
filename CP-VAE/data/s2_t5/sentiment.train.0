john baptized people with water , but in a few days you will be baptized with the holy spirit . ”
the apostles were all together . they asked jesus , “ lord , is this the time for you to give the people of israel their kingdom again ? ”
jesus said to them , “ the father is the only one who has the authority to decide dates and times . they are not for you to know .
they were staring into the sky where he had gone . suddenly two men wearing white clothes were standing beside them .
then the apostles went back to jerusalem from the mount of olives . this mountain is about a half mile from jerusalem .
after a few days there was a meeting of the believers . there were about 120 of them . peter stood up and said ,
peter said , “ in the book of psalms , this is written about judas :
they put two men before the group . one was joseph barsabbas . he was also called justus . the other man was matthias .
when the day of pentecost came , they were all together in one place .
suddenly a noise came from heaven . it sounded like a strong wind blowing . this noise filled the whole house where they were sitting .
they saw something that looked like flames of fire . the flames were separated and stood over each person there .
they were all filled with the holy spirit , and they began to speak different languages . the holy spirit was giving them the power to do this .
there were some godly jews in jerusalem at this time . they were from every country in the world .
a large crowd came together because they heard the noise . they were surprised because , as the apostles were speaking , everyone heard in their own language .
but we hear them in our own languages . how is this possible ? we are from all these different places :
parthia , media , elam , mesopotamia , judea , cappadocia , pontus , asia ,
phrygia , pamphylia , egypt , the areas of libya near the city of cyrene , rome ,
the people were all amazed and confused . they asked each other , “ what is happening ? ”
but others were laughing at the apostles , saying they were drunk from too much wine .
these men are not drunk as you think ; it ’ s only nine o ’ clock in the morning .
but joel the prophet wrote about what you see happening here today . this is what he wrote :
‘ god says : in the last days
in those days i will pour out my spirit
i will work wonders in the sky above .
the sun will be changed into darkness ,
and everyone who trusts in the lord will be saved . ’
jesus suffered the pain of death , but god made him free . he raised him from death . there was no way for death to hold him .
david said this about him :
so my heart is happy ,
because you will not leave me in the place of death .
you taught me how to live .
david knew this before it happened . that is why he said this about that future king :
so jesus is the one god raised from death . we are all witnesses of this . we saw him .
david was not the one who was lifted up to heaven . david himself said ,
until i put your enemies under your power . ’
when the people heard this , they felt very , very sorry . they asked peter and the other apostles , “ brothers , what should we do ? ”
peter warned them with many other words ; he begged them , “ save yourselves from the evil of the people who live now ! ”
then those who accepted what peter said were baptized . on that day about 3000 people were added to the group of believers .
the believers spent their time listening to the teaching of the apostles . they shared everything with each other . they ate together and prayed together .
many wonders and miraculous signs were happening through the apostles , and everyone felt great respect for god .
all the believers stayed together and shared everything .
they sold their land and the things they owned . then they divided the money and gave it to those who needed it .
that day he saw peter and john going into the temple area . he asked them for money .
peter and john looked at the crippled man and said , “ look at us ! ”
he looked at them ; he thought they would give him some money .
then peter took the man ’ s right hand and lifted him up . immediately his feet and legs became strong .
the man was holding on to peter and john . all the people were amazed . they ran to peter and john at solomon ’ s porch .
jesus was holy and good , but you said you did not want him . you told pilate to give you a murderer instead of jesus .
and so you killed the one who gives life ! but god raised him from death . we are witnesses of this—we saw it with our own eyes .
so you must change your hearts and lives . come back to god , and he will forgive your sins .
then the lord will give you times of spiritual rest . he will send you jesus , the one he chose to be the messiah .
and anyone who refuses to obey that prophet will die , separated from god ’ s people . ’
“ samuel , and all the other prophets who spoke for god after samuel , said that this time would come .
the jewish leaders arrested peter and john and put them in jail . it was already night , so they kept them in jail until the next day .
but many of the people who heard the apostles believed what they said . there were now about 5000 men in the group of believers .
the next day the jewish rulers , the older jewish leaders , and the teachers of the law met in jerusalem .
annas the high priest , caiaphas , john , and alexander were there . everyone from the high priest ’ s family was there .
then peter was filled with the holy spirit and said to them , “ rulers of the people and you older leaders ,
are you questioning us today about what we did to help this crippled man ? are you asking us what made him well ?
they saw the crippled man standing there beside the apostles . they saw that he was healed , so they could say nothing against the apostles .
the jewish leaders told them to leave the council meeting . then the leaders talked to each other about what they should do .
but we must make them afraid to talk to anyone again using that name . then this problem will not spread among the people . ”
so the jewish leaders called peter and john in again . they told the apostles not to say anything or to teach anything in the name of jesus .
but peter and john answered them , “ what do you think is right ? what would god want ? should we obey you or god ?
we can not be quiet . we must tell people about what we have seen and heard . ”
our ancestor david was your servant . with the help of the holy spirit he wrote these words :
‘ the kings of the earth prepare themselves to fight ,
these people who came together against jesus made your plan happen . it was done because of your power and your will .
with great power the apostles were making it known to everyone that the lord jesus was raised from death . and god blessed all the believers very much .
none of them could say they needed anything . everyone who owned fields or houses sold them . they brought the money they got
and gave it to the apostles . then everyone was given whatever they needed .
joseph sold a field he owned . he brought the money and gave it to the apostles .
there was a man named ananias . his wife ’ s name was sapphira . ananias sold some land he had ,
about three hours later his wife came in . sapphira did not know about what had happened to her husband .
peter said to her , “ tell me how much money you got for your field . was it this much ? ”
the whole church and all the other people who heard about this were filled with fear .
none of the other people dared to stand with the apostles , but everyone was saying wonderful things about them .
more and more people believed in the lord , and many men and women were added to the group of believers .
people came from all the towns around jerusalem . they brought those who were sick or troubled by evil spirits . all of them were healed .
the high priest and all his friends , a group called the sadducees , became very jealous .
they grabbed the apostles and put them in jail .
but during the night , an angel of the lord opened the doors of the jail . the angel led the apostles outside and said ,
“ go and stand in the temple area . tell the people everything about this new life . ”
when the apostles heard this , they did what they were told . they went into the temple area about sunrise and began to teach the people .
when the men went to the jail , they could not find the apostles there . so they went back and told the jewish leaders about this .
the captain of the temple guards and the leading priests heard this . they were confused and wondered what it all meant .
then another man came and told them , “ listen ! the men you put in jail are standing in the temple area teaching the people . ”
the soldiers brought the apostles in and made them stand before the council . the high priest questioned them .
peter and the other apostles answered , “ we must obey god , not you !
you killed jesus by nailing him to a cross . but god , the same god our fathers had , raised jesus up from death .
when the council members heard this , they became very angry . they began to plan a way to kill the apostles .
then he said to them , “ men of israel , be careful of what you are planning to do to these men .
and so now i tell you , stay away from these men . leave them alone . if their plan is something they thought up , it will fail .
but if it is from god , you will not be able to stop them . you might even be fighting against god himself ! ”
they called the apostles in again . they beat them and told them not to speak anymore using the name of jesus . then they let them go free .
the apostles left the council meeting . they were happy because they were given the honor of suffering dishonor for jesus .
the twelve apostles called the whole group of followers together .
then we can use all our time to pray and to teach the word of god . ”
then they put these men before the apostles , who prayed and laid their hands on them .
stephen received a great blessing . god gave him power to do great wonders and miraculous signs among the people .
but the spirit was helping him speak with wisdom . his words were so strong that these jews could not argue with him .
so they told some men to say , “ we heard stephen say bad things against moses and against god ! ”
we heard him say that jesus from nazareth will destroy this place and change what moses told us to do . ”
everyone there in the council meeting was staring at stephen . they saw that his face looked like the face of an angel .
the high priest said to stephen , “ is all this true ? ”
god said to him , ‘ leave your country and your people , and go to the country i will show you . ’
“ these ancestors of ours became jealous of their brother joseph and sold him to be a slave in egypt . but god was with him
“ but jacob heard that there was food in egypt . so he sent our people there . this was their first trip to egypt .
then they went there a second time . this time joseph told his brothers who he was . and pharaoh learned about joseph ’ s family .
then joseph sent some men to tell jacob , his father , to come to egypt . he also invited all his relatives , a total of 75 people .
so jacob went down to egypt . he and our other ancestors lived there until they died .
then a different king began to rule egypt , one who knew nothing about joseph .
this king tricked our people . he treated them badly , making them leave their children outside to die .
“ this was the time when moses was born . he was a very beautiful child , and for three months his parents took care of him at home .
when they put him outside , pharaoh ’ s daughter took him . she raised him as her own son .
the egyptians taught moses everything they knew . he was powerful in all he said and did .
“ when moses was about 40 years old , he decided to visit his own people , the people of israel .
moses thought that his people would understand that god was using him to save them . but they did not understand .
the man who was hurting the other one pushed moses away and said to him , ‘ did anyone say you could be our ruler and judge ?
will you kill me just as you killed that egyptian yesterday ? ’
“ forty years later moses was in the desert near mount sinai . an angel appeared to him in the flame of a burning bush .
when moses saw this , he was amazed . he went near to look closer at it . he heard a voice ; it was the lord ’ s .
“ the lord said to him , ‘ take off your sandals , because the place where you are now standing is holy ground .
“ but our ancestors did not want to obey moses . they rejected him . they wanted to go back to egypt again .
you carried with you the tent for worshiping moloch
god was very pleased with david . he asked god to let him build a temple for the people of jacob .
but solomon was the one who built the temple .
“ but the most high god does not live in houses built by human hands . this is what the prophet writes :
‘ the lord says , heaven is my throne ,
remember , i made all these things ! ’ ”
you are the people who received god ’ s law , which he gave you through his angels . but you don ’ t obey it ! ”
when those in the council meeting heard this , they became very angry . they were so mad they were grinding their teeth at him .
stephen said , “ look ! i see heaven open . and i see the son of man standing at god ’ s right side . ”
everyone there started shouting loudly , covering their ears with their hands . together they all ran at stephen .
as they were throwing the stones at him , stephen was praying . he said , “ lord jesus , receive my spirit ! ”
he fell on his knees and shouted , “ lord , don ’ t blame them for this sin ! ” these were his last words before he died .
saul agreed that the killing of stephen was a good thing . some godly men buried stephen and cried loudly for him .
they were scattered everywhere , and in every place they went , they told people the good news .
philip went to the city of samaria and told people about the messiah .
the people there heard philip and saw the miraculous signs he was doing . they all listened carefully to what he said .
what a happy day this was for that city !
simon amazed the people with his magic for so long that the people became his followers .
but philip told the people the good news about god ’ s kingdom and the power of jesus christ . men and women believed philip and were baptized .
the apostles in jerusalem heard that the people of samaria had accepted the word of god . so they sent peter and john to the people in samaria .
when peter and john arrived , they prayed for the samaritan believers to receive the holy spirit .
when the two apostles laid their hands on the people , they received the holy spirit .
simon saw that the spirit was given to people when the apostles laid their hands on them . so he offered the apostles money .
he said , “ give me this power so that when i lay my hands on someone , they will receive the holy spirit . ”
peter said to simon , “ you and your money should both be destroyed because you thought you could buy god ’ s gift with money .
you can not share with us in this work . your heart is not right before god .
change your heart ! turn away from these evil thoughts and pray to the lord . maybe he will forgive you .
i see that you are full of bitter jealousy and can not stop yourself from doing wrong . ”
simon answered , “ both of you pray to the lord for me , so that what you have said will not happen to me . ”
now he was on his way home . he was sitting in his chariot reading from the book of isaiah the prophet .
the spirit said to philip , “ go to that chariot and stay near it . ”
the part of the scriptures that he was reading was this :
he was shamed , and all his rights were taken away .
the official said to philip , “ please , tell me , who is the prophet talking about ? is he talking about himself or about someone else ? ”
philip began to speak . he started with this same scripture and told the man the good news about jesus .
then the official ordered the chariot to stop . both philip and the official went down into the water , and philip baptized him .
in jerusalem saul was still trying to scare the followers of the lord , even saying he would kill them . he went to the high priest
so saul went to damascus . when he came near the city , a very bright light from heaven suddenly shined around him .
he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him , “ saul , saul ! why are you persecuting me ? ”
saul said , “ who are you , lord ? ”
get up now and go into the city . someone there will tell you what you must do . ”
the men traveling with saul just stood there , unable to speak . they heard the voice , but they saw no one .
for three days , saul could not see ; he did not eat or drink .
there was a follower of jesus in damascus named ananias . in a vision the lord said to him , “ ananias ! ”
he has seen a vision in which a man named ananias came and laid his hands on him so that he could see again . ”
now he has come here to damascus . the leading priests have given him the power to arrest all people who trust in you . ”
i will show him all that he must suffer for me . ”
immediately , something that looked like fish scales fell off saul ’ s eyes . he was able to see ! then he got up and was baptized .
after he ate , he began to feel strong again .
soon he began to go to the synagogues and tell people about jesus . he told the people , “ jesus is the son of god ! ”
after many days , some jews made plans to kill saul .
they were watching the city gates day and night . they wanted to kill saul , but he learned about their plan .
and so saul stayed with the followers and went all around jerusalem speaking boldly for the lord .
he often had arguments with the greek-speaking jews , who began making plans to kill him .
when the believers learned about this , they took saul to caesarea , and from there they sent him to the city of tarsus .
peter was traveling through all the areas around jerusalem , and he stopped to visit the believers who lived in lydda .
there he met a man named aeneas , who was paralyzed and had not been able to get out of bed for the past eight years .
peter said to him , “ aeneas , jesus christ heals you . get up and make your bed ! ” he stood up immediately .
all the people living in lydda and on the plain of sharon saw him , and they decided to follow the lord .
while peter was in lydda , tabitha became sick and died . they washed her body and put it in an upstairs room .
people everywhere in joppa learned about this , and many believed in the lord .
peter stayed in joppa for many days at the home of a man named simon , who was a leatherworker .
in the city of caesarea there was a man named cornelius , a roman army officer in what was called the italian unit .
one afternoon about three o ’ clock , cornelius had a vision . he clearly saw an angel from god coming to him and saying , “ cornelius ! ”
staring at the angel and feeling afraid , cornelius said , “ what do you want , sir ? ”
send some men now to the city of joppa to get a man named simon , who is also called peter .
he is staying with someone also named simon , a leatherworker who has a house beside the sea . ”
cornelius explained everything to these three men and sent them to joppa .
the next day they were coming near joppa about noon , when peter was going up to the roof to pray .
he was hungry and wanted to eat . but while they were preparing the food for peter to eat , he had a vision .
he saw something coming down through the open sky . it looked like a big sheet being lowered to the ground by its four corners .
in it were all kinds of animals , reptiles , and birds .
then a voice said to him , “ get up , peter ; kill anything here and eat it . ”
but the voice said to him again , “ god has made these things pure . don ’ t say they are unfit to eat . ”
this happened three times . then the whole thing was taken back up into heaven .
peter wondered what this vision meant .
they asked , “ is simon peter staying here ? ”
while peter was still thinking about the vision , the spirit said to him , “ listen , three men are looking for you .
get up and go downstairs . go with these men without wondering if it ’ s all right , because i sent them . ”
so peter went downstairs and said to them , “ i think i ’ m the man you are looking for . why did you come here ? ”
peter asked the men to come in and stay for the night .
the next day they came to the city of caesarea . cornelius was waiting for them and had already gathered his relatives and close friends at his house .
when peter entered the house , cornelius met him . he fell down at peter ’ s feet and worshiped him .
but peter told him to get up . peter said , “ stand up ! i am only a man like you . ”
peter continued talking with cornelius . then peter went inside and saw a large group of people gathered there .
that ’ s why i didn ’ t argue when your men asked me to come here . now , please tell me why you sent for me . ”
he said , ‘ cornelius , god has heard your prayer and has seen your gifts to the poor . he remembers you and all you have done .
peter began to speak : “ i really understand now that god does not consider some people to be better than others .
he accepts anyone who worships him and does what is right . it is not important what nation they come from .
god has spoken to the people of israel . he sent them the good news that peace has come through jesus christ , the lord of all people .
“ you know what has happened all over judea . it began in galilee after john told the people they needed to be baptized .
“ we saw all that jesus did in judea and in jerusalem . but he was killed . they put him on a cross made of wood .
but on the third day after his death , god raised him to life and let him be seen openly .
everyone who believes in jesus will have their sins forgiven through his name . all the prophets agree that this is true . ”
while peter was still speaking these words , the holy spirit came down on all those who were listening to his speech .
the jewish believers who came with peter were amazed that the holy spirit had been poured out as a gift also to people who were not jews .
they heard them speaking different languages and praising god . then peter said ,
“ how can anyone object to these people being baptized in water ? they have received the holy spirit the same as we did ! ”
the apostles and the believers in judea heard that non-jewish people had accepted god ’ s teaching too .
but when peter came to jerusalem , some jewish believers argued with him .
they said , “ you went into the homes of people who are not jews and are not circumcised , and you even ate with them ! ”
so peter explained the whole story to them .
and i looked inside . i saw all kinds of animals , including wild ones , as well as reptiles and birds .
i heard a voice say to me , ‘ get up , peter . kill anything here and eat it ! ’
“ but the voice from heaven answered again , ‘ god has made these things pure . don ’ t say they are unfit to eat ! ’
“ this happened three times . then the whole thing was taken back into heaven .
suddenly there were three men standing outside the house where i was staying . they had been sent from caesarea to get me .
he will speak to you , and what he tells you will save you and everyone living in your house . ’
“ after i began speaking , the holy spirit came on them just as he came on us at the beginning .
then i remembered the words of the lord jesus : ‘ john baptized people in water , but you will be baptized in the holy spirit . ’
the lord was helping these men , and a large number of people believed and decided to follow the lord .
when the church in jerusalem heard about this , they sent barnabas to antioch .
then barnabas went to the city of tarsus to look for saul .
about that same time some prophets went from jerusalem to antioch .
the lord ’ s followers decided that they would each send as much as they could to help their brothers and sisters who lived in judea .
they gathered the money and gave it to barnabas and saul , who took it to the elders in judea .
during this same time , king herod began to do harm to some of those who were part of the church .
he ordered james , the brother of john , to be killed with a sword .
herod saw that many of the jews liked this , so he decided to arrest peter too . this happened during the festival of unleavened bread .
so peter was kept in jail , but the church was constantly praying to god for him .
so the angel went out and peter followed . he did not know if the angel was really doing this . he thought he might be seeing a vision .
peter knocked on the outside door . a servant girl named rhoda came to answer it .
but peter continued to knock . when the believers opened the door , they saw him . they were amazed .
the next day the soldiers were very upset . they wondered what happened to peter .
herod looked everywhere for him but could not find him . so he questioned the guards and then ordered that they be killed .
the people shouted , “ this is the voice of a god , not a man ! ”
the message of god was spreading , reaching more and more people .
after barnabas and saul finished their work in jerusalem , they returned to antioch , taking john mark with them .
so the church fasted and prayed . they laid their hands on barnabas and saul and sent them out .
barnabas and saul were sent out by the holy spirit . they went to the city of seleucia . then they sailed from there to the island of cyprus .
when barnabas and saul came to the city of salamis , they told the message of god in the jewish synagogues . john mark was with them to help .
they went across the whole island to the city of paphos . there they met a jewish man named barjesus who did magic . he was a false prophet .
but the magician elymas ( as barjesus was called in greek ) spoke against them , trying to stop the governor from believing in jesus .
but saul ( also known as paul ) , filled with the holy spirit , looked hard at elymas
when the governor saw this , he believed . he was amazed at the teaching about the lord .
they continued their trip from perga and went to antioch , a city near pisidia .
and he was patient with them for 40 years in the desert .
god destroyed seven nations in the land of canaan and gave their land to his people .
all this happened in about 450 years .
“ as he promised , god has brought one of david ’ s descendants to israel to be their savior . that descendant is jesus .
they could not find any real reason why jesus should die , but they asked pilate to kill him .
but god raised him up from death !
after this , for many days , those who had gone with jesus from galilee to jerusalem saw him . they are now his witnesses to our people .
“ we tell you the good news about the promise god made to our ancestors .
god raised jesus from death . jesus will never go back to the grave and become dust . so god said ,
but in another psalm it says ,
but the one god raised from death did not rot in the grave .
so be careful ! don ’ t let what the prophets said happen to you :
‘ listen , you people who doubt !
as paul and barnabas were leaving the synagogue , the people asked them to come again on the next sabbath day and tell them more about these things .
on the next sabbath day , almost all the people in the city came together to hear the word of the lord .
when the jews there saw all these people , they became very jealous . shouting insults , they argued against everything paul said .
this is what the lord told us to do :
and so the message of the lord was being told throughout the whole country .
so paul and barnabas shook the dust off their feet . then they went to the city of iconium .
but the lord ’ s followers in antioch were happy and filled with the holy spirit .
but some of the jews did not believe . they said things that caused the non-jewish people to be angry and turn against the believers .
when paul and barnabas learned about this , they left the city . they went to lystra and derbe , cities in lycaonia , and to the surrounding areas .
they told the good news there too .
in lystra there was a man who had something wrong with his feet . he had been born crippled and had never walked .
he was sitting and listening to paul speak . paul looked straight at him and saw that the man believed god could heal him .
so paul shouted , “ stand up on your feet ! ” the man jumped up and began walking around .
the people began to call barnabas “ zeus , ” and they called paul “ hermes , ” because he was the main speaker .
“ in the past god let all the nations do what they wanted .
even after saying all this , paul and barnabas still could hardly stop the people from offering sacrifices to them .
paul and barnabas went through the country of pisidia . then they came to the country of pamphylia .
they told people the message of god in the city of perga , and then they went down to the city of attalia .
and they stayed there a long time with the lord ’ s followers .
then the apostles and the elders gathered to study this problem .
to god , those people are not different from us . when they believed , god made their hearts pure .
no , we believe that we and these people will be saved the same way—by the grace of the lord jesus . ”
when they finished speaking , james said , “ my brothers , listen to me .
simon peter has told us how god showed his love for the non-jewish people . for the first time , god accepted them and made them his people .
the words of the prophets agree with this too :
‘ i will return after this .
then the rest of the world will look for the lord god—
‘ all this has been known from the beginning of time . ’
“ so i think we should not make things hard for those who have turned to god from among the non-jewish people .
instead , we should send a letter telling them only the things they should not do :
the group sent the letter with these men . the letter said :
we have all agreed to choose some men and send them to you . they will be with our dear friends , barnabas and paul .
barnabas and paul have given their lives to serve our lord jesus christ .
so we have sent judas and silas with them . they will tell you the same things .
we agree with the holy spirit that you should have no more burdens , except for these necessary things :
don ’ t eat food that has been given to idols .
so paul , barnabas , judas , and silas left jerusalem and went to antioch . there they gathered the group of believers together and gave them the letter .
when the believers read it , they were happy . the letter comforted them .
judas and silas , who were also prophets , said many things to encourage the believers and make them stronger in their faith .
but paul and barnabas stayed in antioch . they and many others taught the believers and told other people the good news about the lord .
barnabas wanted to bring john mark with them too .
paul chose silas to go with him . the believers in antioch put paul into the lord ’ s care and sent him out .
paul and silas went through the countries of syria and cilicia , helping the churches grow stronger .
the believers in the cities of lystra and iconium had only good things to say about him .
so the churches were becoming stronger in their faith , and the number of believers was growing every day .
when they reached the border of mysia , they tried to go on into bithynia , but the spirit of jesus did not let them go there .
so they passed by mysia and went to the city of troas .
we left troas in a ship and sailed to the island of samothrace . the next day we sailed to the city of neapolis .
then we went to philippi , a roman colony and the leading city in that part of macedonia . we stayed there for a few days .
they brought paul and silas before the roman officials and said , “ these men are jews , and they are making trouble in our city .
they are telling people to do things that are not right for us as romans to do . ”
the whole crowd turned against paul and silas . the officials tore the clothes off both men and ordered that they be beaten with rods .
they were beaten severely and thrown into jail . the officials told the jailer , “ guard them very carefully ! ”
when the jailer heard this special order , he put paul and silas far inside the jail and bound their feet between large blocks of wood .
about midnight paul and silas were praying and singing songs to god . the other prisoners were listening to them .
but paul shouted , “ don ’ t hurt yourself ! we are all here ! ”
the jailer told someone to bring a light . then he ran inside and , shaking with fear , fell down in front of paul and silas .
then he brought them outside and said , “ men , what must i do to be saved ? ”
they said to him , “ believe in the lord jesus and you will be saved—you and all who live in your house . ”
so paul and silas told the message of the lord to the jailer and all the people who lived in his house .
it was late at night , but the jailer took paul and silas and washed their wounds . then the jailer and all his people were baptized .
after this the jailer took paul and silas home and gave them some food . all the people were very happy because they now believed in god .
the next morning the roman officials sent some soldiers to tell the jailer , “ let these men go free . ”
the jailer said to paul , “ the officials have sent these soldiers to let you go free . you can leave now . go in peace . ”
the soldiers told the officials what paul said . when they heard that paul and silas were roman citizens , they were afraid .
so they came and told them they were sorry . they led them out of the jail and asked them to leave the city .
paul and silas traveled through the cities of amphipolis and apollonia . they came to the city of thessalonica , where there was a jewish synagogue .
jason is keeping them in his house . they all do things against the laws of caesar . they say there is another king called jesus . ”
when the city leaders and the other people heard this , they became very upset .
they made jason and the other believers deposit money to guarantee that there would be no more trouble . then they let them go .
that same night the believers sent paul and silas to another city named berea . when they arrived there , they went to the jewish synagogue .
the result was that many of them believed , including many important greek women and men .
so the believers immediately sent paul away to the coast , but silas and timothy stayed in berea .
while paul was waiting for silas and timothy in athens , he was upset because he saw that the city was full of idols .
some of the epicurean and some of the stoic philosophers argued with him .
they took paul to a meeting of the areopagus council . they said , “ please explain to us this new idea that you have been teaching .
the things you are saying are new to us . we have never heard this teaching before , and we want to know what it means . ”
( the people of athens and the foreigners who lived there spent all their time either telling or listening to all the latest ideas . )
then paul stood up before the meeting of the areopagus council and said , “ men of athens , everything i see here tells me you are very religious .
in the past people did not understand god , and he overlooked this . but now he is telling everyone in the world to change and turn to him .
so paul left the council meeting .
later , paul left athens and went to the city of corinth .
they were tentmakers , the same as paul , so he stayed with them and worked with them .
every sabbath day paul went to the synagogue and talked with both jews and greeks , trying to persuade them to believe in jesus .
i am with you , and no one will be able to hurt you . many of my people are in this city . ”
paul stayed there for a year and a half teaching god ’ s message to the people .
during the time that gallio was the governor of achaia , some of the jews came together against paul . they took him to court .
they said to gallio , “ this man is teaching people to worship god in a way that is against our law ! ”
so gallio made them leave the court .
then they all grabbed sosthenes , the leader of the synagogue . they beat him before the court . but this did not bother gallio .
they asked him to stay longer , but he refused .
he left them and said , “ i will come back to you again if god wants me to. ” and so he sailed away from ephesus .
when paul arrived at caesarea , he went to jerusalem and visited the church there . after that he went to antioch .
a jew named apollos came to ephesus . born in the city of alexandria , he was an educated man who knew the scriptures well .
he asked them , “ did you receive the holy spirit when you believed ? ”
paul asked them , “ so what kind of baptism did you have ? ”
when these followers heard this , they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus .
then paul laid his hands on them , and the holy spirit came on them . they began speaking different languages and prophesying .
there were about twelve men in this group .
he did this for two years . because of this work , everyone in asia , jews and greeks , heard the word of the lord .
god used paul to do some very special miracles .
but one time an evil spirit said to these jews , “ i know jesus , and i know about paul , but who are you ? ”
all the people in ephesus , jews and greeks , learned about this . they were all filled with fear and gave great honor to the lord jesus .
many of the believers began to confess , telling about all the evil things they had done .
some of them had used magic . these believers brought their magic books and burned them before everyone . these books were worth about 50,000 silver coins .
this is how the word of the lord was spreading in a powerful way , causing more and more people to believe .
timothy and erastus were two of his helpers . paul sent them ahead to macedonia . but he stayed in asia for a while .
but during that time there was some trouble in ephesus about the way . this is how it all happened :
when the men heard this , they became very angry . they shouted , “ great is artemis , the goddess of ephesus ! ”
paul wanted to go in and talk to the people , but the lord ’ s followers did not let him go .
also , some leaders of the country who were friends of paul sent him a message telling him not to go into the stadium .
no one can deny this , so you should be quiet . you must stop and think before you do anything else .
“ you brought these men here , but they have not said anything bad against our goddess . they have not stolen anything from her temple .
“ is there something else you want to talk about ? then come to the regular town meeting of the people . it can be decided there .
after the city clerk said this , he told the people to go home .
when the trouble stopped , paul invited the lord ’ s followers to come visit him . after encouraging them , he told them goodbye and left for macedonia .
on his way through macedonia he had many words of encouragement for the followers in various places . then he went to greece
and stayed there three months .
these men went first , ahead of paul . they waited for us in the city of troas .
we sailed from the city of philippi after the festival of unleavened bread . we met these men in troas five days later and stayed there seven days .
we were all together in a room upstairs , and there were many lights in the room .
the lord ’ s followers took eutychus home alive , and they were all greatly comforted .
when he caught up with us at assos , we took him on board , and we all sailed to mitylene .
in miletus paul sent a message back to ephesus , telling the elders of the church in ephesus to come to him .
i always did what was best for you . i told you the good news about jesus in public before the people and also taught in your homes .
i told everyone—jewish and non-jewish people—to change and turn to god . i told them all to believe in our lord jesus .
“ but now i must obey the spirit and go to jerusalem . i don ’ t know what will happen to me there .
i know only that in every city the holy spirit tells me that troubles and even jail wait for me .
so today i can tell you one thing that i am sure of : god will not blame me if some of you are not saved .
i can say this because i know that i told you everything that god wants you to know .
i know that after i leave , some men will come into your group . they will be like wild wolves and will try to destroy the flock .
when i was with you , i never wanted anyone ’ s money or fine clothes .
you know that i always worked to take care of my own needs and the needs of the people who were with me .
when paul finished speaking , he knelt down , and they all prayed together .
there we found a ship that was going to the area of phoenicia . we got on the ship and sailed away .
and said goodbye . then we got on the ship , and the followers went home .
we continued our trip from tyre and went to the city of ptolemais . we greeted the believers there and stayed with them one day .
he had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophesying .
after we had been there for several days , a prophet named agabus came from judea .
when we heard this , we and the other followers there begged paul not to go to jerusalem .
after this , we got ready and left for jerusalem .
the brothers and sisters in jerusalem were very happy to see us .
the next day paul went with us to visit james , and all the elders were there .
after greeting them , paul told them point by point all that god had used him to do among the non-jewish people .
“ what should we do ? the jewish believers here will learn that you have come .
so we will tell you what to do : four of our men have made a vow to god .
“ in regard to the non-jewish believers , we have already sent a letter to them saying what we think they should do :
while they were trying to kill paul , the commander of the roman army in jerusalem got word that the whole city was in a state of riot .
when the soldiers were ready to take paul into the army building , he asked the commander , “ can i say something to you ? ”
paul said , “ my brothers and fathers , listen to me ! i will make my defense to you . ”
when the jews heard paul speaking aramaic , they became very quiet . then paul said ,
i persecuted the people who followed the way . some of them were killed because of me . i arrested men and women and put them in jail .
i fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me , ‘ saul , saul , why are you persecuting me ? ’
“ i asked , ‘ who are you , lord ? ’ the voice said , ‘ i am jesus from nazareth , the one you are persecuting . ’
the men who were with me did not understand the voice , but they saw the light .
i could not see , because the bright light had made me blind . so the men led me into damascus .
he came to me and said , ‘ saul , my brother , look up and see again ! ’ immediately i was able to see him .
you will be his witness to all people . you will tell them what you have seen and heard .
now , don ’ t wait any longer . get up , be baptized and wash away your sins , trusting in jesus to save you . ’
“ later , i came back to jerusalem . i was praying in the temple area , and i saw a vision .
“ but jesus said to me , ‘ leave now . i will send you far away to the non-jewish people . ’ ”
they kept on shouting , ripping off their clothes and throwing dust into the air .
the commander came to paul and said , “ tell me , are you really a roman citizen ? ”
the commander said , “ i paid a lot of money to become a roman citizen . ”
ananias , the high priest , was there . when he heard this , he told the men who were standing near paul to hit him in the mouth .
the men standing near paul said to him , “ are you sure you want to insult god ’ s high priest like that ? ”
when paul said this , a big argument started between the pharisees and the sadducees . the group was divided .
( the sadducees believe that after people die , they will not live again as an angel or as a spirit . but the pharisees believe in both . )
there were more than 40 of them who made this plan .
but paul ’ s nephew heard about this plan . he went to the army building and told paul .
then paul called one of the army officers and said to him , “ take this young man to the commander . he has a message for him . ”
the commander led the young man to a place where they could be alone . the commander asked , “ what do you want to tell me ? ”
the commander sent the young man away , telling him , “ don ’ t tell anyone that you have told me about their plan . ”
get some horses for paul to ride so that he can be taken to governor felix safely . ”
the commander wrote a letter that said :
i wanted to know why they were accusing him . so i brought him before their council meeting .
the soldiers did what they were told . they got paul and took him to the city of antipatris that night .
the next day the soldiers on horses went with paul to caesarea , but the other soldiers and the spearmen went back to the army building in jerusalem .
the soldiers on horses entered caesarea , gave the letter to governor felix , and then turned paul over to him .
the governor read the letter and asked paul , “ what country are you from ? ” the governor learned that paul was from cilicia .
paul was called into the meeting , and tertullus began to make his accusations .
but i don ’ t want to take any more of your time . so i will say only a few words . please be patient .
this man is a troublemaker . he causes trouble with the jews everywhere in the world . he is a leader of the nazarene group .
the other jews agreed and said it was all true .
i went to worship in jerusalem only twelve days ago . you can learn for yourself that this is true .
these men can not prove the things they are saying against me now .
i have the same hope in god that these jews have—the hope that all people , good and bad , will be raised from death .
this is why i always try to do what i believe is right before god and before everyone .
ask these men here if they found any wrong in me when i stood before the high council meeting in jerusalem .
felix told the army officer to keep paul guarded but to give him some freedom and to let his friends bring whatever he needed .
but felix had another reason for talking with paul . he hoped paul would pay him a bribe , so he sent for paul often and talked with him .
but after two years , porcius festus became governor . so felix was no longer governor . but he left paul in prison to please the jews .
festus became governor , and three days later he went from caesarea to jerusalem .
the leading priests and the important jewish leaders made charges against paul before festus .
they asked festus to do them a favor . they wanted him to send paul back to jerusalem because they had a plan to kill paul on the way .
but festus answered , “ no , paul will be kept in caesarea . i will be going there soon myself ,
and your leaders can go with me . if this man has really done anything wrong , they can accuse him there . ”
paul defended himself , saying , “ i have done nothing wrong against the jewish law , against the temple , or against caesar . ”
festus talked about this with his advisors . then he said , “ you have asked to see caesar , so you will go to caesar ! ”
a few days later king agrippa and bernice came to caesarea to visit festus .
when i went to jerusalem , the leading priests and the older jewish leaders there made charges against him . they wanted me to order his death .
the jews stood up and accused him . but they did not accuse him of the kind of crimes i thought they would .
their charges were all about their own religion and about a man named jesus . jesus died , but paul said that he is still alive .
agrippa said to festus , “ i would like to hear this man too . ”
i think it is foolish to send a prisoner to caesar without making some charges against him . ”
agrippa said to paul , “ you may now speak to defend yourself. ” paul raised his hand to get their attention and began to speak .
he said , “ king agrippa , i feel fortunate that i can stand here before you today and answer all the charges these jews have made against me .
“ all the jews know about my whole life . they know the way i lived from the beginning in my own country and later in jerusalem .
now i am on trial because i hope for the promise that god made to our fathers .
why do you people think it is impossible for god to raise people from death ?
“ i used to think that i should do everything i could against jesus from nazareth .
“ one time the leading priests gave me permission and the authority to go to the city of damascus .
“ i said , ‘ who are you , lord ? ’
i will keep you safe from your own people and from the non-jewish people , the ones i am sending you to .
paul continued speaking : “ king agrippa , after i had this vision from heaven , i obeyed it .
“ this is why the jews grabbed me and were trying to kill me at the temple .
while paul was still defending himself , festus shouted , “ paul , you are out of your mind ! too much study has made you crazy . ”
paul said , “ most honorable festus , i am not crazy . what i am saying is true . it all makes perfect sense .
king agrippa , do you believe what the prophets wrote ? i know you believe ! ”
king agrippa said to paul , “ do you think you can persuade me to become a ‘ christ-follower ’ so easily ? ”
king agrippa , governor festus , bernice , and all the people sitting with them stood up
and agrippa said to festus , “ we could let him go free , but he has asked to see caesar . ”
we left that city and sailed close to the island of cyprus because the wind was blowing against us .
we went across the sea by cilicia and pamphylia . then we came to the city of myra in lycia .
there the army officer found a ship from the city of alexandria that was going to italy . so he put us on it .
we sailed along the coast , but the sailing was hard . then we came to a place called safe harbors , near the city of lasea .
we had lost much time , and it was now dangerous to sail , because it was already after the jewish day of fasting . so paul warned them ,
but the captain and the owner of the ship did not agree with paul . so the army officer accepted what they said instead of believing paul .
but then a very strong wind called the “ northeaster ” came from across the island .
this wind took the ship and carried it away . the ship could not sail against the wind , so we stopped trying and let the wind blow us .
the next day the storm was blowing against us so hard that the men threw some things out of the ship .
a day later they threw out the ship ’ s equipment .
but now i tell you to be happy . none of you will die , but the ship will be lost .
last night an angel came to me from god—the god i worship and belong to .
so men , there is nothing to worry about . i trust god , and i am sure everything will happen just as his angel told me .
but we will crash on an island . ”
on the fourteenth night we were still being blown around in the adriatic sea . the sailors thought we were close to land .
the sailors were afraid that we would hit the rocks , so they threw four anchors into the water . then they prayed for daylight to come .
so the soldiers cut the ropes and let the lifeboat fall into the water .
now i beg you to eat something . you need it to stay alive . none of you will lose even one hair off your heads . ”
after he said this , paul took some bread and thanked god for it before all of them . he broke off a piece and began eating .
all the men felt better and started eating too .
( there were 276 people on the ship . )
we ate all we wanted . then we began making the ship lighter by throwing the grain into the sea .
the soldiers decided to kill the prisoners so that none of the prisoners could swim away and escape .
the others used wooden boards or pieces of the ship . and this is how all the people went safely to land .
when we were safe on land , we learned that the island was called malta .
the people who lived there were very good to us . it was raining and very cold , so they built a fire and welcomed all of us .
but paul shook the snake off into the fire and was not hurt .
after this happened , all the other sick people on the island came to paul , and he healed them too .
we stopped at the city of syracuse . we stayed there three days and then left .
we found some believers there , who asked us to stay with them a week . finally , we came to rome .
when we came to rome , paul was allowed to live alone . but a soldier stayed with him to guard him .
they asked me many questions , but they could not find any reason why i should be put to death . so they wanted to let me go free .
that is why i wanted to see you and talk with you . i am bound with this chain because i believe in the hope of israel . ”
we want to hear your ideas . we know that people everywhere are speaking against this new group . ”
some of the jews believed what he said , but others did not believe .
‘ go to this people and tell them :
yes , the minds of these people are now closed .
“ i want you jews to know that god has sent his salvation to the non-jewish people . they will listen ! ”
paul stayed two full years in his own rented house . he welcomed all the people who came and visited him .
so i will start a fire at hazael ’ s house that will destroy the great palaces of ben-hadad .
so i will start a fire at the wall of gaza that will destroy the high towers in gaza .
so i will start a fire at the walls of tyre that will destroy the high towers in tyre . ”
so i will start a fire at teman that will destroy the high towers of bozrah . ”
then their kings and leaders will be captured . they will all be taken together. ” this is what the lord said .
so i will bring an end to the kings of moab , and i will kill all the leaders of moab. ” this is what the lord said .
so i will start a fire in judah that will destroy the high towers of jerusalem . ”
“ but you made the nazirites drink wine . you told the prophets not to prophesy .
you have become more than i can bear . i am bent low like a wagon loaded with grain .
no one will escape , not even the fastest runner . strong men will not be strong enough . soldiers will not be able to save themselves .
people with bows and arrows will not survive . fast runners will not escape . people on horses will not escape alive .
at that time even very brave soldiers will run away . they will not take the time to put their clothes on. ” this is what the lord said .
two people will not walk together
a lion will roar in the forest
a bird doesn ’ t fly into a trap
if people hear the warning blast of a trumpet ,
when the lord god decides to do something , he will first tell his servants , the prophets .
when a lion roars , people are frightened . when the lord god speaks , a prophet must prophesy .
this is what the lord god all-powerful says : “ warn the family of jacob about these things .
your city will be destroyed . the women will rush out through cracks in the wall and throw themselves onto the pile of dead bodies .
“ so , israel , this is what i will do to you . you people of israel , prepare to meet your god . ”
he is the one who made the mountains .
people of israel , listen to this song . this funeral song is about you .
the virgin of israel has fallen .
this is what the lord god says :
the lord says this to the nation of israel :
but don ’ t look in bethel .
come to the lord and live .
you should go to the lord for help .
you hate those prophets , who go to public places and speak against evil ,
you take unfair taxes from the poor .
this is because i know about your many sins .
at that time wise teachers will be quiet ,
you say that god is with you ,
hate evil and love goodness .
the lord , the lord god all-powerful says ,
people will be crying in the vineyards ,
some of you want to see
you will be like someone who escapes from a lion
the lord ’ s special day will be
“ i hate your festivals ;
even if you offer me burnt offerings and grain offerings ,
take your noisy songs away from here .
but let justice flow like a river ,
israel , you offered me sacrifices
but you also carried statues of sakkuth , your king , and kaiwan .
so i will send you as captives , far beyond damascus . ”
oh , look at the people enjoying life in zion ,
go look at calneh .
you people are rushing toward the day of punishment .
but now you lie on ivory beds
you play your harps ,
you drink wine in fancy cups .
the lord god used his own name and made an oath . the lord god all-powerful said ,
at that time ten people in one house might survive , but they too will die .
look , the lord will give the command ,
do horses run over loose rocks ?
you are so excited about defeating lo debar .
then the lord changed his mind about this . the lord said , “ it will not happen . ”
but i said , “ lord god , stop , i beg you ! jacob can not survive ! he is too small ! ”
then the lord changed his mind about this . the lord god said , “ it will not happen either . ”
the lord said to me , “ amos , what do you see ? ”
amos has said , ‘ jeroboam will die by the sword , and the people of israel will be taken as prisoners out of their country . ’ ”
amaziah also said to amos , “ you seer , go down to judah and eat there . do your prophesying there .
but don ’ t prophesy anymore here at bethel . this is jeroboam ’ s holy place . this is israel ’ s temple . ”
i was a shepherd and the lord took me from following the sheep . the lord said to me , ‘ go , prophesy to my people israel . ’
this is what the lord god showed me : i saw a basket of summer fruit .
he said to me , “ amos , what do you see ? ”
listen to me , you who trample on helpless people .
the poor can not pay their loans ,
the lord made a promise . he used his name , “ pride of jacob , ” and made this promise :
there will be an earthquake
the lord god also said ,
i will change your festivals into days of crying for the dead .
the lord god says ,
the people will wander around the country ,
at that time the beautiful young men and women
they made promises by the sin of samaria ,
i saw the lord standing by the altar , and he said ,
if they dig deep into the ground ,
if they hide at the top of mount carmel ,
if they are captured and taken away by their enemies ,
the lord god all-powerful will touch the land ,
he built his upper rooms above the skies .
this is what the lord says :
the lord god is watching this sinful kingdom .
i am giving the command
“ sinners among my people say ,
“ david ’ s tent has fallen ,
then the people left alive in edom ,
the lord says , “ a time of great blessing is coming .
i will bring my people , israel ,
i will plant my people on their land ,
to the holy and faithful brothers and sisters in christ who live in colossae .
in our prayers we always thank god for you . he is the father of our lord jesus christ .
we thank him because we have heard about the faith you have in christ jesus and the love you have for all of god ’ s people .
your faith and love continue because you know what is waiting for you in heaven—the hope you have had since you first heard the true message , the good news
you heard it from epaphras , our dear friend and co-worker . he is a faithful servant of christ for us .
he also told us about the love you have from the spirit .
since the day we heard these things about you , we have continued praying for you . this is what we pray :
that god will strengthen you with his own great power , so that you will be patient and not give up when troubles come .
god made us free from the power of darkness . and he brought us into the kingdom of his dear son .
the son paid the price to make us free . in him we have forgiveness of our sins .
no one can see god ,
through his power all things were made :
the son was there before anything was made .
he is the head of the body , which is the church .
god was pleased for all of himself to live in the son .
and through him , god was happy to bring all things back to himself again—
at one time you were separated from god . you were his enemies in your minds , because the evil you did was against him .
to do this , i work and struggle using the great strength that christ gives me . that strength is working in my life .
in him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are kept safe .
i tell you this so that no one can fool you by telling you ideas that seem good , but are false .
even though i am far away , my thoughts are always with you . i am happy to see your good lives and your strong faith in christ .
you accepted christ jesus as lord , so continue to live following him .
i say this because all of god lives in christ fully , even in his life on earth .
and because you belong to christ you are complete , having everything you need . christ is ruler over every other power and authority .
so don ’ t let anyone make rules for you about eating and drinking or about jewish customs ( festivals , new moon celebrations , or sabbath days ) .
in the past these things were like a shadow that showed what was coming . but the new things that were coming are found in christ .
“ don ’ t eat this , ” “ don ’ t taste that , ” “ don ’ t touch that ” ?
these rules are talking about earthly things that are gone after they are used . they are only human commands and teachings .
you were raised from death with christ . so live for what is in heaven , where christ is sitting at the right hand of god .
think only about what is up there , not what is here on earth .
your old self has died , and your new life is kept with christ in god .
yes , christ is now your life , and when he comes again , you will share in his glory .
god will show his anger against those who don ’ t obey him , because they do these evil things .
you also did these things in the past , when you lived like them .
but now put these things out of your life : anger , losing your temper , doing or saying things to hurt others , and saying shameful things .
don ’ t lie to each other . you have taken off those old clothes—the person you once were and the bad things you did then .
together with these things , the most important part of your new life is to love each other . love is what holds everything together in perfect unity .
let the peace that christ gives control your thinking . it is for peace that you were chosen to be together in one body . and always be thankful .
everything you say and everything you do should be done for jesus your lord . and in all you do , give thanks to god the father through jesus .
wives , be willing to serve your husbands . this is the right thing to do in following the lord .
husbands , love your wives , and be gentle to them .
children , obey your parents in everything . this pleases the lord .
fathers , don ’ t upset your children . if you are too hard to please , they might want to stop trying .
in all the work you are given , do the best you can . work as though you are working for the lord , not any earthly master .
remember that anyone who does wrong will be punished for that wrong . and the lord treats everyone the same .
masters , give what is good and fair to your servants . remember that you have a master in heaven .
never stop praying . be ready for anything by praying and being thankful .
pray that i will say what is necessary to make this truth clear to everyone .
be wise in the way you act with those who are not believers . use your time in the best way you can .
when you talk , you should always be kind and wise . then you will be able to answer everyone in the way you should .
that is why i am sending him . i want you to know how we are , and i am sending him to encourage you .
i am sending him with onesimus , the faithful and dear brother from your group . they will tell you everything that has happened here .
i know that he has worked hard for you and the people in laodicea and in hierapolis .
greetings also from demas and our dear friend luke , the doctor .
give our greetings to the brothers and sisters in laodicea . greetings also to nympha and to the church that meets in her house .
tell archippus , “ be sure to do the work the lord gave you . ”
here ’ s my greeting in my own handwriting— paul . remember me in prison . god ’ s grace be with you .
greetings from paul , silas , and timothy .
we always remember you when we pray , and we thank god for all of you .
brothers and sisters , god loves you . and we know that he has chosen you to be his people .
you became an example to all the believers in macedonia and achaia .
brothers and sisters , you know that our visit to you was not a failure .
when we encourage people to believe the good news , it ’ s not out of wrong motives . we are not trying to trick or fool anyone .
we were not looking for praise from people—not from you or anyone else .
you know that we treated each one of you the way a father treats his own children .
we encouraged you , we comforted you , and we told you to live good lives for god . he calls you to be part of his glorious kingdom .
yes , we wanted to come to you . i , paul , tried more than once to come , but satan stopped us .
you are our hope , our joy , and the crown we will be proud of when our lord jesus christ comes .
you bring us honor and joy .
we sent him so that none of you would be upset by the troubles we have now . you yourselves know that we must have these troubles .
even when we were with you , we told you that we would all have to suffer . and you know that it happened just as we said .
so , brothers and sisters , we are encouraged about you because of your faith . we have much trouble and suffering , but still we are encouraged .
our life is really full if you stand strong in the lord .
we pray that our god and father and our lord jesus will prepare the way for us to come to you .
you know all that we told you to do by the authority of the lord jesus .
god wants you to be holy . he wants you to stay away from sexual sins .
god wants each one of you to learn to control your own body . use your body in a way that is holy and that gives honor to god .
don ’ t let your sexual desires control you like the people who don ’ t know god .
god chose us to be holy . he does not want us to live in sin .
so anyone who refuses to obey this teaching is refusing to obey god , not us . and god is the one who gives you his holy spirit .
we don ’ t need to write to you about having love for your brothers and sisters in christ . god has already taught you to love each other .
in fact , you love all the believers in macedonia . we encourage you now , brothers and sisters , to show your love more and more .
do all you can to live a peaceful life . mind your own business , and earn your own living , as we told you before .
so encourage each other with these words .
now , brothers and sisters , we don ’ t need to write to you about times and dates .
you know very well that the day when the lord comes again will be a surprise , like a thief who comes at night .
but you , brothers and sisters , are not living in darkness . and so that day will not surprise you like a thief .
you are all people who belong to the light . you belong to the day . we don ’ t belong to the night or to darkness .
so we should not be like other people . we should not be sleeping . we should be awake and have self-control .
people who sleep , sleep at night . people who drink too much , drink at night .
god did not choose us to suffer his anger . god chose us to have salvation through our lord jesus christ .
jesus died for us so that we can live together with him . it is not important if we are alive or dead when jesus comes .
so encourage each other and help each other grow stronger in faith , just as you are already doing .
show them the highest respect and love because of the work they do .
be sure that no one pays back wrong for wrong . but always try to do what is good for each other and for all people .
always be full of joy .
whatever happens , always be thankful . this is how god wants you to live in christ jesus .
don ’ t stop the work of the holy spirit .
don ’ t treat prophecy like something that is not important .
but test everything . keep what is good ,
and stay away from everything that is evil .
the one who chose you will do that for you . you can trust him .
brothers and sisters , please pray for us .
give all the brothers and sisters the special greeting of god ’ s people .
i tell you by the authority of the lord to read this letter to all the believers there .
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you .
greetings from paul , silas , and timothy .
grace and peace to you from god the father and the lord jesus christ .
this is proof that god is right in his judgment . he wants you to be worthy of his kingdom . your suffering is for that kingdom .
god will do what is right . he will punish those who are causing you trouble .
he will come with burning fire to punish those who don ’ t know god—those who refuse to accept the good news about our lord jesus .
i told you before that all these things would happen . remember ?
and you know what is stopping that man of evil now . he is being stopped now so that he will appear at the right time .
so god will send them something powerful that leads them away from the truth and causes them to believe a lie .
they will all be condemned because they did not believe the truth and because they enjoyed doing evil .
so , brothers and sisters , stand strong and continue to believe the teachings we gave you when we were there and by letter .
and pray that we will be protected from crooked and evil people . not everyone believes in the lord , you know .
but the lord is faithful . he will give you strength and protect you from the evil one .
the lord gives us confidence that you are doing what we told you and that you will continue to do it .
we pray that the lord will cause you to feel god ’ s love and remember christ ’ s patient endurance .
you yourselves know that you should live like we do . we were not lazy when we were with you .
when we were with you , we gave you this rule : “ whoever will not work should not be allowed to eat . ”
we hear that some people in your group refuse to work . they are doing nothing except being busy in the lives of others .
brothers and sisters , never get tired of doing good .
but don ’ t treat them as enemies . counsel them as fellow believers .
we pray that the lord of peace will give you peace at all times and in every way . the lord be with you all .
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all .
greetings from paul , an apostle of christ jesus . i am an apostle by the command of god our savior and christ jesus our hope .
to timothy , a true son to me in the faith we share .
but some have missed this key point in their teaching and have gone off in another direction . now they talk about things that help no one .
we know that the law is good if someone uses it right .
that teaching is part of the good news that our blessed god gave me to tell . in it we see his glory .
i thank christ jesus our lord because he trusted me and gave me this work of serving him . he gives me strength .
but our lord gave me a full measure of his grace . and with that grace came the faith and love that are in christ jesus .
here is a true statement that should be accepted without question : christ jesus came into the world to save sinners , and i am the worst of them .
continue to trust in god and do what you know is right . some people have not done this , and their faith is now in ruins .
hymenaeus and alexander are men like that . i have given them to satan so that they will learn not to speak against god .
first of all , i ask that you pray for all people . ask god to bless them and give them what they need . and give thanks .
this is good and pleases god our savior .
god wants everyone to be saved and to fully understand the truth .
there is only one god , and there is only one way that people can reach god . that way is through christ jesus , who as a man
gave himself to pay for everyone to be free . this is the message that was given to us at just the right time .
but they should make themselves attractive by the good things they do . that is more appropriate for women who say they are devoted to god .
a woman should learn while listening quietly and being completely willing to obey .
i don ’ t allow a woman to teach a man or tell him what to do . she must listen quietly ,
because adam was made first . eve was made later .
also , adam was not the one who was tricked . it was the woman who was tricked and became a sinner .
it is a true statement that anyone whose goal is to serve as an elder has his heart set on a good work .
he must be a good leader of his own family . this means that his children obey him with full respect .
if a man does not know how to lead his own family , he will not be able to take care of god ’ s church .
they must follow the true faith that god has now made known to us and always do what they know is right .
you should test them first . then , if you find that they have done nothing wrong , they can be special servants .
the men who are special servants must be faithful in marriage . they must be good leaders of children and their own families .
those who do well as special servants are making an honorable place for themselves . and they will feel very sure of their faith in christ jesus .
i hope i can come to you soon . but i am writing this to you now ,
without a doubt , the secret of our life of worship is great :
everything that god made is good . nothing he made should be refused if it is accepted with thanks to him .
everything he created is made holy by what he has said and by prayer .
here is a true statement that should be accepted without question :
command and teach these things .
continue to read the scriptures to the people , encourage them , and teach them . do this until i come .
remember to use the gift you have , which was given to you through a prophecy when the group of elders laid their hands on you .
continue to do these things . give your life to doing them . then everyone can see that your work is progressing .
be careful in your life and in your teaching . continue to live and teach rightly . then you will save yourself and those who listen to your teaching .
don ’ t speak angrily to an older man . but talk to him as if he were your father . treat the younger men like brothers .
treat the older women like mothers . and treat the younger women with respect like sisters .
take care of widows who really need help .
but the widow who uses her life to please herself is really dead while she is still living .
tell the believers there to take care of their family so that no one can say they are doing wrong .
to be added to your list of widows , a woman must be 60 years old or older . she must have been faithful to her husband .
then they will be guilty of not doing what they first promised to do .
but some of the younger widows have already turned away to follow satan .
the elders who lead the church in a good way should receive double honor—in particular , those who do the work of counseling and teaching .
tell those who sin that they are wrong . do this in front of the whole church so that the others will have a warning .
before god and jesus christ and the chosen angels , i tell you to make these judgments without any prejudice . treat every person the same .
think carefully before you lay your hands on anyone to make him an elder . don ’ t share in the sins of others . keep yourself pure .
timothy , stop drinking only water , and drink a little wine . this will help your stomach , and you will not be sick so often .
the sins of some people are easy to see . their sins show that they will be judged . but the sins of some others are seen only later .
all those who are slaves should show full respect to their masters . then god ’ s name and our teaching will not be criticized .
devotion to god is , in fact , a way for people to be very rich , but only if it makes them satisfied with what they have .
when we came into the world , we brought nothing . and when we die , we can take nothing out .
so , if we have food and clothes , we will be satisfied with that .
do what you were commanded to do without fault or blame until the time when our lord jesus christ comes again .
tell those who are rich to do good—to be rich in good works . and tell them they should be happy to give and ready to share .
some people who claim to have that “ knowledge ” have gone completely away from what we believe .
to timothy , a dear son to me .
i remember that you cried for me . i want very much to see you so that i can be filled with joy .
the spirit god gave us does not make us afraid . his spirit is a source of power and love and self-control .
i was chosen to tell people that message as an apostle and teacher .
this teaching is a treasure that you have been trusted with . protect it with the help of the holy spirit , who lives inside us .
you know that everyone in asia has left me . even phygelus and hermogenes have left me .
i pray that the lord will show mercy to the family of onesiphorus . many times onesiphorus encouraged me . he was not ashamed that i was in prison .
no , he was not ashamed . when he came to rome , he looked and looked for me until he found me .
timothy , you are a son to me . be strong in the grace that we have because we belong to christ jesus .
as a good soldier of christ jesus , accept your share of the troubles we have .
a soldier wants to please his commanding officer , so he does not spend any time on activities that are not a part of his duty .
athletes in a race must obey all the rules to win .
the farmer who works hard deserves the first part of the harvest .
think about what i am saying . the lord will help you understand it all .
here is a true statement :
if we remain faithful even in suffering ,
if we are not faithful ,
stay away from people who talk about useless things that are not from god . that kind of talk will lead a person more and more against god .
their evil teaching will spread like a sickness inside the body . hymenaeus and philetus are men like that .
stay away from foolish and stupid arguments . you know that these arguments grow into bigger arguments .
you must gently teach those who don ’ t agree with you . maybe god will let them change their hearts so that they can accept the truth .
remember this : there are some terrible times coming in the last days .
these women always want to learn something new , but they are never able to fully understand the truth .
but they will not succeed in what they are trying to do . everyone will see how foolish they are . that is what happened to jannes and jambres .
everyone who wants to live showing true devotion to god in christ jesus will be persecuted .
people who are evil and cheat others will become worse and worse . they will fool others , but they will also be fooling themselves .
but you should continue following the teaching you learned . you know it is true , because you know you can trust those who taught you .
using the scriptures , those who serve god will be prepared and will have everything they need to do every good work .
people will stop listening to the truth . they will begin to follow the teaching in false stories .
my life is being given as an offering for god . the time has come for me to leave this life here .
i have fought the good fight . i have finished the race . i have served the lord faithfully .
do your best to come to me as soon as you can .
demas loved this world too much . that is why he left me . he went to thessalonica . crescens went to galatia . and titus went to dalmatia .
luke is the only one still with me . get mark and bring him with you when you come . he can help me in my work here .
i sent tychicus to ephesus .
alexander the metalworker caused me so much harm . the lord will punish him for what he did .
he fought against everything we teach . you should be careful that he doesn ’ t hurt you too .
the first time i defended myself , no one helped me . everyone left me . i pray that god will forgive them .
give my greetings to priscilla and aquila and to the family of onesiphorus .
erastus stayed in corinth . and i left trophimus in miletus—he was sick .
try as hard as you can to come to me before winter .
the lord be with your spirit . grace be with you .
nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came to jerusalem and surrounded it with his army . this happened during the third year that jehoiakim was king of judah .
among those young men were daniel , hananiah , mishael , and azariah from the tribe of judah .
god caused ashpenaz , the man in charge of the officials , to be kind and loyal to daniel .
then daniel talked to the guard who had been put in charge of daniel , hananiah , mishael , and azariah by ashpenaz .
he said , “ please give us this test for ten days : don ’ t give us anything but vegetables to eat and water to drink .
so the guard agreed to test daniel , hananiah , mishael , and azariah for ten days .
after ten days , daniel and his friends looked healthier than all the young men who ate the king ’ s food .
so the guard continued to take away the king ’ s special food and wine and to give only vegetables to daniel , hananiah , mishael , and azariah .
at the end of the three years of training , ashpenaz brought all the young men to king nebuchadnezzar .
so daniel served the king until the first year that cyrus was king .
during nebuchadnezzar ’ s second year as king , he had dreams . they bothered him , and he could not sleep .
then the king said to them , “ i had a dream that bothers me . i want to know what it means . ”
again the wise men said to the king , “ please , sir , tell us about the dream , and we will tell you what it means . ”
then king nebuchadnezzar answered , “ i know that you are trying to get more time . you know that i meant what i said .
when the king heard that , he became very angry . so he gave an order for all the wise men of babylon to be killed .
and said , “ why did the king order such a severe punishment ? ”
so daniel went to his house . he explained the whole story to his friends hananiah , mishael , and azariah .
during the night , god explained the secret to daniel in a vision . then daniel praised the god of heaven .
he changes the times and seasons .
he knows hidden secrets that are hard to understand .
god of my ancestors , i thank you and praise you .
the king asked daniel ( belteshazzar ) a question . he said , “ are you able to tell me about my dream , and what it means ? ”
“ king , in your dream you saw a large statue in front of you that was very large and shiny . it was very impressive .
the lower part of the legs was made from iron . its feet were made partly of iron and partly of clay .
“ that was your dream . now we will tell the king what it means .
king , you are the most important king . the god of heaven has given you a kingdom , power , strength , and glory .
the toes of the statue were partly iron and partly clay . so the fourth kingdom will be partly strong like iron and partly weak like clay .
so all the men came and stood in front of the idol that king nebuchadnezzar had set up .
whoever does not bow down and worship this gold idol will immediately be thrown into a very hot furnace . ”
then some of the chaldeans came up to the king and began speaking against the people from judah .
they said , “ king , may you live forever !
and you also said that whoever does not bow down and worship the gold idol will be thrown into a very hot furnace .
nebuchadnezzar became very angry . he called for shadrach , meshach , and abednego . so they were brought to him .
shadrach , meshach , and abednego answered the king , “ nebuchadnezzar , we don ’ t need to explain these things to you .
shadrach , meshach , and abednego fell into the fire . they were tied up very tightly .
then the king gave shadrach , meshach , and abednego more important jobs in the province of babylon .
king nebuchadnezzar sent this letter to the many nations and language groups living around the world .
i am very happy to tell you about the miracles and wonderful things that the most high god did for me .
god has done amazing miracles !
i , nebuchadnezzar , was at my palace . i was happy and successful .
so i gave an order that all the wise men of babylon be brought to me to tell me what my dream meant .
when the men of magic and the chaldeans came , i told them about the dream , but they could not tell me what it meant .
the tree grew large and strong . the top of the tree touched the sky . it could be seen from anywhere on earth .
“ i was looking at those things in the vision while lying on my bed . and then i saw a holy angel coming down from heaven .
he will not think like a man any longer . he will have the mind of an animal . seven seasons will pass while he is like this . ’
“ king , this is the meaning of the dream . god most high has commanded these things to happen to my lord the king :
all these things happened to king nebuchadnezzar .
king belshazzar gave a big party for 1000 of his officials . the king was drinking wine with them .
so all the king ’ s wise men came in , but they could not read the writing or understand what it meant .
king belshazzar ’ s officials were confused , and the king became even more afraid and worried . his face was white from fear .
so they brought daniel to the king and he asked , “ is your name daniel , one of the captives my father the king brought here from judah ?
i have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you understand secrets and are very smart and very wise .
“ king , god most high made your grandfather nebuchadnezzar a very great and powerful king and gave him great wealth .
“ but nebuchadnezzar became proud and stubborn , so his power was taken away from him . he was taken off his royal throne and stripped of his glory .
“ but belshazzar , you already knew this . you are nebuchadnezzar ’ s grandson , but still you have not made yourself humble .
so because of that , god sent the hand that wrote on the wall .
these are the words that were written on the wall :
“ this is what these words mean :
that very same night , belshazzar , king of the babylonians , was killed .
a man named darius the mede became the new king . darius was about 62 years old .
darius thought it would be a good idea to choose 120 satraps to rule throughout his kingdom .
so the two supervisors and the satraps went as a group to the king . they said , “ king darius , live forever !
so king darius made the law and signed it .
then the supervisors and satraps went as a group and found daniel praying and asking god for help .
the next morning , king darius got up just as it was getting light and ran to the lions ’ den .
daniel answered , “ king , live forever !
then king darius wrote this letter to all the people from other nations and language groups all around the world :
god helps and saves people .
so daniel was successful during the time darius was king and when cyrus the persian was king .
daniel said , “ i saw my vision at night . in the vision the wind was blowing from all four directions . these winds made the sea rough .
i saw four big animals and each one was different from the others . these four animals came up out of the sea .
“ as i was looking , thrones were put in their places ,
a river of fire flowed out
the authority and rule of the other animals had been taken from them . but they were permitted to live for a certain period of time .
“ i , daniel , was confused and worried . the visions that went through my mind bothered me .
i went to someone who was standing there and asked him what all this meant . so he explained it to me .
he said , ‘ the four great animals are four kingdoms that will come from the earth .
but god ’ s holy people will receive the kingdom , and they will have the kingdom forever and ever . ’
as i was watching , this little horn began attacking and making war against god ’ s holy people and killing them .
“ ‘ but the court will decide what should happen , and that king ’ s power will be taken away . his kingdom will end completely .
after that vision , i , daniel , saw another vision during the third year that belshazzar was king .
then a little horn grew from one of those four horns . it grew and became very big . it grew toward the southeast , toward the beautiful land .
because of this sin , the daily sacrifices were stopped . truth was thrown down to the ground . the little horn did these things and was very successful .
the other holy one said , “ this will last for 2300 days . then the holy place will be repaired . ”
“ you saw a ram with two horns . the horns are the countries of media and persia .
the goat is the king of greece . the big horn between its eyes is the first king .
i prayed to the lord my god and told him about all my sins . i said ,
“ lord , we should all be ashamed . all our kings and leaders should be ashamed . our ancestors should be ashamed , because we sinned against you .
“ but , lord our god , you are kind and forgiving , even though we rebelled against you .
we have not obeyed the lord our god . he used his servants , the prophets , and gave us laws , but we have not obeyed his laws .
i was praying to the lord my god about his holy mountain and telling about my sins and the sins of the people of israel .
gabriel helped me understand the things i wanted to know . he said , “ daniel , i have come to give you wisdom and to help you understand .
at that time i , daniel , was very sad for three weeks .
on the 24th day of the first month of the year , i was standing beside the great tigris river .
then a hand touched me . when that happened , i got on my hands and knees . i was so afraid that i was shaking .
while the man was talking to me , i bowed low with my face toward the ground . i could not speak .
sir , i am daniel your servant . how can i talk with you ? my strength is gone and it is hard for me to breathe . ”
the one who looked like a man touched me again . when he touched me , i felt better .
“ during the first year that darius the mede was king , i stood up to support michael in his fight against the prince of persia .
then a very strong and powerful king will come who will rule with much power . he will do anything he wants .
the northern king will attack the southern kingdom . but he will lose , and then he will go back to his own country .
he will defeat large and powerful armies . he will even defeat the leader with the agreement .
“ at the right time , the northern king will attack the southern king again . but this time he will not be successful as he was before .
when those wise people are punished , they will receive some help , but many people who join them will be hypocrites .
the northern king will show his power in many countries . egypt will also learn how powerful he is .
he will get treasures of gold and silver and all the riches of egypt . the libyans and ethiopians will obey him .
but that northern king will hear news from the east and the north that will make him afraid and angry . he will go to completely destroy many nations .
there are many who are dead and buried . some of them will wake up and live forever , but others will wake up to shame and disgrace forever .
the wise people will shine as bright as the sky . those who teach others to live right will shine like stars forever and ever .
i heard the answer , but i really didn ’ t understand . so i asked , “ sir , what will happen after all this comes true ? ”
he answered , “ go on about your life daniel . the message is hidden . it will be a secret until the time of the end .
“ the daily sacrifice will be stopped . there will be 1290 days from that time until the time that the terrible thing that destroys is set up .
the one who waits for and comes to the end of the 1335 days will be very happy .
the trip from mount horeb through the mountains of seir to kadesh barnea takes only eleven days .
the israelites were in moab on the east side of the jordan river when moses began to explain what god had commanded :
“ at mount horeb the lord our god spoke to us . he said , ‘ you have stayed at this mountain long enough .
“ at that time i told you , ‘ i can ’ t take care of you by myself .
may the lord , the god of your ancestors , give you 1000 times more people than you are now ! may he bless you as he promised .
but i can not take care of you and solve all your arguments by myself .
so choose some men from each tribe , and i will make them leaders over you . choose wise men with experience who understand people . ’
“ and you said , ‘ that is a good thing to do . ’
at that same time i also told you everything you must do .
then i said to you , ‘ you have now come to the hill country of the amorites . the lord our god will give us this country .
“ i thought that was a good idea . so i chose twelve men from among you , one man from each tribe .
then they left and went up to the hill country . they came to the valley of eshcol and explored it .
“ but you refused to go into the land . you refused to obey the lord your god .
“ so i said to you , ‘ don ’ t be upset or afraid of those people .
the lord your god is in front , leading you . he will fight for you just as he did in egypt .
“ but you didn ’ t trust the lord your god then either .
“ the lord heard what you said , and he was angry . he made a vow . he said ,
‘ not one of you evil people who are alive now will go into the good land that i promised to your ancestors .
“ the lord was also angry with me because of you . he said to me , ‘ moses , you can not enter the land , either .
but you—you must turn around , take the road to the red sea and go back into the desert . ’
the amorites who lived there came out like a swarm of bees and chased you all the way from seir to hormah .
then you came back crying to the lord for help , but the lord refused to listen to you .
so you stayed at kadesh for such a long time .
then the lord said to me ,
‘ you have traveled around these mountains long enough . turn north .
you must pay the people of esau for any food you eat or water you drink there .
the anakites were part of the rephaites . people thought the emites were also rephaites , but the people of moab called them emites .
“ the lord told me , ‘ now , go to the other side of zered valley. ’ so we crossed zered valley .
the lord had opposed those men until they were all dead and gone from our camp .
“ after all the fighting men were dead and gone ,
the lord said to me ,
‘ today you must cross the border at ar and go into moab .
( that country is also known as the land of rephaim . the rephaites lived there in the past . the people of ammon called them the zamzummites .
today i will make all people everywhere afraid of you . they will hear the news about you , and they will be afraid and shake with fear . ’
“ while we were in the desert of kedemoth , i sent messengers to king sihon of heshbon . the messengers offered peace to sihon . they said ,
‘ let us go through your land . we will stay on the road . we will not turn off the road to the right or to the left .
we will pay you in silver for any food we eat or any water we drink . we only want to march through your country .
“ the lord said to me , ‘ i am giving king sihon and his country to you . now , go take his land ! ’
“ then king sihon and all his people came out to fight against us at jahaz .
but the lord our god gave him to us . we defeated king sihon , his sons , and all his people .
we took only the cattle and the valuable things from those cities .
“ we turned and went on the road to bashan . king og of bashan and all his men came out to fight against us at edrei .
“ so the lord our god let us defeat king og of bashan . we destroyed him and all his men . not one of them was left .
but we kept all the cattle and the valuable things from the cities for ourselves .
( the people from sidon call mount hermon , sirion , but the amorites called it senir . )
i gave the other half of gilead and the whole area of bashan to half the tribe of manasseh . ”
“ i gave gilead to makir .
your wives , your little children , and your cattle ( i know you have many cattle ) will stay here in the cities i have given you .
don ’ t fear the kings of these lands , because the lord your god will fight for you . ’
“ then i begged the lord to do something special for me . i said ,
please let me go across the jordan river and see the good land on the other side . let me see the beautiful hill country and lebanon . ’
“ so we stayed in the valley across from beth peor .
“ you have seen what the lord did at baal peor . the lord your god destroyed all your people who followed the false god baal at that place .
but all of you who stayed with the lord your god are alive today .
“ the lord our god is near when we ask him to help us . no other nation has a god like that !
and no other nation is great enough to have laws and rules as good as the teachings i give you today .
“ on the day the lord spoke to you from the fire at mount horeb , you did not see him—there was no shape for god .
or like an animal on the earth , or like a bird that flies in the sky .
and don ’ t make an idol that looks like anything that crawls on the ground or like a fish in the sea .
because the lord your god hates for his people to worship other gods . and he can be like a fire that destroys !
there you will serve gods made by men—things made of wood and stone that can not see or hear or eat or smell !
when you are in trouble—when all these things happen to you—then you will come back to the lord your god and obey him .
you people heard god speaking to you from a fire , and you are still alive . has that ever happened to anyone else ? no !
the lord showed you all this so that you would know that he is god . there is no other god like him .
then moses chose three cities on the east side of the jordan river .
any person who killed someone by accident and not out of hate could run away to one of these three cities and not be put to death .
moses gave god ’ s law to the israelites .
moses gave these teachings , laws , and rules to the people after they came out of egypt .
this land goes from aroer on the edge of the arnon valley all the way to mount sirion , that is , mount hermon .
the lord our god made an agreement with us at mount horeb .
the lord did not make this agreement with our ancestors , but with us—yes , with all of us who are alive here today .
the lord spoke with you face to face at that mountain . he spoke to you from the fire .
‘ i am the lord your god . i am the one who freed you from egypt , where you were slaves .
‘ you must not worship any other gods except me .
but i will be very kind to people who love me and obey my commands . i will be kind to their families for thousands of generations !
‘ you must not use the name of the lord your god to make empty promises . if you do , the lord will not let you go unpunished .
‘ you must keep the sabbath a special day like the lord your god commanded .
work six days a week and do your job ,
‘ you must not murder anyone .
‘ you must not commit the sin of adultery .
‘ you must not steal .
‘ you must not tell lies about other people .
no one has ever heard the living god speak from the fire like we have and still lived !
“ the lord heard what you said and told me , ‘ i heard what the people said . and that is fine .
“ ‘ go and tell the people to go back to their tents ,
“ so you people must be careful to do everything the lord commanded you . do not stop following god !
“ listen , people of israel ! the lord is our god . the lord is the only god .
you must love the lord your god with all your heart , with all your soul , and with all your strength .
always remember these commands that i give you today .
tie them on your hands and wear them on your foreheads to help you remember my teachings .
write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates .
“ but be careful ! don ’ t forget the lord . you were slaves in egypt , but he brought you out of the land of egypt .
respect the lord your god and serve only him . you must use only his name to make promises .
you must not follow other gods . you must not follow the gods of the people who live around you .
“ you must not test the lord your god like you tested him at massah .
you must be sure to obey the commands of the lord your god . you must follow all the teachings and laws he has given you .
and you will force out all your enemies , just as the lord said .
then you will say to them , ‘ we were pharaoh ’ s slaves in egypt , but the lord brought us out of egypt with his great power .
he brought us out of egypt so that he could give us the land that he promised our ancestors .
don ’ t marry any of them , and don ’ t let your sons or daughters marry any of the people from those other nations .
why did the lord love and choose you ? it was not because you are such a large nation . you had the fewest of all people !
but the lord punishes people who hate him . he will destroy them . he will not be slow to punish those who hate him .
so you must be careful to obey the commands , laws , and rules that i give you today .
“ you will be blessed more than all people . every husband and wife will be able to have children . your cows will be able to have calves .
“ don ’ t say in your heart , ‘ these nations are stronger than we are . how can we force them out ? ’
you must not be afraid of them . you must remember what the lord your god did to pharaoh and to all the people of egypt .
“ the lord your god will send the hornet against them . he will do this until he destroys all the people who escaped and tried to hide .
don ’ t be afraid of them , because the lord your god is with you . he is a great and awesome god .
but the lord your god will let you defeat those nations . he will confuse them in battle , until they are destroyed .
these past 40 years , your clothes did not wear out , and your feet did not swell .
you must remember that the lord your god teaches and corrects you as a father teaches and corrects his son .
“ you must obey the commands of the lord your god . follow him and respect him .
it is a land with wheat and barley , grapevines , fig trees , and pomegranates . it is a land with olive oil and honey .
you will have all you want to eat . then you will praise the lord your god for the good land he has given you .
“ be careful . don ’ t forget the lord your god ! be careful to obey the commands , laws , and rules that i give you today .
then you will have plenty to eat , and you will build good houses and live in them .
your cattle , sheep , and goats will grow large . you will get plenty of gold and silver . you will have plenty of everything .
don ’ t ever say to yourself , ‘ i got all this wealth by my own power and ability . ’
the lord is destroying other nations for you . but if you stop listening to the lord your god , you will be destroyed just like them !
you made the lord angry at mount horeb . the lord was angry enough to destroy you !
“ so at the end of 40 days and 40 nights , the lord gave me two stone tablets—the stones of the agreement .
“ the lord also said to me , ‘ i have watched these people . they are very stubborn !
so i took the two stone tablets and threw them down . there before your eyes i broke the stones into pieces .
i was afraid of the lord ’ s terrible anger . he was angry enough to destroy you , but the lord listened to me again .
the lord was very angry with aaron—enough to destroy him ! so i also prayed for aaron at that time .
“ also , at taberah , massah , and kibroth hattaavah you made the lord angry .
all the time that i have known you , you have refused to obey the lord .
“ so i bowed down before the lord 40 days and 40 nights , because the lord said he would destroy you .
but they are your people , lord . they belong to you . you brought them out of egypt with your great power and strength . ’
then the israelites went from moserah to gudgodah . and they went from gudgodah to jotbathah , a land of rivers .
so obey the laws and commands of the lord that i am giving you today . these laws and commands are for your own good .
“ stop being stubborn . give your hearts to god .
he defends widows and orphans . he loves even the strangers living among us . he gives them food and clothes .
so you must also love them , because you yourselves were strangers in the land of egypt .
“ you must respect the lord your god and worship only him . never leave him . when you make promises , you must use his name only .
“ so you must love the lord your god . you must do what he tells you to do and always obey his laws , rules , and commands .
it was you , not your children , who saw everything he did for you in the desert until you came to this place .
it was you , not your children , who saw all the great things the lord did .
the lord your god cares for that land . the lord your god watches over it , from the beginning to the end of the year .
and i will make grass grow in your fields for your cattle . you will have plenty to eat . ’
write these commands on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates .
“ today i am giving you a choice . you may choose the blessing or the curse .
you will get the blessing if you listen and obey the commands of the lord your god that i have told you today .
you must carefully obey all the laws and rules i give you today .
“ you must not worship the lord your god in the same way these people worship their gods .
“ you must not continue to worship the way we have been worshiping . until now each of us has been worshiping god any way we wanted .
this is because we have not yet entered the peaceful land that the lord your god is giving you .
be sure you don ’ t offer your burnt offerings in just any place you see .
the lord will choose his special place among your tribes . offer your burnt offerings and do everything else i told you only in that place .
but you must not eat the blood . you must pour the blood on the ground like water .
but be sure that you always share these meals with the levites . do this as long as you live in your land .
you may eat this meat the same as you would eat gazelle or deer meat . anyone can do this—people who are clean and people who are unclean .
don ’ t eat the blood . pour it out like water onto the ground .
so don ’ t eat blood . you must do what the lord says is right , and good things will happen to you and to your descendants .
“ a prophet or someone who explains dreams might come to you and tell you that they will show you a sign or a miracle .
they are the gods of the people who live in the other lands around you , some near and some far away . )
you must not agree with them . don ’ t listen to them or feel sorry for them . don ’ t let them go free or protect them .
then all the israelites will hear about it and be afraid . and they will not do those evil things any more .
“ the lord your god has given you cities to live in . sometimes you might hear some bad news about one of these cities . you might hear that
then you must kill all the people of that city and their animals too . you must destroy that city completely .
“ you are the children of the lord your god . when someone dies , you must not cut yourselves or shave your heads to show your sadness .
“ don ’ t eat anything that the lord hates .
you may eat these animals : cattle , sheep , goats ,
deer , gazelles , roe deer , wild sheep , wild goats , antelopes , and mountain sheep .
you may eat any animal that has hooves divided into two parts and that chews the cud .
“ you may eat any kind of fish that has fins and scales .
but don ’ t eat anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales . it is not a clean food for you .
“ you may eat any clean bird .
but don ’ t eat any of these birds : eagles , vultures , buzzards ,
red kites , falcons , any kind of kite ,
any kind of raven ,
horned owls , screech owls , sea gulls , any kind of hawk ,
little owls , great owls , white owls ,
desert owls , ospreys , cormorants ,
storks , any kind of heron , hoopoes , or bats .
“ all insects with wings are unclean , so don ’ t eat them .
but you may eat any clean bird .
“ every year you must be sure to save one-tenth of all the crops that grow in your fields .
sell that part of your crops and take the money with you to the special place the lord has chosen .
“ at the end of every three years , you must gather one-tenth of your harvest for that year . store this food in your towns .
“ at the end of every seven years , you must cancel debts .
you may require a foreigner to repay you , but you must cancel any debt another israelite owes you .
there should not be any poor people in your country , because the lord your god is giving you this land . and the lord will greatly bless you .
but this will happen only if you obey the lord your god . you must be careful to obey every command that i have told you today .
you must be willing to share with them . you must lend them whatever they need .
but when you let your slave go free , don ’ t send him away with nothing .
remember , you were slaves in egypt . and the lord your god set you free . so that is why i am giving you this command today .
but you must not eat the blood from the animal . you must pour the blood out on the ground like water .
“ you must not sacrifice the passover animal in any of the towns that the lord your god gives you .
you must cook the meal and eat it at the place the lord your god will choose . the next morning you may go back home .
“ you must count seven weeks from the time you begin to harvest the grain .
remember , you were slaves in egypt . so be sure to obey these laws .
“ seven days after you have gathered your harvest in from your threshing floor and from your winepress , you should celebrate the festival of shelters .
each man should give as much as he can . he should decide how much to give by thinking about how much the lord has given him .
you must not set up special stones for worshiping false gods . the lord your god hates them .
“ you must not sacrifice to the lord your god an ox or sheep that has anything wrong with it . the lord your god would hate that .
that they have worshiped other gods or maybe the sun , the moon or the stars . i never told you to do that !
you must go to the priests who are levites and to the judge on duty at that time . they will decide what to do about that problem .
you must accept their decision and follow their instructions exactly—don ’ t change anything !
all the people will hear about this punishment and be afraid . then they will not be stubborn anymore .
the tribe of levi will not get any share of land like the other tribes . their share is the lord himself , as he said to them .
this is because the lord your god looked at all your tribes and chose levi and his descendants to serve him as priests forever .
and this levite may serve in the name of the lord his god , the same as all his brother levites who are on duty before the lord .
and that levite will get an equal share with the other levites , in addition to the share his family normally gets .
you must be faithful to the lord your god , never doing anything he considers wrong .
“ the lord said to me , ‘ what they ask for is good .
this prophet will speak for me , and i will punish anyone who refuses to listen to my commands . ’
you might be thinking , ‘ how can we know if something a prophet says is not from the lord ? ’
that is why i commanded you to choose three special cities .
then innocent people will not be killed in the land that the lord your god is giving you . and you will not be guilty for any such deaths .
“ a witness might try to hurt another person by lying and saying that this person did wrong .
when the judges carefully ask their questions , they might find that the witness lied against the other person . if the witnesses tell lies ,
you must punish them with the same punishment the other person would have received . in this way you will remove this evil from your group .
other people will hear about this and be afraid , and people will not do evil things like that again .
“ when you go to the battle , the priest must go to the soldiers and speak to them .
the lord your god is going with you to help you fight against your enemies . he will help you win ! ’
then , after the officers have finished speaking to the army , they must choose captains to lead the soldiers .
“ when you go to attack a city , you must first offer peace to the people there .
if they accept your offer and open their gates , all the people in that city will become your slaves and be forced to work for you .
but if the city refuses to make peace with you and fights against you , you should surround the city .
and when the lord your god lets you take the city , you must kill all the men in it .
that is what you must do to all the cities that are very far from you—the cities that are not in the land where you will live .
“ but when you take cities in the land that the lord your god is giving you , you must kill everyone .
your leaders and judges must come out and measure the distance to the towns around the dead body .
all the leaders of the town nearest the dead body must wash their hands over the cow that had its neck broken in the valley .
these leaders must say , ‘ we did not kill this person , and we did not see it happen .
in this way you will remove that guilt from your group by doing what the lord said .
“ you might fight against your enemies , and the lord your god might let you defeat them and take them as captives .
you might see a beautiful woman among the captives who you want to be your wife .
you must then bring her into your house where she will shave her head and cut her nails .
when the man divides his property among his children , he can not give the rights of the firstborn to the son of his favorite wife .
his father and mother must then take him to the leaders of the town at the town meeting place .
“ a man might be guilty of a sin that must be punished by death . people might kill him and hang his body on a tree .
“ you must not plow with an ox and a donkey together .
“ you must not wear clothes made by weaving together wool and linen .
“ tie several pieces of thread together . then put these tassels on the four corners of the robes you wear .
“ a man might marry a woman and have sexual relations with her . then he might decide that he does not like her .
then the leaders of that town must take that man and punish him .
“ a man might meet a virgin girl engaged to another man . he might have sexual relations with her . if this happens in the city ,
“ but if a man finds an engaged girl out in the field and forces her to have sexual relations with him , only the man must die .
you must do nothing to the girl . she did nothing that deserves the punishment of death . this is like someone attacking their neighbor and killing them .
the man found the engaged girl out in the field and attacked her . maybe she called for help , but there was no one to help her .
“ a man might find a virgin girl who is not engaged and force her to have sexual relations with him . if other people see this happen ,
“ a man must not bring shame to his father by marrying his father ’ s wife .
“ a man with a crushed testicle or part of his sex organ cut off may not join with the men of israel to worship the lord .
you must never try to make peace with the ammonites or moabites . as long as you live , don ’ t be friendly to them .
“ you must not hate edomites , because they are your relatives . you must not hate egyptians , because you were a stranger in their land .
the children of the third generation born to the edomites and egyptians may join with the people of israel to worship the lord .
“ when your army goes to fight against your enemies , stay away from everything that would make you unclean .
then , when evening comes , the man must bathe himself in water . and when the sun goes down , he may come into the camp again .
“ you also must have a place outside the camp where people can go to relieve themselves .
“ if slaves run away and come to you , don ’ t force them to go back to their masters .
runaway slaves may live with you wherever they like in whatever city they choose . you must not trouble them .
“ an israelite man or woman must never become a temple prostitute .
if you don ’ t make a promise , you are not sinning .
when she has left his house , she may go and become another man ’ s wife .
remember what the lord your god did to miriam on your trip out of egypt .
“ when you give someone any kind of loan , you must not go into their house to get security .
you must stand outside . then the person who you gave the loan to will bring out the security to you .
if he is a poor man , then he might give the clothes that keep him warm . you must not keep that security overnight .
“ you must make sure that foreigners and orphans are treated fairly . and you must never take clothes from a widow as security .
remember you were poor slaves in egypt . that is why i tell you to do these things for the poor .
“ when two people have an argument , they should go to the court . the judges will decide which person is right and which is wrong .
don ’ t hit anyone more than 40 times during punishment , because more than that means that their life is not important to you .
“ when an animal is being used to separate grain , you must not cover its mouth to stop it from eating .
then the first son she has will be considered the dead man ’ s son in order to keep the dead man ’ s name alive in israel .
from then on , the brother ’ s family will be known in israel as , ‘ the family of the man whose sandal was removed . ’
if she does that , cut off her hand . don ’ t feel sorry for her .
“ don ’ t use weights that are too heavy or too light .
don ’ t keep measures in your house that are too large or too small .
the lord your god hates people who cheat with false weights and measures . yes , he hates all people who do wrong .
“ remember what the amalekites did to you when you were coming from egypt .
“ you will soon enter the land that the lord your god is giving you . you will take that land and live there .
“ then the priest will take the basket from you . he will put it down in front of the altar of the lord your god .
the egyptians treated us badly . they made us slaves . they hurt us and forced us to work very hard .
then the lord brought us out of egypt with his great power and strength . he used great miracles and wonders and did amazing things .
so he brought us to this place . he gave us this land—a land filled with many good things .
now , lord , i bring you the first harvest from the land that you gave me . ’
“ today the lord your god commands you to obey all these laws and rules . be careful to follow them with all your heart and soul .
moses and the elders of israel spoke to the people . moses said , “ obey all the commands that i give you today .
also , use some stones there to build an altar to the lord your god . don ’ t use iron tools to cut the stones .
you must not use cut stones to build the altar for the lord your god . offer burnt offerings on this altar to the lord your god .
and you must sacrifice and eat fellowship offerings there . eat and enjoy yourselves there together with the lord your god .
you must write all these teachings on the stones that you set up . write clearly so that they are easy to read . ”
so you must do everything that the lord your god tells you . you must obey his commands and his laws that i am giving you today . ”
that day moses also told the people ,
and these tribes will stand on mount ebal to read the curses : reuben , gad , asher , zebulun , dan , and naphtali .
“ and the levites will say to all the israelites in a loud voice :
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who does not show respect to their father or their mother ! ’
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who moves a neighbor ’ s landmark ! ’
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who tricks a blind man into going the wrong way ! ’
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who does not give fair judgment for the foreigners , orphans , and widows ! ’
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who shames his father by having sexual relations with his father ’ s wife . ’
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who has sexual relations with any kind of animal ! ’
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who has sexual relations with his sister or half sister ! ’
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who has sexual relations with his mother-in-law ! ’
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who kills anyone , even if he is not caught ! ’
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who takes money to kill an innocent person ! ’
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who does not support this law and agree to obey it . ’
if you will obey the lord your god , all these blessings will come to you and be yours :
“ he will bless you
he will bless your baskets and pans
he will bless you at all times
if you follow the lord your god and obey his commands , he will do what he promised . the lord will make you his own special people .
then all the people in that land will see that you are called to be the lord ’ s people , and they will be afraid of you .
“ the lord will curse you
he will curse you ,
he will curse you at all times
the lord will send you terrible diseases until you no longer exist , until you are completely gone from the land .
there will be no clouds in the sky—the sky will look like polished brass . and the ground under you will be hard like iron .
the lord will not send rain—only sand and dust will fall from the sky . it will come down on you until you are destroyed .
your dead bodies will be food for the wild birds and animals . there will be no one to scare them away from your dead bodies .
the lord will punish you by making you crazy . he will make you blind and confused .
“ a nation that you don ’ t know will take all your crops and everything you worked for . people will treat you badly and abuse you .
the things you see will make you go crazy .
“ your fields will produce plenty of grain . but your harvest will be small , because the locusts will eat your harvest .
you will have sons and daughters . but you will not be able to keep them , because they will be captured and taken away .
locusts will destroy all your trees and the crops in your fields .
the foreigners living among you will get more and more power , and you will lose the power you had .
these curses will show people that god judged you and your descendants forever . people will be amazed at the terrible things that happen to you .
“ the lord your god gave you many blessings . but you did not serve him with joy and a glad heart .
these people will be cruel . they will not care about old people or show mercy to young children .
he will bring on you all the diseases you saw in egypt that filled you with fear , and you will not be able to avoid them .
the lord will even bring troubles and diseases that are not written in this book of teachings . he will continue to do this until you are destroyed .
you will live with danger and always be afraid . you will be afraid night and day . you will never feel sure about your life .
you saw the great troubles he gave them . you saw the miracles and amazing things he did .
but even today , you still don ’ t understand what happened . the lord has not let you really understand what you saw and heard .
he led you through the desert for 40 years , and in all that time , your clothes and sandals did not wear out .
“ you came to this place , and king sihon of heshbon and king og of bashan came out to fight against us . but we defeated them .
then we took their land and gave it to the people in the tribes of reuben and gad and to half the tribe of manasseh .
if you obey all the commands in this agreement , you will continue to succeed in everything you do .
your wives and children are here and also the foreigners living among you—the people who cut your wood and bring you water .
you are all here to enter into an agreement with the lord your god . the lord your god is making this agreement with you today .
the lord is making this agreement with its promises with you people , but not only with you .
you remember how we lived in the land of egypt . and you remember how we traveled through the countries that were on our way here .
you saw their hated things—the idols they had made from wood , stone , silver , and gold .
“ all the other nations will ask , ‘ why did the lord do this to this land ? why was he so angry ? ’
the israelites started serving other gods—gods they never worshiped before . the lord told his people not to worship those gods .
that is why the lord became very angry with the people of this land . so he brought to them all the curses that are written in this book .
even if you were sent to the farthest parts of the earth , the lord your god will gather you from there and bring you back .
“ then the lord your god will make all these bad things happen to your enemies , who hate you and cause you trouble .
and you will again obey the lord . you will obey all his commands that i give you today .
“ this command that i give you today is not too hard for you . it is not a secret hidden in some far away land .
no , the word is very near to you . it is in your mouth and in your heart . so you can obey it .
“ today i have given you a choice between life and death , success and disaster .
but if you turn away from your god and refuse to listen , if you are led away to worship and serve other gods ,
then moses went and spoke these words to all the israelites .
“ the lord destroyed sihon and og . he destroyed those amorite kings and he will do the same thing for you again !
the lord will help you defeat these nations . but you must do to them everything i told you to do .
the lord appeared at the tent in a tall cloud . the tall cloud stood over the entrance of the tent .
and i will refuse to help them , because they have done evil and worshiped other gods .
so that same day moses wrote down the song and taught it to the israelites .
moses carefully wrote all these teachings in a book . when he finished ,
he gave a command to the levites . ( these men carry the lord ’ s box of the agreement . ) moses said ,
all the israelites were gathered together , and moses sang this whole song for them :
“ skies , listen and i will speak .
my teachings will come like the rain ,
“ the lord is the rock ,
and you are not really his children .
is this the way you repay the lord for all he has done for you ?
“ remember the days of the past .
god most high separated the people on earth
the lord chose his people to be his own .
“ the lord found them in the desert ,
like an eagle when she makes her young leave the nest to fly .
the lord alone led his people .
the lord helped them take control of the hill country .
he gave his people butter from the herd and milk from the flock .
“ but jeshurun became fat and kicked like a bull .
they made him jealous by worshiping other gods .
they offered sacrifices to demons—gods that are not god .
you people left the rock who made you ;
“ the lord saw this and became upset .
so he said , ‘ i will turn away from them ,
they made me jealous with things that are not really gods .
my anger will burn like a fire ,
“ ‘ i will bring troubles to the israelites .
they will become thin from hunger .
in the streets , soldiers will kill them .
“ ‘ i thought about destroying the israelites
but i know what their enemies would say .
“ they are foolish .
if they were wise ,
can one person chase away 1000 men ?
the ‘ rock ’ of our enemies is not strong like our rock .
their vines and fields will be destroyed
their wine is like the poison of deadly snakes .
“ the lord says , ‘ i am saving that punishment .
i will punish them for the bad things they did .
“ the lord will judge his people .
then the lord will say , ‘ where are the false gods ?
those false gods ate the fat of your sacrifices .
“ ‘ now , see that i , and only i , am god !
i raise my hand toward heaven and make this promise .
my enemies will be killed and taken as prisoners .
“ the whole world should be happy for god ’ s people !
moses and joshua son of nun came and sang all the words of this song for the israelites to hear .
when moses finished giving these teachings to the people ,
the lord spoke to moses that same day . he said ,
you will die on that mountain . you will go to be with your people , the same as your brother aaron died on mount hor .
so now you may see the land that i am giving to the israelites . but you can not go into that land . ”
this is the blessing that moses , the man of god , gave the israelites before he died :
“ the lord came from sinai ,
yes , the lord loves his people .
moses gave us the law .
at that time the israelites
“ let reuben live , and not die !
moses said this about judah :
moses said this about levi :
they were more loyal to you , lord , than to their own families .
they will teach your rules to jacob
“ lord , bless everything levi has .
moses said this about benjamin :
moses said this about joseph :
let the sun give them good fruit .
let the hills and ancient mountains
let the earth give its best to joseph .
joseph is like a powerful bull .
moses said this about zebulun :
they will call the people to their mountain .
moses said this about gad :
he chose the best part for himself .
moses said this about dan :
moses said this about naphtali :
moses said this about asher :
your gates will have locks made from iron and bronze .
“ there is no one like the god of israel !
so israel will live in safety .
israel , you are blessed .
he showed him all the land of naphtali , ephraim , and manasseh . he showed him all the land of judah as far as the mediterranean sea .
he showed moses the negev and the valley that goes from zoar to jericho , the city of palm trees .
then moses , the lord ’ s servant , died there in the land of moab . the lord had told moses this would happen .
he buried moses in moab . this was in the valley across from beth peor . but even today , no one knows exactly where moses ’ grave is .
moses was 120 years old when he died . he was as strong as ever , and his eyes were still good .
the israelites cried for moses for 30 days . they stayed in the jordan valley in moab until the time of sadness was finished .
israel never had another prophet like moses : the lord knew moses face to face .
the lord sent moses to do powerful miracles in the land of egypt . pharaoh , all his officers , and all the people in egypt saw those miracles .
no other prophet ever did as many powerful and amazing things as moses did for the israelites to see .
these are the words from the teacher , a son of david and king of jerusalem .
everything is so meaningless . the teacher says that it is all a waste of time !
do people really gain anything from all the hard work they do in this life ?
people live and people die , but the earth continues forever .
the sun rises and the sun goes down , and then it hurries to rise again in the same place .
all rivers flow again and again to the same place . they all flow to the sea , but the sea never becomes full .
someone might say , “ look , this is new , ” but that thing has always been here . it was here before we were .
i , the teacher , was king over israel in jerusalem .
i looked at everything done on earth , and i saw that it is all a waste of time . it is like trying to catch the wind .
if something is crooked , you can not say it is straight . and if something is missing , you can not say it is there .
with much wisdom comes frustration . the one who gains more wisdom also gains more sorrow .
i said to myself , “ i should have fun—i should enjoy everything as much as i can. ” but i learned that this is also useless .
it is foolish to laugh all the time . having fun does not do any good .
then i began doing great things . i built houses , and i planted vineyards for myself .
i planted gardens , and i made parks . i planted all kinds of fruit trees .
i made pools of water for myself , and i used them to water my growing trees .
i became very rich and famous . i was greater than anyone who lived in jerusalem before me . my wisdom was always there to help me .
i saw that wisdom is better than foolishness in the same way that light is better than darkness .
wise people use their minds like eyes to see where they are going . but for fools , it is as if they are walking in the dark .
this made me hate life . it was depressing to think that everything in this life is useless , like trying to catch the wind .
so i became sad about all the work i had done .
what do people really have after all their work and struggling in this life ?
there is a right time for everything , and everything on earth will happen at the right time .
there is a time to be born
there is a time to kill
there is a time to cry
there is a time to throw weapons down
there is a time to look for something
there is a time to tear cloth
there is a time to love
do people really gain anything from their hard work ?
i saw all the hard work god gave us to do .
i learned that the best thing for people to do is to be happy and enjoy themselves as long as they live .
god wants everyone to eat , drink , and enjoy their work . these are gifts from god .
what happened in the past has happened , and what will happen in the future will happen . but god wants to help those who have been treated badly .
i also saw these things in this life : i saw that the courts should be filled with goodness and fairness , but there is evil there now .
i thought about what people do to each other . and i said to myself , “ god wants people to see that they are like animals .
i decided that it is better for those who have died than for those who are still alive .
and it is even better for those who die at birth , because they never saw the evil that is done in this world .
some people say , “ it is foolish to fold your hands and do nothing . if you don ’ t work , you will starve to death . ”
maybe that is true . but i say it is better to be satisfied with the few things you have than to always be struggling to get more .
again i saw something else that didn ’ t make sense :
two people are better than one . when two people work together , they get more work done .
if one person falls , the other person can reach out to help . but those who are alone when they fall have no one to help them .
if two people sleep together , they will be warm . but a person sleeping alone will not be warm .
a young leader who is poor but wise is better than a king who is old but foolish . that old king does not listen to warnings .
maybe the young ruler was born a poor man in the kingdom . and maybe he came from prison to rule the country .
but i have watched people in this life , and i know this : people will follow that young man . he will become the new king .
bad dreams come from too many worries ,
it is better to promise nothing than to promise something and not be able to do it .
you should not let your useless dreams and bragging bring you trouble . you should respect god .
even the king is a slave—his country owns him .
there is a very sad thing that i have seen happen in this life . people save their money for the future .
then something bad happens and they lose everything . so they have nothing to give to their children .
it is very sad that people leave the world just as they came . so what does a person gain from “ trying to catch the wind ” ?
they only get days that are filled with sadness and sorrow . in the end , they are troubled , sick , and angry .
i have seen another thing in this life that is not fair and is very hard to understand .
it is senseless when a baby is born dead . the baby is quickly buried in a dark grave , without even a name .
the baby never saw the sun and never knew anything . but the baby finds more rest than the man who never enjoyed what god gave him .
people work and work to feed themselves , but they are never satisfied .
a good reputation is better than expensive pleasures .
it is better to go to a funeral than to a party ,
sorrow is even better than laughter ,
a wise person thinks about death ,
it is better to be criticized by the wise
the laughter of fools is such a waste .
even the wise will forget their wisdom ,
it is better to finish something
don ’ t become angry quickly ,
don ’ t say , “ life was better in the ‘ good old days . ’
wisdom is better if you also have property . wise people will get more than enough wealth .
wisdom and money can protect you . but knowledge gained through wisdom is even better—it can save your life .
look at what god has made . you can not change a thing , even if you think it is wrong .
in my short life , i have seen everything . i have seen good people die young , and i have seen evil people live long lives .
try to be a little of this and a little of that . even god ’ s followers will do some good things and some bad things .
surely there is no one on earth who always does good and never sins . but wisdom can make one person stronger than ten leaders in a city .
don ’ t listen to everything people say . you might hear your own servant saying bad things about you .
and you know that many times you too have said bad things about other people .
i used my wisdom and thought about all these things . i wanted to be wise , but i couldn ’ t do it .
i can not understand why things are as they are . it is too hard for anyone to understand .
i studied and i tried very hard to find true wisdom . i tried to find a reason for everything .
“ there is one other thing i have learned . god made people good , but they have found many ways to be bad . ”
no one can understand and explain things the way wise people can . their wisdom makes them happy . it changes a sad face into a happy one .
i say you should always obey the king ’ s command . do this because you made a promise to god .
he has the authority to give commands , and no one can tell him what to do .
there is a right time and a right way to do everything . you must decide what you should do , even when it might cause problems
and you are not sure what will happen . no one can tell you what will happen in the future .
a sinner might do a hundred evil things and still live a long time . but i know that it is still better to obey and respect god .
i carefully studied the things people do in this life . i saw how busy people are . they work day and night , and they almost never sleep .
there is hope for those who are still alive—it does not matter who they are . but this saying is true :
the living know that they will die , but the dead don ’ t know anything . they have no more reward . people will soon forget them .
after people are dead , their love , hate , and jealousy are all gone . and they will never again share in what happens on earth .
so go and eat your food now and enjoy it . drink your wine and be happy . it is all right with god if you do these things .
wear nice clothes and make yourself look good .
i also saw a person doing a wise thing in this life , and it seemed very important to me .
there was a small town with a few people in it . a great king fought against that town and put his armies all around it .
words spoken by the wise are heard more clearly
wisdom is better than weapons of war ,
a few dead flies will make even the best perfume stink . in the same way , a little foolishness can ruin much wisdom and honor .
the thoughts of the wise lead them the right way , but the thoughts of the foolish lead them the wrong way .
fools show how foolish they are , just walking down the road . their minds are empty , and everyone knows it .
don ’ t quit your job simply because the boss is angry with you . if you remain calm and helpful , you can correct even great mistakes .
here is something else that i have seen in this life that isn ’ t fair . it is the kind of mistake that rulers make .
fools are given important positions , while the rich get jobs that are not important .
i have seen servants riding on horses , while rulers were walking beside them like slaves .
if you dig a hole , you might fall into it . if you break down a wall , you might be bitten by a snake .
someone might know how to control snakes . but that skill is useless if a snake bites when that person is not around .
words from the wise bring praise ,
fools begin by saying something foolish . but in the end , they speak nonsense .
fools are always talking about what they will do , but you never know what will happen . people can not tell what will happen in the future .
fools aren ’ t smart enough to find their way home ,
if someone is too lazy to work ,
people enjoy eating , and wine makes life happier . but money solves a lot of problems .
do good wherever you go . after a while , the good you do will come back to you .
invest what you have in several different things . you don ’ t know what bad things might happen on earth .
it is good to be alive . it is nice to see the light from the sun .
remember your creator while you are young , before the bad times come—before the years come when you say , “ i have wasted my life . ”
remember your creator while you are young ,
your body came from the earth .
everything is so meaningless . the teacher says that it is all a waste of time !
the teacher was very wise . he used his wisdom to teach the people . he very carefully studied and arranged many wise teachings .
the teacher tried very hard to find the right words , and he wrote the teachings that are true and dependable .
greetings from paul , an apostle of christ jesus . i am an apostle because that is what god wanted .
grace and peace to you from god our father and the lord jesus christ .
praise be to the god and father of our lord jesus christ . in christ , god has given us every spiritual blessing in heaven .
in christ we are made free by his blood sacrifice . we have forgiveness of sins because of god ’ s rich grace .
god gave us that grace fully and freely . with full wisdom and understanding
he let us know his secret plan . this was what god wanted , and he planned to do it through christ .
we jews were the first to hope in christ . and we were chosen so that we would bring praise to god in all his glory .
and you will know that god ’ s power is very great for us who believe . it is the same as the mighty power
he used to raise christ from death and put him at his right side in the heavenly places .
god put everything under christ ’ s power and made him head over everything for the church .
the church is christ ’ s body . it is filled with him . he makes everything complete in every way .
in the past you were spiritually dead because of your sins and the things you did against god .
but god is rich in mercy , and he loved us very much .
yes , it is because we are a part of christ jesus that god raised us from death and seated us together with him in the heavenly places .
god did this so that his kindness to us who belong to christ jesus would clearly show for all time to come the amazing richness of his grace .
i mean that you have been saved by grace because you believed . you did not save yourselves ; it was a gift from god .
you are not saved by the things you have done , so there is nothing to boast about .
yes , through christ we all have the right to come to the father in one spirit .
the whole building is joined together in christ , and he makes it grow and become a holy temple in the lord .
and in christ you are being built together with his other people . you are being made into a place where god lives through the spirit .
so i , paul , am a prisoner because i serve christ jesus for you who are not jews .
surely you know that god gave me this work through his grace to help you .
god let me know his secret plan by showing it to me . i have already written a little about this .
and if you read what i wrote , you can see that i understand the secret truth about christ .
by god ’ s special gift of grace , i became a servant to tell that good news . he gave me that grace by using his power .
this agrees with the plan god had since the beginning of time . he did what he planned , and he did it through christ jesus our lord .
in christ we come before god with freedom and without fear . we can do this because of our faith in christ .
so i ask you not to be discouraged because of what is happening to me . my sufferings are for your benefit—for your honor and glory .
so i bow in prayer before the father .
every family in heaven and on earth gets its true name from him .
i ask the father with his great glory to give you the power to be strong in your spirits . he will give you that strength through his spirit .
i pray that christ will live in your hearts because of your faith . i pray that your life will be strong in love and be built on love .
with god ’ s power working in us , he can do much , much more than anything we can ask or think of .
to him be glory in the church and in christ jesus for all time , forever and ever . amen .
always be humble and gentle . be patient and accept each other with love .
you are joined together with peace through the spirit . do all you can to continue as you are , letting peace hold you together .
there is one body and one spirit , and god chose you to have one hope .
there is one lord , one faith , and one baptism .
there is one god and father of us all , who rules over everyone . he works through all of us and in all of us .
christ gave each one of us a special gift . everyone received what he wanted to give them .
that is why the scriptures say ,
when it says , “ he went up , ” what does it mean ? it means that he first came down low to earth .
so christ came down , and he is the same one who went up . he went up above the highest heaven in order to fill everything with himself .
christ gave these gifts to prepare god ’ s holy people for the work of serving , to make the body of christ stronger .
no , we will speak the truth with love . we will grow to be like christ in every way . he is the head ,
they have no understanding , and they know nothing because they refuse to listen . so they can not have the life that god gives .
they have lost their feeling of shame and use their lives to do what is morally wrong . more and more they want to do all kinds of evil .
but that way of life is nothing like what you learned when you came to know christ .
i know that you heard about him , and in him you were taught the truth . yes , the truth is in jesus .
you must be made new in your hearts and in your thinking .
be that new person who was made to be like god , truly good and pleasing to him .
“ when you are angry , don ’ t let that anger make you sin , ” and don ’ t stay angry all day .
don ’ t give the devil a way to defeat you .
never be bitter , angry , or mad . never shout angrily or say things to hurt others . never do anything evil .
be kind and loving to each other . forgive each other the same as god forgave you through christ .
you are god ’ s dear children , so try to be like him .
live a life of love . love others just as christ loved us . he gave himself for us—a sweet-smelling offering and sacrifice to god .
don ’ t let anyone fool you with words that are not true . god gets very angry when people who don ’ t obey him talk like that .
so don ’ t have anything to do with them .
in the past you were full of darkness , but now you are full of light in the lord . so live like children who belong to the light .
this light produces every kind of goodness , right living , and truth .
try to learn what pleases the lord .
have no part in the things that people in darkness do , which produce nothing good . instead , tell everyone how wrong those things are .
actually , it is shameful to even talk about the things those people do in secret .
but the light makes clear how wrong those things are .
yes , everything is made clear by the light . this is why we say ,
so be very careful how you live . live wisely , not like fools .
i mean that you should use every opportunity you have for doing good , because these are evil times .
so don ’ t be foolish with your lives , but learn what the lord wants you to do .
don ’ t be drunk with wine , which will ruin your life , but be filled with the spirit .
encourage each other with psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs . sing and make music in your hearts to the lord .
always give thanks to god the father for everything in the name of our lord jesus christ .
be willing to serve each other out of respect for christ .
wives , be willing to serve your husbands the same as the lord .
the church serves under christ , so it is the same with you wives . you should be willing to serve your husbands in everything .
husbands , love your wives the same as christ loved the church and gave his life for it .
he died to make the church holy . he used the telling of the good news to make the church clean by washing it with water .
and husbands should love their wives like that . they should love their wives as they love their own bodies . the man who loves his wife loves himself ,
because no one ever hates his own body , but feeds and takes care of it . and that is what christ does for the church
because we are parts of his body .
the scriptures say , “ that is why a man will leave his father and mother and join his wife , and the two people will become one . ”
that secret truth is very important—i am talking about christ and the church .
but each one of you must love his wife as he loves himself . and a wife must respect her husband .
children , obey your parents the way the lord wants , because this is the right thing to do .
the command says , “ you must respect your father and mother. ” this is the first command that has a promise with it .
and this is the promise : “ then all will go well with you , and you will have a long life on the earth . ”
fathers , don ’ t make your children angry , but raise them with the kind of teaching and training you learn from the lord .
slaves , obey your masters here on earth with fear and respect . and do this with a heart that is true , just as you obey christ .
do your work , and be happy to do it . work as though it is the lord you are serving , not just an earthly master .
remember that the lord will give everyone a reward for doing good . everyone , slave or free , will get a reward for the good things they do .
to end my letter i tell you , be strong in the lord and in his great power .
wear the full armor of god . wear god ’ s armor so that you can fight against the devil ’ s clever tricks .
so stand strong with the belt of truth tied around your waist , and on your chest wear the protection of right living .
on your feet wear the good news of peace to help you stand strong .
and also use the shield of faith with which you can stop all the burning arrows that come from the evil one .
accept god ’ s salvation as your helmet . and take the sword of the spirit—that sword is the teaching of god .
also pray for me—that when i speak , god will give me words so that i can tell the secret truth about the good news without fear .
that ’ s why i am sending him—to let you know how we are and to encourage you .
i pray that god the father and the lord jesus christ will give peace and love with faith to all the brothers and sisters there .
god ’ s grace to all of you who love our lord jesus christ with love that never ends .
this is what happened during the time when xerxes was king . xerxes ruled over the 127 provinces from india to ethiopia .
king xerxes ruled from his throne in the capital city of susa .
wine was served in golden cups , and every cup was different . there was plenty of the king ’ s wine , because the king was very generous .
queen vashti also gave a party for the women in the king ’ s palace .
but when the eunuchs told queen vashti about the king ’ s command , she refused to come . then the king was very angry .
the king and his important officials were happy with this advice , so king xerxes did as memucan suggested .
later , king xerxes stopped being angry . then he remembered vashti and what she had done . he remembered his commands about her .
then the king ’ s personal servants had a suggestion . they said , “ search for beautiful young virgins for the king .
mordecai had been carried into captivity from jerusalem by king nebuchadnezzar of babylon . he was with the group that was taken into captivity with king jehoiachin of judah .
esther didn ’ t tell anyone she was a jew . she didn ’ t tell anyone about her family background , because mordecai had told her not to .
when her time came to go in to the king , she could choose to wear or take whatever she wanted from the women ’ s living area .
mordecai was sitting next to the king ’ s gate at the time the young women were gathered together the second time .
when haman saw that mordecai refused to bow down to him or give him honor , he was very angry .
so the king took the official ring off his finger and gave it to haman son of hammedatha the agagite . haman was the enemy of the jews .
then the king said to haman , “ keep the money . do what you want with them . ”
but mordecai went only as far as the king ’ s gate . no one was allowed to enter the gate dressed in sackcloth .
so hathach went out to where mordecai was in the open place of the city in front of the king ’ s gate .
hathach went back and told esther everything mordecai had said .
then esther told hathach to say this to mordecai :
so mordecai went away and did everything esther told him to do .
esther said , “ i have prepared a party for you and haman . will you and haman please come to the party today ? ”
then the king said , “ bring haman quickly so that we may do what esther asks . ”
esther answered , “ this is what i want to ask for :
but haman controlled his anger and went home . then haman called together his friends and his wife , zeresh .
but all this means nothing to me . i can not be happy as long as i see that jew mordecai sitting at the king ’ s gate . ”
then the king asked , “ what honor and good things have been given to mordecai for this ? ”
the king ’ s servants said , “ haman is standing in the courtyard . ”
so haman answered the king , “ do this for the man the king loves to honor :
after that mordecai went back to the king ’ s gate , but haman hurried home with his head covered because he was embarrassed and ashamed .
so the king and haman went to eat with queen esther .
then king xerxes asked queen esther , “ who did this to you ? where is the man who dared to do such a thing to your people ? ”
esther said , “ the man against us , our enemy , is this wicked haman . ”
so they hanged haman on the hanging post he had built for mordecai . then the king stopped being angry .
then the king held out the gold scepter to esther . esther got up and stood in front of the king .
it was an especially happy day for the jews , a day of great joy and happiness .
the jews defeated all their enemies . they used swords to kill and destroy them . they did what they wanted to the people who hated them .
they killed and destroyed 500 men in the capital city of susa .
they also killed these men : parshandatha , dalphon , aspatha ,
poratha , adalia , aridatha ,
parmashta , arisai , aridai , and vaizatha .
that day the king heard how many men had been killed in the capital city of susa .
so the king gave the command that it should be done . so the law was given in susa , and they hanged haman ’ s ten sons .
this happened on the 13th day of the month adar . on the 14th day the jews rested and made that day a happy day of feasting .
he did this to tell the jews to celebrate purim every year on the 14th and 15th days of the month of adar .
so the jews agreed to do what mordecai had written to them . and they agreed to continue the celebration they had begun .
esther ’ s letter made the rules for purim official , and these things were written down in a book .
king xerxes made people pay taxes . all the people in the kingdom , even the faraway cities on the seacoast , had to pay taxes .
when jacob ( israel ) went to egypt , his sons and their families went with him . here are the names of those sons :
reuben , simeon , levi , judah ,
issachar , zebulun , benjamin ,
dan , naphtali , gad , and asher .
another son , joseph , was already in egypt . so jacob ’ s whole family was with him in egypt—70 descendants in all .
later , joseph , his brothers , and all the people of that generation died .
but the israelites had many children , and their number grew until the country of egypt was filled with them .
then a new king began to rule egypt . he did not know joseph .
this king said to his people , “ look at the israelites . there are too many of them , and they are stronger than we are !
so the egyptians made them work even harder .
there were two hebrew nurses who helped the israelite women give birth . they were named shiphrah and puah . the king of egypt said to the nurses ,
but the nurses trusted god , so they did not obey the king ’ s command . they let all the baby boys live .
the king of egypt called for the nurses and asked them , “ why did you do this ? why did you let the baby boys live ? ”
the nurses trusted god , so he was good to them and allowed them to have their own families .
there was a man from the family of levi who decided to marry a woman from the tribe of levi .
she became pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy . the mother saw how beautiful the baby was and hid him for three months .
the baby ’ s sister stayed and watched to see what would happen to the baby .
the king ’ s daughter said , “ yes , please . ”
moses looked around and saw that no one was watching , so he killed the egyptian and buried him in the sand .
pharaoh heard about what moses did , so he decided to kill him . but moses ran away from pharaoh and went to the land of midian .
then they went back to their father , reuel . he asked them , “ why have you come home early today ? ”
the girls answered , “ the shepherds chased us away , but an egyptian rescued us . he got water for us and gave it to our animals . ”
so reuel said to his daughters , “ where is this man ? why did you leave him ? go invite him to eat with us . ”
moses was happy to stay with that man . reuel let moses marry his daughter , zipporah .
zipporah became pregnant and had a son . moses named him gershom because moses was a stranger in a land that was not his own .
god heard their painful cries and remembered the agreement he made with abraham , isaac , and jacob .
god saw the troubles of the israelites , and he knew that he would soon help them .
on that mountain , moses saw the angel of the lord in a burning bush .
so he decided to go closer to the bush and see how a bush could continue burning without being burned up .
the lord saw moses was coming to look at the bush . so he called to him from the bush . he said , “ moses , moses ! ”
then god said , “ don ’ t come any closer . take off your sandals . you are standing on holy ground .
i am the god of your ancestors . i am the god of abraham , the god of isaac , and the god of jacob . ”
i have heard the cries of the israelites , and i have seen the way the egyptians have made life hard for them .
so now i am sending you to pharaoh . go ! lead my people , the israelites , out of egypt . ”
“ but i know that the pharaoh will not let you go . only a great power will force him to let you go ,
and i will cause the egyptians to be kind to the israelites . they will give many gifts to your people when they leave egypt .
but the lord said to moses , “ what is that you have in your hand ? ”
then god said , “ throw your walking stick on the ground . ”
but the lord said to him , “ reach out and grab the snake by its tail . ”
then the lord said to moses , “ i will give you another proof . put your hand under your robe . ”
so go . i will be with you when you speak . i will give you the words to say . ”
but moses said , “ my lord , i beg you to send someone else , not me . ”
so aaron will speak for you . like god , you will speak to him , and he will tell the people what you say .
so go and carry your walking stick with you . use it and the other miracles to show the people that i am with you . ”
so moses put his wife and children on the donkey and returned to egypt . he carried his walking stick with him—the walking stick with the power of god .
then you should say to pharaoh , ‘ this is what the lord says : israel is my firstborn son .
on the way to egypt , moses stopped at a place to spend the night . the lord met moses at that place and tried to kill him .
zipporah said this because she had to circumcise her son . so god let moses live .
moses told aaron everything the lord had commanded him to say and all the miracles he must do to prove that god had sent him .
so moses and aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the israelites .
then aaron spoke to the people and told them everything the lord had told moses . then moses did the miracles for all the people to see ,
but pharaoh said to them , “ moses and aaron , you are bothering the workers . let them do their work . go back to your own work !
there are very many workers , and you are keeping them from doing their jobs . ”
that same day pharaoh gave a command to the slave masters and hebrew foremen .
so make these people work harder . keep them busy . then they will not have enough time to listen to the lies of moses . ”
you must go and get the straw for yourselves . so go and find straw , but you must still make as many bricks as you made before . ”
so the people went everywhere in egypt looking for straw .
the slave masters forced the people to work even harder . they forced the people to make as many bricks as before .
then the hebrew foremen went to pharaoh . they complained and said , “ we are your servants . why are you treating us like this ?
now , go back to work ! we will not give you any straw . and you must still make as many bricks as you did before . ”
the hebrew foremen knew they were in trouble , because the pharaoh had told them , “ you must still make as many bricks as you made before . ”
when they were leaving the meeting with pharaoh , they passed moses and aaron . moses and aaron were waiting for them .
then moses prayed to the lord and said , “ lord , why have you done this terrible thing to your people ? why did you send me here ?
then god said to moses , “ i am the lord .
i appeared to abraham , isaac , and jacob . they called me god all-powerful . they did not know my name , the lord .
i made an agreement with them . i promised to give them the land of canaan . they lived in that land , but it was not their own .
now , i have heard their painful cries . i know that they are slaves in egypt . and i remember my agreement .
so moses told this to the israelites , but the people would not listen to him . they were working so hard that they were not patient with moses .
then the lord said to moses ,
“ go tell pharaoh that he must let the israelites leave his land . ”
these are the names of the leaders of the families of israel :
simeon ’ s sons were jemuel , jamin , ohad , jakin , zohar , and shaul . ( shaul was the son from a canaanite woman ) .
levi lived 137 years . his sons were gershon , kohath , and merari .
gershon had two sons , libni and shimei .
kohath lived 133 years . his sons were amram , izhar , hebron , and uzziel .
merari ’ s sons were mahli and mushi .
amram lived 137 years . he married his father ’ s sister , jochebed . amram and jochebed gave birth to aaron and moses .
izhar ’ s sons were korah , nepheg , and zicri .
uzziel ’ s sons were mishael , elzaphan , and sithri .
the sons of korah ( that is , the ancestors of the korahites ) were assir , elkanah , and abiasaph .
aaron ’ s son , eleazar , married a daughter of putiel . she gave birth to phinehas .
aaron and moses are the men who talked to pharaoh , the king of egypt , and told him to let the israelites leave egypt .
the lord spoke to moses again in the land of egypt .
he said , “ i am the lord . tell the king of egypt everything i tell you . ”
you will tell aaron everything that i command you . then he will tell the king what i say . and pharaoh will let the israelites leave this country .
i will punish the people of egypt , and they will learn that i am the lord . then i will lead my people out of their country . ”
moses and aaron did what the lord told them .
moses was 80 years old at the time , and aaron was 83 .
the lord said to moses and aaron ,
so pharaoh called for his wise men and magicians . these men used their magic , and they were able to do the same thing as aaron .
they threw their walking sticks on the ground , and their sticks became snakes . but then aaron ’ s walking stick ate theirs .
pharaoh still refused to let the people go , just as the lord had said . pharaoh refused to listen to moses and aaron .
then the lord said to moses , “ pharaoh is being stubborn . he refuses to let the people go .
the magicians used their magic to do the same thing . so pharaoh refused to listen to moses and aaron . this happened just as the lord said .
pharaoh ignored what moses and aaron had done . he turned and went into his house .
the egyptians could not drink the water from the river , so they dug wells around the river for water to drink .
seven days passed after the lord changed the nile river .
then the lord told moses , “ go to pharaoh and tell him that the lord says , ‘ let my people go to worship me !
if you refuse to let my people go , then i will fill egypt with frogs .
the frogs will be all over you , your people , and your officials . ’ ”
so aaron raised his hand over the waters of egypt , and the frogs began coming out of the water and covered the land of egypt .
the magicians used their magic to do the same thing—so even more frogs came out onto the land in egypt !
pharaoh said , “ tomorrow . ”
the frogs will leave you , your house , your officials , and your people . they will remain only in the river . ”
moses and aaron left pharaoh . moses prayed to the lord about the frogs he had sent against pharaoh .
and the lord did what moses asked . the frogs died in the houses , in the yards , and in the fields .
they began to rot , and the whole country began to stink .
so the magicians told pharaoh that the power of god did this . but pharaoh refused to listen to them . this happened just as the lord had said .
so tomorrow i will treat my people differently from your people . this will be my proof . ’ ”
so pharaoh called for moses and aaron and told them , “ offer sacrifices to your god here in this country . ”
let us go three days into the desert and offer sacrifices to the lord our god . this is what he told us to do . ”
so moses left pharaoh and prayed to the lord .
and the lord did what moses asked . he removed the flies from pharaoh , his officials , and his people . none of the flies remained .
but pharaoh again became stubborn and did not let the people go .
if you continue to hold them and refuse to let them go ,
but the lord will treat israel ’ s animals differently from the animals of egypt . none of the animals that belong to the israelites will die .
the lord has set the time for this to happen . he said , ‘ tomorrow the lord will make this happen in this country . ’ ”
the magicians could not stop moses from doing this , because even the magicians had the sores . this happened everywhere in egypt .
but the lord made pharaoh stubborn , so he refused to listen to moses and aaron , just as the lord had said .
i could use my power and cause a disease that would wipe you and your people off the earth .
you are still against my people . you are not letting them go free .
some of pharaoh ’ s officials paid attention to the lord ’ s message . they quickly put all of their animals and slaves into houses .
but other people ignored the lord ’ s message and lost all their slaves and animals that were in the fields .
the hail was falling , and lightning was flashing all through it . it was the worst hailstorm that had ever hit egypt since it had become a nation .
the only place that did not get hail was the land of goshen , where the israelites lived .
pharaoh sent for moses and aaron and told them , “ this time i have sinned . the lord is right , and i and my people are wrong .
but i know that you and your officials don ’ t really fear and respect the lord yet . ”
the flax had already developed its seeds , and the barley was already blooming . so these plants were destroyed .
but wheat and spelt ripen later than the other grains , so these plants were not destroyed .
when pharaoh saw that the rain , hail , and thunder had stopped , he again did wrong . he and his officials became stubborn again .
pharaoh refused to let the israelites go free , just as the lord had said through moses .
if you refuse to let my people go , then tomorrow i will bring locusts into your country .
pharaoh quickly called for moses and aaron . pharaoh said , “ i have sinned against the lord your god and against you .
now , forgive me for my sins this time . ask the lord to remove this ‘ death ’ from me . ”
moses left pharaoh and prayed to the lord .
but the lord caused pharaoh to be stubborn again , and pharaoh did not let the israelites go .
then the lord told moses , “ raise your hand into the air and darkness will cover egypt . it will be so dark you can feel it ! ”
so moses raised his hand into the air and a cloud of darkness covered egypt . the darkness stayed in egypt for three days .
the lord made pharaoh stubborn again , so he refused to let them go .
then moses told pharaoh , “ you are right about one thing . i will not come to see you again . ”
moses said to the king , “ the lord says , ‘ at midnight tonight , i will go through egypt ,
the crying in egypt will be worse than at any time in the past or any time in the future .
then the lord told moses , “ the reason pharaoh did not listen to you is so that i could show my great power in egypt . ”
while moses and aaron were still in egypt , the lord spoke to them . he said ,
“ this month will be the first month of the year for you .
this command is for the whole community of israel : on the tenth day of this month each man must get one lamb for the people in his house .
the lamb must be a one-year-old male , and it must be completely healthy . this animal can be either a young sheep or a young goat .
you must collect the blood from these animals and put it on the top and sides of the doorframe of every house where the people eat this meal .
“ on this night you must roast the lamb and eat all the meat . you must also eat bitter herbs and bread made without yeast .
you must eat all the meat that night . if any of the meat is left until morning , you must burn it in the fire .
“ you will always remember tonight—it will be a special festival for you . your descendants will honor the lord with this festival forever .
during this festival you must not eat any yeast . you must eat bread without yeast wherever you live . ”
so moses called all the elders together and told them , “ get the lambs for your families . kill the lambs for the passover .
you must remember this command . this law is for you and your descendants forever .
you must remember to do this even when you go to the land the lord is giving you .
when your children ask you , ‘ why are we doing this ceremony ? ’
the lord had given this command to moses and aaron , so the israelites did what the lord commanded .
that night someone died in every house in egypt . pharaoh , his officials , and all the people of egypt began to cry loudly .
take all of your sheep and cattle with you , just as you said you would . go ! and say a blessing for me too . ”
the people of egypt also asked them to hurry and leave . they said , “ if you don ’ t leave , we will all die ! ”
the israelites did not have time to put the yeast in their bread . they just wrapped the bowls of dough with cloth and carried them on their shoulders .
then the israelites did what moses asked them to do . they went to their egyptian neighbors and asked for clothing and things made from silver and gold .
the lord caused the egyptians to be kind to the israelites , so the egyptians gave their riches to the israelites .
the israelites traveled from rameses to succoth . there were about 600,000 men , not counting the small boys .
a great number of people who were not israelites went with them , along with many sheep , cattle , and other livestock .
the israelites had lived in egypt for 430 years .
after 430 years , to the very day , all the armies of the lord left egypt .
the lord told moses and aaron , “ these are the rules for passover : no foreigner is allowed to eat the passover meal .
the whole community of israel must do this ceremony .
the same rules are for everyone . it doesn ’ t matter if they are citizens or foreigners living among you . ”
so all the israelites obeyed the commands that the lord gave to moses and aaron .
on that same day the lord led all the israelites out of the country of egypt . the people left in groups .
then the lord said to moses ,
today , in the month of abib , you are leaving egypt .
“ for seven days , you must eat only bread without yeast . on the seventh day there will be a great festival to show honor to the lord .
so for seven days , you must not eat any bread made with yeast . there must be no bread with yeast any place in your land .
on this day you should tell your children , ‘ we are having this festival because the lord took me out of egypt . ’
so remember this festival every year at the right time .
you must remember to give the lord every firstborn boy . and every male animal that is the firstborn must also be given to the lord .
so god led them another way through the desert by the red sea . the israelites were dressed for war when they left egypt .
the israelites left succoth and camped at etham . etham was near the desert .
the cloud was always with them during the day , and the column of fire was always with them at night .
then the lord said to moses ,
“ tell the people to go back to pi hahiroth . tell them to spend the night between migdol and the red sea , near baal zephon .
pharaoh will think that the israelites are lost in the desert and that the people will have no place to go .
so pharaoh prepared his chariot and took his men with him .
he took 600 of his best men and all of his chariots . there was an officer in each chariot .
when the israelites saw pharaoh and his army coming toward them , they were very frightened and cried to the lord for help .
you will not have to do anything but stay calm . the lord will do the fighting for you . ”
then the lord said to moses , “ why are you still crying to me ? tell the israelites to start moving .
raise the walking stick in your hand over the red sea , and the sea will split . then the people can go across on dry land .
then egypt will know that i am the lord . they will honor me when i defeat pharaoh and his horse soldiers and chariots . ”
the israelites went through the sea on dry land . the water was like a wall on their right and on their left .
then all of pharaoh ’ s chariots and horse soldiers followed them into the sea .
early that morning the lord looked down from the tall cloud and column of fire at the egyptian army . then he made them panic .
then the lord told moses , “ raise your hand over the sea to make the water fall and cover the egyptian chariots and horse soldiers . ”
but the israelites crossed the sea on dry land . the water was like a wall on their right and on their left .
then moses and the israelites began singing this song to the lord :
the lord is my strength .
the lord is a great soldier .
he threw pharaoh ’ s chariots
the deep water covered them ,
“ lord , your right hand is amazingly strong .
in your great majesty you destroyed
the wind you sent in anger
“ the enemy said ,
but you blew on them
“ are there any gods like the lord ?
you raised your right hand to punish the enemy ,
“ the other nations will hear this story ,
the commanders of edom will tremble .
they will be filled with fear
you will lead your people
“ the lord will rule forever and ever ! ”
then aaron ’ s sister , the woman prophet miriam , took a tambourine . she and the women began singing and dancing .
miriam repeated the words ,
the people began complaining to moses . they said , “ now what will we drink ? ”
then the whole community of israelites began complaining again . they complained to moses and aaron in the desert .
then moses said to aaron , “ tell the whole community of israelites to come together before the lord , because he has heard their complaints . ”
the lord said to moses ,
that evening , flocks of quail came and filled the camp , and in the morning dew lay on the ground all around it .
after the dew was gone , something like thin flakes of frost was on the ground .
the lord says , ‘ each of you should gather what you need , a basket of manna for everyone in your family . ’ ”
so that is what the israelites did . some people gathered a large amount , some people gathered a little .
but when they measured what they had gathered , there was no shortage and there was none left over . everyone gathered just what they needed .
moses told them , “ don ’ t save that food to eat the next day . ”
every morning the people gathered as much food as they could eat , but by noon the food melted and was gone .
on friday the people gathered twice as much food—two baskets for every person . so all the leaders of the people came and told this to moses .
on saturday , some of the people went out to gather some of the food , but they could not find any .
then the lord said to moses , “ how long will you people refuse to obey my commands and teachings ?
so the people rested on the sabbath .
the people called the special food “ manna. ” it was like small white coriander seeds and tasted like thin cakes made with honey .
( aaron did what the lord had commanded moses . aaron put the jar of manna in front of the box of the agreement . )
( the measure they used for the manna was an omer . an omer was about 8 cups . )
so they turned against moses and started arguing with him . they said , “ give us water to drink . ”
so moses cried to the lord , “ what can i do with these people ? they are ready to kill me . ”
at rephidim the amalekites came and fought against the israelites .
so joshua and his men defeated the amalekites in this battle .
then moses built an altar and named it , “ the lord is my flag . ”
moses said , “ i lifted my hands toward the lord ’ s throne . so the lord fought against the amalekites , as he always has . ”
so jethro went to moses while moses was camped in the desert near the mountain of god . moses ’ wife and his two sons were with jethro .
jethro sent a message to moses that said , “ this is your father-in-law jethro . i am bringing your wife and her two sons to you . ”
he said , “ praise the lord ! he freed you from the power of egypt . he saved you from pharaoh .
now i know the lord is greater than all the gods . they thought they were in control , but look what god did ! ”
the next day , moses had the special job of judging the people . there were so many people that they had to stand before him all day .
then moses said to his father-in-law , “ the people come to me and ask me to ask for god ’ s decision for their problem .
but moses ’ father-in-law said to him , “ this isn ’ t the right way to do this .
but you should also choose some of the people to be judges and leaders .
so moses did what jethro told him .
these rulers were judges for the people . the people could always bring their arguments to these rulers , and moses had to decide only the most important cases .
after a short time moses said goodbye to his father-in-law jethro , and jethro went back to his own home .
the israelites reached the desert of sinai in the third month of their trip from egypt .
they had traveled from rephidim to the sinai desert . the israelites camped in the desert near mount sinai .
you will be a special nation—a kingdom of priests. ’ moses , you must tell the israelites what i have said . ”
so moses climbed down the mountain and called the elders of the people together . moses told the elders everything the lord had commanded him to tell them .
all the people spoke at the same time and said , “ we will obey everything the lord says . ”
and the lord said to moses , “ today and tomorrow you must prepare the people for a special meeting . they must wash their clothes
so moses climbed down the mountain and went to the people . he got them ready for the special meeting and they washed their clothes .
then moses said to the people , “ be ready for the meeting with god in three days . until that time do not have sexual relations . ”
then moses led the people out of the camp to a place near the mountain to meet god .
the noise from the trumpet became louder and louder . every time moses spoke to god , god answered him with a voice like thunder .
so moses went down to the people and told them these things .
these are the things god told his people :
“ i am the lord your god . i am the one who freed you from the land of egypt , where you were slaves .
“ you must not worship any other gods except me .
but i will be very kind to people who love me and obey my commands . i will be kind to their families for thousands of generations .
“ you must not use the name of the lord your god to make empty promises . if you do , the lord will not let you go unpunished .
“ you must remember to keep the sabbath a special day .
you may work six days a week to do your job .
“ you must not murder anyone .
“ you must not commit adultery .
“ you must not steal anything .
“ you must not tell lies about other people .
the people stood far away from the mountain while moses went to the dark cloud where god was .
then the lord told moses to say this to the israelites : “ you people have seen that i talked with you from heaven .
so you must not make idols using gold or silver to compete with me . you must not make these false gods .
then god said to moses , “ these are the other laws that you will give to the people :
if the master promised to let the slave woman marry his son , he must treat her like a daughter , not like a slave .
“ whoever hits and kills someone must be killed too .
but whoever plans to kill someone out of anger or hatred must be punished . take them away from my altar and kill them .
“ whoever hits their father or their mother must be killed .
“ whoever steals someone to sell them as a slave or to keep them for their own slave must be killed .
“ whoever curses their father or mother must be killed .
“ sometimes people beat their slaves . if the slave dies after being beaten , the killer must be punished .
you must trade an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth , a hand for a hand , a foot for a foot ,
a burn for a burn , a bruise for a bruise , a cut for a cut .
“ this same law must be followed if the bull kills someone ’ s son or daughter .
if you don ’ t find the thief , then the owner of the house must go before the judges who will decide if that person is guilty .
but if the neighbor stole the animal , then he must pay the owner for the animal .
if the father refuses to allow his daughter to marry him , then the man must still pay the full amount for her .
“ you must not allow any woman to do evil magic . if she does magic , you must not let her live .
“ you must not allow anyone to have sexual relations with an animal . if this happens , that person must be killed .
“ whoever makes a sacrifice to a false god should be destroyed . the lord is the only one you should make sacrifices to .
“ you must never do anything bad to women whose husbands are dead or to orphans .
if you do anything wrong to these widows or orphans , i will know it . i will hear about their suffering .
and i will be very angry . i will kill you with a sword . then your wives will become widows , and your children will become orphans .
you might take their cloak to make sure they pay the money back , but you must give that cloak back to them before sunset .
“ you must not curse god or the leaders of your people .
“ at harvest time you should give me the first grain and the first juice from your fruit . don ’ t wait until late in the year .
“ don ’ t tell lies against other people . if you are a witness in court , don ’ t agree to help a bad person tell lies .
“ in court , don ’ t treat a person in a special way simply because that person is poor .
“ if you see a lost bull or donkey , then you must return it to its owner—even if the owner is your enemy .
“ in court , don ’ t let anyone take advantage of a person simply because that person is poor .
“ plant seeds , harvest your crops , and work the ground for six years .
“ be sure that you obey all these laws . don ’ t worship false gods . you should not even speak their names !
“ you will have three special festivals each year . you must come to my special place to worship me during these festivals .
“ so three times each year all the men will come to the special place to be with the lord god .
“ when you gather your crops at harvest time , you should bring the first of everything you harvest to the house of the lord your god .
“ i am sending an angel before you to protect you along the way and to lead you to the place that i have prepared for you .
your women will all be able to have babies . none of their babies will die at birth . and i will allow you to live long lives .
i will send the hornet in front of you . he will force your enemies to leave . the hivites , canaanites , and hittites will leave your country .
so i will force them out of your land very slowly . i will do this as you grow and eventually take the land to be your own .
“ you must not make any agreements with any of those people or their gods .
then moses sent young men of israel to offer sacrifices . these men offered bulls to the lord as burnt offerings and fellowship offerings .
moses saved the blood from these animals . he put half of the blood in bowls , and he poured the other half of the blood on the altar .
then moses , aaron , nadab , abihu , and the 70 elders of israel went up the mountain .
on the mountain , these men saw the god of israel . he was standing on something that looked like blue sapphires , as clear as the sky !
all the leaders of israel saw god , but god did not destroy them . they all ate and drank together .
so moses and his helper , joshua , went up the mountain of god .
then moses went up the mountain , and the cloud covered the mountain .
the israelites could see the glory of the lord . it was like a fire burning on top of the mountain .
then moses went higher up the mountain into the cloud . he was on the mountain for 40 days and 40 nights .
the lord said to moses ,
“ tell the israelites to bring me gifts . you will accept gifts for me from everyone who is willing to give .

“ aaron must burn sweet-smelling incense on the altar every morning . he will do this when he comes to care for the lamps .
he must burn incense again when he checks the lamps in the evening so that incense will be burned before the lord every day forever .
don ’ t use this altar for offering any other kind of incense or burnt offering or for any kind of grain offering or drink offering .
the lord said to moses ,
every man who is at least 20 years old must be counted . and every man who is counted must give the lord this offering .
the lord said to moses ,
aaron and his sons must wash their hands and feet with the water from this bowl .
then the lord said to moses ,
and 12 pounds of cassia . use the official measure to measure all these things . also get 1 gallon of olive oil .
“ mix all these things to make a special sweet-smelling anointing oil .
pour this oil on the meeting tent and on the box of the agreement . this will show that these things have a special purpose .
you will make all these things holy . they will be very special to the lord . anything that touches these things will also become holy .
“ pour the oil on aaron and his sons to show that they are separated from the rest of the people to serve as priests .
tell the israelites that the anointing oil is holy—it must always be used only for me .
whoever makes a perfume like that and puts it on anyone except a priest must be separated from the people . ”
then the lord said to moses ,
“ i have chosen a man from the tribe of judah to do some special work for me . his name is bezalel son of uri son of hur .
i have filled bezalel with the spirit of god—i have given him the skill and knowledge to do all kinds of things .
he is a very good designer . and he can make things from gold , silver , and bronze .
he can cut and set beautiful jewels . and he can work with wood . he can do all kinds of work .
the table and everything on it ;
the altar for burning offerings and the things used at the altar ;
the special clothes for aaron the priest ;
the sweet-smelling anointing oil ;
then the lord said to moses ,
aaron said to the people , “ bring me the gold earrings that belong to your wives , sons , and daughters . ”
so the people collected all their gold earrings and brought them to aaron .
the lord said to moses , “ i have seen these people , and i know that they are very stubborn . they will always turn against me .
so now let me destroy them in anger . then i will make a great nation from you . ”
so the lord felt sorry for the people . he did not do what he said he might do—he did not destroy them .
god himself made the stones , and god himself wrote the commandments on them .
joshua heard the noise from the party in camp . he said to moses , “ it sounds like war down in the camp ! ”
aaron answered , “ don ’ t be angry , sir . you know that these people are always ready to do wrong .
moses saw that aaron had let the people get out of control . they were being wild , and all their enemies could see them acting like fools .
the people from the tribe of levi obeyed moses . that day about 3000 of the people died .
so moses went back to the lord and said , “ please listen ! these people committed a terrible sin and made a god from gold .
now , forgive them of this sin . if you will not forgive them , then erase my name from your book . ”
but the lord said to moses , “ the only people i erase from my book are those who sin against me .
so the lord caused a terrible sickness to come to the people . he did this because they told aaron to make the golden calf .
the people heard this bad news and became very sad , so they stopped wearing jewelry .
so the israelites stopped wearing their jewelry at mount horeb .
whenever moses went into the tent , the tall cloud would come down and stay at the entrance to the tent . and the lord would speak with moses .
the lord answered , “ i myself will go with you . i will lead you . ”
then moses said to him , “ if you don ’ t go with us , then don ’ t make us leave this place .
then moses said , “ now , please show me your glory . ”
but you can not see my face . no one can see me and continue to live . ”
then the lord said , “ here is a place for you to stand by me on this large rock .
i will put you in a large crack in that rock . then i will cover you with my hand , and my glory will pass by .
then i will take away my hand , and you will see my back . but you will not see my face . ”
be ready tomorrow morning and come up on mount sinai . stand before me there on the top of the mountain .
then the lord came down to him in a cloud , stood there with moses , and spoke his own name .
then moses quickly bowed to the ground and worshiped the lord . moses said ,
so destroy their altars , break the stones they worship , and cut down their idols .
don ’ t worship any other god . i am yahweh kanah—the jealous lord . that is my name . i hate for my people to worship other gods .
you might choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons . those daughters serve false gods . they might lead your sons to do the same thing .
“ don ’ t make idols .
“ a woman ’ s first baby always belongs to me . even the first animals that are born from your cattle or sheep belong to me .
“ you will work for six days , but on the seventh day you must rest . you must rest even during the times of planting and harvesting .
“ celebrate the festival of harvest . use the first grain from the wheat harvest for this festival . and in the fall celebrate the festival of shelters .
“ three times each year all your men must go to be with the lord god , the god of israel .
“ when you kill an animal and offer its blood as a sacrifice , you must not include anything that has yeast in it .
“ give the lord the very first crops that you harvest . bring them to the house of the lord your god .
then the lord said to moses , “ write everything that i have told you . this is the agreement that i made with you and the israelites . ”
aaron and all the people of israel saw that moses ’ face was shining bright . so they were afraid to go near him .
but moses called to them . so aaron and all the leaders of the people went to him . moses talked with them .
after that all the israelites came near moses , and he gave them the commands that the lord had given him on mount sinai .
when moses finished speaking to the people , he put a covering over his face .
moses gathered all the israelites together and said to them , “ i will tell you what the lord has commanded you to do :
on the sabbath you should not even light a fire in any of the places where you live . ”
moses said to all the israelites , “ this is what the lord commanded :
blue , purple , and red yarn and fine linen ; goat hair ;
ram skins dyed red and fine leather ; acacia wood ;
oil for the lamps ; spices for the anointing oil and spices for the sweet-smelling incense .
also , bring onyx stones and other jewels to be put on the ephod and the judgment pouch .
“ all of you who are skilled workers should make all the things the lord commanded :

the curtains around the yard , their posts and bases , and the curtain that covers the entrance to the yard ;

then all the israelites went away from moses .
everyone who wanted to give silver or bronze brought that as a gift to the lord . everyone who had acacia wood came and gave it to the lord .
every skilled woman made fine linen and blue , purple , and red yarn .
and all the women who were skilled and wanted to help made cloth from the goat hair .

the lord has given bezalel and oholiab special skills to teach other people . ( oholiab was the son of ahisamach from the tribe of dan . )
finally , all the skilled workers left the work they were doing on the holy place , and they went to speak to moses . they said ,
“ the people have brought too much . we have more than we need to finish the work the lord told us to do . ”
the people had brought more than enough things to finish the work of building god ’ s holy place .

then moses put the lamps on the lampstand before the lord . he did this just as the lord had commanded him .
then moses put the golden altar in the meeting tent , in front of the curtain .
then he burned sweet-smelling incense on the altar . he did this as the lord had commanded him .
then moses put the curtain at the entrance to the holy tent .
then moses put the bowl between the meeting tent and the altar . he put water in the bowl for washing .
moses , aaron , and aaron ’ s sons used this bowl to wash their hands and feet .
then the cloud covered the meeting tent and the glory of the lord filled the holy tent .
moses could not go into the meeting tent because the cloud had settled on it , and the glory of the lord had filled the holy tent .
when the cloud rose from the holy tent , the israelites would begin to travel .
but when the cloud stayed on the holy tent , the people did not try to move . they stayed in that place until the cloud rose .
inside the cloud , there were four living beings that looked like people .
but each one of them had four faces and four wings .
their legs were straight . their feet looked like calves ’ feet , and they sparkled like polished brass .
under their wings were human arms . there were four living beings . each living being had four faces and four wings .
the wings touched each other . the living beings did not turn when they moved . they went in the direction they were looking .
each living being went in the direction it was looking . they went wherever the spirit caused them to go , but they did not turn when they moved .
that is what the living beings looked like .
the living beings ran back and forth—as fast as lightning .
they could turn to move in any direction . but the living beings did not turn when they moved .
the rims of the wheels were tall and frightening . there were eyes all over the rims of all four wheels .
the wheels always moved with the living beings . if the living beings went up into the air , the wheels went with them .
they went wherever the spirit wanted them to go , and the wheels went with them , because the power that moved the living being was in the wheels .
there was an amazing thing over the heads of the living beings . it was like a bowl turned upside down , and the bowl was clear like crystal .
the living beings stopped moving and lowered their wings . then there was another loud sound that came from above the bowl over their heads .
the voice said , “ son of man , stand up and i will speak with you . ”
then the spirit came into me and lifted me up on my feet , and i listened to the one who spoke to me .
you must tell them what i say , whether they listen or not . they are people who usually refuse to listen !
then i saw an arm reach out toward me . it was holding a scroll with words written on it .
so i opened my mouth and he put the scroll into my mouth .
then god said , “ son of man , i am giving you this scroll . swallow it ! let that scroll fill your body . ”
then god said to me , “ son of man , go to the family of israel . speak my words to them .
but i will make you just as stubborn as they are , and your head just as hard .
then god said to me , “ son of man , listen to every word i say to you and remember them .
the spirit lifted me and took me away . i was very sad and upset in my spirit , but i felt the lord ’ s power in me .
after seven days , the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
but the spirit came into me and lifted me up on my feet . he said to me , “ go home and lock yourself in your house .
son of man , people will come with ropes and tie you up . they will not let you go out among the people .
“ son of man , take a brick and scratch a picture on it . draw a picture of a city—the city of jerusalem .
you can drink only 3 cups of water each day . you can drink it from time to time throughout the day .
that is because there will not be enough food and water for everyone . they will be terrified as they watch each other wasting away because of their sins .
but then you must get a few of those hairs and wrap them up in your robe .
so the lord god says , “ so now , even i am against you ! i will punish you while those other people watch .
then the word of the lord came to me again .
he said , “ son of man , turn toward the mountains of israel and speak against them for me .
your altars will be broken into pieces . your incense altars will be smashed , and i will throw down your dead bodies in front of your filthy idols .
i will put the dead bodies of the people of israel in front of their filthy idols . i will scatter your bones around your altars .
your people will be killed , and then you will know that i am the lord ! ’ ”
then the word of the lord came to me .
he said , “ now , son of man , here is a message from the lord god . this message is for the land of israel :
your end is coming now !
i will not show you any mercy or feel sorry for you .
this is what the lord god said : “ there will be one disaster after another !
the end is coming , and it will come quickly !
they will be too tired and sad to raise their arms . their legs will be like water .
they will wear sackcloth and be covered with fear . you will see the shame on every face . they will shave their heads to show their sadness .
i will let strangers take them . those strangers will make fun of them . they will kill some of the people and take others away as prisoners .
“ make chains for the prisoners , because many people will be punished for killing other people . there will be violence every place in the city .
“ you will shake with fear . you will look for peace , but there will be none .
but the glory of the god of israel was there . the glory looked just like the vision i saw in the valley by the kebar canal .
so i went to the entrance to the courtyard , and i saw a hole in the wall .
then god said to me , “ go in and look at the terrible , evil things that the people are doing here . ”
then he said to me , “ if you come with me , you will see these men doing even more terrible things ! ”
then god shouted to the leaders in charge of punishing the city . each leader had his own destructive weapon in his hand .
so i will not show any mercy or feel sorry for them . they brought it on themselves . i am only giving them the punishment they deserve ! ”
then the man wearing linen clothes and a scribe ’ s pen and ink set spoke up . he said , “ i have done what you commanded . ”
the cherub angels were standing in the area south of the temple as the man walked to them . the cloud filled the inner courtyard .
( the cherub angels had what looked like human arms under their wings . )
then i noticed that there were four wheels . there was one wheel by each cherub angel , and the wheels looked like a clear yellow jewel .
there were four wheels , and they all looked the same . they looked like there was a wheel in a wheel .
these wheels were what i heard called , “ the area between the wheels . ”
and the wheels rose with them . when the cherub angels raised their wings and flew into the air , not even the wheels turned around .
then the glory of the lord rose from the threshold of the temple , moved to the place over the cherub angels , and stopped there .
each living being had four faces , four wings , and something that looked like human arms under their wings .
these men say , ‘ we will be building our houses again very soon . we are as safe in this city as meat in a pot ! ’
so you must speak to the people for me . son of man , prophesy against the people . ”
you have killed many people in this city . you have filled the streets with dead bodies .
you are afraid of the sword , but i am bringing the sword against you ! ’ ” this is what the lord god said .
he also said , “ i will take you out of this city and give you to strangers . i will punish you .
you will die by the sword . i will punish you here in israel , so you will know that i am the lord .
yes , this place will be the cooking pot , and you will be the meat cooking in it . i will punish you here in israel .
but then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
when my people come back , they will destroy all the terrible , filthy idols that are here now .
then the cherub angels raised their wings and flew into the air . the wheels went with them . the glory of the god of israel was above them .
the glory of the lord rose into the air and left the city and stopped on the hill east of jerusalem .
then i spoke to the people in exile . i told them about everything the lord showed me .
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
while the people are watching , make a hole in the wall and go out through that hole in the wall .
the next morning , the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , did the people of israel—those people who always refuse to obey—ask you what you were doing ?
tell them that this is what the lord god said . this sad message is about the leader of jerusalem and all the people of israel who live there .
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , why do people quote this saying about the land of israel :
“ tell the people that the lord god will end that saying . they will not say that about israel anymore . now they will quote this saying :
“ there will not be any more false visions in israel . there will not be any more magicians telling things that don ’ t come true .
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ ‘ israel , your prophets are false prophets . they are like jackals hunting for food among the ruins of a city .
when the wall falls down , the people will ask the prophets , ‘ what happened to the plaster you put on the wall ? ’ ”
some of the elders of israel came to me . they sat down to talk with me .
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
so both the one who came for advice and the prophet who gave an answer will get the same punishment .
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ or i might send wild animals through that country to kill all the people . then no one would travel through that country because of the wild animals .
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , are the pieces of wood from a grapevine any better than the little branches cut from trees in the forest ?
can you use that wood from a grapevine to make anything ? can you use that wood to make pegs to hang dishes on ?
people throw that wood into the fire . the ends burn , and the middle is scorched .
if you can not make anything from that wood before it is burned , you surely can not make anything from that wood after it is burned !
i will destroy that country because the people left me to worship false gods. ” this is what the lord god said .
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , tell the people of jerusalem about the terrible things they have done .
i gave you a nice dress and soft leather sandals , a linen headband , and a silk scarf .
i also gave you some jewelry . i put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck .
i gave you a nose ring , earrings , and a beautiful crown to wear .
you became famous for your beauty , all because i made you so lovely ! ’ ” this is what the lord god said .
you slaughtered my sons and then passed them through the fire to those false gods .
“ after all these evil things , … it will be very bad for you ! ” the lord god said all these things .
“ after all those things , you made a mound for worshiping that false god . you built those places for worshiping false gods on every street corner .
then you went to egypt , your neighbor that is always ready for sex . with more and more sexual sin , you made me angry .
then you went to have sex with assyria . you could not get enough . you were never satisfied .
so you turned to canaan , and then to babylonia , and still you were not satisfied .
you are a woman guilty of adultery . you would rather have sex with strangers than with your own husband .
you are just the opposite of most prostitutes who force men to pay them , because you pay the men to have sex with you . ”
prostitute , listen to the message from the lord .
they will bring a crowd of people and throw rocks at you to kill you . then they will cut you into pieces with their swords .
then i will stop being angry and jealous . i will calm down . i will not be angry anymore .
“ all the people who talk about you will now have one more thing to say . they will say , ‘ like mother , like daughter . ’
you did all the terrible things they did , but you also did much worse !
sodom and her daughters became too proud and began to do terrible things in front of me . so i punished them !
so you must bear your shame . you have made your sisters look good compared to you . you have done terrible things , so you should be ashamed .
i will comfort you . then you will remember the terrible things you did , and you will be ashamed .
“ in the past , you were proud and made fun of your sister sodom . but you will not do that again .
you did that before you were punished , before your neighbors started making fun of you . the daughters of edom and philistia are making fun of you now .
now you must suffer for the terrible things you did. ” this is what the lord said .
but i will remember the agreement we made when you were young . i made an agreement with you that will continue forever !
so i will make my agreement with you , and you will know that i am the lord .
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , i have a story with a hidden meaning for you to tell the family of israel .
tell them that this is what the lord god says :
he broke the top out of that big cedar tree and brought it to canaan .
then the eagle took some of the seeds from canaan .
the seeds grew and became a grapevine .
then another eagle with big wings saw the grapevine .
the grapevine was planted in a good field near plenty of water .
this is what the lord god says :
will the plant grow where it is planted ?
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
but the king of judah will not escape , because he ignored his agreement . he broke his promise to nebuchadnezzar . ”
this is what the lord god says :
i myself will plant it on a high mountain in israel .
“ then the other trees will know that
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ why do you people say this proverb :
but the lord god says , “ by my life , i swear that people in israel will not think this proverb is true anymore !
i will treat everyone , child and parent , just the same . the one who sins is the one who will die !
“ a person who is good will live ! he is fair and does what is right .
“ but someone like that might have a son who does not do any of these good things . the son steals things and kills people .
the father hurts people and steals things . he never does anything good for my people ! he will die because of his own sins .
god will not remember all the bad things they did . he will remember only their goodness , so they will live ! ”
the lord god says , “ i don ’ t want evil people to die . i want them to change their lives so that they can live !
if good people change and become evil , they must die for the bad things they do .
and if evil people change and become good and fair , they will save their lives . they will live !
the people of israel said , “ that ’ s not fair ! the lord isn ’ t fair ! ”
i don ’ t want to kill you ! please come back and live ! ” this is what the lord god said .
the lord said to me , “ you must sing this sad song about the leaders of israel :
“ ‘ your mother is like a female lion ,
one of her cubs gets up .
“ ‘ the people heard him roar ,
“ ‘ the mother lion had hoped that cub would become the leader ,
he hunted with the adult lions
he attacked the palaces and destroyed the cities .
then the people who lived around him set a trap for him ,
they put hooks on him and locked him up .
“ ‘ your mother is like a grapevine
then she grew large branches .
but the vine was pulled up by the roots ,
“ ‘ now that grapevine is planted in the desert .
a fire started in the large branch
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
should you judge them ? will you judge them , son of man ? you must tell them about the terrible things their fathers have done .
i brought the family of israel out of egypt . i led them into the desert .
then i gave them my laws and told them all my rules . all those who obey them will live .
but i felt sorry for them , so i did not destroy them . i did not completely destroy them in the desert .
i am the lord . i am your god . obey my laws and keep my commands . do the things i tell you .
so i made another promise to those people in the desert . i promised to scatter them among the nations , to send them to many different countries .
so i gave them laws that were not good . i gave them commands that would not bring life .
i asked the people of israel why they were going to the high places . but that high place is still there today . ’
i will judge you as i judged your ancestors in the desert near egypt. ” this is what the lord god said .
“ i will judge you guilty and punish you according to the agreement .
in that country you will remember all the evil things you did that made you filthy , and you will be ashamed .
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , look toward the negev , the southern part of judah . speak against the negev forest .
then all people will see that i , the lord , have started the fire . the fire will not be put out ! ’ ”
then i said , “ oh , lord god ! if i say this , the people will say that i am only telling them stories . ”
so the word of the lord came to me again . he said ,
“ son of man , look toward jerusalem and speak against their holy places . speak against the land of israel for me .
“ son of man , make sad sounds like a sad person with a broken heart . make these sad sounds in front of the people .
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , speak to the people for me . say this , ‘ this is what the lord says :
the sword was made sharp for killing .
so the sword has been polished .
“ son of man , clap your hands to show your sadness ,
their hearts will melt with fear ,
sword , be sharp !
“ then i , too , will clap my hands
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
and you , evil leader of israel , you will be killed . your time of punishment has come ! the end is here ! ”
“ ‘ your visions are useless .
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , will you judge the city of murderers ? will you tell her about all the terrible things she has done ?
people far and near will make fun of you . you have ruined your name . you are filled with confusion .
“ ‘ look , all the leaders in israel are using their strength just to kill other people .
you hate all that i consider holy . you treat my special days of rest as if they are not important .
there men commit sexual sins with their father ’ s wife . there the men rape women—even during their monthly time of bleeding .
“ ‘ now look ! i will slam my hand down and stop you ! i will punish you for cheating and killing people .
i will scatter you among the nations . i will force you to go to many countries . i will completely destroy the filthy things in this city .
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
so this is what the lord god says : ‘ all of you have become like worthless waste . so i will gather you into jerusalem .
i will put you in my fire of anger and blow on it , and you will begin to melt .
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ the leaders in jerusalem are like a wolf eating the animal it has caught . they attack people and kill them just to get rich .
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , listen to this story about samaria and jerusalem . there were two sisters , daughters of the same mother .
they became prostitutes in egypt while they were still young girls . that ’ s where they first let men touch and handle their young breasts .
“ then oholah became unfaithful to me—she began to live like a prostitute . she began to want her lovers . she saw the assyrian soldiers
in their blue uniforms . they were all handsome young men riding horses . they were leaders and officers ,
so i let her lovers have her . she wanted assyria , so i gave her to them !
they raped her . they took her children and killed her . they punished her , and women still talk about her .
“ her younger sister oholibah saw all these things happen . but oholibah sinned more than her sister did ! she was more unfaithful than oholah .
she wanted the assyrian leaders and officers . she wanted those soldiers in blue uniforms riding their horses . they were all handsome young men .
i saw that both women were going to ruin their lives with the same mistakes .
they wore belts around their waists and long turbans on their heads . all those men looked like chariot officers . they all looked like native-born babylonian men ,
and oholibah wanted them .
so the babylonian men came to her bed to have sex with her . they used her and made her so filthy that she became disgusted with them .
but oholibah thought about her time as a prostitute in egypt when she was young , and she turned to even more prostitution .
she remembered the lovers who excited her there , who were like animals in their sexual desires and abilities .
“ oholibah , you dreamed of those times when you were young , when your lovers touched and handled your young breasts .
they will take your nice clothes and jewelry .
so i will stop your dreams about your love affair with egypt . you will never again look for them . you will never remember egypt again ! ’ ”
you did those bad things when you left me to chase after the other nations . you did those bad things when you began to worship their filthy idols .
you followed your sister and lived as she did . you , yourself , took her cup of poison and held it in your hands . ”
this is what the lord god says :
you will stagger like a drunk .
you will drink the poison in that cup .
the lord said to me , “ son of man , will you judge oholah and oholibah ? then tell them about the terrible things they have done .
they also treated my special days of rest and my holy place as though they were not important .
they killed their children for their idols , and then they went into my holy place and made it filthy too ! they did this inside my temple !
you sat on a fine bed with a table set before it . you put my incense and my oil on this table .
but they kept going to her as they would go to a prostitute . yes , they went again and again to oholah and oholibah , those wicked women .
“ but good men will judge them guilty of adultery and murder , because oholah and oholibah committed adultery and their hands are covered with blood ! ”
this is what the lord god said : “ gather the people together to punish and terrorize oholah and oholibah .
in this way i will remove that shame from this country , and all the other women will be warned not to do the shameful things you have done .
the word of the lord came to me . this was on the tenth day of the tenth month in the ninth year of exile . he said ,
“ son of man , write today ’ s date and this note : ‘ on this date the army of the king of babylon surrounded jerusalem . ’
the people there refuse to obey me . i have a story with a message for them . tell them , ‘ this is what the lord god says :
put in the pieces of meat .
use the best animals in the flock .
“ ‘ so this is what the lord god says :
jerusalem is like a pot with rust on it .
i put her blood on the bare rock
“ ‘ so this is what the lord god says :
put plenty of wood under the pot .
then let the pot stand empty on the coals .
“ ‘ jerusalem might work hard
“ ‘ you sinned against me
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
the next morning i told the people what god had said . that evening , my wife died . the next morning i did what god commanded .
then the people said to me , “ why are you doing this ? what does it mean ? ”
then i said to them , “ the word of the lord came to me . he told me
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , look toward the people of ammon and speak against them for me .
this is what the lord god says : “ moab and seir say , ‘ the family of judah is just like any other nation . ’
so i will punish moab , and then they will know that i am the lord . ”
i will punish them—i will get even . i will let my anger teach them a lesson . then they will know that i am the lord ! ”
in the eleventh year of exile , on the first day of the month , the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
her daughters on the mainland will be killed in battle . then they will know that i am the lord . ”
he will bring the logs to break down your walls . he will use picks and break down your towers .
so i will stop the sound of your happy songs . people will not hear your harps anymore .
they will sing this sad song about you :
now , on the day you fall ,
the word of the lord came to me again . he said ,
“ son of man , sing this sad song about tyre .
the mediterranean sea is the border around your city .
your builders used cypress trees
they used oak trees from bashan
for your sail , they used colorful linen made in egypt .
men from sidon and arvad rowed your boats for you .
the elders and wise men from byblos
“ ‘ tarshish was one of your best customers . they traded silver , iron , tin , and lead for all the wonderful things you sold .
people in greece , turkey , and the area around the black sea traded with you . they traded slaves and bronze for the things you sold .
people from the nation of togarmah traded horses , war horses , and mules for the things you sold .
the people of rhodes traded with you . you sold your things in many places . people brought ivory tusks and ebony wood to pay you .
damascus was a good customer . they traded with you for the many wonderful things you had . they traded wine from helbon and white wool for those things .
damascus traded wine from uzal for the things you sold . they paid with wrought iron , cassia , and sugar cane .
dedan provided good business and traded with you for saddle blankets and riding horses .
arabia and all the leaders of kedar traded lambs , rams , and goats for your goods .
the merchants of sheba and raamah traded with you . they traded all the best spices and every kind of precious stone and gold for your goods .
haran , canneh , eden , the merchants of sheba , asshur , and kilmad traded with you .
the ships from tarshish carried the things you sold .
your oarsmen rowed you far out to sea .
all your wealth will spill into the sea .
“ ‘ you send your merchants to faraway places .
your whole crew will jump ship .
they will be very sad about you .
they will shave their heads for you .
“ ‘ and in their loud crying they will sing this sad song about you :
your merchants sailed across the seas .
but now you are broken by the seas
all the people living on the coast
the merchants in other nations whistle about you .
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , say to the ruler of tyre , ‘ this is what the lord god says :
you think you are wiser than daniel
through your wisdom and understanding
through your great wisdom and trade ,
“ ‘ so this is what the lord god says :
i will bring strangers to fight against you .
they will bring you down to the grave .
that person will kill you .
strangers will treat you like a foreigner and kill you ,
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , sing this sad song about the king of tyre . say to him , ‘ this is what the lord god says :
you were in eden , the garden of god .
you were one of the chosen cherubs
you were good and honest when i created you ,
your business brought you many riches .
your beauty made you proud .
you did many wrong things .
“ ‘ all the people in other nations
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , look toward sidon and speak for me against that place .
say , ‘ this is what the lord god says :
i will send disease and death to sidon ,
on the twelfth day of the tenth month of the tenth year of exile , the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , look toward pharaoh , king of egypt . speak for me against him and egypt .
say , ‘ this is what the lord god says :
“ ‘ but i will put hooks in your jaws .
then all the people living in egypt
the people of israel leaned on egypt for support ,
so this is what the lord god says :
egypt will be empty and destroyed .
no person or animal will pass through egypt . nothing will pass through or settle there for 40 years .
on the first day of the first month in the twenty-seventh year of exile , the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
i will give egypt to nebuchadnezzar as a reward for the hard work he did for me. ” this is what the lord god said !
the word of the lord came to me again . he said ,
“ son of man , speak for me . say , ‘ this is what the lord god says :
that day is near !
a sword will come against egypt !
“ ‘ this is what the lord says :
egypt will join the other countries that were destroyed .
i will start a fire in egypt ,
this is what the lord god says :
i will make the nile river become dry land .
this is what the lord god says :
i will make pathros empty .
i will pour out my anger against pelusium , the fortress of egypt !
i will start a fire in egypt ;
the young men of heliopolis and bubastis will die in battle ,
it will be a dark day in tahpanhes when i break egypt ’ s control .
so i will punish egypt .
on the seventh day of the first month of the eleventh year of exile , the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
i will scatter the egyptians among the nations .
i will scatter the egyptians among the nations . then they will know that i am the lord ! ”
on the first day of the third month in the eleventh year of exile , the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , say this to pharaoh , king of egypt , and to his people :
assyria was a cedar tree in lebanon with beautiful branches ,
the water made the tree grow .
so that tree was taller than all the other trees of the field ,
all the birds of the sky made their nests
the tree was very beautiful .
even the cedar trees in god ’ s garden
i gave it many branches
now birds live in that fallen tree . wild animals walk over its fallen branches .
on the first day of the twelfth month in the twelfth year of exile , the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , sing this sad song about pharaoh , king of egypt . say to him :
this is what the lord god says :
then i will drop you on the dry ground .
i will scatter your body on the mountains .
i will pour your blood on the mountains ,
i will make you disappear .
i will darken the lights in the sky over you .
“ i will make many people sad and upset when i bring an enemy to destroy you . nations you don ’ t even know will be upset .
that will happen because of what the lord god said : “ the sword of the king of babylon will come to fight against you .
on the fifteenth day of that month in the twelfth year of exile , the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ egypt , you are no better than anyone else ! go down to the place of death . go lie down with those foreigners .
“ egypt will go to be with all the other men who were killed in battle . the enemy has pulled her and all her people away .
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
if this guard sees enemy soldiers coming , he blows the trumpet and warns the people .
if people hear the warning but ignore it , the enemy will capture them and take them away as prisoners . they will be responsible for their own death .
i will not remember the bad things they did in the past , because now they live right and are fair . so they will live !
“ but your people say , ‘ that ’ s not fair ! the lord can not be like that ! ’
if good people stop doing good and begin to sin , they will die because of their sins .
and if evil people stop doing wrong and start living right and being fair , they will live .
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
the people have done many terrible things , so i will make that place an empty wasteland . then they will know that i am the lord . ”
but the things you sing about really will happen , and then the people will know that there was a prophet living among them . ’ ”
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
you eat the fat sheep and use their wool to make clothes for yourselves . you kill the fat sheep , but you don ’ t feed the flock .
“ ‘ and now the sheep are scattered because there was no shepherd . they became food for every wild animal , so they were scattered .
so , you shepherds , listen to the word of the lord .
so , you shepherds , listen to the word of the lord !
the lord god says , “ i myself will be their shepherd . i will search for my sheep and take care of them .
yes , i will feed my flock , and i will lead them to a place of rest. ” this is what the lord god said .
my flock must eat the grass you crushed with your feet , and they must drink the water you stir with your feet ! ”
so the lord god says to them : “ i myself will judge between the fat sheep and the thin sheep !
you push with your side and shoulder . you knock down all the weak sheep with your horns . you push until you have forced them away ,
so i will save my flock . they will not be caught by wild animals anymore . i will judge between one sheep and another .
then i will put one shepherd over them , my servant david . he will feed them and be their shepherd .
i will bless the sheep and the places around my hill . i will cause the rains to fall at the right time and will shower them with blessings .
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , look toward mount seir and speak against it for me .
say to it , ‘ this is what the lord god says :
i will destroy your cities ,
i will make mount seir an empty ruin . i will kill everyone who enters or leaves that city .
i will make you empty forever . no one will live in your cities . then you will know that i am the lord . ”
you said , “ these two nations and countries , israel and judah , will be mine . we will take them for our own . ”
and then you , too , will know that i am the lord .
your proud boasting is really against me . time after time you have insulted me , and i have heard every word . ”
this is what the lord god says : “ all the earth will be happy when i destroy you .
“ son of man , speak to the mountains of israel for me . tell them to listen to the word of the lord !
“ but mountains of israel , you will grow new trees and produce fruit for my people israel . my people will soon come back .
i am with you , and i will help you . people will till your soil and plant seeds in you .
yes , i will lead many people—my people , israel—to your land . you will be their property , and you will not take away their children again . ”
but you will not destroy people anymore or take away their children again. ” this is what the lord god said .
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
i scattered them among the nations and spread them through all the lands . i gave them the punishment they deserved for the bad things they did .
“ the people of israel ruined my holy name wherever they went , and i felt sorry for my name .
“ i will take you out of those nations , gather you together , and bring you back to your own land .
i will put my spirit inside you and change you so that you will obey my laws . you will carefully obey my commands .
then you will live in the land that i gave to your ancestors . you will be my people , and i will be your god .
also , i will save you and keep you from becoming unclean . i will command the grain to grow . i will not bring a famine against you .
people will begin again to work the land so when other people pass by they will not see ruins anymore .
then the lord said to me , “ son of man , can these bones come to life ? ”
then he said to me , “ speak to these bones for me . tell them , ‘ dry bones , listen to the word of the lord !
this is what the lord god says to you : i will cause breath to come into you , and you will come to life !
there before my eyes , i saw sinew and muscles begin to cover the bones . skin began to cover them , but there was no breath in them .
my people , i will open your graves and bring you up out of your graves , and then you will know that i am the lord .
the word of the lord came to me again . he said ,
then join the two sticks together . in your hand , they will be one stick .
“ your people will ask you to explain what that means .
“ take the sticks that you wrote on and hold them in front of you .
my holy tent will be with them . yes , i will be their god and they will be my people .
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
soldiers from persia , ethiopia , and put will be with them . they will all be wearing their shields and helmets .
“ ‘ be prepared . yes , prepare yourself and the armies that have joined with you . you must watch and be ready .
this is what the lord god says : “ at that time an idea will come into your mind . you will begin to make an evil plan .
the lord god said , “ at that time gog will come to fight against the land of israel . i will show my anger .
in my anger and strong emotions , i make this promise : i promise that there will be a strong earthquake in the land of israel .
i will capture you and bring you back . i will bring you from the far north . i will bring you to fight against the mountains of israel .
but i will knock your bow from your left hand and your arrows from your right hand .
that time is coming ! it will happen ! ” this is what the lord god said . “ that is the day i am talking about .
it will take seven months for the family of israel to bury them . they must do this to make the land pure .
the city of the dead will be named hamonah . in this way they will make the country pure . ”
then from that day on , the family of israel will know that i am the lord their god .
they sinned and made themselves filthy , so i punished them for the things they did . i turned away from them and refused to help them . ”
then the man went to the east gate . he walked up its steps and measured the opening for the gate . it was one ruler wide .
then he measured the porch .
there were three little guardrooms on each side of the gateway . all these rooms and their side walls measured the same .
the man measured the entrance to the gateway . it was 10 cubits wide and 13 cubits long .
he measured the faces of all the side walls , including the side walls on either side of the porch at the courtyard . the total was 60 cubits .
from the inside edge of the outer gate to the far end of the porch was 50 cubits .
the pavement was as wide as the gates were long . the pavement reached to the inside end of the gateway . this was the lower pavement .
then the man measured the length and width of the north gate that was in the wall surrounding the outer courtyard .
the gateway and its porch had windows all around like the other gates . the gateway was 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide .
the porch was 25 cubits wide and 5 cubits long .
then the man led me into the inner courtyard on the east side . he measured the gate . it measured the same as the other gates .
then the man led me to the north gate . he measured it , and it measured the same as the other gates .
there was also a doorway in the side walls of the gates . that doorway led into a room where the priests washed the sacrifices .
there were also two tables on each side of the door on the outside wall of this porch .
so there were four tables on the inside wall and four tables on the outside wall—eight tables that the priests used when they killed the animals for sacrifices .
there were meat hooks three inches long on all the walls in this area . the meat of the offerings was put on the tables .
there were two rooms in the inner courtyard . one was by the north gate facing south . the other room was by the south gate facing north .
the man said to me , “ the room that looks to the south is for the priests who are on duty and serving in the temple area .
the outer wall of the side rooms was 5 cubits thick . there was an open area between the side rooms of the temple
and the priests ’ rooms . it was 20 cubits wide and went all the way around the temple .
the restricted area on the east side , in front of the temple , was 100 cubits long .
of cherub angels and palm trees . a palm tree was between each cherub angel . every cherub angel had two faces .
from the floor to the area above the door , cherub angels and palm trees were carved on all walls of the holy place .
the walls on either side of the holy place were square . in front of the most holy place , there was something that looked like
both the holy place and the most holy place had a double door .
each of the doors was made from two smaller doors . each door was really two swinging doors .
this building was 100 cubits long and 50 cubits wide . people entered it from the courtyard on the north side .
there was a path 10 cubits wide and 100 cubits long running along the south side of the building , even though the entrance was on the north side .
there was a wall outside that was parallel to the rooms and ran along the outer courtyard . it ran in front of the rooms for 50 cubits .
the entrance was below these rooms at the east end of the building so that people could enter from the outer courtyard .
the entrance was at the start of the wall beside the courtyard .
path in front of them . they were like the rooms on the north side . they had the same length and width and the same kind of doors .
the entrance to the lower rooms was at the east end of the building so that people could enter from the open end of the path by the wall .
the man had finished measuring inside the temple area . then he brought me out through the east gate and measured all around that area .
he measured the east side with the ruler . it was 500 cubits long .
he measured the north side . it was 500 cubits long .
he measured the south side . it was 500 cubits long .
he went around to the west side and measured it . it was 500 cubits long .
the man led me to the east gate .
the vision that i saw was like the vision i saw by the kebar canal . i bowed with my face to the ground .
the glory of the lord came into the temple through the east gate .
then the spirit picked me up and brought me into the inner courtyard . the glory of the lord filled the temple .
i heard someone speaking to me from inside the temple . the man was still standing beside me .
now let them take their sexual sins and the dead bodies of their kings far away from me . then i will live among them forever .
the place for the fire on the altar was 4 cubits high . the four corners were shaped like horns .
the place for the fire on the altar was 12 cubits long by 12 cubits wide . it was perfectly square .
then take the bull for the sin offering and burn it in the proper place in the temple area , outside the temple building .
for seven days , the priests will make the altar pure and ready for use in worshiping god .
then the man brought me back to the east gate of the temple area . we were outside the gate and the gate was shut .
you did not take care of my holy things . no , you let foreigners have responsibility of my holy place ! ’ ”
but i will let them take care of the temple . they will work in the temple and do the things that must be done in it .
“ they will enter my holy place and come near my table to serve me . they will take care of the things i gave them .
they will wear linen turbans on their heads , and they will wear linen underwear . they will not wear anything that makes them sweat .
“ these priests will not shave their heads or let their hair grow long . the priests may only trim the hair of their heads .
none of the priests may drink wine when they go into the inner courtyard .
after the priest has been made clean , he must wait seven days .
the priests must not eat any bird or animal that has died a natural death or has been torn to pieces by a wild animal .
“ stop cheating people . use accurate scales and measures !
a shekel must equal 20 gerahs . a mina must equal 60 shekels . it must be equal to 20 shekels plus 25 shekels plus 15 shekels .
“ this is a special offering that you must give :
1/6 ephah of wheat for every homer of wheat ;
1/6 ephah of barley for every homer of barley ;
1/10 bath of olive oil for every cor of olive oil ;
and one sheep for every 200 sheep
“ everyone in the country will give to this offering for the ruler of israel .
at that time the ruler will offer a bull for himself and for all the people of israel . the bull will be for a sin offering .
on the sabbath day and on the day of the new moon , the common people will also worship the lord at that gate .
“ when the ruler goes in , he must enter at the porch of the east gate—and he must leave that same way .
so they will give the lamb , the grain offering , and the oil every morning for a burnt offering forever . ”
there was a brick wall around each of the four small courtyards , and there were places built into the brick walls for cooking .
the man said to me , “ these are the kitchens where those who serve at the temple cook the sacrifices for the people . ”
then the man said to me , “ son of man , did you pay close attention to the things you saw ? ”
as i walked back along the side of the river , i saw many trees on both sides of the water .
he said to me , “ this water flows east , down to the arabah valley .
but the swamps and small marshes will not become fresh . they will be left for salt .
this is what the lord god says : “ these are the borders for dividing the land among the twelve tribes of israel . joseph will have two parts .
you will divide the land equally . i promised to give this land to your ancestors , so i am giving this land to you .
berothah , sibraim ( which is on the border between damascus and hamath ) and hazer hatticon , which is on the border of hauran .
so the border will go from the sea to hazar enan on the northern border of damascus and hamath . this will be on the north side .
“ so you will divide this land among you for the tribes of israel .
the tribe where that resident lives must give him some land. ” this is what the lord god said !
you will dedicate this land to the lord . it will be 25,000 cubits long and 20,000 cubits wide .
this special area of land will be divided among the priests and levites .
this share from this holy part of the land will be especially for these priests . it will be next to the land of the levites .
the city workers from all the tribes of israel will farm this land .
“ the southern border of gad ’ s land will go from tamar to the oasis at meribah-kadesh , then along the brook of egypt to the mediterranean sea .
this is the land that you will divide among the tribes of israel . this is what each group will get. ” this is what the lord god said !
“ these are the gates of the city . the gates will be named for the tribes of israel .
there will be three gates : reuben ’ s gate , judah ’ s gate , and levi ’ s gate .
“ the distance around the city will be 18,000 cubits . from now on , the name of the city will be the lord is there . ”
from king cyrus of persia :
this is what mithredath brought out of the lord ’ s temple : 30 gold dishes , 1000 silver dishes , 29 knives and pans ,
30 gold bowls , 410 silver bowls similar to the gold bowls , and 1000 other dishes .
all together , there were 5400 things made from gold and silver . sheshbazzar brought them all with him when the prisoners left babylon and went back to jerusalem .

from the family of priests there were descendants of
they had 736 horses , 245 mules , 435 camels , and 6720 donkeys .
then they celebrated the festival of shelters just as the law of moses said . they offered the right number of burnt offerings for each day of the festival .
they sang songs of praise and thanksgiving , taking turns in singing each part . they sang ,
so the enemies began to discourage them and tried to frighten them in order to stop them from building the temple .
these enemies even wrote letters to the king of persia trying to stop the jews . they wrote a letter the year that xerxes became the king of persia .
and from the other people who the great and powerful ashurbanipal moved to the city of samaria and other places in the country west of the euphrates river .
this is the copy of the letter sent to king artaxerxes :
we have a responsibility to the king . we don ’ t want to see this happen , so we are sending this letter to inform the king .
then king artaxerxes sent this answer :
the letter you sent us has been translated and read to me .
now , you must give an order for these men to stop work . that order must be given to keep jerusalem from being rebuilt until i say so .
so the work stopped on god ’ s temple in jerusalem . the work did not continue until the second year that darius was king of persia .
at that time the prophets haggai and zechariah son of iddo began to prophesy in the name of god . they encouraged the jews in judah and jerusalem .
they also asked zerubbabel , “ what are the names of the men who are working on this building ? ”
tattenai the governor of the area west of the euphrates river , shethar bozenai , and the important people with them sent a letter to king darius .
this is a copy of that letter :
we also asked for their names . we wanted to write down the names of their leaders so that you would know who they are .
this is the answer they gave us :
but , in the first year that cyrus was king of babylon , king cyrus gave a special order for god ’ s temple to be rebuilt .
a scroll was found in the fortress of ecbatana . ( ecbatana is in the province of media . ) this is what was written on that scroll :
during the first year that cyrus was king , he gave an order about the temple of god in jerusalem . the order said :
so king darius sent this message to his officials :
the temple was finished on the third day of the month of adar . that was in the sixth year of the rule of king darius .
on the fourteenth day of the first month , the jews who came back from captivity celebrated the passover .
hilkiah was the son of shallum . shallum was the son of zadok . zadok was the son of ahitub .
ahitub was the son of amariah . amariah was the son of azariah . azariah was the son of meraioth .
meraioth was the son of zerahiah . zerahiah was the son of uzzi . uzzi was the son of bukki .
ezra arrived in jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year that artaxerxes was king .
i and my advisors are giving gold and silver to the god of israel , who lives in jerusalem . you must take this gold and silver with you .
take all these things to the god of jerusalem . they are for the worship in the temple of your god .
from the descendants of phinehas : gershom ; from the descendants of ithamar : daniel ; from the descendants of david : hattush ;

they also sent hashabiah and jeshaiah from the descendants of merari , along with their brothers and nephews . in all there were 20 men .
so we fasted and prayed to our god about our trip . he answered our prayers .
then i chose twelve of the priests who were leaders . i chose sherebiah , hashabiah , and ten of their brothers .
then we arrived in jerusalem . we rested there for three days .
we counted and weighed everything and we wrote down the total weight .
then i prayed this prayer :
“ now , god , what can we say to you ? we have stopped obeying you again .
get up , ezra . this is your responsibility , but we will support you . so be brave and do it . ”
so ezra got up . he made the leading priests , the levites , and all the israelites promise to do what he said .
those who did not come to jerusalem in three days like the officials and elders said would lose their property and be removed from the group .
then the whole group who met together answered ezra . they shouted , “ ezra , you are right ! we must do what you say .
and by the first day of the first month , they finished discussing all the men who had married foreign women .
these are the names of the descendants of the priests who married foreign women :

greetings also from all those in god ’ s family who are with me .
i pray that god our father and the lord jesus christ will be good to you and give you peace .
jesus gave himself for our sins to free us from this evil world we live in . this is what god our father wanted .
the glory belongs to god forever and ever . amen .
there is no other message that is the good news , but some people are confusing you . they want to change the good news about christ .
brothers and sisters , i want you to know that the good news message i told you was not made up by anyone .
you have heard about my past life in the jewish religion . i persecuted the church of god very much . i tried to destroy his people .
but god had special plans for me even before i was born . so he chose me through his grace .
three years later i went to jerusalem to meet peter . i stayed with him 15 days .
i met no other apostles—only james , the brother of the lord .
god knows there is nothing untrue in any of this .
later , i went to the areas of syria and cilicia .
no one in any of christ ’ s churches in judea had ever met me before .
these believers praised god because of me .
after 14 years i went back to jerusalem with barnabas and took titus with me .
titus , who was with me , is a greek . but these leaders still did not force him to be circumcised .
but we did not agree with anything those false brothers wanted . we wanted the truth of the good news to continue for you .
they asked us to do only one thing—to remember to help those who are poor . and this was something that i really wanted to do .
when peter came to antioch , he did something that was not right . i stood against him , because he was wrong .
we are jews by birth . we were not born “ sinners , ” as we call those who are not jews .
but i would be wrong to begin teaching again those things that i gave up .
you began your life in christ with the spirit . now do you try to complete it by your own power ? that is foolish .
you have experienced many things . were all those experiences wasted ? i hope they were not wasted !
so you should know that the true children of abraham are those who have faith .
abraham believed this , and because he believed , he was blessed . all people who believe are blessed the same as abraham was .
the law does not depend on faith . no , it says that the only way a person will find life by the law is to obey its commands .
but when god gave the promise , there was no mediator , because a mediator is not needed when there is only one side , and god is one .
before this faith came , the law held us as prisoners . we had no freedom until god showed us the way of faith that was coming .
i mean the law was the guardian in charge of us until christ came . after he came , we could be made right with god through faith .
now that the way of faith has come , we no longer need the law to be our guardian .
it is the same for us . we were once like children , slaves to the useless rules of this world .
but when the right time came , god sent his son , who was born from a woman and lived under the law .
god did this so that he could buy the freedom of those who were under the law . god ’ s purpose was to make us his children .
now you are not slaves like before . you are god ’ s children , and you will receive everything he promised his children .
in the past you did not know god . you were slaves to gods that were not real .
it worries me that you follow teachings about special days , months , seasons , and years . i fear that my work for you has been wasted .
brothers and sisters , i became like you . so please become like me . you were very good to me before .
you know that i came to you the first time because i was sick . that was when i told the good news to you .
am i now your enemy because i tell you the truth ?
some of you people want to be under the law . tell me , do you know what the law says ?
but the heavenly jerusalem that is above is like the free woman , who is our mother .
my brothers and sisters , you are children who were born because of god ’ s promise , just as isaac was .
so , my brothers and sisters , we are not children of the slave woman . we are children of the free woman .
we have freedom now , because christ made us free . so stand strong in that freedom . don ’ t go back into slavery again .
listen ! i , paul , tell you that if you start following the law by being circumcised , then christ can not help you .
again , i warn everyone : if you allow yourselves to be circumcised , then you must follow the whole law .
if you try to be made right with god through the law , your life with christ is finished—you have left god ’ s grace .
i say this because our hope of being right with god comes through faith . and the spirit helps us feel sure as we wait for that hope .
you were doing so well . who caused you to stop following the truth ?
it certainly wasn ’ t the one who chose you .
be careful ! “ just a little yeast makes the whole batch of dough rise . ”
i trust in the lord that you will not believe those different ideas . someone is trying to confuse you . whoever it is will be punished .
i wish those people who are bothering you would add castration to their circumcision .
the whole law is made complete in this one command : “ love your neighbor the same as you love yourself . ”
if you continue hurting each other and tearing each other apart , be careful , or you will completely destroy each other .
so i tell you , live the way the spirit leads you . then you will not do the evil things your sinful self wants .
but if you let the spirit lead you , you are not under law .
the wrong things the sinful self does are clear : committing sexual sin , being morally bad , doing all kinds of shameful things ,
but the fruit that the spirit produces in a person ’ s life is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
gentleness , and self-control . there is no law against these kinds of things .
those who belong to christ jesus have crucified their sinful self . they have given up their old selfish feelings and the evil things they wanted to do .
we get our new life from the spirit , so we should follow the spirit .
we must not feel proud and boast about ourselves . we must not cause trouble for each other or be jealous of each other .
help each other with your troubles . when you do this , you are obeying the law of christ .
if you think you are too important to do this , you are only fooling yourself .
don ’ t compare yourself with others . just look at your own work to see if you have done anything to be proud of .
you must each accept the responsibilities that are yours .
whoever is being taught god ’ s word should share the good things they have with the one who is teaching them .
if you think you can fool god , you are only fooling yourselves . you will harvest what you plant .
we must not get tired of doing good . we will receive our harvest of eternal life at the right time . we must not give up .
this is my own handwriting . you can see how big the letters are .
it doesn ’ t matter if anyone is circumcised or not . the only thing that matters is this new life we have from god .
peace and mercy to those who follow this rule—to all god ’ s people .
so don ’ t give me any more trouble . i have scars on my body that show i belong to jesus .
my brothers and sisters , i pray that the grace of our lord jesus christ will be with your spirits . amen .
god created the sky and the earth . at first ,
the earth was completely empty . there was nothing on the earth . darkness covered the ocean , and god ’ s spirit moved over the water .
then god said , “ let there be light ! ” and light began to shine .
he saw the light , and he knew that it was good . then he separated the light from the darkness .
god named the light “ day , ” and he named the darkness “ night . ”
then god said , “ let there be a space to separate the water into two parts ! ”
so god made the space and separated the water . some of the water was above it , and some of the water was below it .
god named that space “ sky. ” there was evening , and then there was morning . this was the second day .
then god said , “ let the water under the sky be gathered together so that the dry land will appear. ” and it happened .
god named the dry land “ earth , ” and he named the water that was gathered together “ seas. ” and god saw that this was good .
there was evening , and then there was morning . this was the third day .
they will be in the sky to shine light on the earth. ” and it happened .
god put these lights in the sky to shine on the earth .
there was evening , and then there was morning . this was the fourth day .
then god said , “ let the water be filled with many living things , and let there be birds to fly in the air over the earth . ”
there was evening , and then there was morning . this was the fifth day .
so god created humans in his own image . he created them to be like himself . he created them male and female .
god looked at everything he had made . and he saw that everything was very good .
so the earth , the sky , and everything in them were finished .
god finished the work he was doing , so on the seventh day he rested from his work .
this is the story about the creation of the sky and the earth . this is what happened when the lord god made the earth and the sky .
so water came up from the earth and spread over the ground .
then the lord god planted a garden in the east , in a place named eden . he put the man he made in that garden .
a river flowed from eden and watered the garden . the river then separated and became four smaller rivers .
the name of the first river was pishon . this river flowed around the entire country of havilah .
( there is gold in that country , and that gold is pure . a kind of expensive perfume and onyx are also found there . )
the name of the second river was gihon . this river flowed around the whole land of cush .
the name of the third river was tigris . this river flowed east of assyria . the fourth river was the euphrates .
the lord god put the man in the garden of eden to work the soil and take care of the garden .
the lord god gave him this command : “ you may eat from any tree in the garden .
the lord god used the rib from the man to make a woman . then he brought the woman to the man .
and the man said ,
that is why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife . in this way two people become one .
the man and his wife were naked , but they were not ashamed .
the woman answered the snake , “ no , we can eat fruit from the trees in the garden .
but the snake said to the woman , “ you will not die .
god knows that if you eat the fruit from that tree you will learn about good and evil , and then you will be like god ! ”
the lord god called to the man and said , “ where are you ? ”
the man said , “ i heard you walking in the garden , and i was afraid . i was naked , so i hid . ”
the man said , “ the woman you put here with me gave me fruit from that tree . so i ate it . ”
then the lord god said to the woman , “ what have you done ? ”
so the lord god said to the snake ,
i will make you and the woman enemies to each other .
then god said to the woman ,
then god said to the man ,
the ground will grow thorns and weeds for you .
you will work hard for your food ,
adam named his wife eve . he gave her this name because eve would be the mother of everyone who ever lived .
the lord god used animal skins and made some clothes for the man and his wife . then he put the clothes on them .
so the lord god forced the man out of the garden of eden to work the ground he was made from .
eve gave birth again to cain ’ s brother abel . abel became a shepherd , and cain became a farmer .
but he did not accept cain and his offering . cain was sad because of this , and he became very angry .
the lord asked cain , “ why are you angry ? why does your face look sad ?
later , the lord said to cain , “ where is your brother abel ? ”
then cain said to the lord , “ this punishment is more than i can bear !
cain went away from the lord and lived in the land of nod .
enoch had a son named irad . irad had a son named mehujael . mehujael had a son named methushael . and methushael had a son named lamech .
lamech married two women . one wife was named adah , and the other was named zillah .
adah gave birth to jabal . jabal was the father of people who live in tents and earn their living by keeping cattle .
jabal was jubal ’ s brother . jubal was the father of people who play the harp and flute .
zillah gave birth to tubal-cain . tubal-cain was the father of people who work with bronze and iron . the sister of tubal-cain was named naamah .
lamech said to his wives ,
the punishment for killing cain was very bad .
seth also had a son . he named him enosh . at that time people began to pray to the lord .
this is the history of adam ’ s family . when god created people , he made them like himself .
he created them male and female . and on the same day he made them , he blessed them and called them “ humans . ”
after adam was 130 years old , he had another son . this son looked just like adam . adam named his son seth .
after seth was born , adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters .
so adam lived a total of 930 years ; then he died .
after seth was 105 years old , he had a son named enosh .
after enosh was born , seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters .
so seth lived a total of 912 years ; then he died .
after enosh was 90 years old , he had a son named kenan .
after kenan was born , enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters .
so enosh lived a total of 905 years ; then he died .
after kenan was 70 years old , he had a son named mahalalel .
after mahalalel was born , kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters .
so kenan lived a total of 910 years ; then he died .
when mahalalel was 65 years old , he had a son named jared .
after jared was born , mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters .
so mahalalel lived a total of 895 years ; then he died .
after jared was 162 years old , he had a son named enoch .
after enoch was born , jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters .
so jared lived a total of 962 years ; then he died .
after enoch was 65 years old , he had a son named methuselah .
after methuselah was born , enoch walked with god for 300 years and had other sons and daughters .
so enoch lived a total of 365 years .
one day enoch was walking with god , and he disappeared . god took him .
after methuselah was 187 years old , he had a son named lamech .
after lamech was born , methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters .
so methuselah lived a total of 969 years ; then he died .
when lamech was 182 years old , he had a son .
lamech named his son noah . lamech said , “ we work very hard as farmers because god cursed the ground . but noah will bring us rest . ”
after noah was born , lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters .
so lamech lived a total of 777 years ; then he died .
after noah was 500 years old , he had sons named shem , ham , and japheth .
the lord saw that the people on the earth were very evil . he saw that they thought only about evil things all the time .
the lord was sorry that he had made people on the earth . it made him very sad in his heart .
but noah pleased the lord .
this is the history of noah ’ s family . he was a good man all his life , and he always followed god .
noah had three sons : shem , ham , and japheth .
when god looked at the earth , he saw that people had ruined it . violence was everywhere , and it had ruined their life on earth .
use cypress wood and build a boat for yourself . make rooms in the boat and cover it with tar inside and out .
“ this is the size i want you to make the boat : 300 cubits long , 50 cubits wide , and 30 cubits high .
i will make a special agreement with you . you , your wife , your sons , and their wives will all go into the boat .
two of every kind of bird , animal , and creeping thing will come to you so that you might keep them alive .
also bring every kind of food into the boat , for you and for the animals . ”
noah did everything god commanded him .
noah did everything the lord told him to do .
noah was 600 years old at the time the rains came .
he and his family went into the boat to be saved from the flood . his wife and his sons and their wives were on the boat with him .
all the clean animals , all the other animals on the earth , the birds , and everything that crawls on the earth
went into the boat with noah . these animals went into the boat in groups of two , male and female , just as god commanded .
seven days later the flood started . the rain began to fall on the earth .
all these animals went into the boat with noah . they came in groups of two from every kind of animal that had the breath of life .
all these animals went into the boat in groups of two , just as god had commanded noah . then the lord closed the door behind noah .
water flooded the earth for 40 days . the water began rising and lifted the boat off the ground .
the water continued to rise , and the boat floated on the water high above the earth .
the water rose so much that even the highest mountains were covered by the water .
the water continued to rise above the mountains . the water was more than 20 feet above the highest mountain .
the water continued to cover the earth for 150 days .
rain stopped falling from the sky , and water stopped flowing from under the earth .
the water continued to go down , and by the first day of the tenth month , the tops of the mountains were above the water .
forty days later noah opened the window he had made in the boat .
then he sent out a raven . the raven flew from place to place until the ground was dry and the water was gone .
noah also sent out a dove . he wanted it to find dry ground . he wanted to know if water still covered the earth .
after seven days noah again sent out the dove .
seven days later noah sent the dove out again . but this time the dove didn ’ t come back .
by the 27th day of the second month , the ground was completely dry .
then god said to noah ,
“ leave the boat . you , your wife , your sons , and your sons ’ wives should go out now .
so noah went out with his sons , his wife , and his sons ’ wives .
all the animals , everything that crawls , and every bird left the boat . all the animals came out of the boat in family groups .
god blessed noah and his sons and said to them , “ have many children . fill the earth with your people .
but i give you one command . you must not eat meat that still has its life ( blood ) in it .
also , i will demand your blood for your lives . that is , i will demand the life of any person or animal that takes a human life .
“ god made humans to be like himself .
“ have many children and fill the earth with your people . ”
then god said to noah and his sons ,
“ i now make my promise to you and to your people who will live after you .
i am putting a rainbow in the clouds as proof of the agreement between me and the earth .
when i bring clouds over the earth , you will see the rainbow in the clouds .
so god said to noah , “ this rainbow is proof of the agreement that i made with all living things on earth . ”
these three men were noah ’ s sons . and all the people on earth came from these three sons .
noah became a farmer and planted a vineyard .
one day noah made some wine . he got drunk , went into his tent , and took off all his clothes .
ham , the father of canaan , saw that his father was naked and told his brothers who were outside the tent .
shem and japheth took a robe , put it across their shoulders , and walked backward into the tent . then they covered their father without looking at him .
later , noah woke up . ( he was sleeping because of the wine . ) when he learned what his youngest son ham had done to him ,
may god give more land to japheth .
after the flood noah lived 350 years .
he lived a total of 950 years ; then he died .
this is the history of the families of shem , ham , and japheth . they are noah ’ s sons . these men had children after the flood .
japheth ’ s sons were gomer , magog , madai , javan , tubal , meshech , and tiras .
gomer ’ s sons were ashkenaz , riphath , and togarmah .
javan ’ s sons were elishah , tarshish , kittim , and dodanim .
ham ’ s sons were cush , mizraim , put , and canaan .
cush ’ s sons were seba , havilah , sabtah , raamah , and sabteca .
cush also had a son named nimrod who became a very powerful man on earth .
nimrod ’ s kingdom spread from babylon to erech , to akkad , and then to calneh in the land of babylonia .
nimrod also went into assyria . in assyria , nimrod built the cities of nineveh , rehoboth ir , calah , and
resen . ( resen is the city between nineveh and calah , the big city . )
mizraim was the father of the people of lud , anam , lehab , naphtuh ,
pathrus , casluh , and caphtor . ( the philistine people came from casluh . )
canaan was the father of sidon . sidon was canaan ’ s first son . canaan was also the father of the hittites ,
jebusites , amorites , girgashites ,
hivites , arkites , the sinites ,
arvadites , zemarites , and hamathites .
all these people were descendants of ham . they are arranged by families , languages , countries , and nations .
shem was japheth ’ s older brother . one of shem ’ s descendants was eber , the father of all the hebrew people .
shem ’ s sons were elam , asshur , arphaxad , lud , and aram .
aram ’ s sons were uz , hul , gether , and mash .
arphaxad was the father of shelah .
joktan was the father of almodad , sheleph , hazarmaveth , jerah ,
hadoram , uzal , diklah ,
obal , abimael , sheba ,
ophir , havilah , and jobab . all these people were joktan ’ s sons .
they lived in the area between mesha and the hill country in the east . mesha was toward the country of sephar .
these are the people from the family of shem . they are arranged by families , languages , countries , and nations .
there was a time when the whole world spoke one language . everyone used the same words .
then people began to move from the east . they found a plain in the land of babylonia and stayed there to live .
then the lord came down to see the city and the tower .
let ’ s go down and confuse their language . then they will not understand each other . ”
so people stopped building the city , and the lord scattered them all over the earth .
this is the history of shem ’ s family . two years after the flood , when shem was 100 years old , his son arphaxad was born .
after that shem lived 500 years . he had other sons and daughters .
when arphaxad was 35 years old , his son shelah was born .
after shelah was born , arphaxad lived 403 years . during that time he had other sons and daughters .
after shelah was 30 years old , his son eber was born .
after eber was born , shelah lived 403 years . during that time he had other sons and daughters .
after eber was 34 years old , his son peleg was born .
after peleg was born , eber lived another 430 years . during that time he had other sons and daughters .
after peleg was 30 years old , his son reu was born .
after reu was born , peleg lived another 209 years . during that time he had other sons and daughters .
after reu was 32 years old , his son serug was born .
after serug was born , reu lived another 207 years . during that time he had other sons and daughters .
after serug was 30 years old , his son nahor was born .
after nahor was born , serug lived another 200 years . during that time he had other sons and daughters .
after nahor was 29 years old , his son terah was born .
after terah was born , nahor lived another 119 years . during that time he had other sons and daughters .
after terah was 70 years old , his sons abram , nahor , and haran were born .
this is the history of terah ’ s family . terah was the father of abram , nahor , and haran . haran was the father of lot .
haran died in his hometown , ur of babylonia , while his father terah was still alive .
sarai did not have any children because she was not able to have children .
terah lived to be 205 years old . he died in haran .
i will build a great nation from you .
i will bless those who bless you ,
so abram left haran just like the lord said , and lot went with him . abram was 75 years old when he left haran .
the lord appeared to abram and said , “ i will give this land to your descendants . ”
then he moved on toward the negev , stopping for a time at several places on the way .
during this time there was not enough food in the land , so abram went down to egypt to live .
just before they arrived in egypt , abram told sarai , “ look , i know that you are a very beautiful woman .
so tell them that you are my sister . then they will be good to me because of you . in this way you will save my life . ”
so when abram went into egypt , the egyptian men saw that sarai was a very beautiful woman .
even some of pharaoh ’ s officials noticed her and told pharaoh how beautiful she was . so they took her to pharaoh ’ s house .
pharaoh took abram ’ s wife , so the lord caused pharaoh and all the people in his house to have very bad diseases .
then pharaoh commanded his men to lead abram out of egypt . so abram and his wife left that place and took everything they had with them .
so abram left egypt . he traveled through the negev with his wife and everything he owned . lot was also with them .
at this time abram was very rich . he had many animals and much silver and gold .
this was where abram had built an altar earlier . so he worshiped the lord there .
during this time lot was also traveling with abram . lot had many animals and tents .
abram and lot had so many animals that the land could not support both of them together .
( the canaanites and the perizzites were also living in this land at the same time . ) the shepherds of abram and lot began to argue .
so abram said to lot , “ there should be no arguing between you and me or between your people and my people . we are all brothers .
so lot chose to live in the jordan valley . the two men separated , and lot began traveling east .
abram stayed in the land of canaan , and lot lived among the cities in the valley . lot moved as far as sodom and made his camp there .
the lord knew that the people of sodom were very evil sinners .
after lot left , the lord said to abram , “ look around you . look north , south , east , west .
all this land that you see i will give to you and your people who live after you . this will be your land forever .
so go . walk through your land . i now give it to you . ”
amraphel was the king of babylonia , arioch was the king of ellasar , kedorlaomer was the king of elam , and tidal was the king of goiim .
all these kings joined their armies in the valley of siddim . ( the valley of siddim is now the salt sea . )
these kings had served kedorlaomer for twelve years . but in the 13th year , they all rebelled against him .
and they defeated the horites who lived in the area from the hill country of seir to el paran . ( el paran is near the desert . )
so kedorlaomer and his armies took everything that the people of sodom and gomorrah owned . they took all their food and clothing and left .
lot , the son of abram ’ s brother , was living in sodom , and they captured him . they also took everything he owned and left .
that night he and his men made a surprise attack against the enemy . they defeated them and chased them to hobah , north of damascus .
then abram brought back everything the enemy had stolen , as well as the women and servants , his nephew lot , and everything lot owned .
melchizedek , the king of salem and a priest of god most high , also went to meet abram . he brought bread and wine .
he blessed abram and said ,
and we praise god most high ,
then the king of sodom told abram , “ give me my people who were captured . but you can keep everything else . ”
but abram said to the king of sodom , “ i promise to the lord , the god most high , the one who made heaven and earth .
abram said , “ you have given me no son , so a slave born in my house will get everything i have . ”
abram believed the lord , and because of this faith the lord accepted him as one who has done what is right .
but abram said , “ lord god , how can i be sure that i will get this land ? ”
later , large birds flew down to eat the animals , but abram chased them away .
the sun began to go down and abram got very sleepy . while he was asleep , a very terrible darkness came over him .
but then i will punish the nation that made them slaves . your people will leave that land , and they will take many good things with them .
“ you yourself will live to be very old . you will die in peace and will be buried with your family .
this is the land of the kenites , kenizzites , kadmonites ,
hittites , perizzites , rephaites ,
amorites , canaanites , girgashites , and jebusites . ”
sarai was abram ’ s wife , but she did not have any children . she had an egyptian slave named hagar .
so after living ten years in the land of canaan , sarai gave her egyptian slave to abram as a second wife .
the angel of the lord found hagar near a spring of water in the desert . the spring was by the road to shur .
the angel said , “ hagar , sarai ’ s slave girl , why are you here ? where are you going ? ”
the angel of the lord said to her , “ sarai is your owner . go home to her and obey her . ”
the angel of the lord also said , “ from you will come many people—too many people to count . ”
then the angel of the lord said ,
ishmael will be wild and free
so the well there was called beer lahai roi . it is between kadesh and bered .
hagar gave birth to abram ’ s son , and abram named the son ishmael .
abram was 86 years old when ishmael was born from hagar .
when abram was 99 years old , the lord appeared to him . he said , “ i am god all-powerful . obey me and live the right way .
if you do this , i will prepare an agreement between us . i will promise to make your people a great nation . ”
then abram bowed down before god . god said to him ,
“ this is my part of our agreement : i will make you the father of many nations .
i will change your name from abram to abraham , because i am making you the father of many nations .
i will give you many descendants . new nations and kings will come from you .
then god said to abraham , “ now , this is your part of the agreement : you and all your descendants will obey my agreement .
this is my agreement that all of you must obey . this is the agreement between me and you and all your descendants . every male must be circumcised .
you will cut the skin to show that you follow the agreement between me and you .
so every baby boy in your nation will be circumcised . every boy who is born from your family or bought as a slave will be circumcised .
god said to abraham , “ i will give sarai , your wife , a new name . her new name will be sarah .
then abraham said to god , “ i hope ishmael will live and serve you . ”
but i will make my agreement with isaac , the son who sarah will have . he will be born at this same time next year . ”
after god finished talking with abraham , god went up into heaven .
abraham was 99 years old when he was circumcised .
and ishmael , his son , was 13 years old when he was circumcised .
abraham and his son were circumcised on the same day .
he looked up and saw three men standing in front of him . when he saw the men , he ran to them and bowed before them .
abraham said , “ sirs , please stay a while with me , your servant .
i will bring some water to wash your feet . you can rest under the trees .
i will get some food for you , and you can eat as much as you want . then you can continue your journey . ”
abraham hurried to the tent . he said to sarah , “ quickly , prepare enough flour for three loaves of bread . ”
then the men said to abraham , “ where is your wife sarah ? ”
then one of them said , “ i will come again in the spring . at that time your wife sarah will have a son . ”
abraham and sarah were very old . sarah was past the right age for women to have children .
so she laughed to herself and said , “ i am old , and my husband is old . i am too old to have a baby . ”
then the lord said to abraham , “ sarah laughed and said she was too old to have a baby .
sarah said , “ i didn ’ t laugh ! ” ( she said this because she was afraid . )
then the men got up to leave . they looked toward sodom and began walking in that direction . abraham walked with them to send them on their way .
the lord said to himself , “ should i tell abraham what i am going to do now ?
abraham will become a great and powerful nation , and all the nations on earth will be blessed because of him .
then the lord said , “ i have heard many times that the people of sodom and gomorrah are very evil .
i will go and see if they are as bad as i have heard . then i will know for sure . ”
so the men turned and started walking toward sodom while abraham stood there before the lord .
then abraham approached him and asked , “ will you destroy the good people while you are destroying those who are evil ?
then the lord said , “ if i find fifty good people in the city of sodom , i will save the whole city . ”
then abraham said , “ compared to you , lord , i am only dust and ashes . but let me bother you again and ask you this question .
what if there are five less than fifty ? will you destroy a whole city because of just five people ? ”
abraham spoke again . he said , “ and if you find only forty good people there , will you destroy the city ? ”
then abraham said , “ lord , may i bother you again and ask , what if there are twenty good people ? ”
the lord finished speaking to abraham and left . then abraham went back home .
“ where are the two men who came to you tonight ? bring them out to us . we want to have sex with them . ”
lot went outside and closed the door behind him .
he said to the men , “ no , my friends , i beg you , please don ’ t do this evil thing !
but the two men staying with lot opened the door , pulled him back inside the house , and closed the door .
we are going to destroy this city . the lord heard how evil this city is , so he sent us to destroy it . ”
but lot said to the two men , “ sirs , please don ’ t force me to run so far !
look , there is a very small town near here . let me run to that town . i can run there and be safe . ”
the angel said to lot , “ very well , i ’ ll let you do that . i will not destroy that town .
lot was entering the town as the sun came up ,
and the lord began to destroy sodom and gomorrah . he caused fire and burning sulfur to fall from the sky .
he destroyed the whole valley—all the cities , the people living in the cities , and all the plants in the valley .
lot ’ s wife was following behind him and looked back at the city . when she did , she became a block of salt .
early the next morning , abraham got up and went to the place where he stood before the lord .
abraham looked down into the valley toward the cities of sodom and gomorrah . he saw clouds of smoke rising from the land , like smoke from a furnace .
god destroyed the cities in the valley , but he remembered what abraham had said . so god sent lot away from those cities before destroying them .
lot was afraid to stay in zoar , so he and his two daughters went to live in the mountains in a cave .
both of lot ’ s daughters became pregnant . their father was the father of their babies .
the older daughter gave birth to a son . she named him moab . moab is the ancestor of all the moabites living today .
the younger daughter also gave birth to a son . she named him ben-ammi . ben-ammi is the ancestor of all the ammonites living today .
abraham left that place and traveled to the negev . he settled in the city of gerar , between kadesh and shur . while in gerar ,
abraham told people that sarah was his sister . king abimelech of gerar heard this . abimelech wanted sarah , so he sent some servants to take her .
but one night god spoke to abimelech in a dream and said , “ you will die . the woman you took is married . ”
but abimelech had not yet slept with sarah , so he said , “ lord , i am not guilty . would you kill an innocent man ?
so very early the next morning , abimelech called all his servants and told them about the dream . the servants were very afraid .
what were you afraid of ? why did you do this to me ? ”
then abraham said , “ i thought no one in this place respected god . i thought someone would kill me to get sarah .
she is my wife , but she is also my sister . she is the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother .
so abimelech gave sarah back to abraham . abimelech also gave abraham some sheep , cattle , and slaves .
and abimelech said , “ look all around you . this is my land . you may live any place you want . ”
the lord came back to visit sarah as he said he would , and he kept his promise to her .
at exactly the time god said it would happen , sarah became pregnant and gave birth to a son for abraham in his old age .
abraham named his son isaac .
abraham did what god commanded and circumcised isaac when he was eight days old .
abraham was 100 years old when his son isaac was born .
sarah said , “ god has made me happy , and everyone who hears about this will be happy with me .
isaac continued to grow , and soon he was old enough to begin eating solid food . so abraham gave a big party .
sarah saw hagar ’ s son playing . ( hagar was the egyptian slave woman who gave birth to abraham ’ s first son . )
this upset abraham very much . he was worried about his son ishmael .
but i will also bless the son of your slave woman . he is your son , so i will make a great nation from his family also . ”
after some time , when all their drinking water was gone , hagar put her son under a bush .
go help the boy . hold his hand and lead him . i will make him the father of many people . ”
his mother found a wife for him in egypt . they continued to live in the paran desert .
and abraham said , “ i promise to treat you the same way you have treated me . ”
then abraham complained to abimelech because abimelech ’ s servants had captured a well of water .
but abimelech said , “ i don ’ t know who did this . you never told me about this before today ! ”
so abraham and abimelech made an agreement . abraham gave abimelech some sheep and cattle as proof of the agreement .
abraham also put seven female lambs in front of abimelech .
abimelech asked abraham , “ why did you put these seven female lambs by themselves ? ”
abraham answered , “ when you accept these lambs from me , it will be proof that i dug this well . ”
so after that , the well was called beersheba . abraham gave the well this name because it was the place where they made a promise to each other .
so abraham and abimelech made an agreement at beersheba . then abimelech and phicol , his military commander , went back to the country of the philistines .
abraham planted a special tree at beersheba and prayed to the lord , the god who lives forever .
and abraham lived as a stranger for a long time in the country of the philistines .
after these things god decided to test abraham ’ s faith . god said to him , “ abraham ! ”
after they traveled three days , abraham looked up , and in the distance he saw the place where they were going .
isaac said to his father abraham , “ father ! ”
abraham answered , “ god himself is providing the lamb for the sacrifice , my son . ”
then abraham reached for his knife to kill his son .
but the angel of the lord stopped him . the angel called from heaven and said , “ abraham , abraham ! ”
the angel of the lord called to abraham from heaven a second time .
every nation on the earth will be blessed through your descendants . i will do this because you obeyed me . ”
then abraham went back to his servants . they all traveled back to beersheba , and abraham stayed there .
after all these things happened , a message was sent to abraham . it said , “ your brother nahor and his wife milcah have children now .
the first son is uz . the second son is buz . the third son is kemuel , the father of aram .
then there are kesed , hazo , pildash , jidlaph , and bethuel . ”
bethuel was the father of rebekah . milcah was the mother of these eight sons , and nahor was the father . nahor was abraham ’ s brother .
also nahor had four other sons from his slave woman reumah . the sons were tebah , gaham , tahash , and maacah .
sarah lived to be 127 years old .
she died in the city of kiriath arba ( hebron ) in the land of canaan . abraham was very sad and cried for her there .
then he left his dead wife and went to talk to the hittites . he said ,
the hittites answered abraham ,
abraham got up and bowed to the people .
he said to them , “ if you really want to help me bury my dead wife , speak to ephron the son of zohar for me .
ephron was sitting there among the people . he answered abraham ,
abraham bowed before the hittites .
“ sir , listen to me . ten pounds of silver mean nothing to you or me . take the land and bury your dead wife . ”
after this , abraham buried his wife sarah in the cave of that field near mamre ( hebron ) in the land of canaan .
abraham bought the field and the cave in it from the hittites . so this became his property to be used as a burial place .
abraham lived to be a very old man . the lord blessed him and everything he did .
abraham ’ s oldest servant was in charge of everything he owned . abraham called that servant to him and said , “ put your hand under my leg .
go back to my country , to my own people , to find a wife for my son isaac . bring her here to him . ”
abraham said to him , “ no , don ’ t take my son to that place .
if the girl refuses to come with you , you will be free from this promise . but you must not take my son back to that place . ”
so the servant put his hand under his master ’ s leg and made the promise .
here i am , standing by this well of water , and the young women from the city are coming out to get water .
then the servant ran to her and said , “ please give me a little water to drink from your jar . ”
rebekah quickly lowered the jar from her shoulder and gave him a drink . she said , “ drink this , sir . ”
as soon as she finished giving him something to drink , rebekah said , “ i will also pour some water for your camels . ”
the servant quietly watched her . he wanted to be sure that the lord had given him an answer and had made his trip successful .
the servant asked , “ who is your father ? and is there a place in your father ’ s house for me and my men to sleep ? ”
rebekah answered , “ my father is bethuel , the son of milcah and nahor . ”
then she said , “ yes , we have straw and other food for your camels and a place for you to sleep . ”
the servant bowed and worshiped the lord .
then rebekah ran and told her family about all these things .
the servant said , “ i am abraham ’ s servant .
so you must promise to go to my father ’ s country . go to my family and choose a wife for my son . ’
i said to my master , ‘ maybe the woman will not come back to this place with me . ’
“ today i came to this well and said , ‘ lord , god of my master abraham , please make my trip successful .
then laban and bethuel answered , “ we see that this is from the lord , so there is nothing we can say to change it .
here is rebekah . take her and go . let her marry your master ’ s son . this is what the lord wants . ”
when abraham ’ s servant heard this , he bowed to the ground before the lord .
rebekah ’ s brother and mother said , “ we will call rebekah and ask her what she wants to do . ”
they called her and asked her , “ do you want to go with this man now ? ”
so they allowed rebekah to go with abraham ’ s servant and his men . her nurse also went with them .
while rebekah was leaving they said to her ,
then rebekah and her nurse got on the camels and followed the servant and his men . so the servant took rebekah and left .
isaac had left beer lahai roi and was now living in the negev .
one evening he went out to the field to think . he looked up and saw the camels coming from far away .
rebekah also looked and saw isaac . then she jumped down from the camel .
she said to the servant , “ who is that young man walking in the field to meet us ? ”
the servant told isaac everything that had happened .
abraham married again . his new wife was named keturah .
she gave birth to zimran , jokshan , medan , midian , ishbak , and shuah .
jokshan was the father of sheba and dedan . the people of asshur , leum , and letush were descendants of dedan .
the sons of midian were ephah , epher , hanoch , abida , and eldaah . all these sons came from the marriage of abraham and keturah .
abraham lived to be 175 years old .
then he grew weak and died . he had lived a long and satisfying life . he died and went to be with his people .
this is the same cave that abraham bought from the hittites . he was buried there with his wife sarah .
after abraham died , god blessed isaac . isaac was living at beer lahai roi .
this is the list of ishmael ’ s family . ishmael was abraham and hagar ’ s son . ( hagar was sarah ’ s egyptian maid . )
these are the names of ishmael ’ s sons : the first son was nebaioth ; then kedar was born , then adbeel , mibsam ,
mishma , dumah , massa ,
hadad , tema , jetur , naphish , and kedemah .
ishmael lived to be 137 years old . then he died and went to be with his people .
this is the story of isaac . abraham had a son named isaac .
while rebekah was pregnant , the babies inside her struggled with one another . she prayed to the lord and said , “ what is happening to me ? ”
the lord said to her ,
when the right time came , rebekah gave birth to twins .
the first baby was red . his skin was like a hairy robe . so he was named esau .
isaac loved esau . he liked to eat the animals esau killed . but rebekah loved jacob .
one day esau came back from hunting . he was tired and weak from hunger . jacob was boiling a pot of beans .
but jacob said , “ you must sell me your rights as the firstborn son . ”
esau said , “ i am almost dead with hunger , so what good are these rights to me now ? ”
the lord spoke to isaac and said , “ don ’ t go down to egypt . live in the land that i commanded you to live in .
i will do this because your father abraham obeyed my words and did what i said . he obeyed my commands , my laws , and my rules . ”
so isaac settled in gerar .
after isaac had lived there a long time , abimelech looked out of his window and saw isaac and his wife enjoying one another .
abimelech called for isaac and said , “ this woman is your wife . why did you tell us that she was your sister ? ”
isaac planted fields in that place , and that year he gathered a great harvest . the lord blessed him very much .
isaac became rich . he gathered more and more wealth until he became a very rich man .
he had many flocks and herds of animals . he also had many slaves . all the philistines were jealous of him .
so they destroyed all the wells that isaac ’ s father abraham and his servants had dug many years before . they filled them with sand .
abimelech said to isaac , “ leave our country . you have become much more powerful than we are . ”
so isaac left that place and camped near the little river of gerar . he stayed there and lived .
isaac ’ s servants also dug a well near the little river and found fresh water .
then isaac ’ s servants dug another well . but there was an argument over this well too . so isaac named that well sitnah .
from there isaac went to beersheba .
so isaac built an altar and worshiped the lord in that place . he set up camp there , and his servants dug a well .
abimelech came from gerar to see isaac . he brought with him ahuzzath , his advisor , and phicol , the commander of his army .
isaac asked , “ why have you come to see me ? you were not friendly to me before . you even forced me to leave your country . ”
so isaac gave a party for them . they all ate and drank .
early the next morning each man made a promise and a vow . then the men left in peace .
so isaac named it shibah . and that city is still called beersheba .
when esau was 40 years old , he married two hittite women . one was judith the daughter of beeri . the other was basemath the daughter of elon .
these marriages made isaac and rebekah very unhappy .
isaac said , “ i am old . maybe i will die soon .
so take your bow and arrows and go hunting . kill an animal for me to eat .
prepare the food that i love . bring it to me , and i will eat it . then i will bless you before i die . ”
so esau went hunting .
rebekah said to her son jacob , “ listen , i heard your father talking to your brother esau .
so listen , son , and do what i tell you .
go out to our goats and bring me two young ones . i will prepare them the way your father loves them .
then you will carry the food to your father , and he will bless you before he dies . ”
but jacob told his mother rebekah , “ my brother esau is a hairy man . i am not hairy like him .
so rebekah said to him , “ i will accept the blame if there is trouble . do what i said . go get the goats for me . ”
so jacob went out and got two goats and brought them to his mother . his mother cooked the goats in the special way that isaac loved .
then rebekah took the clothes that her older son esau loved to wear . she put these clothes on the younger son jacob .
she took the skins of the goats and put them on jacob ’ s hands and on his neck .
then she got the food she had cooked and gave it to jacob .
jacob went to his father and said , “ father . ”
but isaac said to his son , “ how have you hunted and killed the animals so quickly ? ”
isaac did not know it was jacob , because his arms were hairy like esau ’ s . so isaac blessed jacob .
isaac said , “ are you really my son esau ? ”
then isaac said to him . “ son , come near and kiss me . ”
so jacob went to his father and kissed him . when isaac smelled esau ’ s clothes , he blessed him and said ,
may god give you plenty of rain ,
may the nations serve you
isaac finished blessing jacob . then , just as jacob left his father isaac , esau came in from hunting .
but isaac said to him , “ who are you ? ”
isaac said , “ your brother tricked me ! he came and took your blessing ! ”
but esau continued to beg his father . “ do you have only one blessing , father ? bless me also , father ! ” esau began to cry .
then isaac said to him ,
you will have to fight to live ,
so , son , do what i say . my brother laban is living in haran . go to him and hide .
stay with him for a short time until your brother stops being angry .
isaac called jacob and blessed him . then isaac gave him a command and said , “ you must not marry a canaanite woman .
i pray that god all-powerful will bless you and give you many children . i pray that you will become the father of a great nation
esau learned that jacob obeyed his father and his mother and went to paddan aram .
esau saw from this that his father did not want his sons to marry canaanite women .
jacob left beersheba and went to haran .
jacob was afraid and said , “ this is a very great place . this is the house of god . this is the gate to heaven . ”
the name of that place was luz , but jacob named it bethel .
and if i return in peace to my father ’ s house—if he does all these things—then the lord will be my god .
then jacob continued his trip . he went to the country in the east .
jacob said to the shepherds there , “ brothers , where are you from ? ”
then jacob said , “ do you know laban , the son of nahor ? ”
then jacob said , “ how is he ? ”
while jacob was talking with the shepherds , rachel came with her father ’ s sheep . ( it was her job to take care of the sheep . )
then jacob kissed rachel and cried .
then laban said , “ this is wonderful ! you are from my own family. ” so jacob stayed with laban for a month .
now laban had two daughters . the older was leah and the younger was rachel .
leah ’ s eyes were gentle , but rachel was beautiful .
jacob loved rachel , so he said to laban , “ i will work seven years for you if you will allow me to marry your daughter rachel . ”
laban said , “ it would be better for her to marry you than someone else . so stay with me . ”
so jacob stayed and worked for laban for seven years . but it seemed like a very short time because he loved rachel very much .
after seven years jacob said to laban , “ give me rachel so that i can marry her . my time of work for you is finished . ”
so laban gave a party for all the people in that place .
that night laban brought his daughter leah to jacob . jacob and leah had sexual relations together .
( laban gave his maid zilpah to his daughter to be her maid . )
laban said , “ in our country we don ’ t allow the younger daughter to marry before the older daughter .
continue for the full week of the marriage ceremony , and i will also give you rachel to marry . but you must serve me another seven years . ”
so jacob did this and finished the week . then laban gave him his daughter rachel as a wife .
( laban gave his maid bilhah to his daughter rachel to be her maid . )
so jacob had sexual relations with rachel also . and jacob loved rachel more than leah . jacob worked for laban for another seven years .
the lord saw that jacob loved rachel more than leah , so he made it possible for leah to have children . but rachel did not have any children .
jacob became angry with rachel and said , “ i am not god . he is the one who has caused you to not have children . ”
so rachel gave bilhah to her husband jacob . he had sexual relations with bilhah .
she became pregnant and gave birth to a son for jacob .
rachel said , “ god has listened to my prayer . he decided to give me a son. ” so she named this son dan .
bilhah became pregnant again and gave jacob a second son .
rachel said , “ i have fought hard to compete with my sister , and i have won. ” so she named that son naphtali .
leah saw that she could have no more children . so she gave her slave girl zilpah to jacob .
then zilpah had a son .
leah said , “ i am lucky. ” so she named the son gad .
zilpah gave birth to another son .
leah said , “ i am very happy ! now women will call me happy. ” so she named that son asher .
leah answered , “ you have already taken away my husband . now you are trying to take away my son ’ s flowers . ”
then god allowed leah to become pregnant again . she gave birth to a fifth son .
she said , “ god has given me a reward because i gave my slave to my husband. ” so she named her son issachar .
leah became pregnant again and gave birth to a sixth son .
later , leah gave birth to a daughter . she named her dinah .
then god heard rachel ’ s prayer and made it possible for rachel to have children .
she became pregnant and gave birth to a son . she said , “ god has taken away my shame . ”
rachel named the son joseph , saying , “ may the lord give me another son . ”
after the birth of joseph , jacob said to laban , “ now let me go back to my own homeland .
give me my wives and my children . i have earned them by working for you . you know that i served you well . ”
laban said to him , “ please , let me say something . i know that the lord has blessed me because of you .
tell me what i should pay you , and i will give it to you . ”
jacob answered , “ you know that i have worked hard for you . your flocks have grown and been well while i cared for them .
laban asked , “ then what should i give you ? ”
laban answered , “ i agree to that . we will do what you ask . ”
then jacob cut green branches from poplar and almond trees . he stripped off some of the bark so that the branches had white stripes on them .
he put the branches in front of the flocks at the watering places . when the animals came to drink , they also mated in that place .
then when the goats mated in front of the branches , the young that were born were spotted , striped , or black .
jacob separated the spotted and the black animals from the other animals in the flock . he kept his animals separate from laban ’ s .
any time the stronger animals in the flock were mating , jacob put the branches before their eyes . the animals mated near those branches .
in this way jacob became very rich . he had large flocks , many servants , camels , and donkeys .
then jacob noticed that laban was not as friendly as he had been in the past .
the lord said to jacob , “ go back to your own land where your ancestors lived . i will be with you . ”
so jacob told rachel and leah to meet him in the field where he kept his flocks of sheep and goats .
you both know that i have worked as hard as i could for your father .
but he cheated me . he has changed my pay ten times . but during all this time , god protected me from all of laban ’ s tricks .
so god has taken the animals away from your father and has given them to me .
the angel of god spoke to me in that dream . the angel said , ‘ jacob ! ’
rachel and leah answered jacob , “ our father has nothing to give us when he dies .
he treated us like strangers . he sold us to you , and then he spent all the money that should have been ours .
so jacob prepared for the trip . he put his children and his wives on camels .
while laban was gone to cut the wool from his sheep , rachel went into his house and stole the false gods that belonged to her father .
jacob tricked laban the aramean . he did not tell laban he was leaving .
jacob took his family and everything he owned and left quickly . they crossed the euphrates river and traveled toward the hill country of gilead .
three days later laban learned that jacob had run away .
so he gathered his men together and began to chase jacob . after seven days laban found jacob near the hill country of gilead .
that night god came to laban in a dream and said , “ be careful ! be careful of every word you say to jacob . ”
laban said to jacob , “ why did you trick me ? why did you take my daughters like they were women you captured during war ?
you didn ’ t even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye . you were very foolish to do this !
i know that you want to go back to your home . that is why you left . but why did you steal the gods from my house ? ”
jacob answered , “ i left without telling you , because i was afraid . i thought you would take your daughters away from me .
in the daytime the sun took away my strength , and at night sleep was taken from my eyes by the cold .
so i am ready to make an agreement with you . we will set up a pile of stones to show that we have an agreement . ”
so jacob found a large rock and put it there to show that he had made an agreement .
he told his men to find some more rocks and to make a pile of rocks . then they ate beside the pile of rocks .
laban named that place yegar sahadutha . but jacob named that place galeed .
laban said to jacob , “ this pile of rocks will help us both remember our agreement. ” that is why jacob called the place galeed .
then laban said , “ let the lord watch over us while we are separated from each other. ” so that place was also named mizpah .
then laban said , “ if you hurt my daughters , remember that god will punish you . if you marry other women , remember that god is watching .
here are the rocks that i have put between us , and here is the special rock to show that we made an agreement .
may the god of abraham , the god of nahor , and the god of their ancestors judge us guilty if we break this agreement . ”
early the next morning laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters goodbye . he blessed them and went back home .
jacob also left that place . while he was traveling , he saw god ’ s angels .
when he saw them , he said , “ this is god ’ s camp ! ” so jacob named that place mahanaim .
jacob ’ s brother esau was living in the area called seir in the hill country of edom . jacob sent messengers to esau .
he told them , “ tell this to my master esau : ‘ your servant jacob says , i have lived with laban all these years .
i have many cattle , donkeys , flocks , and servants . sir , i am sending you this message to ask you to accept us . ’ ”
jacob was very frightened and worried . he divided the people who were with him and all the flocks , herds , and camels into two groups .
jacob thought , “ if esau comes and destroys one group , the other group can run away and be saved . ”
jacob stayed in that place for the night . he prepared some things to give to esau as a gift .
he took 200 female goats and 20 male goats , 200 female sheep and 20 male sheep .
he took 30 camels and their colts , 40 cows and 10 bulls , 20 female donkeys and 10 male donkeys .
you will say , ‘ this is a gift to you , and your servant jacob is behind us . ’ ”
so jacob sent the gifts to esau , but he stayed that night in the camp .
during the night , jacob got up and began moving his two wives , his two maids , and his eleven sons across the jabbok river at the crossing .
after he sent his family across the river , he sent across everything he had .
jacob was left alone , and a man came and wrestled with him . the man fought with him until the sun came up .
when the man saw that he could not defeat jacob , he touched jacob ’ s leg and put it out of joint .
then the man said to jacob , “ let me go . the sun is coming up . ”
and the man said to him , “ what is your name ? ”
then jacob asked him , “ please tell me your name . ”
so jacob named that place peniel . he said , “ at this place , i saw god face to face , but my life was spared . ”
then the sun came up as jacob left peniel . he was limping because of his leg .
jacob put the maids with their children first . then he put leah and her children behind them , and he put rachel and joseph in the last place .
jacob himself went out before them . while he was walking toward his brother esau , he bowed down to the ground seven times .
esau looked up and saw the women and children . he said , “ who are all these people with you ? ”
then the two maids and the children with them went to esau . they bowed down before him .
then leah and the children with her went to esau and bowed down . and then rachel and joseph went to him and bowed down .
esau said , “ who were all those people i saw while i was coming here ? and what were all those animals for ? ”
but esau said , “ you don ’ t have to give me gifts , brother . i have enough for myself . ”
then esau said , “ now you can continue your journey . i will go with you . ”
so esau said , “ then i will leave some of my men to help you . ”
so that day esau started on his trip back to seir .
but jacob went to succoth . there he built a house for himself and small barns for his cattle . that is why the place was named succoth .
jacob safely ended his trip from paddan aram when he came to the town of shechem in canaan . he made his camp in a field near the city .
he bought the field where he camped from the family of hamor , father of shechem . he paid 100 pieces of silver for it .
he built an altar there to honor god . he named the place “ el , the god of israel . ”
one day , dinah , the daughter of leah and jacob , went out to see the women of that place .
she was seen by shechem , the son of hamor the hivite , who ruled that area . shechem took dinah and raped her .
but he was so attracted to her that he fell in love and began expressing his feelings to her .
he told his father , “ please get this girl for me so that i can marry her . ”
then shechem ’ s father , hamor , came out to talk with jacob .
but hamor talked to dinah ’ s brothers and said , “ my son shechem wants dinah very much . please let him marry her .
this marriage will show we have a special agreement . then our men can marry your women , and your men can marry our women .
you can live in the same land with us . you will be free to own the land and to trade here . ”
shechem also talked to jacob and to dinah ’ s brothers and said , “ please accept me . i will do anything you ask me to do .
jacob ’ s sons decided to lie to shechem and his father because shechem had done such a bad thing to their sister dinah .
the brothers said to them , “ we can not allow our sister to marry you because you are not yet circumcised . that would bring us shame .
but we will allow you to marry her if you do this one thing : every man in your town must be circumcised like us .
then your men can marry our women , and our men can marry your women . then we will become one people .
if you refuse to be circumcised , we will take dinah away . ”
this agreement made hamor and shechem very happy .
shechem was very happy to do what dinah ’ s brothers asked .
hamor and shechem went to the meeting place of their city . they spoke to the men of the city and said ,
but there is one thing that all our men must agree to do . they must agree to be circumcised as they are .
all the men who heard this in the meeting place agreed with hamor and shechem . and every man was circumcised at that time .
dinah ’ s brothers , simeon and levi , killed hamor and his son shechem . then they took dinah out of shechem ’ s house and left .
jacob ’ s sons went to the city and stole everything that was there because of what shechem had done to their sister .
so the brothers took all their animals , all their donkeys , and everything else in the city and in the fields .
the brothers took everything those people owned . they even took their wives and children .
but the brothers said , “ should we let these people treat our sister like a prostitute ? they were wrong to do that to our sister ! ”
so jacob and his people went to luz , which is now called bethel . it is in the land of canaan .
deborah , rebekah ’ s nurse , died there . they buried her under the oak tree at bethel . they named that place allon bacuth .
when jacob came back from paddan aram , god appeared to him again . god blessed jacob
i gave abraham and isaac some special land . now i give the land to you and to all your people who will live after you . ”
then god left that place .
jacob and his group left bethel . before they came to ephrath , rachel began giving birth to her baby .
rachel died while giving birth to the son . before dying , she named the boy benoni . but jacob called him benjamin .
rachel was buried on the road to ephrath ( that is , bethlehem ) .
jacob put a special rock on rachel ’ s grave to honor her . that special rock is still there today .
then israel continued his journey . he camped just south of eder tower .
his firstborn son was reuben , whose mother was leah . jacob ’ s other sons by leah were simeon , levi , judah , issachar , and zebulun .
his sons by rachel were joseph and benjamin .
his sons by bilhah , rachel ’ s maid , were dan and naphtali .
his sons by zilpah , leah ’ s maid , were gad and asher .
jacob went to his father isaac at mamre in kiriath arba ( hebron ) . this is where abraham and isaac had lived .
isaac lived 180 years .
this is the history of the family of esau ( edom ) .
basemath , ishmael ’ s daughter , the sister of nebaioth .
esau and adah had a son named eliphaz . basemath had a son named reuel .
oholibamah had three sons : jeush , jalam , and korah . these were esau ’ s sons who were born in the land of canaan .
esau is the father of the people of edom . these are the names of esau ’ s family living in the hill country of seir :
esau and adah ’ s son was eliphaz . esau and basemath ’ s son was reuel .
eliphaz had five sons : teman , omar , zepho , gatam , and kenaz .
eliphaz also had a slave woman named timna . timna and eliphaz had a son named amalek .
reuel had four sons : nahath , zerah , shammah , and mizzah .
these are the family groups that came from esau :
korah , gatam , and amalek .
esau ’ s son reuel was the father of these families : nahath , zerah , shammah , and mizzah .
esau ’ s wife oholibamah , daughter of anah , gave birth to jeush , jalam , and korah . these three men were the leaders of their families .
they were all sons of esau and leaders of the family groups of edom .
seir , a horite man , lived in edom before esau . these are the sons of seir :
dishon , ezer , and dishan . these sons were all horite family leaders from seir in edom .
lotan was the father of hori and heman . ( timna was lotan ’ s sister . )
shobal was the father of alvan , manahath , ebal , shepho , and onam .
anah was the father of dishon and oholibamah .
dishon had four sons . they were hemdan , eshban , ithran , and keran .
ezer had three sons . they were bilhan , zaavan , and akan .
dishan had two sons . they were uz and aran .
these are the names of the leaders of the horite families : lotan , shobal , zibeon , anah ,
dishon , ezer , and dishan . these men were the leaders of the families that lived in the country of seir .
at that time there were kings in edom . edom had kings a long time before israel did .
bela son of beor was a king who ruled in edom . he ruled over the city of dinhabah .
when bela died , jobab became king . jobab was the son of zerah from bozrah .
when jobab died , husham ruled . husham was from the land of the temanites .
when hadad died , samlah ruled that country . samlah was from masrekah .
when samlah died , shaul ruled that area . shaul was from rehoboth by the river .
when shaul died , baal hanan ruled that country . baal hanan was the son of acbor .
esau was the father of these edomite families :
jacob stayed and lived in the land of canaan . this is the same land where his father had lived .
this is the story of jacob ’ s family .
one time joseph had a special dream . later , he told his brothers about this dream , and after that his brothers hated him even more .
joseph said , “ i had a dream .
joseph ’ s brothers continued to be jealous of him , but his father thought about all these things and wondered what they could mean .
one day joseph ’ s brothers went to shechem to care for their father ’ s sheep .
jacob said to joseph , “ go to shechem . your brothers are there with my sheep . ”
at shechem , joseph got lost . a man found him wandering in the fields . the man said , “ what are you looking for ? ”
joseph answered , “ i am looking for my brothers . can you tell me where they are with their sheep ? ”
joseph ’ s brothers saw him coming from far away . they decided to make a plan to kill him .
they said to each other , “ here comes joseph the dreamer .
but reuben wanted to save joseph . he said , “ let ’ s not kill him .
we can put him into a well without hurting him. ” reuben planned to save joseph and send him back to his father .
when joseph came to his brothers , they attacked him and tore off his long and beautiful coat .
then they threw him into an empty well that was dry .
so judah said to his brothers , “ what profit will we get if we kill our brother and hide his death ?
we will profit more if we sell him to these traders . then we will not be guilty of killing our own brother. ” the other brothers agreed .
reuben went to the brothers and said , “ the boy is not in the well ! what will i do ? ”
the brothers killed a goat and put the goat ’ s blood on joseph ’ s beautiful coat .
then the brothers showed the coat to their father . and the brothers said , “ we found this coat . is this joseph ’ s coat ? ”
the midianite traders later sold joseph in egypt . they sold him to potiphar , an officer of the king of egypt and the captain of his palace guards .
about that time , judah left his brothers and went to stay with a man named hirah from the town of adullam .
judah met a canaanite girl there and married her . the girl ’ s father was named shua .
the canaanite girl gave birth to a son and named him er .
later , she gave birth to another son and named him onan .
then she had another son named shelah . judah lived in kezib when his third son was born .
judah chose a woman named tamar to be the wife of his first son er .
but er did many bad things . the lord was not happy with him , so the lord killed him .
this made the lord angry . so he killed onan also .
tamar learned that judah , her father-in-law , was going to timnah to cut the wool from his sheep .
so he went to her and said , “ let me have sex with you. ” ( judah did not know that she was tamar , his daughter-in-law . )
judah answered , “ i will send you a young goat from my flock . ”
judah asked , “ what do you want me to give you as proof that i will send you the goat ? ”
then tamar went home , took off her veil that covered her face , and again put on the special clothes that showed she was a widow .
he asked some of the men at the town of enaim , “ where is the prostitute who was here by the road ? ”
about three months later , someone told judah , “ your daughter-in-law tamar sinned like a prostitute , and now she is pregnant . ”
the time came for tamar to give birth . she was going to have twins .
after this , the other baby was born . this was the baby with the red string on his hand . they named him zerah .
the traders who bought joseph took him down to egypt . they sold him to the captain of pharaoh ’ s guard , potiphar .
the lord helped joseph become a successful man . joseph lived in the house of his master , potiphar the egyptian .
potiphar saw that the lord was with joseph and that the lord helped joseph be successful in everything he did .
so potiphar allowed joseph to take responsibility for everything in the house . potiphar didn ’ t have to worry about anything except deciding what to eat .
but joseph refused . he said , “ my master trusts me with everything in his house . he has given me responsibility for everything here .
the woman talked with joseph every day , but he refused to sleep with her .
one day joseph went into the house to do his work . he was the only man in the house at the time .
the woman saw that joseph had left his coat in her hand and had run out of the house .
my scream scared him and he ran away , but he left his coat with me . ”
then she kept his coat until her husband , joseph ’ s master , came home .
she told her husband the same story . she said , “ this hebrew slave you brought here tried to attack me !
but when he came near me , i screamed . he ran away , but he left his coat . ”
joseph ’ s master listened to what his wife said , and he became very angry .
so potiphar put joseph into the prison where the king ’ s enemies were held , and that is where joseph remained .
the lord was with joseph and continued to show his kindness to him , so the commander of the prison guards began to like joseph .
the commander of the guards put joseph in charge of all the prisoners . joseph was their leader , but he still did the same work they did .
later , two of pharaoh ’ s servants did something wrong to pharaoh . these servants were the baker and the man who served wine to pharaoh .
pharaoh became angry with his baker and wine server ,
so he put them in the same prison as joseph . potiphar , the commander of pharaoh ’ s guards , was in charge of this prison .
the commander put the two prisoners under joseph ’ s care . the two men continued to stay in prison for some time .
one night both of the prisoners had a dream . the baker and the wine server each had his own dream , and each dream had its own meaning .
joseph went to them the next morning and saw that the two men were worried .
he asked them , “ why do you look so worried today ? ”
so the wine server told joseph his dream . the server said , “ i dreamed i saw a vine .
on the vine there were three branches . i watched the branches grow flowers and then become grapes .
i was holding pharaoh ’ s cup , so i took the grapes and squeezed the juice into the cup . then i gave the cup to pharaoh . ”
then joseph said , “ i will explain the dream to you . the three branches mean three days .
i was kidnapped and taken from the land of my people , the hebrews . i have done nothing wrong ! i should not be in prison . ”
in the top basket there were all kinds of baked food for the king , but birds were eating this food . ”
joseph answered , “ i will tell you what the dream means . the three baskets mean three days .
he freed the wine server and gave him his job back , and once again the wine server put a cup of wine in pharaoh ’ s hand .
but pharaoh hanged the baker , and everything happened the way joseph said it would .
but the wine server did not remember to help joseph . he said nothing about him to pharaoh . the wine server forgot about joseph .
two years later pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the nile river .
in the dream , seven cows came out of the river and stood there eating grass . they were healthy , good-looking cows .
the seven sick cows ate the seven healthy cows . then pharaoh woke up .
then he saw seven more heads of grain sprouting , but they were thin and scorched by the hot wind .
the thin heads of grain ate the seven good heads of grain . then pharaoh woke up again and realized it was only a dream .
then the wine servant remembered joseph and said to pharaoh , “ i remember something that happened to me .
you were angry with the baker and me , and you put us in prison .
then one night he and i had a dream . each dream had a different meaning .
joseph answered , “ i can not ! but god can explain the dream for you , pharaoh . ”
then pharaoh said to joseph , “ in my dream i was standing by the nile river .
seven cows came up out of the river and stood there eating the grass . they were healthy , good-looking cows .
the thin , sick cows ate the first healthy cows ,
“ in my next dream i saw seven heads of grain growing on one plant . they were healthy and full of grain .
and then seven more heads of grain grew after them , but they were thin and scorched by the hot wind .
then the thin heads of grain ate the seven good heads of grain .
then joseph said to pharaoh , “ both of these dreams have the same meaning . god is telling you what will happen soon .
the seven good cows and the seven good heads of grain are seven good years .
god has shown you what will happen soon . he will make these things happen just as i told you .
for seven years there will be plenty of food in egypt .
it will be so bad that people will forget what it was like to have plenty of food .
so , pharaoh , you should choose a wise , intelligent man and put him in charge of egypt .
then during the seven years of hunger , there will be food for the country of egypt . and egypt will not be destroyed by the famine . ”
this seemed like a very good idea to pharaoh , and all his officials agreed .
so pharaoh said to joseph , “ god showed these things to you , so you must be the wisest man .
pharaoh said to joseph , “ i now make you governor over all of egypt . ”
joseph was 30 years old when he began serving the king of egypt . he traveled throughout the country of egypt .
during the seven good years , the crops in egypt grew very well .
joseph stored so much grain that it was like the sands of the sea . he stored so much grain that it could not be measured .
for seven years people had all the food they needed , but those years ended .
the famine began , and the people cried to pharaoh for food . pharaoh said to the egyptian people , “ go ask joseph what to do . ”
but the famine was bad everywhere . so people from the countries around egypt had to come to joseph in egypt to buy grain .
i have heard that there is grain for sale in egypt . go there and buy grain for us so that we will live and not die ! ”
so ten of joseph ’ s brothers went to egypt to buy grain .
jacob did not send benjamin . ( benjamin was joseph ’ s only full brother . ) jacob was afraid that something bad might happen to benjamin .
joseph recognized his brothers , but they did not know who he was .
then joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed about his brothers .
but the brothers said to him , “ no , sir , we come as your servants . we have come only to buy food .
we are all brothers—we all have the same father . we are honest men . we have come only to buy food . ”
then joseph said to them , “ no , you have come to spy on us ! ”
but joseph said to them , “ no ! i can see that i am right . you are spies .
then joseph put them all in prison for three days .
after three days joseph said to them , “ i am a god-fearing man . do this , and i will let you live .
if you are honest men , one of your brothers can stay here in prison , and the others can go and carry grain back to your people .
so the brothers put the grain on their donkeys and left .
the brothers went back to their father jacob in the land of canaan . they told him about everything that had happened .
they said , “ the governor of that country spoke rudely to us . he thought that we were spies !
we told him , ‘ we are honest men , not spies .
the famine was very bad in that country .
if you send benjamin with us , we will go down and buy grain .
but if you refuse to send benjamin , we will not go . the man warned us to not come back without him . ”
israel said , “ why did you tell him you had another brother ? why did you do such a bad thing to me ? ”
if you had let us go before , we could have already made two trips for food . ”
take benjamin , and go back to the man .
the servant did as he was told . he brought the men into joseph ’ s house .
so the brothers went to the servant in charge of joseph ’ s house .
they said , “ sir , i promise this is the truth . the last time we came , we came to buy food .
the servant led the men into joseph ’ s house . he gave them water , and they washed their feet . then he fed their donkeys .
the brothers heard that they were going to eat with joseph , so they worked until noon preparing their gifts for him .
when joseph came home , the brothers gave him the gifts they had brought with them . then they bowed down to the ground in front of him .
joseph asked them how they were doing . then he said , “ how is your elderly father you told me about ? is he still alive ? ”
the brothers answered , “ yes , sir , our father is still alive. ” and they again bowed before joseph .
then joseph washed his face and came out . he regained control of himself and said , “ now it is time to eat . ”
put the youngest brother ’ s money in his sack too . but also put my special silver cup in his sack. ” so the servant obeyed joseph .
early the next morning the brothers and their donkeys were sent back to their country .
my master drinks from that cup , and he uses it to learn secret things . what you did was wrong ! ’ ”
so the servant obeyed . he rode out to the brothers and stopped them . the servant said to them what joseph had told him to say .
but the brothers said to the servant , “ why does the governor say these things ? we wouldn ’ t do anything like that !
we brought back the money that we found in our sacks before . so surely we wouldn ’ t steal silver or gold from your master ’ s house .
if you find the silver cup in any of our sacks , let that man die . you can kill him , and we will be your slaves . ”
then every brother quickly opened his sack on the ground .
the servant started looking in the sacks . he started with the oldest brother and ended with the youngest . he found the cup in benjamin ’ s sack .
the brothers were very sad . they tore their clothes to show their sadness . they put their sacks back on the donkeys and went back to the city .
when judah and his brothers went back to joseph ’ s house , joseph was still there . the brothers fell to the ground and bowed down before him .
when we were here before , you asked us , ‘ do you have a father or a brother ? ’
then you said to us , ‘ bring that brother to me . i want to see him . ’
but you said to us , ‘ you must bring your youngest brother , or i will not sell you grain again . ’
so we went back to our father and told him what you said .
“ later , our father said , ‘ go back and buy us some more food . ’
then my father said to us , ‘ you know that my wife rachel gave me two sons .
i let one son go away , and he was killed by a wild animal . and i haven ’ t seen him since .
if you take my other son away from me , and something happens to him , i will be sad enough to die . ’
now , imagine what will happen when we go home without our youngest brother—he is the most important thing in our father ’ s life !
so now i beg you , please let the boy go back with his brothers , and i will stay and be your slave .
i can not go back to my father if the boy is not with me . i am very afraid of what would happen to my father . ”
joseph continued to cry , and all the egyptian people in pharaoh ’ s house heard it .
this terrible famine has continued for two years now , and there will be five more years without planting or harvest .
so god sent me here ahead of you so that i can save your people in this country .
you can live near me in the land of goshen . you , your children , your grandchildren , and all of your animals are welcome here .
i will take care of you during the next five years of hunger . so you and your family will not lose everything you own . ’
“ surely you can see that i really am joseph . even my brother benjamin knows it is me , your brother , talking to you .
then joseph hugged his brother benjamin , and they both began crying .
then joseph cried as he kissed all his brothers . after this , the brothers began talking with him .
pharaoh learned that joseph ’ s brothers had come to him . this news spread throughout pharaoh ’ s house . pharaoh and his servants were very excited !
so pharaoh told joseph , “ tell your brothers to take all the food they need and go back to the land of canaan .
don ’ t worry about bringing all of their belongings . we can give them the best of egypt . ”
so the sons of israel did this . joseph gave them good wagons just as pharaoh had promised . and joseph gave them enough food for their trip .
he gave each brother a suit of beautiful clothes . but to benjamin he gave five suits of beautiful clothes and 300 pieces of silver .
so the brothers left egypt and went to their father in the land of canaan .
they told him , “ father , joseph is still alive ! and he is the governor over the whole country of egypt . ”
israel said , “ now i believe you . my son joseph is still alive ! i am going to see him before i die ! ”
so israel began his trip to egypt . first he went to beersheba . there he worshiped god , the god of his father isaac . he offered sacrifices .
during the night god spoke to israel in a dream and said , “ jacob , jacob . ”
they also had their cattle and everything they owned in the land of canaan . so israel went to egypt with all his children and his family .
with him were his sons and his grandsons , his daughters and his granddaughters . all of his family went with him .
these are the names of israel ’ s sons and family who went to egypt with him :
reuben ’ s sons were hanoch , pallu , hezron , and carmi .
levi ’ s sons were gershon , kohath , and merari .
issachar ’ s sons were tola , puah , job , and shimron .
zebulun ’ s sons were sered , elon , and jahleel .
gad ’ s sons were zephon , haggi , shuni , ezbon , eri , arodi , and areli .
asher ’ s sons were imnah , ishvah , ishvi , beriah , and their sister serah . also there were beriah ’ s sons , heber and malkiel .
benjamin ’ s sons were bela , beker , ashbel , gera , naaman , ehi , rosh , muppim , huppim , and ard .
these were the sons of jacob from his wife rachel . there were 14 people in this family .
dan ’ s son was hushim .
naphtali ’ s sons were jahziel , guni , jezer , and shillem .
also , joseph had two sons in egypt . with these two grandsons , jacob ’ s family in egypt numbered 70 people in all .
jacob sent judah ahead to speak to joseph . judah went to joseph in the land of goshen . then jacob and his people followed into the land .
then israel said to joseph , “ now i can die in peace . i have seen your face , and i know that you are still alive . ”
they are a family of shepherds . they have always kept sheep and cattle . they have brought all their animals and everything they own with them . ’
when pharaoh calls you , he will ask , ‘ what work do you do ? ’
joseph chose five of his brothers to be with him before the pharaoh .
pharaoh said to the brothers , “ what work do you do ? ”
then pharaoh said to joseph , “ your father and your brothers have come to you .
then joseph called his father jacob to come in to meet pharaoh . jacob blessed pharaoh .
then pharaoh said to him , “ how old are you ? ”
then jacob blessed pharaoh and left from his meeting with him .
joseph also gave his father , his brothers , and all their people the food they needed .
the famine got worse ; there was no food anywhere in the land . egypt and canaan became very poor because of this bad time .
people in the land bought more and more grain . joseph saved the money and brought it to pharaoh ’ s house .
but joseph answered , “ give me your cattle , and i will give you food . ”
so the people used their cattle and horses and all their other animals to buy food . and that year , joseph gave them food and took their animals .
so joseph bought all the land in egypt for pharaoh . all the people in egypt sold joseph their fields . they did this because they were very hungry .
and everywhere in egypt all the people became pharaoh ’ s slaves .
the people said , “ you have saved our lives . we are happy to be slaves to pharaoh . ”
israel stayed in egypt . he lived in the land of goshen . his family grew and became very large . they became landowners there and did very well .
jacob lived in egypt 17 years , so he was 147 years old .
bury me in the place where my ancestors are buried . carry me out of egypt and bury me in our family grave . ”
some time later joseph learned that his father was very sick . so he took his two sons , manasseh and ephraim , and went to his father .
then israel said to joseph , “ god all-powerful appeared to me at luz in the land of canaan . god blessed me there .
then israel saw joseph ’ s sons . israel said , “ who are these boys ? ”
joseph said to his father , “ these are my sons . these are the boys god gave me . ”
israel was old and his eyes were not good . so joseph brought the boys close to his father . israel kissed and hugged the boys .
then joseph took the boys off israel ’ s lap , and they bowed down in front of his father .
and israel blessed joseph and said ,
he was the angel who saved me from all my troubles .
joseph said to his father , “ you have your right hand on the wrong boy . manasseh is the firstborn . put your right hand on him . ”
so israel blessed them that day . he said ,
“ children of jacob , gather around .
“ reuben , my first son , you are my strength ,
but your passion was like a flood you couldn ’ t control .
“ simeon and levi are brothers .
i will not join their secret meetings .
their anger is so strong that it is a curse .
“ judah , your brothers will praise you .
judah is like a young lion .
men from judah ’ s family will be kings .
he ties his donkeys to the best grapevines .
his eyes are red from drinking wine .
“ zebulun will live near the sea .
“ issachar is like a donkey that has worked too hard .
he will see his land is pleasant
“ dan will rule his people
dan will be like a snake at the side of the road .
“ lord , i am waiting for your salvation .
“ a group of robbers will attack gad ,
“ asher ’ s land will grow much good food .
“ naphtali is like a deer running free ,
“ joseph is like a wild donkey ,
people attacked him and made life hard for him .
but he won the fight
the god of your father who helps you .
my parents had many good things happen to them .
“ benjamin is like a hungry wolf .
these are the twelve families of israel . and this is what their father said to them . he gave each son a blessing that was right for him .
that cave is in the field that was bought from the hittites . ”
after jacob finished talking to his sons , he lay down , put his feet back on the bed , and died .
when israel died , joseph was very sad . he hugged his father and cried over him and kissed him .
after the time of sadness was finished , joseph spoke to pharaoh ’ s officers and said , “ please tell this to pharaoh :
pharaoh answered , “ keep your promise . go and bury your father . ”
so joseph went to bury his father . all of pharaoh ’ s officials , personal advisors , and all the older leaders of egypt went with joseph .
so there was a large crowd of people with him . there was even a group of soldiers riding in chariots and some on horses .
they went to goren atad , east of the jordan river . there they had a long funeral service for israel , which continued for seven days .
so jacob ’ s sons did what their father told them .
after joseph buried his father , he and everyone in the group with him went back to egypt .
so the brothers sent this message to joseph : “ before your father died , he told us to give you a message .
his brothers went to him and bowed down in front of him . they said , “ we will be your servants . ”
then joseph said to them , “ don ’ t be afraid . i am not god ! i have no right to punish you .
joseph continued to live in egypt with his father ’ s family . he died when he was 110 years old .
during joseph ’ s life ephraim had children and grandchildren . and his son manasseh had a son named makir . joseph lived to see makir ’ s children .
joseph died in egypt when he was 110 years old . doctors prepared his body for burial and put the body in a coffin in egypt .
this is the message that was given to habakkuk the prophet .
lord , i continue to ask for help . when will you listen to me ? i cried to you about the violence , but you did nothing !
people are stealing things and hurting others . they are arguing and fighting . why do you make me look at these terrible things ?
the babylonians will scare the other people . they will do what they want to do and go where they want to go .
then they will leave like the wind and go on to fight against other places . the only thing the babylonians worship is their own strength . ”
lord , you are the one who lives forever !
your eyes are too good to look at evil .
you made people like fish in the sea .
the enemy catches all of them with hooks and nets .
his net helps him live like the rich
will he continue to take riches with his net ?
i will stand like a guard and watch .
the lord answered me , “ write down what i show you . write it clearly on a sign so that the message will be easy to read .
this message can not help those who refuse to listen to it , but those who are good will live because they believe it .
you planned shameful things , and that will bring shame to your own family . you have done wrong , and it will cost you your life .
the stones of the walls will cry out against you . even the wooden rafters in your own house will prove that you are wrong .
“ look at them ! they kill people to build their city and do wicked things to make their walled city strong .
but the lord all-powerful has decided that a fire will destroy everything that those people worked to build . all their work will be for nothing .
then people everywhere will know about the glory of the lord . this news will spread just as water spreads out into the sea .
but the lord is in his holy temple , so the whole earth should be silent in his presence and show him respect .
the prayer of habakkuk the prophet .
lord , i have heard the news about you .
god is coming from teman .
rays of light shine from his hand , a bright , shining light .
the sickness went before him ,
he stood and judged the earth .
i saw that the cities of cushan were in trouble
lord , were you angry at the rivers ?
even then you showed your rainbow .
the mountains saw you and shook .
the sun and the moon lost their brightness .
in anger you walked on the earth
you came to save your people
you used moses ’ walking stick
but you marched your horses
my whole body shook when i heard the story .
figs might not grow on the fig trees ,
but i will still be glad in the lord
the lord god gives me my strength .
this is what the lord all-powerful said , “ the people say it is not yet the right time to build the lord ’ s temple . ”
again haggai received a message from the lord . haggai spoke this message :
now the lord all-powerful says , ‘ think about what is happening .
the lord all-powerful said , “ think about what you are doing .
that is why the sky holds back its dew and why the earth holds back its crops .
then haggai , the lord ’ s messenger , delivered this message to the people : “ the lord says , ‘ i am with you ! ’ ”
so they began this work on the 24th day of the sixth month in the second year darius was the king .
on the 21st day of the seventh month , this message from the lord came to haggai :
‘ all their silver really belongs to me ! and all the gold is mine ! ’ this is what the lord all-powerful said .
on the 24th day of the ninth month in the second year darius was king of persia , this message from the lord came to haggai the prophet :
“ the lord all-powerful commands you to ask the priests what the law says about these things :
then haggai said , “ whoever touches a dead body will become unclean . now if they touch anything else , will it also become unclean ? ”
“ ‘ think about what has happened to you . think about how things were before you began working on the lord ’ s temple .
another message from the lord came to haggai on the 24th day of the month . this is the message :
“ go to zerubbabel , the governor of judah and tell him that i will shake heaven and earth .
in the past god spoke to our people through the prophets . he spoke to them many times and in many different ways .
the son became much greater than the angels , and god gave him a name that is much greater than any of their names .
god never said this to any of the angels :
and then , when god presents his firstborn son to the world , he says ,
this is what god said about the angels :
but this is what he said about his son :
you love what is right and hate what is wrong .
these things will disappear , but you will stay .
you will fold them up like a coat ,
and god never said this to an angel :
all the angels are spirits who serve god and are sent to help those who will receive salvation .
so we must be more careful to follow what we were taught . we must be careful so that we will not be pulled away from the true way .
god did not choose angels to be the rulers over the new world that was coming . that future world is the world we have been talking about .
it is written some place in the scriptures ,
for a short time you made him lower than the angels .
you put everything under his control . ”
jesus became like these people and died so that he could free them . they were like slaves all their lives because of their fear of death .
clearly , it is not angels that jesus helps . he helps the people who are from abraham .
and now he can help those who are tempted . he is able to help because he himself suffered and was tempted .
every house is built by someone , but god built everything .
moses was faithful as a servant in god ’ s whole house . he told people what god would say in the future .
so it is just as the holy spirit says :
don ’ t be stubborn as you were in the past ,
for 40 years in the desert , your people saw what i did .
so i was angry with them .
so i was angry and made a promise :
so , brothers and sisters , be careful that none of you has the evil thoughts that cause so much doubt that you stop following the living god .
we have the honor of sharing in all that christ has if we continue until the end to have the sure faith we had in the beginning .
that ’ s why the spirit said ,
who were those who heard god ’ s voice and turned against him ? it was all the people moses led out of egypt .
and who was god angry with for 40 years ? he was angry with those who sinned . and their dead bodies were left in the desert .
so we see that they were not allowed to enter and have god ’ s rest , because they did not believe .
only we who believe it are able to enter god ’ s place of rest . as god said ,
but in the scripture above god said , “ they will never enter my place of rest . ”
this shows that the seventh-day rest for god ’ s people is still to come .
the high priest has his own weaknesses . so he is able to be gentle with those who do wrong out of ignorance .
he offers sacrifices for their sins , but he must also offer sacrifices for his own sins .
to be a high priest is an honor . but no one chooses himself for this work . that person must be chosen by god just as aaron was .
and in another part of the scriptures god says ,
jesus was the son of god , but he still suffered , and through his sufferings he learned to obey whatever god says .
this made him the perfect high priest , who provides the way for everyone who obeys him to be saved forever .
god made him high priest , just like melchizedek .
we have many things to tell you about this . but it is hard to explain because you have stopped trying to understand .
anyone who lives on milk is still a baby and is not able to understand much about living right .
but solid food is for people who have grown up . from their experience they have learned to see the difference between good and evil .
and that ’ s what we will do if god allows .
he said , “ i will surely bless you . i will give you many descendants . ”
abraham waited patiently for this to happen , and later he received what god promised .
these two things can not change : god can not lie when he says something , and he can not lie when he makes an oath .
this hope is like an anchor for us . it is strong and sure and keeps us safe . it goes behind the curtain .
jesus has already entered there and opened the way for us . he has become the high priest forever , just like melchizedek .
then abraham gave him a tenth of everything he had .
you can see that melchizedek was very great . abraham , our great ancestor , gave him a tenth of everything he won in battle .
and everyone knows that the more important person always blesses the less important person .
levi was not yet born , but he already existed in his ancestor abraham when melchizedek met him .
and when a different kind of priest comes , then the law must be changed too .
and these things become even clearer when we see that another priest has come who is like melchizedek .
this is what the scriptures say about him : “ you are a priest forever—the kind of priest melchizedek was . ”
the old rule is now ended because it was weak and worthless .
but christ became a priest with god ’ s oath . god said to him ,
so this means that jesus is the guarantee of a better agreement from god to his people .
also , when one of those other priests died , he could not continue being a priest . so there were many of those priests .
but jesus lives forever . he will never stop serving as a priest .
every high priest has the work of offering gifts and sacrifices to god . so our high priest must also offer something to god .
if there was nothing wrong with the first agreement , then there would be no need for a second agreement .
but god found something wrong with the people . he said ,
it will not be like the agreement
this is the new agreement i will give the people of israel .
never again will anyone have to teach their neighbors
and i will forgive the wrongs they have done ,
god called this a new agreement , so he has made the first agreement old . and anything that is old and useless is ready to disappear .
the first agreement had rules for worship and a place for worship here on earth .
behind the second curtain was a room called the most holy place .
everything in the tent was made ready in the way i have explained . then the priests went into the first room every day to do their worship duties .
the holy spirit uses those two separate rooms to teach us that the way into the most holy place was not open while the first room was still there .
when someone dies and leaves a will , there must be proof that the one who wrote the will is dead .
a will means nothing while the one who wrote it is still living . it can be used only after that person ’ s death .
that is why blood was needed to begin the first agreement between god and his people .
then he said , “ this is the blood that makes the agreement good—the agreement that god commanded you to follow . ”
in the same way , moses sprinkled the blood on the holy tent . he sprinkled the blood over everything used in worship .
the law says that almost everything must be made clean by blood . sins can not be forgiven without a blood sacrifice .
everyone must die once . then they are judged .
but that ’ s not what happens . their sacrifices make them remember their sins every year ,
because it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
so when christ came into the world he said ,
you are not pleased with the sacrifices of animals killed and burned
then i said , ‘ here i am , god .
every day the priests stand and do their religious service . again and again they offer the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins .
but christ offered only one sacrifice for sins , and that sacrifice is good for all time . then he sat down at the right side of god .
and now christ waits there for his enemies to be put under his power .
with one sacrifice christ made his people perfect forever . they are the ones who are being made holy .
the holy spirit also tells us about this . first he says ,
“ this is the agreement i will make
and after everything is forgiven , there is no more need for a sacrifice to pay for sins .
we enter through a new way that jesus opened for us . it is a living way that leads through the curtain—christ ’ s body .
and we have a great priest who rules the house of god .
we must hold on to the hope we have , never hesitating to tell people about it . we can trust god to do what he promised .
we should think about each other to see how we can encourage each other to show love and do good works .
if we decide to continue sinning after we have learned the truth , then there is no other sacrifice that will take away sins .
it is a terrible thing to face punishment from the living god .
remember the days when you first learned the truth . you had a hard struggle with much suffering , but you continued strong .
sometimes people said hateful things to you and mistreated you in public . and sometimes you helped others who were being treated that same way .
so don ’ t lose the courage that you had in the past . your courage will be rewarded richly .
you must be patient . after you have done what god wants , you will get what he promised you .
the person who is right with me
but we are not those who turn back and are lost . no , we are the people who have faith and are saved .
faith is what makes real the things we hope for . it is proof of what we can not see .
god was pleased with the people who lived a long time ago because they had faith like this .
without faith no one can please god . whoever comes to god must believe that he is real and that he rewards those who sincerely try to find him .
abraham was waiting for the city that has real foundations . he was waiting for the city that is planned and built by god .
when people accept something like that , they show they are waiting for a country that will be their own .
if they were thinking about the country they had left , they could have gone back .
isaac blessed the future of jacob and esau . he did that because he had faith .
some were laughed at and beaten . others were tied up and put in prison .
the world was not good enough for these great people . they had to wander in deserts and mountains , living in caves and holes in the ground .
god was pleased with all of them because of their faith . but not one of them received god ’ s great promise .
you are struggling against sin , but you have not had to give up your life for the cause .
you are children of god , and he speaks words of comfort to you . you have forgotten these words :
the lord disciplines everyone he loves ;
so , if you never receive the discipline that every child must have , you are not true children and don ’ t really belong to god .
you have become weak , so make yourselves strong again .
live in the right way so that you will be saved and your weakness will not cause you to be lost .
try to live in peace with everyone . and try to keep your lives free from sin . anyone whose life is not holy will never see the lord .
they did not want to hear the command : “ if anything , even an animal , touches the mountain , it must be killed with stones . ”
what they saw was so terrible that moses said , “ i am shaking with fear . ”
because our god is like a fire that can destroy us .
continue loving each other as brothers and sisters in christ .
always remember to help people by welcoming them into your home . some people have done that and have helped angels without knowing it .
keep your lives free from the love of money . and be satisfied with what you have . god has said ,
so we can feel sure and say ,
remember your leaders . they taught god ’ s message to you . remember how they lived and died , and copy their faith .
jesus christ is the same yesterday , today , and forever .
we have a sacrifice . and those priests who serve in the holy tent can not eat from the sacrifice we have .
so jesus also suffered outside the city . he died to make his people holy with his own blood .
so we should go to jesus outside the camp and accept the same shame that he had .
here on earth we don ’ t have a city that lasts forever . but we are waiting for the city that we will have in the future .
so through jesus we should never stop offering our sacrifice to god . that sacrifice is our praise , coming from lips that speak his name .
and don ’ t forget to do good and to share what you have with others , because sacrifices like these are very pleasing to god .
continue praying for us . we feel right about what we do , because we always try to do what is best .
and i beg you to pray that god will send me back to you soon . i want this more than anything else .
i want you to know that our brother timothy is out of prison . if he comes to me soon , we will both come to see you .
give my greetings to all your leaders and to all god ’ s people . all those from italy send you their greetings .
god ’ s grace be with you all .
so hosea married gomer daughter of diblaim . she became pregnant and gave birth to a son for hosea .
and at that time i will break israel ’ s bow at jezreel valley . ”
after gomer had finished nursing lo-ruhamah , she became pregnant again and gave birth to a son .
then the lord said , “ name him lo-ammi , because you are not my people , and i am not your god . ”
i will have no pity on her children because they are the children of prostitution .
“ so i , the lord , will speak romantic words to her . i will lead her into the desert and speak tender words .
this is what the lord says .
i will take the names of those false gods out of her mouth . then people will not use those names again .
and i will make you my bride forever . i will make you my bride with goodness and justice and with love and mercy .
i will make you my faithful bride . then you will really know the lord .
and at that time i will answer. ” this is what the lord says .
the earth will produce grain , wine , and oil ,
i will sow her many seeds on her land .
so i bought gomer back for 6 ounces of silver and 9 bushels of barley .
they are always cursing , lying , killing , stealing , and committing adultery . they murder one person after another .
no one should argue or blame another person . priests , my argument is with you !
you priests will fall in the daytime . and at night the prophet will also fall with you . i will also destroy your mother .
they became proud . they sinned more and more against me , so i will change their honor to shame .
“ the priests fed on the people ’ s sins . they wanted more and more of their sin offerings .
“ sexual sins , strong drink , and new wine ruin a person ’ s ability to think straight .
“ ephraim has joined his idols , so leave him alone .
ephraim has joined their drunkenness . let them continue to be prostitutes . let them be with their lovers .
they went to those gods for safety , and they have lost their ability to think . their altars will bring them shame .
“ priests , nation of israel , and people in the king ’ s family , listen to me . you have been judged guilty !
you have done many evil things , so i will punish you all .
i know ephraim . i know what israel has done . ephraim , right now you act like a prostitute . israel is dirty with sin .
israel ’ s pride is a witness against them , so israel and ephraim will stumble in their sin . but judah will also stumble with them .
they have not been faithful to the lord . their children are from some stranger . and now , he will destroy them and their land again .
“ blow the horn in gibeah .
the leaders of judah are like thieves trying to steal someone ’ s property ,
ephraim will be punished .
i will destroy ephraim as a moth eats a piece of cloth .
ephraim saw his sickness , and judah saw his wound ,
i will be like a lion to ephraim ,
i will go back to my place ,
“ come , let ’ s go back to the lord .
after two days he will bring us back to life .
let ’ s learn about the lord .
“ ephraim , what should i do with you ?
this is because i want faithful love ,
but the people broke the agreement as adam did .
gilead is a city of people who do evil—
the priests are like gangs of robbers
i have seen a terrible thing in the nation of israel .
judah , there is also a time of harvest for you .
“ i will heal israel !
they don ’ t believe that i will remember their crimes .
their evil makes their king happy .
a baker presses dough to make bread .
on our king ’ s day , the leaders get so drunk that they get sick .
the people make their secret plans .
they are all like hot ovens .
“ ephraim mixes with the nations .
strangers destroy ephraim ’ s strength ,
ephraim ’ s pride speaks against him .
so ephraim has become like a silly dove without understanding .
they go to those countries for help ,
it will be very bad for those who left me .
they never call to me from their hearts .
i trained them and made their arms strong ,
like a boomerang , they changed directions ,
they yell out at me , ‘ my god , we in israel know you ! ’
but israel refused the good things , so the enemy chases him .
“ israel was destroyed ;
ephraim went to his ‘ lovers . ’
yes , israel was taken to the nations ,
“ ephraim built more and more altars ,
even if i wrote 10,000 laws for ephraim ,
the israelites love sacrifices .
israel has built palaces for their kings ,
but the grain from those threshing floors will not provide enough food for israel . there will not be enough wine for israel .
the israelites will not stay in the lord ’ s land . ephraim will return to egypt . in assyria they will eat food that they should not eat .
they will not be able to celebrate the lord ’ s feasts or festivals .
the israelites have gone deep into ruin as in the time of gibeah . god will remember the israelites ’ sins , and he will punish them .
“ like a bird , ephraim ’ s glory will fly away . there will be no more pregnancies , no more births , and no more babies .
i can see that ephraim is leading his children into a trap . ephraim will lead his children out to the killer .
lord , give them what you will . give them a womb that loses babies and breasts that can not give milk .
all their evil is in gilgal ;
ephraim will be punished .
those people will not listen to my god ,
israel is like a vine
the people of israel tried to trick god ,
now the israelites say , “ we have no king . we don ’ t honor the lord . and his king can not do anything to us . ”
samaria ’ s false god will be destroyed . it will be like a piece of wood floating away on the water ’ s surface .
i will come to punish them . armies will come together against them and punish the israelites for both of their sins .
but you planted evil , and you harvested trouble . you ate the fruit of your lies , because you had trusted in your power and your soldiers .
the lord said , “ i loved israel when he was a child ,
but the more i called the israelites ,
“ but i was the one who taught ephraim to walk .
i led them with ropes ,
“ the israelites will not go back to egypt . the king of assyria will become their king , because they refused to turn back to god .
the sword will swing against their cities and kill their strong men . it will destroy their leaders .
“ my people expect me to come back . they will call to god above , but he will not help them . ”
“ ephraim , i don ’ t want to give you up .
i will not let my terrible anger win .
i , the lord , will roar like a lion ,
they will come from egypt ,
“ ephraim surrounded me with false gods .
the lord says , “ i have a complaint against israel . jacob must be punished for the bad things he did .
jacob wrestled with god ’ s angel and won . he cried and asked for a favor . that happened at bethel . there he spoke to us .
yes , yahweh is the god of the armies . his name is yahweh .
so come back to your god . be loyal to him . do the right thing , and always trust in your god !
“ jacob is a tricky merchant . he even cheats his friend ! even his scales lie .
i spoke to the prophets and gave them many visions . i gave the prophets many ways to teach my lessons to you .
“ jacob ran away to the land of aram . there israel worked for a wife . he kept sheep to get another wife .
but the lord used a prophet and brought israel out of egypt . he used a prophet and kept israel safe .
i knew you in the desert—i knew you in that dry land .
i gave food to the israelites , and they ate it . they became full and satisfied . they became proud , and then they forgot me .
“ that is why i will be like a lion to them . i will be like a leopard waiting by the road .
“ israel , i helped you , but you turned against me . so now i will destroy you .
i was angry , and i gave you a king . and when i became very angry , i took him away .
“ ephraim tried to hide his guilt .
his punishment will be like the pain of a woman giving birth .
“ i will save them from the grave .
israel grows among his brothers ,
israel , you fell and sinned against god . so come back to the lord your god .
think about what you will say , and come back to the lord . say to him ,
assyria will not save us .
i will be like the dew to israel .
his branches will grow ,
the people of israel will again live under my protection .
“ ephraim , i will have nothing more to do with idols .
a wise person understands these things ,
heaven and earth , listen ! this is what the lord says :
a bull knows its master ,
what good will it do to keep punishing you ? you will continue to rebel . your whole head and heart are already sick and aching .
you officers of sodom , listen to the lord ’ s message . you people of gomorrah , listen to god ’ s teaching .
when you people come to meet with me , you trample everything in my yard . who told you to do this ?
i hate your monthly meetings and councils . they have become like heavy weights to me , and i am tired of carrying them .
“ wash yourselves and make yourselves clean . stop doing the evil things i see you do . stop doing wrong .
“ if you listen to what i say , you will get the good things from this land .
but if you refuse to listen and rebel against me , your enemies will destroy you . ”
people use lye to clean silver . in the same way , i will clean away all your wrongs . i will remove all the impurities from you .
god is good and does what is right , so he will rescue zion and the people who come back to him .
but all the criminals and sinners will be destroyed . those who stopped following the lord will be removed .
in the future , you will be ashamed of the oak trees and special gardens you chose to worship ,
because you will be like an oak tree whose leaves are dying . you will be like a garden dying without water .
isaiah son of amoz received this message about judah and jerusalem .
in the last days the mountain of the lord ’ s temple
people from many places will go there and say ,
then god will act as judge to end arguments between nations .
family of jacob , let us follow the lord .
his land is full of gods that the people bow down to worship . they made those idols themselves .
the people have become worse and worse . they have become very low , and you leaders did nothing to lift them up !
you should be afraid of the lord ! go hide in the dirt and behind the rocks . hide from his glorious power !
proud people will stop being proud . they will bow down to the ground with shame , and only the lord will still stand high .
the lord all-powerful has a special day planned when he will punish the proud and boastful people . they will be brought down .
they might be like the tall cedar trees from lebanon or the great oak trees from bashan , but they will be cut down .
they might be like the tall mountains and high hills
or like the tall towers and high walls , but they will be brought down .
they might be like great ships from tarshish , filled with such wonderful cargo , but they will be brought down .
at that time those proud people will fall . they will bow low to the ground , and only the lord will stand high .
all the idols will be gone .
they will go down into cracks in the rocks and boulders because they are afraid of the lord and his glorious power as he stands to shake the earth .
stop trusting other people to save you . do not think too highly of them ; they are only humans who have not stopped breathing yet .
he will take away all the heroes and soldiers . he will take away all the judges , the prophets , the fortunetellers , and the elders .
he says , “ i will put young boys in charge of you . they will be your leaders .
the people will turn against each other . young people will not respect those who are older . the common people will not respect important leaders . ”
tell the good people who do what is right that good things will happen to them . they will receive a reward for what they do .
but it will be very bad for wicked people , because they , too , will get what they deserve . they will get what they did to others .
even children will defeat my people , and women will rule over them .
look , the lord is standing to judge his people .
the lord is ready to present his case against the elders and leaders of his people .
the lord will put sores on the heads of those women in zion . the lord will make their heads bald .
then the lord will take away everything they are proud of : the beautiful ankle bracelets , the necklaces that look like the sun and the moon ,
the earrings , bracelets , and veils ,
the scarves , the ankle chains , the cloth belts worn around their waists , the bottles of perfume , the charms ,
the signet rings , and the nose rings ,
the fine dresses , robes , veils , and purses ,
the mirrors , linen dresses , turbans , and long shawls .
your men will be killed with swords . your heroes will die in war .
it will be a shelter to protect the people from the heat of the sun and from all kinds of storms and rain .
now i will sing a song for my friend , my love song about his vineyard .
he dug and cleared the field
my friend said , “ you people living in jerusalem and you people of judah ,
what more could i do for my vineyard ?
“ now i will tell you
i will turn my vineyard into useless land .
the vineyard that belongs to the lord all-powerful is the house of israel . the grapevine , the plant he loves , is the man of judah .
i heard the lord all-powerful make this oath : “ i swear , all these houses will be destroyed . these big , fancy houses will be empty .
a ten-acre vineyard will make only a little wine , and many sacks of seed will grow only a little grain . ”
everyone , common people and leaders alike , will be humbled . those who are now so proud will bow their heads in shame .
the lord all-powerful will judge fairly , and people will honor him . they will respect the holy god when he brings justice .
then sheep will be able to go wherever they want and graze on the land that rich people once owned .
look at those people ! they pull their guilt and sins behind them like people pulling wagons with ropes .
they think they are so smart . they think they are very intelligent .
they are famous for drinking wine and are heroes known for mixing drinks .
and if you pay them enough money , they will forgive a criminal . but they will not let good people be judged fairly .
look ! god is giving a sign to the nations far away . he is raising a flag and whistling for them to come .
the enemy soldiers never get tired and stumble . they never get sleepy and fall asleep . their weapon belts are always ready . their sandal straps never break .
in the year that king uzziah died , i saw the lord sitting on a very high and wonderful throne . his long robe filled the temple .
the angels were calling to each other , “ holy , holy , holy is the lord all-powerful . his glory fills the whole earth . ”
the sound was so loud that it caused the frame around the door to shake , and the temple was filled with smoke .
then i heard the lord ’ s voice , saying , “ who can i send ? who will go for us ? ”
then i asked , “ lord , how long should i do this ? ”
the lord will make the people go far away , and there will be large areas of empty land in the country .
and made plans against you . they said ,
but the lord god says , “ their plan will not succeed . it will not happen
then the lord spoke to ahaz again
but ahaz said , “ i will not ask for a sign as proof . i will not test the lord . ”
but the lord will still show you this sign :
he will eat milk curds and honey
but before he is old enough to make that choice ,
they will settle in the deep valleys and in the caves , by the thornbushes and watering holes .
“ at that time someone might keep only one young cow and two sheep alive .
but there will be enough milk for them to eat milk curds . in fact , everyone left in the country will eat milk curds and honey .
there are now fields that have 1000 grapevines , and each grapevine is worth 1000 pieces of silver . but those fields will be covered with weeds and thorns .
that land will be wild and used only as a hunting ground where people go with bows and arrows .
i found some men who could be trusted to serve as witnesses : uriah the priest and zechariah son of jeberekiah . they watched me write those words .
the lord spoke to me again .
he said , “ these people refuse to accept the slow-moving waters of shiloah . they prefer rezin and remaliah ’ s son . ”
this water will be like a flash flood as it passes through judah . it will rise to judah ’ s throat and almost drown him .
all you nations , prepare for war .
make your plans for the fight .
the lord spoke to me with his great power and warned me not to be like these people . he said ,
the lord all-powerful is the one you should fear . he is the one you should respect . he is the one who should frighten you .
( many people will trip over this rock . they will fall and be broken . they will be caught in the trap . )
the lord has turned away from the family of jacob .
you should follow the teachings and the agreement . i swear , if you follow those other things , there is no future for you .
and when the captives turn their faces to the ground , there is only a depressing darkness closing in—the dark sadness of people forced to leave their country .
every boot that marched in battle and every uniform stained with blood will be destroyed and thrown into the fire .
the lord gave a command against jacob and someone in israel fell .
so all the people in ephraim , including the ruler in samaria , learned their lesson .
the lord found people to go up and fight against rezin . he stirred up rezin ’ s enemies .
the people did not stop sinning . they did not come to the lord all-powerful for help .
so the lord cut off israel ’ s head and tail . he took away the branch and the stalk in one day .
( the head means the elders and important leaders . the tail means the prophets who told lies . )
their guides are leading them the wrong way , so those who follow them will be destroyed .
the lord all-powerful was angry , so the land was burned . the people were fuel for the fire . no one showed any compassion to anyone else .
manasseh fought against ephraim , and ephraim fought against manasseh . then both of them turned on judah .
just look at those lawmakers who write evil laws and make life hard for the people .
they are not fair to the poor . they take away the rights of the poor and allow people to steal from widows and orphans .
the lord says , “ i will use assyria like a stick . in my anger i will use assyria to punish israel .
assyria says to himself , ‘ all of my officers are like kings !
the city of calno is no better than the city of carchemish . arpad is like hamath , and samaria is like damascus .
i defeated those evil kingdoms and now i control them . the idols those people worship are better than the idols of jerusalem and samaria .
i defeated samaria and her gods . i will also defeat jerusalem and the idols her people have made . ’ ”
and then spreads to burn up the tall trees and vineyards . finally , everything will be destroyed—even the people . assyria will be like a rotting log .
there will be a few trees left standing in the forest—so few that even a child could count them .
those who are left in jacob ’ s family will again follow the powerful god .
the lord god all-powerful really will destroy this land .
but after a short time my anger will stop . i will be satisfied that assyria has punished you enough . ”
cry out , bath gallim ! laishah , listen ! anathoth , answer me !
the people of madmenah are running away . the people of gebim are hiding .
this day the army will stop at nob and prepare to fight against mount zion , the hill of jerusalem .
god will cut down his enemies . like the tall trees of lebanon he will cut them down with an ax .
a small tree will begin to grow from the stump of jesse . that branch will grow from jesse ’ s roots .
he will find joy in obeying the lord .
then ephraim will not be jealous of judah , and judah will have no enemies left . and judah will not cause trouble for ephraim .
at that time you will say ,
god is the one who saves me .
you people will get your water from the spring of salvation .
at that time you will say ,
sing songs of praise about the lord ,
people of zion , shout about these things !
god showed isaiah son of amoz this message about babylon :
“ raise a flag on that mountain where nothing grows .
“ i have separated these men from the people ,
“ listen to that loud noise in the mountains .
they are coming from a faraway land .
people will lose their courage . fear will make them weak .
everyone will be afraid . they will stare at each other with shock on their faces . fear will grip them like the pains of a woman in childbirth .
the skies will be dark . the sun , the moon , and the stars will not shine .
there will be only a few people left . they will be as rare as pure gold .
in my anger i will shake the sky , and the earth will be moved from its place . ”
anyone caught by the enemy will be killed with a sword .
everything in their houses will be stolen . their wives will be raped , and their little children will be beaten to death while they watch .
babylon will be destroyed like the time god destroyed sodom and gomorrah .
in the past , you were slaves . people forced you to work hard . but the lord will take away the hard work you were forced to do .
at that time you will begin to sing this song about the king of babylon :
the lord breaks the scepter of evil rulers ;
in anger , the king of babylon beat the people .
but now , the whole country rests and is quiet .
you were an evil king ,
the place of death is excited
they will make fun of you , saying ,
your pride has been sent down to sheol .
you were like the morning star ,
you always told yourself ,
i will go up to the altar above the tops of the clouds .
but that did not happen .
people will come to look at your dead body .
the kings of other nations lie buried with honor ,
but you were thrown out of your grave
other kings have their own graves ,
prepare to kill his children ,
the lord all-powerful made this promise : “ this will happen exactly as i meant for it to happen . it will happen just the way i planned .
this is what i plan to do for this land . i will use my power to punish all those nations . ”
when the lord all-powerful makes a plan , no one can change it . when he raises his arm to punish , no one can stop him .
this message was given to me the year king ahaz died :
people near the city gates , cry !
but what will the messengers from that nation report about us ?
this is a message about moab :
the king ’ s family and the people of dibon go to the places of worship to cry .
everywhere in moab , on the housetops and in the streets ,
in heshbon and elealeh they are crying loudly .
my heart cries , full of sorrow for moab .
but nimrim brook is as dry as a desert .
so the people gather up everything they own
you can hear crying everywhere in moab—
the water of dimon is full of blood ,
the women of moab try to cross the river arnon .
they say , “ help us !
people from moab were forced to leave their homes .
then a new king will come .
we have heard that the people of moab
because of their pride , everyone in moab will mourn .
the fields of heshbon and the vines of sibmah no longer grow grapes .
i will cry with the people of jazer and sibmah ,
there will be no joy and happiness in the orchard .
so i will hum a sad song for moab and kir heres ,
the people of moab will go
the lord said these things about moab many times .
this is a message about damascus :
people will leave the cities of aroer .
the fort cities of ephraim will be destroyed .
“ at that time jacob ’ s wealth will all be gone .
then the people will look up to the one who made them . their eyes will see the holy one of israel .
they will not trust the great things they have made . they will not go to the special gardens and altars they made for false gods .
this will happen because you have forgotten the god who saves you . you have not remembered that god is your place of safety .
listen to all these people !
and like the waves ,
that night , the people will be frightened .
look at the land along the rivers of ethiopia where you can hear the buzzing of insect wings .
that land sends people down the nile river in reed boats .
like a flag on a hill ,
the lord god all-powerful says , “ i will give egypt to a hard master . a powerful king will rule over the people . ”
the water in the nile river will dry up and disappear .
all the rivers will smell very bad . the canals in egypt will be dry , and the water will be gone . all the water plants will rot .
those who make cloth from flax , who weave it into linen , will all be sad .
those who weave cloth will be broken , and those who work for money will be depressed .
the leaders of zoan have been fooled . the leaders of noph have believed lies , so they lead egypt the wrong way .
then israel , assyria , and egypt will join together and control the land . this will be a blessing for the land .
sargon was the king of assyria . he sent his military commander to fight against ashdod . the commander went there and captured the city .
then the lord said , “ my servant isaiah has gone without clothes or sandals for three years . this is a sign for egypt and ethiopia .
those who looked to ethiopia for help will be shattered . those who were amazed by egypt ’ s glory will be ashamed . ”
this is a message about the “ desert by the sea ” :
i was given a vision of the hard times to come .
i saw those terrible things , and now i am afraid .
i am worried and shaking with fear .
people are rushing around shouting their orders :
the lord said to me , “ go find someone to guard this city . he must report whatever he sees .
whether he sees a chariot and a team of horses or men riding donkeys or camels , he must listen carefully . ”
then one day the watchman called out ,
look ! i see a man in a chariot
this is a message about dumah :
this is a message about arabia :
they gave water to some thirsty travelers .
they were running from swords
only a few of the archers , the great soldiers of kedar , will be left alive. ” the lord , the god of israel , told me this .
this is a message about the valley of vision :
this city was so happy ,
all your officers ran away together ,
so i say , “ don ’ t look at me !
horse soldiers from elam took their bags of arrows and rode into battle . soldiers from kir rattled their shields .
your favorite valley was filled with chariots . horse soldiers were stationed in front of the city gates .
then the cover protecting judah was removed , and the people turned to the weapons they kept at the forest palace .
so the lord god all-powerful told the people to cry and mourn for their dead friends . he told them to shave their heads and wear mourning clothes .
but look , everyone was happy . the people rejoiced , saying ,
the lord god all-powerful told me to go to shebna , the palace manager ,
i will force you out of your position here . your new leader will take you away from your important job .
at that time i will call for my servant eliakim son of hilkiah .
he will be like a favorite chair in his father ’ s house . i will make him like a strong peg in a solid board .
this is a message about tyre :
you people living near the sea , mourn in silence .
they traveled the seas looking for grain .
sidon , you should be very sad ,
when egypt hears the news about tyre ,
you ships , try to escape to tarshish !
can this be that happy city that was founded so long ago ?
this city produced so many leaders .
it was the lord all-powerful .
ships from tarshish , go back home .
the lord raised his arm over the sea
he said , “ daughter sidon , you have been hurt badly ,
as for babylon , look at the land of the chaldeans !
so be sad , you ships from tarshish .
“ oh , woman who men forgot ,
look , the lord is destroying this land . he will clean out the land completely and force all the people to go far away .
everyone will be forced out of the land . all the wealth will be taken . this will happen because the lord commanded it .
the country will be empty and sad . the world will be empty and weak . the great leaders of the people in this land will become weak .
the grapevines are dying . the new wine is bad . people who were happy are now sad .
they have stopped showing their joy . the happy music from the drums and harps has ended .
they no longer sing as they drink their wine . the beer now tastes bitter to those who drink it .
“ total confusion ” is a good name for this city . the city has been destroyed . people can not enter the houses . the doors are blocked .
people still ask for wine in the marketplaces , but all the joy is gone . it was carried off with everything else .
all that is left is destruction . even the gates are crushed .
at harvest time , people knock olives from the trees .
those who are left will begin shouting louder than the ocean .
they will say , “ people in the east , praise the lord !
we hear songs of praise for god from every place on earth .
i see troubles for you people living in this land .
people will hear about the danger ,
there will be earthquakes ,
the sins of the world are very heavy ,
at that time the lord will judge
many people will be gathered together .
the lord will rule as king on mount zion in jerusalem .
lord , you are my god .
and you destroyed the city that was protected by strong walls .
that is why powerful nations will honor you .
you have been a safe place for poor people in trouble .
like the heat of summer in a dry land ,
but now there is a veil covering all nations and people . this veil is called “ death . ”
at that time people will say ,
the lord ’ s power is on this mountain ,
they will reach out their arms to escape
he will destroy their high walls and safe places .
at that time people will sing this song in judah :
open the gates for the good people to enter .
god , you give true peace
so trust the lord always ,
but he will destroy the proud city
then poor and humble people will walk on those ruins .
honesty is the path good people follow .
but , lord , we are waiting for your way of justice .
at night my soul longs to be with you ,
evil people will not learn to do good ,
lord , your arm is raised to punish them ,
lord , you have succeeded in doing everything we tried to do ,
lord , you are our god ,
those dead lords will not come to life .
lord , you have helped the nation you love .
lord , people remember you
lord , because of you we were in pain ,
but we struggled in pain for nothing .
but the lord says ,
my people , go into your rooms
look ! the lord is coming out from his place
at that time the lord will judge leviathan ,
at that time people will sing
“ i , the lord , will care for the vineyard .
i am not angry .
but if anyone comes to me for safety
in the future , jacob will take root firmly on his soil .
the vines will become dry , and the branches will break off . women will use them for firewood .
look , the lord has someone who is strong and brave .
the drunks of ephraim are proud of their beautiful crown ,
that city sits on a hill with a rich valley around it .
at that time the lord all-powerful will become the “ beautiful crown. ” he will be the “ wonderful crown of flowers ” for his people who are left .
then he will give wisdom to the judges who rule his people . he will give strength to the people who are in battles at the city gates .
every table is covered with vomit . there is not a clean place anywhere .
he speaks to us as though we were babies :
so god will use this strange way of talking , and he will use other languages to speak to these people .
so the lord ’ s words will be senseless sounds to them :
you leaders in jerusalem should listen to the lord ’ s message , but now you refuse to listen to him .
your agreement with death will be erased . your contract with sheol will not help you .
now don ’ t complain about these things . if you fight against them , you will only tighten the ropes around you .
listen closely to the message i am telling you .
does a farmer plow his field all the time ? no , he doesn ’ t work the soil all the time .
our god is using this to teach you a lesson . this example shows us that god is fair when he punishes his people .
this lesson comes from the lord all-powerful , who gives wonderful advice . he is very wise .
god says , “ look at ariel , the city where david camped . keep on having your festivals , year after year .
but i will punish ariel . the city will be filled with sadness and crying , but it will always be my ariel .
“ i will put armies all around you , ariel . i will raise war towers against you .
there will be so many foreigners that they will be like dust . cruel people will be like the chaff blowing in the wind . then suddenly ,
the lord all-powerful will punish you with earthquakes , thunder , and loud noises . there will be storms , strong winds , and a burning , destructive fire .
many nations will fight against ariel . it will be a nightmare . armies will surround ariel and punish her .
be surprised and amazed !
the lord will make you sleepy .
this is the truth : after a very short time , lebanon will become rich farmland , and the farmland will be like thick forests .
the deaf will hear the words in the book . the blind will see through the darkness and fog .
the lord will make poor people happy . the poorest people will rejoice in the holy one of israel .
this will happen when the people who are mean and cruel have come to an end . it will happen when those who enjoy doing bad things are gone .
( they lie about good people . they try to trap people in court . they try to destroy innocent people . )
yes , when they see all their children ,
many of these people did not understand , so they did what was wrong . they complained , but now they will learn their lesson . ”
“ but i tell you , hiding in egypt will not help you . pharaoh will not be able to protect you .
your leaders have gone to zoan , and your representatives have gone to hanes .
this is a message about the negev animals :
that useless nation is egypt . egypt ’ s help is worth nothing , so i call egypt the “ do-nothing dragon . ”
these people are like children who refuse to obey . they lie and refuse to listen to the lord ’ s teachings .
stop seeing things that will really happen . get out of our way . stop telling us about the holy one of israel . ”
the holy one of israel says , “ you people have refused to accept this message from me . you depend on fighting and lies to help you .
you are guilty of these things . so you are like a tall wall with cracks in it . that wall will fall and break into small pieces .
every mountain and hill will have streams filled with water . these things will happen after many people are killed and the enemy ’ s towers are pulled down .
assyria will be frightened by the lord ’ s voice and the stick that will beat him .
and as the lord beats assyria , his people will keep the rhythm with their drums and harps .
people of israel , you should come back to the god you turned away from .
that is because when those things happen , people will reject the gold and silver idols you made when you sinned against me .
their place of safety will be destroyed . their leaders will be defeated , and they will abandon their flag .
listen to what i say ! a king should rule in a way that brings justice . leaders should make fair decisions when they lead the people .
then people would actually see what they look at . they would actually listen to what they hear .
people who are now confused would be able to understand . those who can not speak clearly now would be able to speak clearly and quickly .
fools would not be called great men . people would not respect men who make secret plans .
they use evil like a tool and plan ways to steal from the poor . they tell lies about the poor and keep them from being judged fairly .
but a good leader plans good things to do , and that will make him a leader over other leaders .
some of you women are calm now ; you feel safe . but you should stand and listen to the words i say .
beat your breasts in sorrow . cry because your fields are empty . your vineyards once gave grapes , but now they are empty .
this will continue until god gives us his spirit from above . then the desert will become rich farmland and the farmland will be like thick forests .
that is , what is now a desert will be filled with right decisions , and what is now a farmland will be filled with justice .
that justice will bring peace and safety forever .
my people will be safe in their homes and in their calm , peaceful fields .
but before this happens , the forest must fall and the city must be torn down .
some of you live away from the cities . you plant seeds by every stream and let your cattle and donkeys roam free . you will be very blessed .
lord , be kind to us .
your powerful voice makes people run away in fear .
the lord is very great . he lives in a very high place . he fills zion with justice and goodness .
jerusalem , you are rich with wisdom and knowledge of god . you are rich with salvation . you respect the lord , and that makes you rich .
but listen ! the messengers are crying outside . the messengers who bring peace are crying very hard .
the lord says , “ now , i will stand and show people how great and powerful i am .
people will be burned until their bones become lime . they will burn quickly like thorns and dry bushes .
“ you people in faraway lands , listen to what i have done . you people who are near me , learn about my power . ”
they will live safely in high places . they will be protected in high rock fortresses . they will always have food and water .
your eyes will see the king in his beauty . you will see the great land .
no one living there will say , “ i am sick , ” because everyone living there has had their guilt removed .
the lord is angry with all the nations and their armies . he will destroy them all and put them to death .
their bodies will be thrown outside . the stink will rise from the bodies , and the blood will flow down the mountains .
the lord says , “ this will happen when my sword in the sky is covered with blood . ”
this will happen because the lord has chosen a time for punishment . he has chosen a year when people must pay for the wrong they did to zion .
edom ’ s rivers will be like hot tar . edom ’ s ground will be like burning sulfur .
the free men and leaders will all be gone , and there will be nothing left for them to rule .
wild cats will live there with hyenas . wild goats will call to their friends . night animals will spend some time there and find a place to rest .
the dry desert will rejoice . the desert will be glad and blossom .
make the weak arms strong again . strengthen the weak knees .
then the eyes of the blind will be opened so that they can see , and the ears of the deaf will be opened so that they can hear .
during hezekiah ’ s 14th year as king , sennacherib king of assyria went to fight against all the strong cities of judah . sennacherib defeated those cities .
the commander told them , “ tell hezekiah this is what the great king , the king of assyria says :
then the commander , shouting loudly in hebrew , gave this warning to them all :
this is what the king says : don ’ t let hezekiah fool you ! he can not save you from my power .
none of the gods of these other places were able to save their land from me ! so why do you think the lord can save jerusalem from me ?
when king hezekiah ’ s officers came to isaiah ,
the commander heard that the king of assyria had left lachish . he found him at libnah , fighting against that city .
then the king of assyria got a report that said , “ king tirhakah of ethiopia is coming to fight you . ”
he told them , “ tell king hezekiah of judah these things :
you have heard what the kings of assyria did to all the other countries . we destroyed them completely . will you be saved ? no !
where is the king of hamath ? the king of arpad ? the king of the city of sepharvaim ? the kings of hena and ivvah ? ’ ”
he prayed to the lord :
it is true , lord . the kings of assyria did destroy all those nations .
“ so this is the lord ’ s message against sennacherib :
but who was it that you insulted and made fun of ?
you sent your officers to insult the lord .
i dug wells and drank water from new places .
‘ how could you say this , sennacherib ?
the people living there had no power .
i know all about your battles ;
yes , you were upset at me .
so the lord says this about the king of assyria :
he will go back the way he came .
i will protect this city and save it .
so king sennacherib of assyria went back to nineveh and stayed there .
hezekiah turned toward the wall that faced the temple and began praying to the lord .
“ lord , remember that i have faithfully served you with all my heart . i have done what you say is good. ” then hezekiah cried very hard .
then isaiah received this message from the lord :
i will save you and this city from the king of assyria . i will protect this city . ’ ”
then isaiah told hezekiah , “ crush figs together and put them on your sore . then you will get well . ”
hezekiah asked isaiah , “ what is the sign that proves i will get well and go to the lord ’ s temple ? ”
this is the sign from the lord to show you that he will do what he says :
this is the letter from hezekiah when he became well :
i thought i would live a full life .
so i said , “ i will not see the lord yah in the land of the living again .
my home , my shepherd ’ s tent , is being pulled down and taken from me .
all night i cried as loud as a lion ,
i cried like a bird
what can i say ?
lord , use this hard time to make my spirit live again .
look , my troubles are gone !
the dead can not praise you .
people who are alive , people like me ,
so i say , “ the lord saved me .
then isaiah the prophet went to king hezekiah and asked him , “ what did these men say ? where did they come from ? ”
so isaiah asked him , “ what did they see in your house ? ”
then isaiah said to hezekiah , “ listen to this message from the lord all-powerful :
the babylonians will take your own sons , and your sons will become officers in the palace of the king of babylon . ”
speak kindly to jerusalem and tell her ,
listen , there is someone shouting :
every valley must be filled .
then the glory of the lord will be shown to everyone .
a voice said , “ speak ! ”
when a wind from the lord blows on them ,
grass dies and flowers fall ,
zion , you have good news to tell .
the lord god is coming with power .
like a good shepherd , he takes care of his people .
who measured the oceans in the palm of his hand ?
who could know the lord ’ s mind ?
did the lord ask for anyone ’ s help ?
look , all the nations in the world are like one small drop in the bucket .
all the trees in lebanon are not enough
compared to god , all the nations of the world are nothing .
can you compare god to anything ?
no , but some people make statues from rock or wood ,
for the base he chooses special wood ,
surely you know the truth , don ’ t you ?
it is the lord who sits above the circle of the earth .
he takes away the power of rulers .
they are like plants that are planted in the ground .
the holy one says , “ can you compare me to anyone ?
look up to the skies .
people of jacob , this is true .
surely you know the truth .
he helps tired people be strong .
young men get tired and need to rest .
but those who trust in the lord will become strong again .
who woke up the man who is coming from the east ?
he chases armies and is never hurt .
who was able to make all this happen ?
people along the coast saw this ,
“ workers help each other . they encourage each other to be strong .
the lord says , “ you , israel , are my servant .
you were in a faraway country ,
don ’ t worry—i am with you .
look , some people are angry with you ,
you will look for the people who were against you ,
i am the lord your god ,
people of israel , descendants of jacob , you may be weak and worthless ,
look , i have made you like a new threshing board with many sharp teeth .
you will throw them into the air ,
“ the poor and needy look for water ,
i will make rivers flow on dry hills .
i will make trees grow in the desert .
i will do this so that people will see it and know who did it .
the lord , the king of jacob , says , “ come , present your arguments . show me your proof .
“ look , you false gods are worthless . you can not do anything . only some horrible fool would want to worship you . ”
“ i called someone in the north to come .
“ who told us about this before it happened
i , the lord , was the first one to tell zion about these things .
i looked at those false gods .
those gods are all less than nothing .
“ here is my servant ,
he will not cry out or shout
he will not break even a crushed reed .
he will not grow weak or give up
“ i , the lord , was right to call you .
you will make the blind able to see .
“ i am yahweh .
in the past , i told you what would happen ,
sing a new song to the lord ;
deserts and cities , villages of kedar ,
give glory to the lord .
the lord will go out like a strong soldier .
“ for a long time i have said nothing .
i will destroy the hills and mountains .
then i will lead the blind along a path they never knew
but some of them have left me .
“ deaf people , listen to me !
in all the world , no one is more blind than my servant .
my people see what they should do ,
the lord wants them to do what is right .
but look at his people .
will any of you pay attention to this warning ? will you ever learn to listen ?
bring to me all the people who are mine—the people who have my name . i made them for myself . i made them , and they are mine .
“ bring out the people who have eyes but are blind . bring out the people who have ears but are deaf .
i myself am the lord , and there is no other savior .
i am the lord your holy one . i made israel . i am your king . ”
the lord is making roads through the sea . he is making a path for his people , even through rough waters . the lord says ,
so don ’ t remember what happened in earlier times . don ’ t think about what happened a long time ago ,
i made them , and they will sing songs of praise to me .
“ jacob , you did not pray to me . israel , you became tired of me .
“ i , i am the one who wipes away all your sins . i do this to please myself . i will not remember your sins .
but you should remember me . let ’ s meet together and decide what is right . tell your story and prove that you are innocent .
your first father sinned , and your lawyers committed crimes against me .
i will make your temple leaders unfit to serve there . i will destroy jacob . bad things will happen to israel .
“ jacob , you are my servant . israel , i chose you . listen to me !
they will sprout like grass in the spring and grow like trees by streams of water .
who made these false gods ? who covered these useless statues ?
“ jacob , remember these things !
your sins were like a big cloud ,
skies , rejoice for what the lord has done .
the one who rescued you is the lord ,
he tells the deep waters , “ become dry !
he says to cyrus , “ you are my shepherd .
this is what the lord said to cyrus , his chosen king :
i will go in front of you
i will give you the wealth that is stored in secret places .
i do this for my servant , jacob .
i am the lord , the only god .
i am doing this so that everyone will know
i made the light and the darkness .
“ may the clouds in the skies above
the lord god is the holy one of israel . he created israel , and he says ,
i made the earth ,
i was right to give power to cyrus ,
the lord says , “ egypt and ethiopia are rich ,
you are the god people can not see .
many people make false gods ,
but israel will be saved by the lord .
the lord is god .
i have spoken openly , not in secret .
tell them to come to me . let them present their case and discuss these things . )
so all you people in faraway places , turn to me and be saved , because i am god , and there is no other .
they will say , ‘ goodness and strength come only from the lord . ’ ”
the lord will help the people of israel live right and praise their god .
the lord says , “ bel has fallen to the ground . nebo is kneeling before me .
but they all bowed down and fell to the ground . they couldn ’ t escape ; they were all carried away like prisoners .
“ can you compare me to anyone ? no one is equal to me . you can not understand everything about me . there is nothing like me .
“ sinners , change your heart and mind . think about this again . remember it and be strong .
remember what happened long ago . remember , i am god and there is no other god . there is no other like me .
“ listen to me , you stubborn people ! you are far from doing what is right .
but i am close to making things right . salvation will not be delayed much longer . i will bring salvation to zion and to my wonderful israel . ”
“ fall down and sit in the dirt , virgin daughter babylon .
men will see your naked body
“ my people say , ‘ god saves us .
“ so babylon , sit down and shut up .
“ i was angry with my people .
you said , ‘ i will live forever .
so now listen , you who love only pleasure !
these two things will happen to you :
you do bad things but still feel safe .
“ but disaster is coming your way .
you worked hard all your life
you have many advisors .
but they can not even save themselves .
that ’ s what will happen to those you have worked with ,
“ family of jacob , listen to me !
“ yes , you call yourselves citizens of the holy city ,
“ long ago i told you what would happen .
i did that because i knew you were stubborn .
so long ago i told you what would happen .
“ you heard what i said would happen .
this is something that is happening now , not long ago .
but even in the past you didn ’ t listen .
“ but i will be patient .
“ look , i will make you pure ,
i will do this for myself—for me !
“ jacob , listen to me !
i made the earth with my own hands .
“ all of you , come here and listen to me .
“ i told you that i would call him .
come here and listen to me !
the lord , the savior , the holy one of israel , says ,
if you had obeyed me ,
if you had obeyed me ,
my people , leave babylon !
they never got thirsty as he led them through the desert ,
but the lord also said ,
hear me , people by the sea .
he used me to speak for him .
he told me , “ israel , you are my servant .
i said , “ i worked hard for nothing .
the lord is the one who made me in my mother ’ s womb ,
and now he says , “ you are a very important servant to me .
the lord , the holy protector of israel , speaks to his servant .
this is what the lord says :
you will tell the prisoners ,
they will not be hungry or thirsty .
i will make a road for my people .
“ look ! people are coming to me from faraway places .
heavens and earth , be happy !
but now zion says , “ the lord has left me ;
but the lord says ,
i drew a picture of you on my hand .
your children will come back to you ,
look up ! look all around you !
“ you are destroyed and defeated now .
you were sad for the children you lost , but they will tell you ,
then you will say to yourself ,
this is what the lord god says :
kings will be their teachers .
if a strong soldier takes a prisoner ,
here is the lord ’ s answer :
those people hurt you ,
this is what the lord says :
i came home and found no one there .
i can make the skies dark .
the lord god gave me the ability to teach , so now i teach these sad people . every morning he wakes me and teaches me like a student .
the lord god helps me learn , and i have not turned against him . i will not stop following him .
“ my people , listen to me !
i will soon save you and show that i am fair .
look up to the heavens !
you people who understand goodness should listen to me .
they will be like old clothes eaten by moths .
wake up ! wake up !
you dried up the water that was in the deep sea .
the lord will save his people .
the lord says , “ i am the one who comforts you .
“ i , the lord , am the one who made you .
“ people in prison will soon be made free .
“ i am the lord your god ,
wake up ! wake up !
jerusalem had many people , but none of them became leaders for her . none of the children she raised became guides to lead her .
troubles came to you , jerusalem , in pairs : your land was destroyed and lies in ruins , and your people suffered from famine and war .
wake up ! wake up !
jerusalem , get up and shake off the dust !
the lord god says , “ first , my people went down to egypt and became slaves . then assyria made them slaves .
the city guards are shouting .
ruins of jerusalem , be happy again !
the lord showed his holy strength to all the nations .
you will leave babylon ,
the lord says , “ look , my servant will succeed in what he has to do , and he will be raised to a position of high honor .
it is true that many were shocked when they saw him . he was beaten so badly that he no longer looked like a man .
who really believed what we heard ? who saw in it the lord ’ s great power ?
we had all wandered away like sheep . we had gone our own way . and yet the lord put all our guilt on him .
after his suffering he will see the light , and he will be satisfied with what he experienced .
“ woman , be happy !
“ make your tent bigger .
because you will grow in all directions .
don ’ t be afraid !
your real husband is the one who made you .
“ like a woman whose husband has left her ,
“ for a short time i turned away from you ,
i was so angry that for a while i did not want to see you .
“ remember , in noah ’ s time i punished the world with the flood .
“ the mountains may disappear ,
“ you poor city !
the stones on top of the wall will be made from rubies .
i , the lord , will teach your children ,
you will be built on goodness .
i will never send anyone to attack you .
“ all you people who are thirsty , come !
why waste your money on something that is not real food ?
listen closely to what i say .
i made david a witness of my power for all nations .
there are nations in places you don ’ t know ,
so you should look for the lord
evil people should stop living evil lives .
the lord says , “ my thoughts are not like yours .
just as the heavens are higher than the earth ,
“ rain and snow fall from the sky
in the same way , my words leave my mouth ,
“ so you will go out from there with joy .
large cypress trees will grow where there were thornbushes .
i will bless those who refuse to do wrong and who obey the law about the sabbath . ”
the lord god said these things .
wild animals in the forest ,
the watchmen are all blind .
they are like hungry dogs .
they come and say ,
all the good people are gone ,
but peace will come too ,
“ come here , you children of witches .
you are children out of control , full of lies .
all you want is to worship false gods
you love to worship the smooth rocks in the rivers .
you make your bed on every hill
you hide the things that help you remember me
you use your oils and perfumes
all of them made you tired ,
you did not remember me .
i could tell about your ‘ good works ’ and all the ‘ religious ’ things you do ,
when you need help ,
clear the road ! clear the road !
god is high and lifted up .
i will not accuse my people forever .
israel ’ s evil greed made me angry ,
i have seen their way of life , but i will heal them .
i will teach them a new word : peace .
but evil people are like the angry ocean .
shout as loud as you can and don ’ t stop .
they still come every day to worship me ,
look , the lord ’ s power is enough to save you . he can hear you when you ask him for help .
it is your sins that separate you from your god . he turns away from you when he sees them .
that ’ s because your hands are covered with blood from the people you murdered . you tell lies and say evil things .
they can not be used for clothes , and you can not cover yourself with them .
all fairness and goodness is gone .
we are like people without eyes .
we are always complaining ;
that ’ s because we committed crimes against our god .
we rebelled against the lord
we pushed justice away .
he did not see anyone speak up for the people .
he put on the armor of goodness ,
he will give his enemies the punishment they deserve .
people from the west to the east will fear the lord
then a redeemer will come to zion
“ jerusalem , get up and shine !
darkness now covers the earth ,
then the nations will come to your light .
“ at that time you will see your people ,
herds of camels from midian and ephah
people will collect all the sheep from kedar and give them to you .
look at the people .
the faraway lands are waiting for me .
children from other lands will rebuild your walls .
your gates will always be open .
any nation or kingdom that does not serve you
all the great things of lebanon will be given to you .
in the past , people hurt you ,
“ people hated you .
nations will give you what you need ,
“ you now have copper ,
there will never again be news of violence in your country .
“ the sun will no longer be your light during the day .
your sun will never go down again .
“ all your people will be good .
the smallest family will become a large family group .
then the old cities that were destroyed will be rebuilt . those ancient ruins will be made new , as they were in the beginning .
then your enemies will come to care for your sheep , and their children will work in your fields and in your gardens .
their descendants will be known throughout the earth , and everyone will know their children . whoever sees them will know that the lord has blessed them .
the lord makes me very happy .
the earth causes plants to grow ,
then all nations will see your goodness .
you will be like a beautiful crown that the lord holds up ,
you will never again be called ‘ the people god left . ’
as a young man takes a bride and she belongs to him ,
jerusalem , i put guards on your walls .
don ’ t give him any rest until he rebuilds jerusalem
the lord made a promise and guaranteed it by his own power .
whoever gathers the food will eat it and praise the lord .
come through the gates !
listen , the lord is speaking
his people will be called “ the holy people , ”
who is this coming from edom ,
“ why are your clothes bright red ?
he answers , “ i walked in the winepress by myself .
i chose a time to punish people .
i looked around , but i saw no one to help me .
in my anger i trampled down the nations .
i will remember the kind things the lord has done ,
he said , “ these are my people .
the people had many troubles ,
but they turned against him
then they remembered what happened long ago .
he was by moses ’ side and led him with his wonderful hand .
he led the people through the deep sea .
like cattle going down to the valley ,
please , look down from the heavens .
look , you are our father !
lord , why are you pushing us away from you ?
your holy people had their land only a short time .
some people don ’ t follow you .
if you would tear open the skies
the mountains would burst into flames like burning bushes .
but you have done awesome things that we did not expect .
no one has ever heard of such a god .
you welcome people who enjoy doing good and who remember you
we are all dirty with sin .
we don ’ t call to you for help .
but , lord , you are our father .
lord , don ’ t continue to be angry with us !
your holy cities are as empty as the desert .
our ancestors worshiped you in our holy temple .
lord , will these things always keep you from helping ?
they keep doing things , right in front of me , that make me angry . they offer sacrifices and burn incense in their special gardens .
so this is what the lord god says :
my servants will shout for joy ,
your names will be like curses to my chosen servants . ”
the lord says , “ people now ask blessings from the earth .
“ i am creating a new heaven and a new earth .
my people will be happy and rejoice forever and ever
“ then i will rejoice with jerusalem .
in that city there will never be a baby who lives only a few days ,
“ in that city whoever builds a house will live there ;
never again will one person build a house
never again will a woman suffer childbirth
i will answer them before they call for help .
wolves and little lambs will eat together .
this is what the lord says :
i am the one who made all things .
some people kill bulls as a sacrifice ,
so i decided to use their own tricks .
you who obey the lord ’ s commands ,
in the same way , i will not cause pain without allowing something new to be born . ”
jerusalem and all her friends , be happy !
be happy that you will receive mercy
this is what the lord says :
i will comfort you like a mother comforting her child .
when you see these things , you will be happy .
look , the lord is coming with fire .
the lord will judge the people
i will also choose some of these people to be priests and levites. ” the lord himself said this .
greetings from james , a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ .
my brothers and sisters , you will have many kinds of trouble . but this gives you a reason to be very happy .
you know that when your faith is tested , you learn to be patient in suffering .
do any of you need wisdom ? ask god for it . he is generous and enjoys giving to everyone . so he will give you wisdom .
believers who are poor should be glad that god considers them so important .
believers who are rich should be glad when bad things happen that humble them . their riches won ’ t keep them from disappearing as quickly as wildflowers .
you are tempted by the evil things you want . your own desire leads you away and traps you .
your desire grows inside you until it results in sin . then the sin grows bigger and bigger and finally ends in death .
my dear brothers and sisters , don ’ t be fooled about this .
god decided to give us life through the true message he sent to us . he wanted us to be the most important of all that he created .
my dear brothers and sisters , always be more willing to listen than to speak . keep control of your anger .
anger does not help you live the way god wants .
do what god ’ s teaching says ; don ’ t just listen and do nothing . when you only sit and listen , you are fooling yourselves .
hearing god ’ s teaching and doing nothing is like looking at your face in the mirror
and doing nothing about what you saw . you go away and immediately forget how bad you looked .
my dear brothers and sisters , you are believers in our glorious lord jesus christ . so don ’ t treat some people better than others .
suppose someone comes into your meeting wearing very nice clothes and a gold ring . at the same time a poor person comes in wearing old , dirty clothes .
doesn ’ t this show that you think some people are more important than others ? you set yourselves up as judges—judges who make bad decisions .
and the rich are the ones who insult the wonderful name of christ , the name by which you are known .
but if you are treating one person as more important than another , you are sinning . you are guilty of breaking god ’ s law .
you will be judged by the law that makes people free . you should remember this in everything you say and do .
my brothers and sisters , if a person claims to have faith but does nothing , that faith is worth nothing . faith like that can not save anyone .
suppose a brother or sister in christ comes to you in need of clothes or something to eat .
it is the same with faith . if it is just faith and nothing more—if it doesn ’ t do anything—it is dead .
you believe there is one god . that ’ s good , but even the demons believe that ! and they shake with fear .
you fool ! faith that does nothing is worth nothing . do you want me to prove this to you ?
our father abraham was made right with god by what he did . he offered his son isaac to god on the altar .
so you see that abraham ’ s faith and what he did worked together . his faith was made perfect by what he did .
so you see that people are made right with god by what they do . they can not be made right by faith alone .
a person ’ s body that does not have a spirit is dead . it is the same with faith—faith that does nothing is dead !
we all make many mistakes . a person who never said anything wrong would be perfect . someone like that would be able to control their whole body too .
we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us . with these bits we can control their whole body .
it is the same with our tongue . it is a small part of the body , but it can boast about doing great things .
humans have control over every kind of wild animal , bird , reptile , and fish , and they have controlled all these things .
but no one can control the tongue . it is wild and evil , full of deadly poison .
we use our tongues to praise our lord and father , but then we curse people who were created in god ’ s likeness .
these praises and curses come from the same mouth . my brothers and sisters , this should not happen .
do good water and bad water flow from the same spring ? of course not .
if you are selfish and have bitter jealousy in your hearts , you have no reason to boast . your boasting is a lie that hides the truth .
where there is jealousy and selfishness , there will be confusion and every kind of evil .
people who work for peace in a peaceful way get the blessings that come from right living .
do you know where your fights and arguments come from ? they come from the selfish desires that make war inside you .
do you think the scriptures mean nothing ? the scriptures say , “ the spirit god made to live in us wants us only for himself . ”
but the kindness god shows is greater . as the scripture says , “ god is against the proud , but he is kind to the humble . ”
so give yourselves to god . stand against the devil , and he will run away from you .
be sad , be sorry , and cry ! change your laughter into crying . change your joy into sadness .
be humble before the lord , and he will make you great .
so you should say , “ if the lord wants , we will live and do this or that . ”
but now you are proud and boast about yourself . all such boasting is wrong .
if you fail to do what you know is right , you are sinning .
you rich people , listen ! cry and be very sad because much trouble will come to you .
your riches will rot and be worth nothing . your clothes will be eaten by moths .
you showed no mercy to good people . they were not against you , but you killed them .
you must be patient too . never stop hoping . the lord is coming soon .
brothers and sisters , follow the example of the prophets who spoke for the lord . they suffered many bad things , but they were patient .
are you having troubles ? you should pray . are you happy ? you should sing .
are you sick ? ask the elders of the church to come and rub oil on you in the name of the lord and pray for you .
then elijah prayed that it would rain . and the rain came down from the sky , and the land grew crops again .
my brothers and sisters , if anyone wanders away from the truth and someone helps that person come back ,
remember this : anyone who brings a sinner back from the wrong way will save that person from eternal death and cause many sins to be forgiven .
greetings from peter , an apostle of jesus christ .
i know the thought of that is exciting , even if you must suffer through different kinds of troubles for a short time now .
your faith has a goal , and you are reaching that goal—your salvation .
the prophets studied carefully and tried to learn about this salvation . they spoke about the grace that was coming to you .
so prepare your minds for service . with complete self-control put all your hope in the grace that will be yours when jesus christ comes .
be holy in everything you do , just as god is holy . he is the one who chose you .
in the scriptures god says , “ be holy , because i am holy . ”
you were bought with the precious blood of christ ’ s death . he was a pure and perfect sacrificial lamb .
christ was chosen before the world was made , but he was shown to the world in these last times for you .
but the word of the lord lasts forever . ”
like newborn babies hungry for milk , you should want the pure teaching that feeds your spirit . with it you can grow up and be saved .
you have already tasted the goodness of the lord .
so , that stone brings honor for you who believe . but for those who don ’ t believe he is
for them he is also
in the past you were not a special people ,
be willing to serve the people who have authority in this world . do this for the lord . obey the king , the highest authority .
and obey the leaders who are sent by the king . they are sent to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do good .
when you do good , you stop ignorant people from saying foolish things about you . this is what god wants .
live like free people , but don ’ t use your freedom as an excuse to do evil . live as those who are serving god .
show respect for all people . love your brothers and sisters in god ’ s family . respect god , and honor the king .
one of you might have to suffer even when you have done nothing wrong . if you think of god and bear the pain , this pleases god .
“ he never sinned ,
you were like sheep that went the wrong way . but now you have come back to the shepherd and protector of your lives .
your husbands will see the pure lives that you live with respect for god .
it is not fancy hair , gold jewelry , or fine clothes that should make you beautiful .
so all of you should live together in peace . try to understand each other . love each other like brothers and sisters . be kind and humble .
stop doing what is wrong , and do good .
the lord watches over those who do what is right ,
if you are always trying to do good , no one can really harm you .
but keep the lord christ holy in your hearts . always be ready to answer everyone who asks you to explain about the hope you have .
it is better to suffer for doing good than for doing wrong . yes , it is better if that is what god wants .
christ himself suffered when he died for you ,
and by the spirit he went and preached to the spirits in prison .
now he has gone into heaven . he is at god ’ s right side and rules over angels , authorities , and powers .
strengthen yourselves so that you will live your lives here on earth doing what god wants , not the evil things that people want to do .
the time is near when all things will end . so keep your minds clear , and control yourselves . this will help you in your prayers .
most important of all , love each other deeply , because love makes you willing to forgive many sins .
open your homes to each other and share your food without complaining .
but you should be happy that you are sharing in christ ’ s sufferings . you will be happy and full of joy when christ shows his glory .
you may suffer , but don ’ t let it be because you murder , steal , make trouble , or try to control other people ’ s lives .
but if you suffer because you are a “ christ-follower , ” don ’ t be ashamed . you should praise god for that name .
“ if it is hard for even a good person to be saved ,
don ’ t be like a ruler over those you are responsible for . but be good examples to them .
then when christ the ruling shepherd comes , you will get a crown—one that will be glorious and never lose its beauty .
so be humble under god ’ s powerful hand . then he will lift you up when the right time comes .
give all your worries to him , because he cares for you .
control yourselves and be careful ! the devil is your enemy , and he goes around like a roaring lion looking for someone to attack and eat .
all power is his forever . amen .
the church in babylon sends you greetings . they were chosen just as you were . mark , my son in christ , also sends his greetings .
give each other a special greeting of love when you meet .
greetings from simon peter , a servant and apostle of jesus christ .
grace and peace be given to you more and more , because now you know god and jesus our lord .
because you have these blessings , do all you can to add to your life these things : to your faith add goodness ; to your goodness add knowledge ;
to your knowledge add self-control ; to your self-control add patience ; to your patience add devotion to god ;
to your devotion add kindness toward your brothers and sisters in christ , and to this kindness add love .
and you will be given a very great welcome into the kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ , a kingdom that never ends .
you already know these things . you are very strong in the truth you have . but i am always going to help you remember them .
while i am still living here on earth , i think it is right for me to remind you of them .
i know that i must soon leave this body . our lord jesus christ has shown me that .
i will try my best to make sure you remember these things even after i am gone .
and we heard that voice . it came from heaven while we were with jesus on the holy mountain .
most important of all , you must understand this : no prophecy in the scriptures comes from the prophet ’ s own understanding .
no prophecy ever came from what some person wanted to say . but people were led by the holy spirit and spoke words from god .
but he saved lot , a good man who lived there . lot was greatly troubled by the morally bad lives of those evil people .
this good man lived with those evil people every day , and his good heart was hurt by the evil things he saw and heard .
they have made many people suffer . so they themselves will suffer . that is their pay for what they have done .
my friends , this is the second letter i have written to you . i wrote both letters to you to help your honest minds remember something .
then the world was flooded and destroyed with water .
everything will be destroyed in this way . so what kind of people should you be ? your lives should be holy and devoted to god .
but grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ . glory be to him , now and forever ! amen .
we write these things to you so that you can be full of joy with us .
we heard the true teaching from god . now we tell it to you : god is light , and in him there is no darkness .
if we say that we have no sin , we are fooling ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
if we say that we have not sinned , we are saying that god is a liar and that we don ’ t accept his true teaching .
jesus is the way our sins are taken away . and he is the way all people can have their sins taken away too .
if we obey what god has told us to do , then we are sure that we know him .
if we say we know god but do not obey his commands , we are lying . the truth is not in us .
but when we obey god ’ s teaching , his love is truly working in us . this is how we know that we are living in him .
if we say we live in god , we must live the way jesus lived .
those who love their brothers and sisters live in the light , and there is nothing in them that will make them do wrong .
i write to you , dear children ,
i write to you , fathers ,
i write to you , children ,
the world is passing away , and all the things that people want in the world are passing away . but whoever does what god wants will live forever .
you have the gift that the holy one gave you . so you all know the truth .
whoever does not believe in the son does not have the father , but whoever accepts the son has the father too .
and this is what the son promised us—eternal life .
i am writing this letter about those who are trying to lead you into the wrong way .
you know that christ always did what was right . so you know that all those who do what is right are god ’ s children .
he is pure , and everyone who has this hope in him keeps themselves pure like christ .
anyone who sins breaks god ’ s law . yes , sinning is the same as living against god ’ s law .
you know that christ came to take away people ’ s sins . there is no sin in christ .
so whoever lives in christ does not continue to sin . if they continue to sin , they have never really understood christ and have never known him .
this is the teaching you have heard from the beginning : we must love each other .
brothers and sisters , don ’ t be surprised when the people of this world hate you .
anyone who hates a fellow believer is a murderer . and you know that no murderer has eternal life .
my dear friends , if we don ’ t feel that we are doing wrong , we can be without fear when we come to god .
and god gives us what we ask for . we receive it because we obey god ’ s commands and do what pleases him .
this is what god commands : that we believe in his son jesus christ , and that we love each other as he commanded .
and they belong to the world , so what they say is from the world too . and the world listens to what they say .
anyone who does not love does not know god , because god is love .
this is how god showed his love to us : he sent his only son into the world to give us life through him .
true love is god ’ s love for us , not our love for god . he sent his son as the way to take away our sins .
that is how much god loved us , dear friends ! so we also must love each other .
we know that we live in god and god lives in us . we know this because he gave us his spirit .
we have seen that the father sent his son to be the savior of the world , and this is what we tell people now .
so we know the love that god has for us , and we trust that love .
we love because god first loved us .
god gave us this command : if we love god , we must also love each other as brothers and sisters .
the people who believe that jesus is the messiah are god ’ s children . anyone who loves the father also loves the father ’ s children .
how do we know that we love god ’ s children ? we know because we love god and we obey his commands .
loving god means obeying his commands . and god ’ s commands are not too hard for us ,
because everyone who is a child of god has the power to win against the world .
so there are three witnesses that tell us about jesus :
the spirit , the water , and the blood . these three witnesses agree .
this is what god told us : god has given us eternal life , and this life is in his son .
whoever has the son has life , but whoever does not have the son of god does not have life .
i write this letter to you who believe in the son of god . i write so that you will know that you have eternal life now .
he listens to us every time we ask him . so we know that he gives us whatever we ask from him .
doing wrong is always sin . but there is sin that does not lead to eternal death .
we know that we belong to god , but the evil one controls the whole world .
so , dear children , keep yourselves away from false gods .
greetings from the elder .
we love you because of the truth—the truth that lives in us . that truth will be with us forever .
grace , mercy , and peace will be with us from god the father and from his son , jesus christ , as we live in truth and love .
be careful ! don ’ t lose the reward we have worked for . be careful so that you will receive all of that reward .
if you do , you are helping them with their evil work .
the children of your sister who was chosen by god send you their love .
greetings from the elder .
it always gives me the greatest joy when i hear that my children are following the way of truth .
my dear friend , it is good that you continue to help the believers . they are people you don ’ t even know .
they told the church about the love you have . please help them to continue their trip . help them in a way that will please god .
they went on their trip to serve christ . they did not accept any help from people who are not believers .
so we should help them . when we help them , we share with their work for the truth .
i wrote a letter to the church , but diotrephes will not listen to what we say . he always wants to be the leader .
i have many things i want to tell you . but i don ’ t want to use pen and ink .
i hope to visit you soon . then we can be together and talk .
peace to you . the friends here with me send their love . please give our love to each one of the friends there .
the lord began to speak to jeremiah in the 13th year that josiah , son of amon , was king of the nation of judah .
the lord ’ s message came to me :
“ before i made you in your mother ’ s womb ,
then i said , “ but , lord god , i don ’ t know how to speak . i am only a boy . ”
but the lord said to me ,
don ’ t be afraid of anyone .
then the lord reached out with his hand and touched my mouth . he said to me ,
today i have put you in charge of nations and kingdoms .
the lord ’ s message came to me : “ jeremiah , what do you see ? ”
the lord said to me , “ you have seen very well , and i am watching to make sure that my message to you comes true . ”
the lord ’ s message came to me again : “ jeremiah , what do you see ? ”
the lord said to me , “ something terrible will come from the north .
in a short time i will call all the people in the northern kingdoms . ”
and i will announce judgment against my people ,
“ as for you , jeremiah , get ready .
as for me , today i will make you like a strong city ,
all those people will fight against you ,
the lord ’ s message came to me :
“ jeremiah , go and speak to the people of jerusalem . tell them that this is what the lord says :
the people of israel were a holy gift to the lord .
family of jacob , hear the lord ’ s message .
this is what the lord says :
your ancestors did not say ,
“ i brought you into a good land ,
“ the priests did not ask ,
the lord says , “ so now i will accuse you again ,
go across the sea to the islands of kittim .
has any nation ever stopped worshiping their old gods
“ skies , be shocked at what happened !
“ my people have done two evil things .
“ israel is not a slave , is he ?
like a lion the enemy has roared at israel .
people from memphis and tahpanhes
this trouble is your own fault .
people of judah , think about this :
you have done wrong ,
“ judah , long ago you broke free from me ,
judah , i planted you like a special vine .
even if you wash yourself with lye ,
“ judah , how can you say to me ,
you are like a wild donkey that lives in the desert .
judah , stop chasing after idols !
“ a thief is ashamed
they say to pieces of wood ,
but where are the idols you made for yourselves ?
“ why do you argue with me ?
“ i punished you people of judah ,
people of this generation ,
a young woman does not forget her jewelry .
“ judah , you have become so good at finding lovers .
you have blood on your hands !
but still , you say , ‘ i am innocent .
you go from one place to another looking for help ,
so you will eventually leave egypt too ,
“ if a man divorces his wife and she goes and marries someone else ,
“ look up to the bare hilltops , judah .
you sinned , so the rain has not come .
but didn ’ t you just call me ‘ father ’ ?
you also said , ‘ god will not always be angry with me .
the lord said to me , “ israel was not faithful to me , but she had a better excuse than unfaithful judah .
jeremiah , look toward the north and speak this message :
but you must recognize your sin .
then i will give you new rulers who will be faithful to me . they will lead you with knowledge and understanding .
in those days there will be many of you in the land. ” this message is from the lord .
this message is from the lord :
you can hear crying on the bare hills .
“ people of israel , you are unfaithful to me , but come back to me .
it was foolish to worship idols on the hills .
that terrible false god baal has eaten everything our fathers owned .
let us lie down in our shame .
this message is from the lord .
if you do these things , you will be able to use my name to make a promise .
this is what the lord says to the people of judah and to jerusalem :
become the lord ’ s people .
“ give this message to the people of judah :
raise the signal flag toward zion .
a lion has come out of his cave .
the lord is angry with us ,
the lord says , “ when this happens ,
at that time this message will be given
it is a stronger wind than that ,
look ! the enemy rises up like a cloud .
listen ! the voice of a messenger
“ report it to this nation .
the enemy has surrounded jerusalem
“ the way you lived and the things you did
my sadness and worry is making my stomach hurt .
how long must i see the war flags ?
the lord said , “ my people are foolish .
i looked at the earth .
i looked at the mountains ,
i looked , but there were no people .
i looked , and the good land had become a desert .
this is what the lord says :
so the people in the land will cry for the dead .
the people of judah will hear the sound
judah , you have been destroyed .
i hear a cry like a woman in labor ,
the people make promises and say , ‘ as the lord lives. ’ but they don ’ t really mean it ! ”
lord , i know that you want people
but i said to myself ,
so i will go to the leaders of judah .
so a lion from the forest will attack them .
god says , “ people of judah , why should i forgive you ?
they are like horses that have had plenty to eat and are ready to mate .
should i punish the people of judah for doing these things ? ”
“ go along the rows of judah ’ s grapevines .
the family of israel and the family of judah
“ those people lied about the lord .
the prophets are only empty wind .
the lord god all-powerful said these things :
family of israel , this message is from the lord .
their arrow bags are like open graves .
they will eat all the crops that you gathered .
this message is from the lord : “ but , judah , when these terrible days come , i will not fully destroy you .
“ tell this message to the family of jacob ,
surely you are afraid of me . ”
but the people of judah are stubborn .
the people of judah never say to themselves ,
you don ’ t have these blessings because you have done wrong .
there are evil men among my people .
their houses are full of lies ,
they have grown big and fat from the evil they have done .
should i punish the people of judah for doing these things ? ”
“ a terrible and shocking thing
the prophets tell lies .
“ run for your lives , people of benjamin !
jerusalem , you are like a beautiful meadow .
enemy shepherds will surround you
“ get ready to fight against jerusalem .
so get up ! we will attack the city at night !
this is what the lord all-powerful says :
as a well keeps its water fresh ,
listen to this warning , jerusalem ,
this is what the lord all-powerful says :
who can i speak to ?
but i am full of the lord ’ s anger ,
their houses will be given to others .
“ all the people of israel want more and more money .
they should bandage the wounds my people have suffered ,
they should be ashamed of the evil things they do ,
this is what the lord says :
i chose watchmen to watch over you .
so listen , all you nations ,
hear this , people of the earth :
“ why do you bring me incense from the country of sheba ?
so this is what the lord says :
this is what the lord says :
the soldiers carry bows and spears .
we have heard the news about that army ,
don ’ t go out into the fields .
my people , put on sackcloth
“ jeremiah , i want you to be
my people have turned against me ,
they are like a worker who tried to make silver pure .
my people will be called ‘ rejected silver . ’
this is the lord ’ s message to jeremiah :
“ jeremiah , stand at the gate of the lord ’ s house . teach this message at the gate :
if you change your lives and do good things , i will let you live in this place . you must be fair to each other .
if you obey me , i will let you live in this place . i gave this land to your ancestors for them to keep forever .
“ ‘ but you are trusting lies that are worthless .
i will throw you away from me just as i threw away all your brothers from ephraim . ’
i know you see what they are doing in the towns of judah . you can see what they are doing in the streets of the city of jerusalem .
i brought your ancestors out of egypt . i spoke to them , but i did not give them any commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices .
“ jeremiah , say this to the people of judah : ‘ this is what the lord says :
the people of judah went the wrong way .
i have listened to them very carefully ,
even the birds in the sky
“ ‘ you keep saying , “ we have the lord ’ s teachings . so we are wise ! ”
these “ wise people ” refused to listen to the lord ’ s teachings .
so i will give their wives to other men .
they should bandage the wounds my people have suffered ,
they should be ashamed of the evil things they do ,
“ ‘ i will take away their fruit and crops
“ they will say , ‘ why are we just sitting here ?
we hoped to have peace ,
from the land of the tribe of dan ,
“ people of judah , i am sending poisonous snakes to attack you .
god , i am very sad and afraid .
listen to my people .
and the people say ,
my people are hurt , so i am hurt .
surely there is some medicine in gilead .
if my head were filled with water ,
if only i had a place in the desert—
“ they use their tongues like a bow ;
“ watch your neighbors !
everyone lies to their neighbor .
one bad thing followed another ,
so the lord all-powerful says ,
the people of judah have tongues as sharp as arrows .
should i punish the people of judah for doing these things ? ”
i , jeremiah , will cry for the mountains .
the lord says , “ i will make the city of jerusalem a pile of garbage .
so the lord all-powerful , the god of israel , says , “ i will soon make the people of judah eat bitter food and drink poisoned water .
this is what the lord all-powerful says :
“ the sound of loud crying is heard from zion :
now , women of judah , listen to the message from the lord .
“ death has climbed in through our windows
this is what you should say : “ the lord says ,
this is what the lord says :
but if someone wants to brag , then let them brag about this :
this is what the lord says : “ the time is coming when i will punish all those who are circumcised only in the body .
family of israel , listen to the lord !
this is what the lord says :
the customs of other people are worth nothing .
they make their idols beautiful with silver and gold .
the idols of the other nations are like
lord , there is no one like you .
everyone should respect you , king of all the nations .
all the people of the other nations are stupid and foolish .
they use silver from the city of tarshish
but the lord is the only true god .
the lord says , “ tell them this message :
god is the one who used his power and made the earth .
god causes the loud thunder ,
people are so stupid !
these idols are worth nothing .
but jacob ’ s god is not like the idols .
get everything you own and prepare to leave .
this is what the lord says :
i am hurt badly .
my tent is ruined .
the shepherds are stupid .
listen ! a loud noise !
lord , i know that our lives do not belong to us .
so correct us , lord !
if you are angry , then punish the other nations .
this is the message from the lord :
“ jeremiah , listen to the words of this agreement and tell them to the people living in jerusalem and the rest of judah .
tell them that this is what the lord , the god of israel , says : ‘ bad things will happen to anyone who does not obey this agreement .
the lord said to me , “ jeremiah , i know that the people of judah and the people living in jerusalem have made secret plans .
“ judah is the one i love , but why is she in my temple ?
the lord gave you a name .
no one from the city of anathoth will be left . no one will survive . i will punish them and cause something bad to happen to them . ”
lord , if i argue with you ,
you have put these wicked people here like plants with strong roots .
but you know my heart , lord .
how much longer will the land be dry ?
“ jeremiah , if running in a race against men makes you tired ,
these men are your own brothers .
“ i have abandoned my house .
my own people turned against me like a wild lion .
my own people have become like
many shepherds have ruined my vineyard .
they have turned it into an empty desert .
the empty hills are covered with soldiers
the people will plant wheat ,
so i bought a linen loincloth , just as the lord told me to do , and i put it around my waist .
then the message from the lord came to me a second time .
so i went to perath and hid the loincloth there , just as the lord told me to do .
many days later the lord said to me , “ now , jeremiah , go to perath . get the loincloth that i told you to hide there . ”
then the message from the lord came to me .
listen and pay attention .
honor the lord your god .
if you people of judah don ’ t listen to him ,
tell these things to the king and his wife ,
the cities in the negev are locked .
i will let your enemies become your rulers—
you might ask yourself ,
a black man can not change the color of his skin ,
“ i will force you to leave your homes .
this is what will happen to you .
jerusalem , i will pull your skirt up over your face .
i saw the terrible things you did .
this is the lord ’ s message to jeremiah about the drought :
“ the nation of judah cries for people who have died .
the leaders of the people send their servants to get water .
no one prepares the ground for crops .
even the mother deer in the field leaves her newborn baby alone ,
wild donkeys stand on the bare hills .
“ we know that this is our fault .
god , you are the hope of israel !
you seem like a man who has been attacked by surprise ,
then the lord said to me , “ jeremiah , don ’ t pray for good things to happen to the people of judah .
“ jeremiah , speak this message to the people of judah :
if i go into the country ,
lord , have you completely rejected the nation of judah ?
lord , we know that we are wicked .
for the good of your name , don ’ t push us away .
foreign idols don ’ t have the power to bring rain .
they might ask you , ‘ where will we go ? ’ tell them this is what the lord says :
i will send four kinds of destroyers against them . ’
i will make the people of judah
“ no one will feel sorry for you , city of jerusalem .
jerusalem , you left me . ”
i will separate the people of judah with my pitchfork .
many women will lose their husbands .
the enemy will attack with swords and kill the people .
mother , i am sorry
surely , lord , i have served you well .
“ jeremiah , you know that no one
the people of judah have many treasures .
people of judah , i will make you slaves of your enemies .
lord , you understand me .
your words came to me , and i ate them up .
i never sat with the crowd
i don ’ t understand why i still hurt .
then the lord said , “ jeremiah , if you change and come back to me ,
i will make you strong .
“ i will save you from these evil people .
the lord ’ s message came to me :
“ jeremiah , you must not get married . you must not have sons or daughters in this place . ”
this is what the lord says about the sons and daughters who are born in the land of judah and about their mothers and fathers :
i see everything they do . the people of judah can not hide the things they do . their sin is not hidden from me .
lord , you are my strength and my protection .
can people make real gods for themselves ?
“ so i will teach those who make idols .
“ the sins of judah are written where they can not be erased—
their children remember the altars
you will lose the land i gave you .
this is what the lord says :
they are like a bush in a desert where no one lives .
“ but those who trust in the lord will be blessed .
they will be strong like trees planted near a stream
“ nothing can hide its evil as well as the human mind .
but i am the lord ,
sometimes a bird will hatch an egg that it did not lay .
from the very beginning , our temple
lord , you are the hope of israel .
lord , if you heal me , i surely will be healed .
the people of judah continue to ask me questions .
lord , i did not run away from you .
please don ’ t make me afraid of you .
people are hurting me .
this is the message that came to jeremiah from the lord :
“ jeremiah , go down to the potter ’ s house . i will give you my message there . ”
so i went down to the potter ’ s house and saw him working with clay at the wheel .
then this message from the lord came to me :
there may come another time when i speak about a nation that i will build up or plant .
but if i see that nation doing evil things and not obeying me , i will think again about the good i had planned to do for them .
listen to what the lord says :
it is as strange as not finding snow on lebanon ’ s mountains
but my people have forgotten me .
so their land will become an empty desert ,
like a strong east wind , i will scatter my people .
lord , listen to me !
i have done only good to them .
so now make their children starve to death !
let them cry out in their houses ,
lord , you know about their plans to kill me .
go out to the valley of ben hinnom , near the front of the potsherd gate . i have a message i want you to announce there .
“ jeremiah , tell this to the people , and while they are watching , break the jar .
i will do this to these people and to this place . i will make this city like topheth. ’ this message is from the lord .
lord , you tricked me , and i certainly was fooled .
every time i speak , i shout .
sometimes i say to myself , “ i will forget about him .
i hear people whispering against me .
but the lord is with me .
lord all-powerful , you test good people .
sing to the lord !
curse the day that i was born !
curse the man who told my father the news that i was born .
let that man be like the cities the lord destroyed .
because he did not kill me
why did i have to come out of her body ?
then jeremiah answered pashhur and zephaniah . he said , “ tell king zedekiah ,
i will kill everything living in jerusalem , both people and animals . they will die from a terrible disease that will spread all through the city .
“ also tell the people of jerusalem , ‘ this is what the lord says : understand that i will let you choose to live or die .
“ say this to judah ’ s royal family : ‘ listen to the message from the lord .
family of david , this is what the lord says :
“ jerusalem , i am against you .
“ you will get the punishment you deserve .
the lord said , “ jeremiah , go down to the king ’ s palace . go to the king of judah and tell this message there :
this is what the lord says about the palace where the king of judah lives :
i will send men to destroy the palace ,
don ’ t cry for the king who has died .
jehoahaz will die in the place where the egyptians have taken him , and he will not see this land again . ”
“ it will be very bad for king jehoiakim .
“ jehoiakim , having a lot of cedar in your house
josiah helped poor and needy people ,
“ jehoiakim , your eyes look only for what benefits yourself .
so this is what the lord says to king jehoiakim son of josiah :
the people of jerusalem will bury jehoiakim like a donkey .
“ judah , go up to the mountains of lebanon and cry out .
“ judah , you felt safe , but i warned you .
judah , the punishment i give will come like a storm ,
“ king , you seem so safe in your palace of cedar .
jehoiachin , i will give you to king nebuchadnezzar of babylon and the babylonians . those are the people you are afraid of . they want to kill you .
i will throw you and your mother into another country where neither of you was born . you and your mother will die in that country .
jehoiachin , you will want to come back to your land , but you will never be allowed to come back . ”
jehoiachin is like a broken pot that someone threw away .
land , land , land of judah !
the lord says , “ write this down about jehoiachin :
this message is from the lord :
when he rules , judah will be saved ,
a message to the prophets :
the land of judah is full of people who commit adultery .
this message is from the lord :
i will stop giving my messages to them .
“ i saw the prophets of samaria doing wrong things .
i have even seen the prophets of jerusalem doing sinful things .
so this is what the lord all-powerful says about those jerusalem prophets :
this is what the lord all-powerful says :
some of the people hate the real messages from the lord ,
but none of these prophets has stood in the heavenly council .
now the punishment from the lord will come like a storm .
the lord ’ s anger will not stop
i did not send those prophets ,
if they had stood in my heavenly council ,
this message is from the lord .
someone might try to hide from me in some hiding place .
how long will this continue ? they think up lies and then they teach them to the people .
yes , the lord says , “ you must treat my message carefully , like a fire or like a hammer that can smash a rock . ”
this message is from the lord : “ so i am against the false prophets . they keep stealing my words from each other . ”
yes , the lord says , “ i am against the false prophets . they use their own words and pretend that it is a message from me .
this is what you will say to one another : ‘ what did the lord answer ? ’ or ‘ what did the lord say ? ’
and i will make you a disgrace forever . you will never forget your shame . ’ ”
the lord said to me , “ what do you see , jeremiah ? ”
then the message from the lord came to me .
this is the message that jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of judah and all the people of jerusalem :
so this is what the lord all-powerful says , “ you have not listened to my messages .
that whole area will be an empty desert . all these people will be slaves of the king of babylon for 70 years .
so i took the cup of wine from the lord ’ s hand . i went to those nations and i made them drink from the cup .
i also made all the arabs and all the kings of the land of uz drink from the cup .
then i made the people of edom , moab , and ammon drink from the cup .
i made all the kings of tyre and sidon drink from the cup .
i made all the kings of arabia drink from the cup . these kings live in the desert .
i made all the kings from zimri , elam , and media drink from the cup .
“ jeremiah , you will give them this message :
the noise spreads to all the people on earth .
this is what the lord all-powerful says :
shepherds , you should be leading the sheep .
there will be no place for the shepherds to hide .
i hear the shepherds shouting .
those peaceful pastures will be ruined
he is like an angry lion that has left his cave .
this message came from the lord during the first year that jehoiakim son of josiah was king of judah .
you will say to them , ‘ this is what the lord says : i gave my teachings to you . you must obey me and follow my teachings .
the priests , the prophets , and all the people heard jeremiah say all these words at the lord ’ s temple .
as for me , i am in your power . do to me what you think is good and right .
then some of the elders stood up and spoke to all the people .
but king jehoiakim sent elnathan son of acbor and some other men to egypt .
there was an important man named ahikam son of shaphan who supported jeremiah . he kept jeremiah from being killed by the priests and prophets .
a message from the lord came to jeremiah . it came during the fourth year that zedekiah son of josiah was king of judah .
now i have given all your countries to king nebuchadnezzar of babylon . he is my servant . i will make even the wild animals obey him .
but the false prophets are saying , ‘ you will never be slaves to the king of babylon . ’
“ but listen to what i have to say to you and to all the people .
jeremiah was wearing a yoke around his neck . the prophet hananiah took the yoke from jeremiah ’ s neck and broke it .
then the message from the lord came to jeremiah . this happened after hananiah had taken the yoke off jeremiah ’ s neck and had broken it .
hananiah died in the seventh month of that same year .
this is what the lord all-powerful , the god of the people of israel , says to all the people he sent into captivity from jerusalem to babylon :
“ build houses and live in them . settle in the land . plant gardens and eat the food you grow .
then you will call my name . you will come to me and pray to me , and i will listen to you .
you will search for me , and when you search for me with all your heart , you will find me .
you people might say , “ but the lord has given us prophets here in babylon . ”
“ you people are captives . i forced you to leave jerusalem and go to babylon . so listen to the message from the lord . ”
also give a message to shemaiah from the nehelam family .
now jeremiah is acting like a prophet . so why didn ’ t you arrest him ?
zephaniah the priest read the letter to jeremiah the prophet .
then this message from the lord came to jeremiah :
this is the message that came to jeremiah from the lord .
the lord spoke this message about the people of israel and judah .
this is what the lord said :
“ ask this question and consider it :
“ this is a very important time for jacob .
“ so jacob , my servant , don ’ t be afraid ! ”
people of israel and judah , i am with you . ”
this is what the lord says :
there is no one to care for your sores ,
you became friends with many nations ,
israel and judah , why are you still crying about your wound ?
those nations destroyed you ,
and i will bring your health back
this is what the lord says :
people in those places will sing songs of praise ,
jacob ’ s family will be like the family of israel long ago .
you will be my people ,
the lord was very angry !
the lord will be angry until he is through punishing them .
this is what the lord says :
from far away , the lord
israel , my bride , i will rebuild you .
you farmers of israel will plant vineyards again .
there will be a time when watchmen shout this message :
this is what the lord says :
remember , i will bring israel
they will come back crying ,
“ nations , listen to this message from the lord !
the lord will bring jacob back .
the people of israel will come to the top of zion ,
then the young women of israel will be happy and dance .
i will give the priests plenty of food .
this is what the lord says :
but the lord says , “ stop crying .
israel , there is hope for you . ”
i have heard ephraim crying :
i wandered away from you .
“ people of israel , repair the road signs .
“ people in all the towns of judah will live together in peace . farmers and those who move around with their flocks will live peacefully together in judah .
i will give rest and strength to those who are weak and tired . ”
after hearing that , i , jeremiah , woke up and looked around . my sleep was very pleasant .
“ people will not use this saying anymore :
no , people will die for their own sins . those who eat sour grapes will get the sour taste . ”
he makes the sun shine in the day ,
“ the descendants of israel will never stop being a nation .
the lord says , “ i will never reject the descendants of israel .
the measuring line will stretch from the corner gate straight to the hill of gareb and then turn to the place named goah .
while jeremiah was a prisoner , he said , “ this message from the lord came to me . this was the message :
i bought the field at anathoth from my cousin hanamel . i weighed out 17 shekels of silver for him .
then i took the sealed copy of the deed , which contained the demands and limits of my purchase , and the copy that was not sealed .
with all the people watching , i said to baruch ,
after i gave the deed to baruch son of neriah , i prayed to the lord :
“ lord god , with your great power you made the earth and the sky . there is nothing too hard for you to do .
you used powerful miracles and brought your people israel out of egypt . you used your own powerful hand to do this . your power was amazing !
“ you gave the israelites this land that you promised to give to their ancestors long ago . it is a very good land filled with many good things .
then this message from the lord came to jeremiah :
“ jeremiah , i am the lord . i am the god of every person on the earth . you know that nothing is impossible for me . ”
the people of israel and judah will be my people , and i will be their god .
while jeremiah was still locked up in the courtyard of the guards , the message from the lord came to him a second time :
“ the lord made the earth , and he keeps it safe . the lord is his name . he says ,
‘ judah , pray to me , and i will answer you . i will tell you important secrets . you have never heard these things before . ’
“ ‘ but then i will heal the people in that city . i will let them enjoy peace and safety .
i will make good things happen to judah and israel again and make them strong as in the past .
they sinned against me , but i will wash away that sin . they fought against me , but i will forgive them .
the lord says , “ someone from david ’ s family will always sit on the throne and rule the family of israel .
this message from the lord came to jeremiah .
jeremiah received this message from the lord :
so jeremiah told all this message to zedekiah in jerusalem .
but after that , the people who had slaves changed their minds . so they took the people they had set free and made them slaves again .
then this message from the lord came to jeremiah :
during the time when jehoiakim , son of king josiah , was king of judah , the lord spoke this message to jeremiah :
then i put some bowls full of wine and some cups in front of the recabite family . and i said to them , “ drink some wine . ”
so we have obeyed everything our ancestor jonadab commanded us . none of us ever drinks wine , and neither do our wives , sons , or daughters .
we never build houses to live in , we never own vineyards or fields , and we never plant crops .
we have lived in tents and have obeyed everything our ancestor jonadab commanded us .
then this message from the lord came to jeremiah :
the descendants of jonadab obeyed the commands that their ancestor gave them , but the people of judah have not obeyed me . ’
so the lord all-powerful , the god of israel , says : ‘ there will always be a descendant of jonadab son of recab to serve me . ’ ”
then jeremiah said to baruch , “ i can not go to the lord ’ s temple . i am not allowed to go there .
a man named micaiah heard all the messages from the lord that baruch read from the scroll . micaiah was the son of gemariah , the son of shaphan .
micaiah told them everything he had heard baruch read from the scroll .
then the officials said to baruch , “ sit down and read the scroll to us . ”
“ yes , ” baruch answered . “ jeremiah spoke , and i wrote down all the messages with ink on this scroll . ”
then the royal officials said to baruch , “ you and jeremiah must go and hide . don ’ t tell anyone where you are hiding . ”
then the royal officials put the scroll in the room of elishama the scribe . they went to king jehoiakim and told him all about the scroll .
elnathan , delaiah , and gemariah tried to talk king jehoiakim out of burning the scroll , but he would not listen to them .
king jehoiakim burned the scroll on which baruch had written all the words that jeremiah had spoken to him . then this message from the lord came to jeremiah :
“ get another scroll . write all the messages on it that were on the first scroll that king jehoiakim of judah burned .
nebuchadnezzar was the king of babylon . he appointed zedekiah son of josiah to be the king of judah in the place of jehoiachin son of jehoiakim .
but zedekiah , his servants , and the people of judah did not pay attention to the messages the lord had given to jeremiah the prophet .
at that time jeremiah had not yet been put into prison , so he was free to go anywhere he wanted .
this message from the lord came to jeremiah the prophet :
after that the army from babylon will come back here and attack jerusalem . then they will capture and burn it . ’
when the babylonian army left jerusalem to fight the army of the pharaoh of egypt ,
jeremiah wanted to travel from jerusalem to the land of benjamin . he wanted to be there for a division of some property that belonged to his family .
they put jeremiah into a cell under the house of jonathan . the cell was in a dungeon under the ground . jeremiah was there for a long time .
so king zedekiah said to the officials , “ jeremiah is in your control . i can not do anything to stop you . ”
the men pulled jeremiah up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern . and jeremiah stayed under guard in the temple yard .
but if you refuse to surrender to the army of babylon , the lord has shown me what will happen . this is what he has told me :
then zedekiah said to jeremiah , “ don ’ t tell anyone that i have been talking to you . if you do , you might die .
so jeremiah stayed under guard in the temple yard until the day jerusalem was captured .
and on the ninth day of the fourth month in zedekiah ’ s eleventh year , the wall of jerusalem was broken through .
there at the town of riblah , the king of babylon killed zedekiah ’ s sons and he killed all the royal officials of judah while zedekiah watched .
then nebuchadnezzar tore out zedekiah ’ s eyes . he put bronze chains on zedekiah and took him to babylon .
the army of babylon set fire to the king ’ s palace and the houses of the people of jerusalem . and they broke down the walls of jerusalem .
but commander nebuzaradan left behind some of the poor people of judah who owned nothing . nebuzaradan gave them vineyards and farmland in judah .
nebuchadnezzar also gave an order about jeremiah to commander nebuzaradan :
“ find jeremiah and take care of him . don ’ t hurt him . give him whatever he asks for . ”
while the guards were watching jeremiah in the temple yard , a message from the lord came to him . this was the message :
so jeremiah went to gedaliah son of ahikam at mizpah . he stayed with gedaliah among those who were left behind in the land of judah .
ishmael also killed all the men of judah who were with gedaliah at the town of mizpah . he also killed the babylonian soldiers who were there with gedaliah .
johanan son of kareah and all the army officers who were with him heard about all the evil things ishmael had done .
when the captives that ishmael had taken saw johanan and the army officers , they were very happy .
then all the captives who ishmael had taken from the town of mizpah ran to johanan son of kareah .
but ishmael and eight of his men escaped from johanan and ran away to the ammonites .
jeremiah , pray that the lord your god will tell us where we should go and what we should do . ”
at the end of ten days , the message from the lord came to jeremiah .
i will be kind to you , and the king of babylon will also treat you with mercy . he will bring you back to your land . ’
but you might say , ‘ we will not stay in judah. ’ if you say that , you will disobey the lord your god .
“ survivors of judah , the lord told you : ‘ don ’ t go to egypt. ’ i warn you right now ,
so jeremiah finished telling the people the message from the lord their god . he told them everything that the lord their god had sent him to tell them .
so johanan , the army officers , and all the people disobeyed the lord ’ s command . the lord had commanded them to stay in judah .
these people didn ’ t listen to the lord . so they all went to egypt to the town of tahpanhes .
in the town of tahpanhes , jeremiah received this message from the lord :
“ we will not listen to the message from the lord that you spoke to us .
then jeremiah spoke to all the men and women who told him these things .
“ this is what the lord , the god of israel , says to you :
these messages about different nations came to jeremiah the prophet from the lord .
“ get your large and small shields ready .
get the horses ready .
what do i see ?
“ fast men can not run away .
who is coming like the nile river ?
it is egypt that comes like the rising nile river .
horse soldiers , charge into battle .
“ but on that day , the lord god all-powerful will win .
“ egypt , go to gilead and get some medicine .
the nations will hear you crying .
this is the message the lord spoke to jeremiah the prophet about nebuchadnezzar coming to attack egypt .
“ announce this message in egypt .
egypt , your strong soldiers will be killed .
they will stumble again and again .
in their homelands , those soldiers will say ,
this message is from the king .
people of egypt , pack your things .
“ egypt is like a beautiful cow .
the hired soldiers in egypt ’ s army are like fat calves .
egypt is like a snake hissing
this is what the lord says :
egypt will be ashamed .
“ jacob , my servant , do not be afraid .
this is what the lord says .
this is the message from the lord that came to jeremiah the prophet about the philistines . this message came before pharaoh attacked the city of gaza .
this is what the lord says :
they will hear the sound of running horses ,
because the time has come to destroy all the philistines .
the people from gaza will be sad and shave their heads .
“ sword of the lord , you have not stopped .
but how can the sword of the lord rest ?
this message is about the country of moab . this is what the lord all-powerful , the god of the people of israel , says :
moab will not be praised again .
listen to the cries from horonaim .
moab will be destroyed .
moab ’ s people go up the path to luhith .
run away ! run for your lives !
“ you trust in the things you made and in your wealth ,
the destroyer will come against every town .
spread salt over the fields in moab .
bad things will happen to those who
“ moab has never known trouble .
this is what the lord says :
“ you can not say , ‘ we are good soldiers .
the enemy will attack moab .
“ the end of moab is near .
all you who live around moab should cry for that country .
“ you people living in dibon ,
“ you people living in aroer ,
“ moab will be ruined and filled with shame .
people on the high plain have been punished .
judgment has come to the towns
judgment has come to the towns
judgment has come to the towns
moab ’ s strength has been cut off .
“ the people of moab thought they were greater than the lord .
“ moab , you made fun of israel .
people in moab , leave your towns .
“ we have heard about moab ’ s pride .
the lord says , “ i know moab gets angry quickly and brags about himself ,
so i cry for moab .
i cry with the people of jazer for jazer .
joy and happiness are gone from the large vineyards of moab .
the lord says , “ look ! an eagle is diving down from the sky .
the towns of moab will be captured .
the nation of moab will be destroyed ,
this is what the lord says :
people will be afraid and run away ,
“ people have run from the powerful enemy .
it will be bad for you , moab .
moab ’ s people will be taken away as captives .
this message is about the ammonites . this is what the lord says :
the lord says , “ the time will come in rabbah of ammon
“ people in heshbon , cry because the town of ai is destroyed !
you brag about your strength ,
but this is what the lord god all-powerful says :
“ the ammonites will be taken away as captives . but the time will come when i will bring the ammonites back. ” this message is from the lord .
this message is about edom . this is what the lord all-powerful says :
you people living in dedan , run away and hide ,
“ workers pick grapes from grapevines ,
but i will take everything from esau .
no one will be left to care for his children .
i heard a message from the lord :
edom , i will make you become unimportant .
edom , you made other nations afraid ,
“ edom will be destroyed .
edom will be destroyed like sodom and gomorrah and the towns around them .
so listen to what the lord has planned to do to the people of edom .
at the sound of edom ’ s fall , the earth will shake .
just as an eagle flies high to see the animal it will attack ,
this message is about the city of damascus :
the city of damascus has become weak .
“ damascus is a happy city .
so the young men will die in the public squares of that city .
“ i will set the walls of damascus on fire .
this message is about the tribe of kedar and the rulers of hazor . king nebuchadnezzar of babylon defeated them . this is what the lord says :
their tents and flocks will be taken away .
“ there is a nation that feels so safe and secure
“ their camels are there to be taken in battle .
“ hazor will become a home for wild dogs , an empty desert forever .
early in the time when zedekiah was king of judah , jeremiah the prophet received a message from the lord about the nation of elam .
the lord all-powerful says ,
i will bring the four winds against elam .
i will break elam to pieces while their enemies are watching .
i will show elam that i am in control ,
“ but in the future i will make good things happen to elam . ”
this is the message the lord spoke through the prophet jeremiah about babylon and its people .
“ announce this to all nations !
a nation from the north will attack babylon .
the lord says , “ at that time
they will ask how to go to zion .
“ my people have been like lost sheep .
they were attacked by all who saw them .
“ run away from babylon .
i will bring many nations together from the north .
the enemy will take all the wealth from the chaldeans .
“ babylon , you are excited and happy .
now your mother will be very ashamed .
the lord will show his anger ,
“ prepare for war against babylon .
soldiers around babylon , shout the cry of victory !
don ’ t let the people from babylon plant their crops .
“ israel is like a flock of sheep that was scattered all over the country .
so this is what the lord all-powerful , the god of israel , says :
“ ‘ i will bring israel back to his own fields .
the lord says , “ at that time people will try hard to find israel ’ s guilt ,
the lord says , “ attack the country of merathaim !
“ the noise of battle can be heard all over the country .
babylon , i set a trap for you ,
the lord has opened up his storeroom
“ come against babylon from far away .
kill all the young men in babylon .
people are running out of babylon .
“ call for the archers .
babylon ’ s young men will be killed in the streets .
“ babylon , you are too proud ,
proud babylon will stumble and fall ,
this is what the lord all-powerful says :
but god will get them back .
sword , kill the priests of babylon .
sword , kill the horses and chariots of babylon .
sword , strike the waters of babylon .
babylon will never again be filled with people .
god completely destroyed sodom and gomorrah
“ look ! there are people coming from the north .
their armies have bows and spears .
the king of babylon heard about those armies ,
“ sometimes a lion will come
listen to what the lord has planned
i will send foreigners to winnow babylon ,
the babylonian soldiers will not get to use their bows and arrows .
babylon ’ s soldiers will be killed in the land of the chaldeans .
the lord all-powerful did not leave israel and judah alone , like a widow .
run away from babylon .
babylon was like a golden cup in the lord ’ s hand .
but babylon will suddenly fall and be broken .
we tried to heal babylon ,
the lord got even for us .
lift up a flag against the walls of babylon .
babylon , you live near much water .
the lord all-powerful used his name to make this promise :
god used his great power and made the earth .
when he thunders , the waters in the skies roar .
but people are so stupid .
those idols are worthless .
but god , who is jacob ’ s portion , is not like those worthless statues .
the lord says , “ babylon , you are my club .
i used you to smash horse and rider .
i used you to smash men and women .
i used you to smash shepherds and flocks .
but i will repay babylonia and all the babylonians for all the evil things they did to zion .
people will not take stones from babylon to use as the foundation of a building .
“ lift up the war flag in the land !
get the nations ready for battle against her .
the land shakes and moves as if it is in pain .
babylon ’ s soldiers have stopped fighting .
one messenger follows another .
the places where people cross the rivers have been captured .
this is what the lord all-powerful , the god of the people of israel , says :
“ king nebuchadnezzar of babylon destroyed us in the past .
babylon did terrible things to hurt us .
so this is what the lord says :
babylon will become a pile of ruined buildings ,
“ the people of babylon are like roaring young lions .
they are acting like powerful lions .
“ babylon will be like sheep , rams , and goats waiting to be killed .
“ sheshach will be defeated .
the sea will rise over babylon .
babylon will be like a dry , desert land .
i will punish the false god bel in babylon .
come out of the city of babylon , my people .
“ don ’ t be sad , my people .
the time will surely come when i will punish the false gods of babylon ,
then heaven and earth and all that is in them
“ babylon killed people from israel .
you people escaped the swords .
“ we people of judah are ashamed .
the lord says , “ the time is coming ,
babylon might grow until she touches the sky .
“ we can hear people crying in babylon .
the lord will destroy babylon very soon .
the army will come and destroy babylon .
i will make babylon ’ s wise men
this is what the lord all-powerful says :
jeremiah had written on a scroll all the terrible things that would happen to babylon . he had written all these things about babylon .
jeremiah said to seraiah , “ seraiah , go to babylon . be sure to read this message so that all the people can hear you .
after you finish reading this scroll , tie a stone to it and throw it into the euphrates river .
zedekiah did evil things , just as king jehoiakim had done . the lord did not like zedekiah doing those evil things .
terrible things happened to the people of jerusalem and judah because the lord was angry with them . finally , he threw them out of his presence .
the city of jerusalem was surrounded by the army of babylon until the eleventh year that zedekiah was king .
but the babylonian army chased king zedekiah and caught him on the plains of jericho . all of zedekiah ’ s soldiers ran away .
nebuzaradan burned the lord ’ s temple , the king ’ s palace , and every important building in jerusalem , as well as all the houses .
all the babylonian soldiers that were with the commander broke down the walls around jerusalem .
but nebuzaradan left some of the poorest people behind in the land . he left them to work in the vineyards and the fields .
there were 96 pomegranates on the sides of the pillars . all together , there were 100 pomegranates above the net design that went around the pillars .
this is how many people nebuchadnezzar carried into captivity :
in nebuchadnezzar ’ s 18th year as king of babylon , 832 people were taken from jerusalem .
in nebuchadnezzar ’ s 23rd year as king , nebuzaradan took 745 people of judah into captivity . nebuzaradan was the commander of the king ’ s special guards .
evil merodach spoke kindly to jehoiachin . he gave jehoiachin a place of honor higher than the other kings who were with him in babylon .
so jehoiachin took his prison clothes off . for the rest of his life , he ate regularly at the king ’ s table .
every day the king of babylon paid jehoiachin enough to take care of his needs until the day jehoiachin died .
job had seven sons and three daughters .
he owned 7000 sheep , 3000 camels , 1000 oxen , and 500 female donkeys . he had many servants . he was the richest man in the east .
job ’ s sons took turns having dinner parties in their homes , and they invited their sisters .
then the day came for the angels to meet with the lord . even satan was there with them .
the lord said to satan , “ where have you been ? ”
satan answered the lord , “ but job has a good reason to respect you .
but if you were to destroy everything he has , i promise you that he would curse you to your face . ”
the lord said to satan , “ all right , do whatever you want with anything that he has , but don ’ t hurt job himself . ”
one day job ’ s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine at the oldest brother ’ s house .
a messenger came to job and said , “ we were plowing the fields with the oxen and the donkeys were eating grass nearby ,
even after all this , job did not sin . he did not accuse god of doing anything wrong .
then another day came for the angels to meet with the lord . satan joined them for this meeting with the lord .
the lord said to satan , “ where have you been ? ”
satan answered , “ skin for skin ! a man will give everything he has to protect himself .
i swear , if you attack his flesh and bones , he will curse you to your face ! ”
so the lord said to satan , “ all right , job is in your hands , but you are not allowed to kill him . ”
job sat on the pile of ashes where he was mourning and used a piece of broken pottery to scrape his sores .
his wife said to him , “ are you still holding on to your faith ? why don ’ t you just curse god and die ! ”
then job opened his mouth and cursed the day he was born .
“ i wish the day i was born would be lost forever .
i wish that day had remained dark .
i wish that bitter day had remained as dark as death ,
i wish the darkness had carried away that night ,
i wish that night had produced nothing
some magicians think they can wake leviathan .
let that day ’ s morning star be dark .
i wish it had stopped me from being born
why didn ’ t i die when i was born ?
why did my mother hold me on her knees ?
if i had died when i was born ,
with the kings and their advisors
i wish i were buried with rulers
why wasn ’ t i a child who died at birth
there the wicked stop causing trouble ,
even prisoners find relief there ;
everyone—from the greatest to the least important—will be there ,
“ why must a suffering person continue to live ?
such people want to die , but death does not come .
they would be happy to find their grave .
but god keeps their future a secret
when it is time to eat , all i can do is sigh with sadness , not joy .
i was afraid something terrible would happen ,
i can not calm down or relax .
eliphaz from teman answered :
“ i must say something .
job , you have taught many people .
your words helped those who were ready to fall .
but now trouble comes to you ,
can you think of any innocent person who was ever destroyed ?
yes , i have seen people whose lives were cut short ,
they lost the breath god gave them .
they were like roaring lions ,
like a lioness that can not find prey .
“ i happened to hear a message .
like a bad dream in the night ,
a spirit passed by my face .
the spirit stood still ,
‘ a person can not be more right than god .
look , god can not even trust his heavenly servants .
so surely people are worse !
from dawn to sunset people are destroyed .
the ropes of their tent are pulled up ,
“ job , call out if you want , and see if anyone answers !
a fool ’ s anger will kill him .
i saw a fool who thought he was safe ,
there was no one to help his children .
hungry people ate all his crops ,
bad times don ’ t come up from the dirt .
but people are born to have trouble ,
if i were you , i would turn to god
people can not understand the wonderful things god does .
he sends rain all over the earth
he raises up the humble
he spoils the plans of even the smartest people
he catches those who think they are wise in their own clever traps
daylight will be like darkness for them .
god saves the poor from the hurtful words of the wicked .
so the poor have hope ;
“ you are fortunate when god corrects you .
god might injure you , but he will bandage those wounds .
he will save you again and again .
god will save you from death
people might say bad things about you with their sharp tongues .
you will laugh at destruction and famine .
it is as if you have a peace treaty
you will live in peace because your tent is safe .
you will have many children .
you will be like the wheat that grows until harvest time .
“ we have studied this and know it is true .
“ i wish my suffering could be weighed
they would be heavier than all the sand of the sea !
god all-powerful has shot me with his arrows .
even a wild donkey does not complain when it has grass to eat .
food without salt does not taste good ,
i refuse to touch that kind of food ;
“ i wish i could have what i ask for .
i wish he would crush me—
then i would be comforted by this one thing :
“ with my strength gone , i have no hope to go on living .
i am not strong like a rock .
i don ’ t have the power to help myself ,
“ friends should be loyal to you in times of trouble ,
but i can not depend on you , my brothers .
in the winter , it is choked with ice and melting snow .
but when the weather is hot and dry ,
it twists and turns along the way
traders from tema search for it .
they are sure they can find water ,
now , you are like those streams .
but have i ever asked you to help me ?
no , and i never said , ‘ save me from my enemies ! ’
“ so now , teach me , and i will be quiet .
honest words are powerful ,
do you plan to criticize me ?
are you the kind of people
now , look me in the face ,
you need to start over and stop being so unfair !
i am not lying .
“ people have a hard struggle on earth .
they are like a slave looking for cool shade
month after frustrating month has gone by .
when i lie down , i think ,
my skin is covered with worms and scabs .
“ my days pass by faster than a weaver ’ s shuttle ,
god , remember , my life is like a breath .
those who see me now will never see me again .
just as clouds that come and go ,
they don ’ t come back to their old homes .
“ so i will not be quiet !
am i one of your enemies ?
my bed should bring me comfort .
but when i lie down , you scare me with dreams ;
so i would rather be choked to death
i hate my life—i give up .
god , why are people so important to you ?
why do you visit them every morning
you never look away from me
you are always watching us !
why don ’ t you just pardon me for doing wrong ?
then bildad from shuah answered :
“ how long will you talk like that ?
god is always fair .
if your children sinned against god , he punished them .
but now , look to god
if you are pure and good ,
then you will have a lot more
“ ask those who are now old .
it seems as though we were born yesterday .
maybe the old people can tell you something .
“ can papyrus grow tall on a dry land ?
no , they will dry up before harvest .
people who forget god are like that .
they have put their trust in something weak .
when they lean against it ,
such people are like a vine that gets plenty of water and sunshine ,
its roots spread among the rocks ,
but if you move it , it will die ,
everything might have been going well ,
god does not support evil people ,
so perhaps you might laugh again .
maybe your enemies will be humiliated
“ of course , i know that this is true .
anyone who chose to argue with him
god is so wise and powerful that
when god is angry , he moves mountains before they know what happened .
he can shake the earth ,
with one command he can stop the sun from rising .
he alone made the skies ,
“ god made the bear , orion , and the pleiades .
he does things too marvelous for people to understand .
when he passes by , i can not see him .
if he takes something away , no one can stop him .
god will not hold back his anger .
so i can not argue with god .
i am innocent , but i can not give him an answer .
even if i called and he answered ,
he would just send storms to crush me .
he would not let me catch my breath again .
i can not defeat god .
i am innocent , but anything i say makes me seem guilty .
i am innocent , but i don ’ t know what to think .
so i say , ‘ does it make any difference ?
is it god who laughs when a disaster kills innocent people ?
is it god who keeps the leaders from seeing when an evil person takes control ?
“ my days are passing faster than a runner .
they go by as quickly as papyrus boats ,
“ i could say , ‘ i will not complain .
but the suffering still frightens me .
i will be found guilty ,
even if i scrubbed my hands with soap
god would still push me into the slime pit ,
god is not a human like me , so i can not argue with him .
i wish there were someone who could listen to both sides ,
i wish someone could take away the threat of god ’ s punishment .
then i could say what i want without being afraid of him .
“ i hate my own life , so i will complain freely .
i will say to god , ‘ don ’ t just say i am guilty !
do you enjoy hurting me ?
do you have human eyes ?
is your life as short as ours ?
you look for my wrong
you know i am innocent ,
your hands made me and shaped my body .
remember , you molded me like clay .
you poured me out like milk .
you put me together with bones and muscles ,
you gave me life and were very kind to me .
but this is what you hid in your heart .
if i sinned , you would be watching me
if i sin , i am guilty
if i have any success and feel proud ,
you bring witness after witness
so why did you let me be born ?
i wish i had never lived .
my life is almost finished .
i am going soon to the land of no return ,
that land of darkest night , of shadows and confusion ,
then zophar from naamah answered job and said ,
“ this flood of words should be answered !
do you think we don ’ t have
you say to god ,
i wish god would answer you
he could tell you the secret of wisdom .
“ do you think you really understand god ?
that knowledge is higher than the heavens
it is greater than the earth
“ if god decides to arrest you and take you to court ,
god knows who is worthless .
a wild donkey can not give birth to a man ,
prepare your heart to serve only god .
put away the sin that you still hold on to .
if you will do that , you could look to god without shame .
then you can forget your troubles ,
your life will be brighter than the sunshine at noon .
you will feel safe because there is hope .
you will lie down without fear of anyone .
evil people might look for help ,
then job answered them :
“ i ’ m sure you think you are
but my mind is as good as yours .
“ my friends laugh at me now .
those who have no troubles make fun of those who do .
but robbers ’ tents are not bothered .
“ but ask the animals , and they will teach you .
or speak to the earth , and it will teach you .
every animal that lives and everyone who breathes—
but just as the tongue tastes food ,
people say , ‘ wisdom is to be found in those who are old .
but wisdom and power belong to god .
anything god tears down can not be rebuilt .
if he holds back the rain , the earth will dry up .
god is strong and always wins .
he strips advisors of their wisdom
he strips kings of their authority
he strips priests of their power
he makes trusted advisors be silent .
he brings disgrace to important people .
he exposes even the darkest secrets .
god makes nations great ,
he makes their leaders foolish .
they are like someone feeling their way in the dark .
“ i have seen all this before .
i know as much as you do .
but i don ’ t want to argue with you .
but you men try to cover up your ignorance with lies .
i wish you would just be quiet .
“ now , listen to my argument .
will you speak lies for god ?
are you trying to defend god against me ?
if god checked you very closely ,
you know that god would criticize you
god ’ s majesty frightens you .
the wise sayings you quote are worthless .
“ be quiet and let me talk !
i will put myself in danger
i will continue to trust god even if he kills me .
and if he lets me live , it will be because i had the confidence to speak .
listen carefully to what i say .
i am ready now to defend myself .
if anyone can prove i am wrong ,
“ god , just give me two things ,
then call to me , and i will answer you .
how many sins have i committed ?
god , why do you avoid me
are you trying to scare me ?
you have a list of terrible charges against me .
you have put chains on my feet .
so i am becoming weaker and weaker ,
“ we are all human beings .
our life is like a flower that grows quickly and then dies away .
god , do you need to keep an eye on something so small ?
“ no one can make something clean from something so dirty .
the length of our life has been decided .
so stop watching us ; leave us alone ,
“ there is always hope for a tree .
its roots might grow old in the ground
but with water , it will grow again .
but when a man dies ,
like a lake that goes dry
so people lose their lives ,
“ i wish you would hide me in my grave .
if a man dies , will he live again ?
god , you would call me ,
you would still watch every step i take ,
it would be as if you had sealed my sins in a bag .
“ mountains fall and crumble away .
water flowing over stones wears them down .
if their sons are honored , they will never know it .
they only feel the pain in their bodies ,
then eliphaz from teman answered job :
“ if you were really wise ,
do you think a wise man would use empty words
if you had your way ,
what you say clearly shows your sin .
i don ’ t need to prove to you that you are wrong .
“ do you think you were the first person ever to be born ?
did you listen to god ’ s secret plans ?
we know as much as you do !
the old , gray-haired men agree with us .
god tries to comfort you , but that is not enough for you .
why will you not understand ?
you are expressing your anger against god
“ people can not really be pure .
god does not even trust his angels .
people are even worse .
“ listen to me , and i will explain it to you .
i will tell you what wise men would say ,
these are important people in our country !
and they said that an evil man suffers all his life .
every noise scares him .
an evil man has no hope of escaping the darkness .
he wanders from place to place , looking for food .
he lives in fear , with worry and suffering threatening him
that is because that evil man shook his fist at god , refusing to obey .
like a soldier with a thick , strong shield
he might be rich and fat ,
but his town will be ruined ;
he will not be rich for long .
he will not escape the darkness .
that evil man should not fool himself by trusting in worthless things ,
he will die before his time ,
he will be like a vine that loses its grapes before they ripen .
that is because people without god have nothing .
they are always thinking of ways to do evil and cause trouble .
“ i have heard all these things before .
your long speeches never end !
i also could say the same things you say ,
but i would say things to encourage you
“ nothing i say makes my pain go away .
god , you surely took away my strength .
you have made me thin and weak ,
“ god attacks me ;
people have crowded around me .
god has given me to evil people .
i was enjoying a quiet , peaceful life ,
with his archers all around me ,
again and again he attacks me .
“ i am very sad , so i wear this sackcloth .
my face is red from crying .
i was never cruel to anyone ,
“ earth , don ’ t hide the wrong things that were done to me .
even now there is someone in heaven who will speak for me .
my friend speaks for me ,
he speaks to god for me ,
“ in only a few years
my spirit is broken ;
people stand around me and laugh at me .
“ god , give me some support .
you have closed my friends ’ minds ,
you know what people say :
god has made my name a bad word to everyone .
my eyes are almost blind from my grief .
good people wonder how this could happen .
but those who do right will continue to do what is right .
“ but come on , all of you , and try to prove me wrong .
my life is passing away , and my plans are destroyed .
“ i might hope for the grave to be my new home .
i might say to the grave , ‘ you are my father , ’
but you can ’ t really call that hope , can you ?
will hope go down with me to the place of death ?
then bildad from shuah answered :
“ when will you stop talking ?
why do you think we are stupid ,
your anger is hurting no one but you .
“ yes , the light of those who are evil will go out .
the light in their houses will become dark .
their steps , once strong and fast , become weak .
their own feet lead them into a net .
a trap catches them by the heel ,
a rope is hidden on the ground to trip them .
on every side terrors frighten them .
disaster is hungry for them .
diseases will eat away their skin .
they will be taken away from the safety of their tents
nothing will be left in their tents ,
their roots below will dry up ,
people on earth will not remember them .
they will be forced from light into darkness .
they will leave behind no children , no descendants .
people in the west will be shocked at what happened to them .
this is what will happen to the homes of those who are evil .
“ how long will you hurt me
you have insulted me ten times now .
even if i have sinned ,
you want me to look bad to make yourselves look good .
i want you to know it was god who did this .
i shout , ‘ he hurt me ! ’ but get no answer .
god has blocked my way to keep me from getting through .
he took away my honor .
he hits me on every side until i am worn out .
his anger burns against me .
he sends his army to attack me .
“ god has made my brothers hate me .
my relatives have left me .
my servant girls and visitors in my home
i call for my servant , but he does not answer .
my wife hates the smell of my breath .
even little children make fun of me .
all my close friends hate me .
“ i am so thin , my skin hangs loose on my bones .
“ pity me , my friends , pity me ,
why do you persecute me as god does ?
“ i wish someone would write down everything i say .
i wish they were carved with an iron tool into lead
i know that there is someone to defend me and that he lives !
after i leave my body and my skin has been destroyed ,
i will see him with my own eyes .
“ maybe you will say , ‘ how can we push job a little harder
but you need to worry about your own punishment .
then zophar from naamah answered :
“ you upset me , so i must answer you .
you insulted me with your answers !
“ you know that the joy of the wicked does not last long .
maybe an evil man ’ s pride will reach up to the sky ,
but he will be gone forever like his own body waste .
like a dream , he will fly away , never to be found .
those who knew him before will not see him again .
his children will have to give back what he took from the poor .
when he was young , his bones were strong ,
“ evil tastes sweet in his mouth .
he hates to let it go
but that evil will turn sour in his stomach .
the evil man will spit out the riches he has swallowed .
what he drank will be like a snake ’ s poison ;
he will never again enjoy so much wealth—
he will be forced to give back his profits .
because he hurt the poor and left them with nothing .
“ the evil man is never satisfied .
after filling himself , there is nothing left .
even while he has plenty , he will be pressed down with trouble .
if he does get all he wants ,
maybe he will run away from an iron sword ,
it will go through his body
all his treasures will be lost in darkness .
heaven will prove that he is guilty .
his house and everything in it will be carried away
that is what god will do to those who are evil .
“ listen to what i say .
be patient while i speak .
“ my complaint is not against people .
look at me and be shocked .
when i think about what happened to me ,
why do evil people live long lives ?
they watch their children grow up
their homes are safe and free from fear .
their bulls never fail to mate .
they send their children out to play like lambs .
they sing and dance to the sound of harps and flutes .
evil people enjoy success during their lives
they say to god , ‘ leave us alone !
and they say , ‘ who is god all-powerful ?
“ of course , evil people don ’ t make their own success .
but how often does god blow out their light ?
does god blow them away , as the wind blows straw
but you say , ‘ god is saving their punishment for their children . ’
let them see their own punishment .
when their life is finished and they are dead ,
“ no one can teach god anything he doesn ’ t already know .
one person dies after living a full and successful life ,
with a body that was well fed
but another person dies after a hard life that has made them bitter ,
in the end , both of these people will lie together in the dirt .
“ but i know what you are thinking ,
you might say , ‘ show me a good man ’ s house .
“ surely you have talked with travelers .
evil people are spared when disaster comes .
no one criticizes them to their faces for how they lived .
when they are carried to the grave ,
so even the soil in the valley will be pleasant for them ,
“ so your empty words are no comfort to me .
then eliphaz from teman answered :
“ does god need our help ?
does your living right benefit him ?
why does god blame and punish you ?
no , it is because you sin so much .
maybe to guarantee loans you took things from people for no reason .
maybe you failed to give water or food
you have a lot of farmland ,
but maybe you sent widows away without giving them anything .
that is why traps are all around you ,
that is why it is so dark you can not see ,
“ god lives in the highest part of heaven
but you might say , ‘ what does god know ?
thick clouds hide us from his eyes ,
“ job , you are walking on the old path
they were destroyed before it was their time to die .
they told god , ‘ leave us alone ! ’
and it was god who filled their houses with good things .
those who do what is right are happy to see them destroyed .
‘ surely our enemies are destroyed !
“ now , job , give yourself to god and make peace with him .
if you return to god all-powerful , you will be restored .
think of your gold as nothing but dirt .
and let god all-powerful be your gold .
then you will enjoy god all-powerful ,
when you pray , he will hear you .
if you decide to do something , it will be successful .
when people are brought down and you ask god to help them ,
even those who are guilty will be forgiven .
“ i am still complaining today .
i wish i knew where to find him .
i would present my case to him .
he could give his response , and i would understand .
would god use his power against me ?
since i am an honest man , he would let me tell my story .
“ if i go to the east , god is not there .
when he is working in the north , i don ’ t see him .
but god knows me .
i have always lived the way god wants .
i always obey his commands .
“ but god never changes ,
he will do to me what he planned ,
that is why i am terrified to stand before him .
the fear of god has made me lose my courage .
what has happened to me is like a dark cloud over my face .
“ why doesn ’ t god all-powerful set times for judgment ?
“ people move property markers to get more of their neighbor ’ s land .
they steal a donkey that belongs to an orphan .
they take a nursing baby from its mother .
they force the poor to move out of their way
“ the poor are like wild donkeys that go out to the desert to find food .
they have to work in the fields , harvesting grain .
they must sleep all night without clothes .
they are soaked with rain in the mountains .
they have no clothes , so they work naked .
they press out olive oil
in the city you can hear the sad sounds of dying people .
“ some people rebel against the light .
a murderer gets up at dawn and kills poor , helpless people .
a man who commits adultery waits for the night to come .
when it is dark , evil people go out and break into houses .
the darkest night is their morning .
“ you say , ‘ evil people are taken away like things carried away in a flood .
as hot , dry weather melts away the winter snows ,
their own mothers will forget them .
these evil people hurt women who have no children to protect them ,
by his power god removes the powerful .
they might feel safe and secure ,
they might be successful for a while , but then they will be gone .
“ i swear these things are true !
then bildad from shuah answered :
“ god is the ruler .
no one can count his stars .
how can anyone claim to be right before god ?
in god ’ s eyes even the moon is not pure and bright ;
people are much less pure .
“ bildad , what a great help you are to this tired , weary man !
you have given such wonderful advice to this foolish man !
who helped you say these things ?
“ the ghosts and their neighbors
but god can see clearly into that place of death .
god stretched the northern sky over empty space .
he fills the thick clouds with water .
he covers the face of the full moon .
he drew the horizon on the ocean ,
the foundations that hold up the sky
with his own power god calmed the sea .
his breath made the skies clear .
these are only a few of the amazing things god has done .
job continued his answer :
“ god all-powerful has been unfair to me ;
as long as i have life in me ,
i will not be a hypocrite .
you will never hear me say you men are right !
i will hold on to my innocence and never let go !
may my enemies be punished like those who are evil .
what hope do people without god have when it is time to die ,
when they have troubles and cry out for help ,
it will be too late for them to enjoy talking with god all-powerful .
“ i will teach you about god ’ s power .
but you have seen it all with your own eyes .
“ here is what god has planned for those who are evil .
they may have many children , but all of them will be killed in war .
all those who are left will die ,
evil people collect silver as easily as dirt .
but their piles of clothes will be worn by those who have lived right .
evil people might build houses , but they will not last long .
they might be rich when they go to bed ,
terrible fears will come over them like a flood ,
the east wind will carry them away , and they will be gone .
they may try to run away from the power of the storm ,
it will make a sound like clapping hands as they run away .
“ there are mines where people get silver
iron is dug out of the ground ,
miners carry lights deep into caves
far from where people live , they dig deep into the ground ,
food grows on the ground above .
in the rocks there are sapphires
wild birds know nothing about the way to these places .
wild animals have never been there .
miners dig the hardest rocks .
they cut tunnels through the rocks
they even find places where rivers begin .
“ but where can anyone find wisdom ?
people don ’ t know where wisdom is .
the deep ocean says , ‘ it ’ s not here with me . ’
you can not buy wisdom with even the purest gold .
you can not buy it with gold from ophir
wisdom is worth more than gold or crystal .
it is far more valuable than coral and jasper ,
the topaz from ethiopia can not match its value ,
“ so where does wisdom come from ?
wisdom is hidden from every living thing on earth .
death and destruction say ,
“ only god knows the way to wisdom .
he can see to the very ends of the earth .
god gave the wind its power .
he decided where to send the rain
he looked at wisdom and discussed it .
then he said to humans ,
job continued to speak :
“ i wish my life could be the same as it was a few months ago ,
god ’ s light shined above me ,
i wish for the days when i was successful ,
god all-powerful was still with me then ,
life was so good that i washed my feet in cream
“ those were the days when i went to the city gate
when the young men saw me coming , they stepped out of my way .
the leaders of the people stopped talking
even the most important leaders were quiet ,
all who heard me said good things about me .
because i helped the poor when they cried out .
people who were dying asked god to bless me .
right living was my clothing .
i was like eyes for the blind ,
i was like a father to the poor .
i stopped evil people from abusing their power
“ i always thought i would live a long life ,
i was like a healthy plant with roots that have plenty of water
i thought each new day would bring more honor
“ in the past people listened to me .
when i finished speaking , they had nothing more to say .
they waited for my words as they would for rain .
i smiled at them , and they could hardly believe it .
i was their leader and made decisions about their future .
“ but now men younger than i make fun of me—
their fathers are still too weak to be of any use to me .
they are starving with nothing to eat ,
they pull up salt plants in the desert
they are forced away from other people ,
they must live in the dry riverbeds ,
they howl in the bushes
they are a bunch of worthless people without names ,
“ now their sons sing songs to make fun of me .
they hate me and stay far away from me ,
god has taken the string from my bow and made me weak ,
they attack me on my right side .
they guard the road so that i can not escape .
they break a hole in the wall and come rushing through it ,
i am shaking with fear .
“ now my life is almost gone , and soon i will die .
all my bones ache at night .
god grabbed the collar of my coat
he threw me into the mud ,
“ god , i cry out to you for help , but you don ’ t answer .
you have become cruel to me ;
you let the strong wind blow me away .
i know you will lead me to my death ,
“ surely no one would attack a man who is already ruined ,
god , you know that i cried for those who were in trouble .
but when i hoped for good , trouble came instead .
i constantly feel upset .
i am always sad and depressed , without any relief .
making sad sounds like the wild dogs ,
my skin is burned and peeling away .
my harp is tuned to play songs of sorrow .
“ i made an agreement with my eyes
what does god above have for us ?
he sends trouble to the wicked
god is the one who knows what i do
“ i have not lied to anyone .
if god would use accurate scales ,
if i ever stepped off the right path ,
then let others eat what i planted .
“ if i have desired another woman
then let my wife serve someone else ,
to do such a thing would be shameful ,
such sin is like a fire that burns until it destroys everything .
“ if i refused to be fair to my slaves
then what will i do when i must face god ?
the one who made me in my mother ’ s womb also made them .
“ i have never refused to help the poor .
i have never been selfish with my food .
all my life i have been like a father to orphans
whenever i found people suffering because they didn ’ t have clothes
i always gave them something to wear .
i never threatened an orphan ,
if i ever did that , may my arm be pulled from its socket
but i didn ’ t do any of these bad things .
“ i have never trusted in riches .
i have been wealthy ,
i have never worshiped the bright sun
i was never foolish enough
this is also a sin that must be punished .
“ i have never been happy
i have never let my mouth sin by cursing my enemies
the people in my house know that
i always invited strangers into my home
i have not tried to hide my sins as some people do .
i was never so afraid of what people might say or of making enemies
“ how i wish someone would listen to me !
i would wear it around my neck .
then i could explain everything i have done .
“ i did not use my land in a wrong way .
i always paid the workers for the food i got from the land .
if i ever did any of these bad things ,
then job ’ s three friends gave up trying to answer him , because he was so sure that he was innocent .
elihu was also angry with job ’ s three friends because they could not answer him , and yet they still considered him guilty of doing wrong .
elihu was the youngest one there , so he had waited until everyone finished talking .
but when he saw that job ’ s three friends had nothing more to say , his anger forced him to speak .
so here ’ s what elihu son of barakel the buzite said :
i thought to myself , ‘ older people should speak first .
but it is the spirit in people , the breath from god all-powerful ,
old men are not the only wise people .
“ so please listen to me ,
i waited patiently while you men talked .
i listened carefully to what you said .
you men can not say that you have found wisdom .
job was arguing with you , not me ,
“ job , these men lost the argument .
i waited for them to answer you .
so now i will give you my answer .
i have so much to say
i feel like a jar of wine that has never been opened .
i must speak so that i will feel better .
i will treat you the same as i would treat anyone else .
i can not treat one person better than another .
“ now , job , listen to me .
i am ready to speak .
my heart is honest , so my words are sincere .
god ’ s spirit made me .
listen to me and answer if you can .
you and i are the same before god .
don ’ t be afraid of me .
“ but , job , i heard what you said .
‘ i am pure and innocent ;
but god found an excuse to attack me .
he put chains on my feet
“ but you are wrong about this , and i will prove it to you .
you are arguing with god !
but maybe god does explain what he does
he may speak in a dream , or in a vision at night ,
he may whisper something in their ear ,
god warns people to stop them from doing wrong
he does this to save them from death .
“ or those who are sick in bed might be suffering punishment from god .
they feel so bad they can not eat .
their bodies might waste away until they become thin
they might be close to death ,
but maybe one of god ’ s thousands of angels is watching over them ,
maybe the angel will be kind and say to god ,
then that person ’ s body will become young and strong again .
he will pray and god will answer .
he will tell everyone , ‘ i sinned .
god saved me from going down to the place of death .
“ god does all these things for people again and again .
he wants them to be saved from death
“ job , pay attention and listen to me .
but if you have an answer , go ahead and speak .
but if you have nothing to say , then listen to me .
then elihu continued his speech :
“ listen to what i say , you wise men .
your tongue tastes the food it touches ,
so let us test these arguments and decide for ourselves what is right .
job says , ‘ i am innocent ,
i am right , but i am judged to be a liar .
“ would anyone but job say such things ?
he is a friend of evil people .
i know this because he says ,
“ you men can understand , so listen to me .
he pays us back for what we have done .
the truth is that god does no wrong .
no one chose god to be in charge of the earth .
if god decided to take away his spirit
then everything on earth would die .
“ if you men are wise ,
can someone be a ruler if he hates justice ?
god is the one who says to kings , ‘ you are worthless ! ’
he does not respect leaders more than other people .
any of us can die suddenly , in the middle of the night .
“ god watches what people do .
there is no place dark enough
god does not need to set a time
he does not have to ask questions when people do wrong ,
when he learns what people have done ,
he will punish them for the evil they have done ,
he will do this because they rebelled against him
they hurt the poor and made them cry to god for help .
but if god decides not to help them ,
he keeps the wicked from ruling
“ a person should say to god ,
show me the sins i am not able to see .
job , you want god to reward you ,
a wise person would listen to me .
‘ job talks like an ignorant person .
i think job should be punished even more ,
he adds rebellion to his other sins .
elihu continued talking and said ,
“ job , it is not fair for you to say ,
because you also ask him ,
“ job , i want to answer you and your friends here with you .
look up at the sky .
if you sin , it does not hurt god .
and if you are good , that does not help god .
job , the good and bad things you do
“ if people are being hurt , they cry out
but they forget to say , ‘ where is god , the one who made me ?
he is the one who makes us smarter than any animal on earth
“ or if evil people ask god for help , he will not answer them ,
god will not listen to their worthless begging .
so , job , god will not listen to you
“ job thinks that god does not punish evil
so he continues his worthless talking .
elihu continued talking and said ,
“ be patient with me a little longer .
i will share my knowledge with everyone .
job , i am telling the truth .
“ god is very powerful , but he does not hate people .
he will not let evil people live .
he watches over those who live right .
so if people are punished ,
and god will tell them what they did ,
he will force them to listen to his warning .
if they serve and obey him , he will make them successful
but if they refuse to obey him , they will be destroyed .
“ people who don ’ t care about god are always bitter .
they will die while they are still young ,
god saves those who suffer by using their suffering .
“ in fact , god wants to help you out of your troubles .
but you are full of this talk about guilt , judgment , and justice !
job , don ’ t let your anger fill you with doubt about god .
do you think your wealth will keep you out of trouble ?
don ’ t be like those who wish darkness would come and hide them .
job , don ’ t let your suffering cause you to choose evil .
“ look , god ’ s power makes him great !
no one can tell him what to do .
remember to praise him for what he has done ,
everyone can see what he has done ,
yes , god is great , but we can not understand his greatness .
“ god takes up water from the earth
so the clouds pour out the water ,
no one can understand how he spreads the clouds out
look , he spreads lightning all over the sky
he uses them to control the nations
he grabs the lightning with his hands ,
the thunder warns that a storm is coming .
“ the thunder and lightning frighten me ;
listen to god ’ s thundering voice !
he sends his lightning to flash across the whole sky .
after the flashes of lightning you can hear his roaring voice .
god ’ s thundering voice is amazing !
he says to the snow ,
god does this to stop everyone ’ s work
the animals run into their dens and stay there .
whirlwinds come from the south .
god ’ s breath makes ice
he fills the clouds with water
he orders the clouds to be blown all around the earth .
he causes the clouds to punish people with floods
“ job , stop for a minute and listen .
do you know how god controls the clouds ?
do you know how the clouds hang in the sky ?
all you know is that you sweat , your clothes stick to you ,
can you help god spread out the sky
“ job , tell us what we should say to god !
i would not tell god that i wanted to talk to him .
a person can not look at the sun .
in the same way god ’ s golden glory shines from the holy mountain .
we have seen that god all-powerful really is all powerful !
that is why people fear and respect him .
then the lord spoke to job from a whirlwind and said ,
“ who is this ignorant person
prepare yourself for an attack !
“ where were you when i made the earth ?
and who decided how big the earth should be ?
what is the earth resting on ?
when the morning stars sang together
“ who closed the flood gates
who covered it with clouds
i set the limits for the sea
i said to the sea , ‘ you can come this far , but no farther .
“ did you ever in your life command the morning to begin
did you ever tell the morning light to grab the earth
the morning light makes the hills
evil people don ’ t like the daylight .
“ have you ever gone to the deepest parts of the sea ?
has anyone shown you the gates to the world of the dead ?
do you really understand how big the earth is ?
“ where does light come from ?
can you take them back to where they belong ?
surely you know these things , since you are so old and wise .
“ have you ever gone into the storerooms
i save them there for times of trouble ,
have you ever gone to the place where the sun comes up ,
who dug ditches in the sky for the heavy rain ?
who makes it rain even in desert places
the rain gives that dry empty land all the water it needs ,
does the rain have a father ?
does ice have a mother ?
that ’ s when the water freezes as hard as a rock .
“ can you tie up the pleiades ?
can you bring out the other constellations at the right times ?
do you know the laws that control the sky ?
“ can you shout at the clouds
can you give a command to the lightning ?
“ who makes people wise ?
who is wise enough to count the clouds
the rain makes the dust become mud ,
“ do you find food for the lions ?
no , they hide in their caves
who feeds the ravens when their babies cry out to god
“ do you know when the mountain goats are born ?
do you know how many months they must carry their babies ?
these animals lie down , they feel their birth pains ,
their babies grow strong out in the wild .
“ who let the wild donkeys go free ?
i let the wild donkey have the desert for a home .
they are happy to be away from the noise of the city .
they live in the mountains .
“ will a wild bull agree to serve you ?
will he let you put ropes on him
a wild bull is very strong ,
can you trust him to gather your grain
“ an ostrich gets excited and flaps its wings , but it can not fly .
an ostrich lays her eggs on the ground
the ostrich forgets that someone might step on her eggs
an ostrich leaves her little babies .
that ’ s because i did not give wisdom to the ostrich .
but when the ostrich gets up to run , she laughs at the horse and its rider ,
“ did you give the horse its strength ?
did you make it able to jump like a locust
a horse is happy to be so strong .
it laughs at fear ; nothing makes it afraid !
the soldier ’ s quiver shakes on the horse ’ s side .
the horse gets very excited and races over the ground .
when the trumpet sounds , it snorts , ‘ hurray ! ’
“ did you teach the hawk how to spread its wings and fly south ?
are you the one who told the eagle to fly high into the sky ?
it lives high on a peak at the top of a cliff .
from there it looks far into the distance ,
the eagles gather around dead bodies ,
then the lord said to job ,
“ you wanted to argue with god all-powerful .
then job answered the lord :
“ i am not worthy to speak !
i spoke once , but i will not speak again .
then the lord spoke to job again from the storm :
“ are you trying to show that i am unfair ?
are your arms as strong as mine ?
if so , you can be proud
if you are as powerful as god , then show your anger !
yes , just look at the proud and make them humble .
bury them all in the dirt .
if you can do any of these things , then even i will praise you .
“ look at the behemoth .
but he has great strength in his body .
his tail stands strong like a cedar tree .
his bones are as strong as bronze .
the behemoth is the most amazing animal i made ,
he eats the grass that grows on the hills
he lies under the lotus plants .
the lotus plants hide him in their shade .
if the river floods , the behemoth will not run away .
no one can blind his eyes and capture him .
“ can you catch leviathan with a fishhook ?
can you put a rope through his nose
will he beg you to let him go free ?
will he make an agreement with you
will you play with leviathan as you would play with a bird ?
will fishermen try to buy him from you ?
can you throw spears into his skin or head ?
“ if you ever lay a hand on leviathan , you will never do it again !
do you think you can defeat him ?
no one is brave enough to wake him up
i owe nothing to anyone .
“ i will tell you about leviathan ’ s legs ,
no one can pierce his skin .
no one can force him to open his jaws .
his back has rows of shields
they are so close to each other
the shields are joined to each other .
when leviathan sneezes , it is like lightning flashing out .
burning torches come from his mouth .
smoke pours from his nose
his breath sets coals on fire ,
his neck is very powerful .
there is no soft spot in his skin .
his heart is like a rock ; he has no fear .
when he gets up , even the strongest people are afraid .
swords , spears , and darts only bounce off when they hit him .
he breaks iron as easily as straw .
arrows don ’ t make him run away .
when a wood club hits him , it feels to him like a piece of straw .
the skin on his belly is like sharp pieces of broken pottery .
he stirs up the water like a boiling pot .
when he swims , he leaves a sparkling path behind him .
no animal on earth is like him .
he looks down on the proudest of creatures .
then job answered the lord :
“ i know you can do everything .
you asked , ‘ who is this ignorant person saying these foolish things ? ’
“ you said to me , ‘ listen , and i will speak .
in the past i heard about you ,
and i am ashamed of myself .
so eliphaz from teman , bildad from shuah , and zophar from naamah obeyed the lord . then the lord answered job ’ s prayer .
job prayed for his friends , and the lord made job successful again . the lord gave him twice as much as he had before .
the lord blessed job with even more than he had in the beginning . job got 14,000 sheep , 6000 camels , 2000 oxen , and 1000 female donkeys .
he also got seven sons and three daughters .
he named the first daughter jemimah and the second daughter keziah . he named the third daughter keren happuch .
so job lived for 140 years more . he lived to see his children , his grandchildren , his great-grandchildren , and his great-great-grandchildren .
job lived to be a very old man who had lived a good , long life .
joel son of pethuel received this message from the lord :
leaders , listen to this message !
you will tell these things to your children ,
what the cutting locust has left ,
drunks , wake up and cry !
a powerful nation came to attack my land .
it destroyed my grapevine .
cry like a young woman crying
priests , servants of the lord , cry
the fields are ruined .
be sad , farmers !
the vines have become dry ,
priests , put on sackcloth and cry loudly .
be sad because the lord ’ s special day is near . at that time punishment will come like an attack from god all-powerful .
our food is gone . joy and happiness are gone from the temple of our god .
the animals are hungry and groaning . the herds of cattle wander around confused because they have no grass to eat . the sheep are dying .
lord , i am calling to you for help . fire has changed our green fields into a desert . flames have burned all the trees in the field .
wild animals also need your help . the streams are dry—there is no water ! fire has changed our green fields into a desert .
blow the trumpet on zion .
it will be a dark , gloomy day .
the army will destroy the land like a burning fire .
they look like horses .
before this army , people shake with fear .
the soldiers run fast .
they don ’ t trip each other .
they run to the city .
before them , earth and sky shake .
the lord calls loudly to his army .
this is the lord ’ s message :
who knows , maybe he will change his mind
blow the trumpet at zion .
bring the people together .
let the priests , the lord ’ s servants ,
then the lord cared very much about his land .
the lord spoke to his people .
no , i will force the people from the north to leave your land
land , don ’ t be afraid .
animals of the field , don ’ t be afraid .
so be happy , people of zion .
the threshing floors will be filled with wheat ,
“ i , the lord , sent my army against you .
then you will have plenty to eat .
you will know that i am with israel .
in those days i will pour out my spirit
i will work wonders in the sky and on the earth .
the sun will be changed into darkness ,
and everyone who trusts in the lord will be saved .
“ yes , at that time i will bring back the people of judah and jerusalem from captivity .
they threw lots for my people . they sold boys to buy a prostitute , and they sold girls to buy wine to drink .
you took my silver and gold . you took my precious treasures and put them in your temples .
“ you sold the people of judah and jerusalem to the greeks . that way you could take them far from their land .
you sent my people to that faraway place , but i will bring them back . and i will punish you for what you did .
i will sell your sons and daughters to the people of judah . then they will sell them to the faraway sabeans. ” this is what the lord said .
announce this among the nations :
beat your plows into swords .
all you nations , hurry !
wake up , nations !
there are many , many people in the valley of decision .
the sun and the moon will become dark .
the lord god will shout from zion .
“ then you will know that i am the lord your god .
“ on that day the mountains will drip with sweet wine .
egypt will be empty .
but there will always be people living in judah .
those people killed my people ,
before the world began , the word was there . the word was with god , and the word was god .
he was there with god in the beginning .
everything was made through him , and nothing was made without him .
in him there was life , and that life was a light for the people of the world .
the light shines in the darkness , and the darkness has not defeated it .
there was a man named john , who was sent by god .
he came to tell people about the light . through him all people could hear about the light and believe .
john was not the light . but he came to tell people about the light .
the true light was coming into the world . this is the true light that gives light to all people .
the word was already in the world . the world was made through him , but the world did not know him .
he came to the world that was his own . and his own people did not accept him .
but some people did accept him . they believed in him , and he gave them the right to become children of god .
yes , the word was full of grace and truth , and from him we all received one blessing after another .
that is , the law was given to us through moses , but grace and truth came through jesus christ .
the jewish leaders in jerusalem sent some priests and levites to john to ask him , “ who are you ? ” he told them the truth .
without any hesitation he said openly and plainly , “ i am not the messiah . ”
they asked him , “ then who are you ? are you elijah ? ”
john told them the words of the prophet isaiah :
these jews were sent from the pharisees .
john answered , “ i baptize people with water . but there is someone here with you that you don ’ t know .
he is the one who is coming later . i am not good enough to be the slave who unties the strings on his sandals . ”
these things all happened at bethany on the other side of the jordan river . this is where john was baptizing people .
the next day john saw jesus coming toward him and said , “ look , the lamb of god . he takes away the sins of the world !
i did not know who he was . but i came baptizing people with water so that israel could know that he is the messiah . ”
the next day john was there again and had two of his followers with him .
he saw jesus walking by and said , “ look , the lamb of god ! ”
the two followers heard him say this , so they followed jesus .
jesus turned and saw the two men following him . he asked , “ what do you want ? ”
these men followed jesus after they had heard about him from john . one of them was andrew , the brother of simon peter .
the next day jesus decided to go to galilee . he met philip and said to him , “ follow me . ”
philip was from the town of bethsaida , the same as andrew and peter .
but nathanael said to philip , “ nazareth ! can anything good come from nazareth ? ”
jesus saw nathanael coming toward him and said , “ this man coming is a true israelite , one you can trust . ”
nathanael asked , “ how do you know me ? ”
then nathanael said , “ teacher , you are the son of god . you are the king of israel . ”
two days later there was a wedding in the town of cana in galilee , and jesus ’ mother was there .
jesus and his followers were also invited .
at the wedding there was not enough wine , so jesus ’ mother said to him , “ they have no more wine . ”
jesus answered , “ dear woman , why are you telling me this ? it is not yet time for me to begin my work . ”
his mother said to the servants , “ do what he tells you . ”
there were six large stone waterpots there that were used by the jews in their washing ceremonies . each one held about 20 or 30 gallons .
jesus said to the servants , “ fill the waterpots with water. ” so they filled them to the top .
then he said to them , “ now dip out some water and take it to the man in charge of the feast . ”
then jesus went to the town of capernaum . his mother and brothers and his followers went with him . they all stayed there a few days .
it was almost time for the jewish passover , so jesus went to jerusalem .
when this happened , his followers remembered what was written in the scriptures :
some jews said to jesus , “ show us a miracle as a sign from god . prove that you have the right to do these things . ”
jesus answered , “ destroy this temple and i will build it again in three days . ”
they answered , “ people worked 46 years to build this temple ! do you really believe you can build it again in three days ? ”
but the temple jesus meant was his own body .
after he was raised from death , his followers remembered that he had said this . so they believed the scriptures , and they believed the words jesus said .
jesus was in jerusalem for the passover festival . many people believed in him because they saw the miraculous signs he did .
but jesus did not trust them , because he knew how all people think .
he did not need anyone to tell him what a person was like . he already knew .
there was a man named nicodemus , one of the pharisees . he was an important jewish leader .
jesus answered , “ i assure you , everyone must be born again . anyone who is not born again can not be in god ’ s kingdom . ”
the only life people get from their human parents is physical . but the new life that the spirit gives a person is spiritual .
don ’ t be surprised that i told you , ‘ you must be born again . ’
nicodemus asked , “ how is all this possible ? ”
jesus said , “ you are an important teacher of israel , and you still don ’ t understand these things ?
the only one who has ever gone up to heaven is the one who came down from heaven—the son of man .
“ moses lifted up the snake in the desert . it is the same with the son of man . he must be lifted up too .
then everyone who believes in him can have eternal life . ”
god sent his son into the world . he did not send him to judge the world guilty , but to save the world through him .
everyone who does evil hates the light . they will not come to the light , because the light will show all the bad things they have done .
but anyone who follows the true way comes to the light . then the light will show that whatever they have done was done through god .
after this , jesus and his followers went into the area of judea . there he stayed with his followers and baptized people .
john was also baptizing people in aenon , a place near salim with plenty of water . people were going there to be baptized .
this was before john was put in prison .
some of john ’ s followers had an argument with another jew about religious washing .
john answered , “ a person can receive only what god gives .
you yourselves heard me say , ‘ i am not the messiah . i am only the one god sent to prepare the way for him . ’
he must become more and more important , and i must become less important .
he tells what he has seen and heard , but people don ’ t accept what he says .
whoever accepts what he says has given proof that god speaks the truth .
god sent him , and he tells people what god says . god gives him the spirit fully .
the father loves the son and has given him power over everything .
jesus learned that the pharisees had heard the report that he was making and baptizing more followers than john .
( but really , jesus himself did not baptize anyone ; his followers baptized people for him . )
so he left judea and went back to galilee .
on the way to galilee , he had to go through the country of samaria .
in samaria jesus came to the town called sychar , which is near the field that jacob gave to his son joseph .
jacob ’ s well was there . jesus was tired from his long trip , so he sat down beside the well . it was about noon .
a samaritan woman came to the well to get some water , and jesus said to her , “ please give me a drink . ”
this happened while his followers were in town buying some food .
the woman said , “ sir , where will you get that living water ? the well is very deep , and you have nothing to get water with .
jesus answered , “ everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again .
jesus told her , “ go get your husband and come back . ”
the woman answered , “ but i have no husband . ”
that ’ s because , although you have had five husbands , the man you live with now is not your husband . that much was the truth . ”
the woman said , “ sir , i can see that you are a prophet .
our fathers worshiped on this mountain . but you jews say that jerusalem is the place where people must worship . ”
you samaritans worship something you don ’ t understand . we jews understand what we worship , since salvation comes from the jews .
god is spirit . so the people who worship him must worship in spirit and truth . ”
then jesus said , “ he is talking to you now—i am the messiah . ”
then the woman left her water jar and went back to town . she told the people there ,
“ a man told me everything i have ever done . come see him . maybe he is the messiah . ”
so the people left the town and went to see jesus .
while the woman was in town , jesus ’ followers were begging him , “ teacher , eat something ! ”
but jesus answered , “ i have food to eat that you know nothing about . ”
so the followers asked themselves , “ did someone already bring him some food ? ”
it is true when we say , ‘ one person plants , but another person harvests the crop . ’
i sent you to harvest a crop that you did not work for . others did the work , and you get the profit from their work . ”
the samaritans went to jesus . they begged him to stay with them . so he stayed there two days .
many more people became believers because of the things he said .
two days later jesus left and went to galilee .
( jesus had said before that a prophet is not respected in his own country . )
when he arrived in galilee , the people there welcomed him . they had been at the passover festival in jerusalem and had seen everything he did there .
jesus said to him , “ you people must see miraculous signs and wonders before you will believe in me . ”
the king ’ s official said , “ sir , come before my little son dies . ”
jesus answered , “ go . your son will live . ”
on the way home , the man ’ s servants came and met him . they said , “ your son is well . ”
the man asked , “ what time did my son begin to get well ? ”
that was the second miraculous sign that jesus did after coming from judea to galilee .
later , jesus went to jerusalem for a special jewish festival .
in jerusalem there is a pool with five covered porches . in aramaic it is called bethzatha . this pool is near the sheep gate .
many sick people were lying on the porches beside the pool . some of them were blind , some were crippled , and some were paralyzed .
one of the men lying there had been sick for 38 years .
then jesus said , “ stand up ! pick up your mat and walk . ”
immediately the man was well . he picked up his mat and started walking .
but he answered , “ the man who made me well told me , ‘ pick up your mat and walk . ’ ”
they asked him , “ who is the man who told you to pick up your mat and walk ? ”
but the man who had been healed did not know who it was . there were many people there , and jesus had left .
then the man left and went back to the jews who questioned him . he told them that jesus was the one who made him well .
jesus was doing all this on the sabbath day . so these jews began trying to make him stop .
but he said to them , “ my father never stops working , and so i work too . ”
the father raises the dead and gives them life . in the same way , the son gives life to those he wants to .
“ also , the father judges no one . he has given the son power to do all the judging .
life comes from the father himself . so the father has also allowed the son to give life .
and the father has given him the power to judge all people because he is the son of man .
“ don ’ t be surprised at this . a time is coming when all people who are dead and in their graves will hear his voice .
“ if i tell people about myself , they can not be sure that what i say is true .
but there is someone else who tells people about me , and i know that what he says about me is true .
“ you sent men to john , and he told you what is true .
i don ’ t need anyone to tell people about me , but i remind you of what john said so that you can be saved .
john was like a lamp that burned and gave light , and you were happy to enjoy his light for a while .
and the father who sent me has given proof about me himself . but you have never heard his voice . you have never seen what he looks like .
the father ’ s teaching does not live in you , because you don ’ t believe in the one the father sent .
you carefully study the scriptures . you think that they give you eternal life . these same scriptures tell about me !
but you refuse to come to me to have that life .
“ i don ’ t want praise from you or any other human .
but i know you—i know that you have no love for god .
you like to have praise from each other . but you never try to get the praise that comes from the only god . so how can you believe ?
if you really believed moses , you would believe me , because he wrote about me .
but you don ’ t believe what he wrote , so you can ’ t believe what i say . ”
later , jesus went across lake galilee ( also known as lake tiberias ) .
a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the miraculous signs he did in healing the sick .
jesus went up on the side of the hill and sat there with his followers .
it was almost the time for the jewish passover festival .
he asked philip this question to test him . jesus already knew what he planned to do .
philip answered , “ we would all have to work a month to buy enough bread for each person here to have only a little piece ! ”
another follower there was andrew , the brother of simon peter . andrew said ,
“ here is a boy with five loaves of barley bread and two little fish . but that is not enough for so many people . ”
jesus said , “ tell everyone to sit down. ” this was a place with a lot of grass , and about 5000 men sat down there .
the people saw this miraculous sign that jesus did and said , “ he must be the prophet who is coming into the world . ”
jesus knew that the people planned to come get him and make him their king . so he left and went into the hills alone .
that evening jesus ’ followers went down to the lake .
it was dark now , and jesus had not yet come back to them . they got into a boat and started going across the lake to capernaum .
the wind was blowing very hard . the waves on the lake were becoming bigger .
but he said to them , “ don ’ t be afraid . it ’ s me . ”
when he said this , they were glad to take him into the boat . and then the boat reached the shore at the place they wanted to go .
the people saw that jesus and his followers were not there now . so they got into the boats and went to capernaum to find jesus .
the people found jesus on the other side of the lake . they asked him , “ teacher , when did you come here ? ”
the people asked jesus , “ what does god want us to do ? ”
jesus answered , “ the work god wants you to do is this : to believe in the one he sent . ”
our ancestors were given manna to eat in the desert . as the scriptures say , ‘ he gave them bread from heaven to eat . ’ ”
god ’ s bread is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world . ”
the people said , “ sir , from now on give us bread like that . ”
i told you before that you have seen me , and still you don ’ t believe .
the father gives me my people . every one of them will come to me . i will always accept them .
i came down from heaven to do what god wants , not what i want .
some jews began to complain about jesus because he said , “ i am the bread that comes down from heaven . ”
but jesus said , “ stop complaining to each other .
“ i can assure you that anyone who believes has eternal life .
i am the bread that gives life .
your ancestors ate the manna god gave them in the desert , but it didn ’ t keep them from dying .
here is the bread that comes down from heaven . whoever eats this bread will never die .
then the jews began to argue among themselves . they said , “ how can this man give us his body to eat ? ”
those who eat my body and drink my blood have eternal life . i will raise them up on the last day .
my body is true food , and my blood is true drink .
those who eat my body and drink my blood live in me , and i live in them .
“ the father sent me . he lives , and i live because of him . so everyone who eats me will live because of me .
jesus said all this while he was teaching in the synagogue in the city of capernaum .
when jesus ’ followers heard this , many of them said , “ this teaching is hard . who can accept it ? ”
jesus already knew that his followers were complaining about this . so he said , “ is this teaching a problem for you ?
then what will you think when you see the son of man going up to where he came from ?
jesus said , “ that is why i said , ‘ anyone the father does not help to come to me can not come . ’ ”
after jesus said these things , many of his followers left and stopped following him .
jesus asked the twelve apostles , “ do you want to leave too ? ”
simon peter answered him , “ lord , where would we go ? you have the words that give eternal life .
we believe in you . we know that you are the holy one from god . ”
then jesus answered , “ i chose all twelve of you . but one of you is a devil . ”
after this , jesus traveled around the country of galilee . he did not want to travel in judea , because the jewish leaders there wanted to kill him .
it was time for the jewish festival of shelters .
jesus ’ brothers said this because even they did not believe in him .
jesus said to them , “ the right time for me has not yet come , but any time is right for you to go .
the world can not hate you . but the world hates me , because i tell the people in the world that they do evil things .
so you go to the festival . i will not go now , because the right time for me has not yet come . ”
after jesus said this , he stayed in galilee .
so his brothers left to go to the festival . after they left , jesus went too , but he did not let people see him .
at the festival the jewish leaders were looking for him . they said , “ where is that man ? ”
but no one was brave enough to talk about him openly . they were afraid of the jewish leaders .
when the festival was about half finished , jesus went to the temple area and began to teach .
the jewish leaders were amazed and said , “ how did this man learn so much ? he never had the kind of teaching we had ! ”
jesus answered , “ what i teach is not my own . my teaching comes from the one who sent me .
people who really want to do what god wants will know that my teaching comes from god . they will know that this teaching is not my own .
the people answered , “ a demon is making you crazy ! we are not trying to kill you . ”
jesus said to them , “ i did one miracle on a sabbath day , and you were all surprised .
stop judging by the way things look . be fair and judge by what is really right . ”
then some of the people who lived in jerusalem said , “ this is the man they are trying to kill .
but when the real messiah comes , no one will know where he comes from . and we know where this man ’ s home is . ”
i know him because i am from him . he is the one who sent me . ”
the pharisees heard what the people were saying about jesus . so the leading priests and the pharisees sent some temple police to arrest him .
then jesus said , “ i will be with you a little while longer . then i will go back to the one who sent me .
you will look for me , but you will not find me . and you can not come where i am . ”
if anyone believes in me , rivers of living water will flow out from their heart . that is what the scriptures say . ”
when the people heard the things that jesus said , some of them said , “ this man really is the prophet . ”
other people said , “ he is the messiah . ”
so the people did not agree with each other about jesus .
some of the people wanted to arrest him . but no one tried to do it .
the temple police went back to the leading priests and the pharisees . the priests and the pharisees asked , “ why didn ’ t you bring jesus ? ”
the temple police answered , “ we have never heard anyone say such amazing things ! ”
the pharisees answered , “ so he has fooled you too !
you don ’ t see any of the leaders or any of us pharisees believing in him , do you ?
but those people out there know nothing about the law . they are under god ’ s curse ! ”
but nicodemus was there in that group . he was the one who had gone to see jesus before . he said ,
“ our law will not let us judge anyone without first hearing them and finding out what they have done . ”
the jewish leaders answered , “ you must be from galilee too ! study the scriptures . you will find nothing about a prophet coming from galilee . ”
then they all left and went home .
jesus went to the mount of olives .
early in the morning he went back to the temple area . the people all came to him , and he sat and taught them .
they said to jesus , “ teacher , this woman was caught in the act of adultery .
the law of moses commands us to stone to death any such woman . what do you say we should do ? ”
then jesus stooped down again and wrote on the ground .
he looked up again and said to her , “ where did they all go ? did no one judge you guilty ? ”
she answered , “ no one , sir . ”
you judge me the way people judge other people . i don ’ t judge anyone .
but if i judge , my judging is true , because when i judge i am not alone . the father who sent me is with me .
your own law says that when two witnesses say the same thing , you must accept what they say .
i am one of the witnesses who speaks about myself . and the father who sent me is my other witness . ”
the people asked , “ where is your father ? ”
they asked , “ then who are you ? ”
they did not understand who he was talking about . he was telling them about the father .
the one who sent me is with me . i always do what pleases him . so he has not left me alone . ”
while he was saying these things , many people believed in him .
so jesus said to the jews who believed in him , “ if you continue to accept and obey my teaching , you are really my followers .
you will know the truth , and the truth will make you free . ”
they answered , “ we are abraham ’ s descendants . and we have never been slaves . so why do you say that we will be free ? ”
jesus said , “ the truth is , everyone who sins is a slave—a slave to sin .
a slave does not stay with a family forever . but a son belongs to the family forever .
so if the son makes you free , you are really free .
i know you are abraham ’ s descendants . but you want to kill me , because you don ’ t want to accept my teaching .
i am telling you what my father has shown me . but you do what your father has told you . ”
they said , “ our father is abraham . ”
i am someone who has told you the truth i heard from god . but you are trying to kill me . abraham did nothing like that .
so you are doing what your own father did . ”
you don ’ t understand the things i say , because you can not accept my teaching .
“ i am telling you the truth , and that ’ s why you don ’ t believe me .
can any of you prove that i am guilty of sin ? if i tell the truth , why don ’ t you believe me ?
whoever belongs to god accepts what he says . but you don ’ t accept what god says , because you don ’ t belong to god . ”
jesus answered , “ i have no demon in me . i give honor to my father , but you give no honor to me .
i am not trying to get honor for myself . there is one who wants this honor for me . he is the judge .
i promise you , whoever continues to obey my teaching will never die . ”
do you think you are greater than our father abraham ? he died , and so did the prophets . who do you think you are ? ”
your father abraham was very happy that he would see the day when i came . he saw that day and was happy . ”
the jews said to jesus , “ what ? how can you say you have seen abraham ? you are not even 50 years old ! ”
jesus answered , “ the fact is , before abraham was born , i am . ”
when he said this , they picked up stones to throw at him . but jesus hid , and then he left the temple area .
while jesus was walking , he saw a man who had been blind since the time he was born .
while i am in the world , i am the light of the world . ”
after jesus said this , he spit on the dirt , made some mud and put it on the man ’ s eyes .
his neighbors and some others who had seen him begging said , “ look ! is this the same man who always sits and begs ? ”
they asked , “ what happened ? how did you get your sight ? ”
they asked him , “ where is this man ? ”
then the people brought the man to the pharisees .
the day jesus had made mud and healed the man ’ s eyes was a sabbath day .
so the pharisees asked the man , “ how did you get your sight ? ”
some of the pharisees said , “ that man does not obey the law about the sabbath day . so he is not from god . ”
they asked the man again , “ since it was your eyes he healed , what do you say about him ? ”
the jewish leaders still did not believe that this really happened to the man—that he was blind and was now healed . but later they sent for his parents .
they asked them , “ is this your son ? you say he was born blind . so how can he see ? ”
his parents answered , “ we know that this man is our son . and we know that he was born blind .
that is why his parents said , “ he is old enough . ask him . ”
they asked , “ what did he do to you ? how did he heal your eyes ? ”
at this they shouted insults at him and said , “ you are his follower , not us ! we are followers of moses .
we know that god spoke to moses . but we don ’ t even know where this man comes from ! ”
the man answered , “ this is really strange ! you don ’ t know where he comes from , but he healed my eyes .
we all know that god does not listen to sinners , but he will listen to anyone who worships and obeys him .
this is the first time we have ever heard of anyone healing the eyes of someone born blind .
this man must be from god . if he were not from god , he could not do anything like this . ”
when jesus heard that they had forced the man to leave , he found him and asked him , “ do you believe in the son of man ? ”
the man said , “ tell me who he is , sir , so i can believe in him . ”
jesus said to him , “ you have already seen him . the son of man is the one talking with you now . ”
the man answered , “ yes , i believe , lord ! ” then he bowed and worshiped jesus .
some of the pharisees were near jesus . they heard him say this . they asked , “ what ? are you saying that we are blind too ? ”
but the man who takes care of the sheep enters through the gate . he is the shepherd .
he brings all of his sheep out . then he goes ahead of them and leads them . the sheep follow him , because they know his voice .
but sheep will never follow someone they don ’ t know . they will run away from him , because they don ’ t know his voice . ”
jesus told the people this story , but they did not understand what it meant .
so jesus said again , “ i assure you , i am the gate for the sheep .
all those who came before me were thieves and robbers . the sheep did not listen to them .
a thief comes to steal , kill , and destroy . but i came to give life—life that is full and good .
“ i am the good shepherd , and the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep .
the man runs away because he is only a paid worker . he does not really care for the sheep .
the father loves me because i give my life . i give my life so that i can get it back again .
again the jews were divided over what jesus was saying .
many of them said , “ a demon has come into him and made him crazy . why listen to him ? ”
it was winter , and the time came for the festival of dedication at jerusalem .
jesus was in the temple area at solomon ’ s porch .
but you do not believe , because you are not my sheep .
my sheep listen to my voice . i know them , and they follow me .
i give my sheep eternal life . they will never die , and no one can take them out of my hand .
my father is the one who gave them to me , and he is greater than all . no one can steal my sheep out of his hand .
the father and i are one . ”
again the jews there picked up stones to kill jesus .
jesus answered , “ it is written in your law that god said , ‘ i said you are gods . ’
this scripture called those people gods—the people who received god ’ s message . and scripture is always true .
if i don ’ t do what my father does , then don ’ t believe what i say .
they tried to get jesus again , but he escaped from them .
then he went back across the jordan river to the place where john began his work of baptizing people . jesus stayed there ,
and many people came to him . they said , “ john never did any miraculous signs , but everything john said about this man is true . ”
and many people there believed in jesus .
there was a man named lazarus who was sick . he lived in the town of bethany , where mary and her sister martha lived .
so mary and martha sent someone to tell jesus , “ lord , your dear friend lazarus is sick . ”
jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus .
so when he heard that lazarus was sick , he stayed where he was two more days
and then said to his followers , “ we should go back to judea . ”
but whoever walks at night will stumble because there is no light . ”
then jesus said , “ our friend lazarus is now sleeping , but i am going there to wake him . ”
the followers answered , “ but , lord , if he can sleep , he will get well . ”
they thought jesus meant that lazarus was literally sleeping , but he really meant that lazarus was dead .
so then jesus said plainly , “ lazarus is dead .
and i am glad i was not there . i am happy for you because now you will believe in me . we will go to him now . ”
then thomas , the one called “ twin , ” said to the other followers , “ we will go too . we will die there with jesus . ”
jesus arrived in bethany and found that lazarus had already been dead and in the tomb for four days .
bethany was about two miles from jerusalem .
many jews had come to see martha and mary . they came to comfort them about their brother lazarus .
when martha heard that jesus was coming , she went out to greet him . but mary stayed home .
martha said to jesus , “ lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died .
but i know that even now god will give you anything you ask . ”
jesus said , “ your brother will rise and be alive again . ”
martha answered , “ i know that he will rise to live again at the time of the resurrection on the last day . ”
jesus said to her , “ i am the resurrection . i am life . everyone who believes in me will have life , even if they die .
and everyone who lives and believes in me will never really die . martha , do you believe this ? ”
when mary heard this , she stood up and went quickly to jesus .
he had not yet come into the village . he was still at the place where martha met him .
when jesus saw mary crying and the people with her crying too , he was very upset and deeply troubled .
he asked , “ where did you put him ? ”
and the jews said , “ look ! he loved lazarus very much ! ”
but some of them said , “ jesus healed the eyes of the blind man . why didn ’ t he help lazarus and stop him from dying ? ”
again feeling very upset , jesus came to the tomb . it was a cave with a large stone covering the entrance .
he said , “ move the stone away . ”
then jesus said to her , “ remember what i told you ? i said that if you believed , you would see god ’ s divine greatness . ”
so they moved the stone away from the entrance . then jesus looked up and said , “ father , i thank you that you heard me .
after jesus said this he called in a loud voice , “ lazarus , come out ! ”
the dead man came out . his hands and feet were wrapped with pieces of cloth . he had a handkerchief covering his face .
there were many jews who came to visit mary . when they saw what jesus did , many of them believed in him .
but some of them went to the pharisees and told them what jesus did .
if we let him continue doing these things , everyone will believe in him . then the romans will come and take away our temple and our nation . ”
one of the men there was caiaphas . he was the high priest that year . he said , “ you people know nothing !
it is better for one man to die for the people than for the whole nation to be destroyed . but you don ’ t realize this . ”
caiaphas did not think of this himself . as that year ’ s high priest , he was really prophesying that jesus would die for the jewish people .
that day the jewish leaders began planning to kill jesus .
six days before the passover festival , jesus went to bethany . that is where lazarus lived , the man jesus raised from death .
there they had a dinner for jesus . martha served the food , and lazarus was one of the people eating with jesus .
judas iscariot , one of jesus ’ followers , was there—the one who would later hand jesus over to his enemies . judas said ,
jesus answered , “ don ’ t stop her . it was right for her to save this perfume for today—the day for me to be prepared for burial .
you will always have those who are poor with you . but you will not always have me . ”
so the leading priests made plans to kill lazarus too .
because of him , many jews were leaving them and believing in jesus . that is why they wanted to kill lazarus too .
the next day the people in jerusalem heard that jesus was coming there . these were the crowds of people who had come to the passover festival .
they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet jesus . they shouted ,
jesus found a donkey and rode on it , as the scriptures say ,
“ do not be afraid , people of zion !
that ’ s why so many people went out to meet him—because they had heard about this miraculous sign he did .
so the pharisees said to each other , “ look ! our plan is not working . the people are all following him ! ”
there were some greeks there too . these were some of the people who went to jerusalem to worship at the passover festival .
they went to philip , who was from bethsaida in galilee . they said , “ sir , we want to meet jesus . ”
philip went and told andrew . then andrew and philip went and told jesus .
jesus said to them , “ the time has come for the son of man to receive his glory .
whoever serves me must follow me . my servants must be with me everywhere i am . my father will give honor to anyone who serves me .
father , do what will bring you glory ! ”
the people standing there heard the voice . they said it was thunder .
jesus said , “ that voice was for you and not for me .
now is the time for the world to be judged . now the ruler of this world will be thrown out .
i will be lifted up from the earth . when that happens , i will draw all people to myself . ”
jesus said this to show how he would die .
the people saw all these miraculous signs jesus did , but they still did not believe in him .
this was to give full meaning to what isaiah the prophet said :
this is why the people could not believe . because isaiah also said ,
“ god made the people blind .
isaiah said this because he saw jesus ’ divine greatness . so he spoke about him .
they loved praise from people more than praise from god .
then jesus said loudly , “ everyone who believes in me is really believing in the one who sent me .
everyone who sees me is really seeing the one who sent me .
i came into this world as a light . i came so that everyone who believes in me will not stay in darkness .
that is because what i taught was not from myself . the father who sent me told me what to say and what to teach .
and i know that whatever he says to do will bring eternal life . so the things i say are exactly what the father told me to say . ”
so while they were eating , jesus stood up and took off his robe . he got a towel and wrapped it around his waist .
then he poured water into a bowl and began to wash the followers ’ feet . he dried their feet with the towel that was wrapped around his waist .
he came to simon peter . but peter said to him , “ lord , you should not wash my feet . ”
jesus answered , “ you don ’ t know what i am doing now . but later you will understand . ”
peter said , “ no ! you will never wash my feet . ”
simon peter said , “ lord , after you wash my feet , wash my hands and my head too ! ”
jesus knew who would hand him over to his enemies . that is why he said , “ not all of you are clean . ”
you call me ‘ teacher. ’ and you call me ‘ lord. ’ and this is right , because that is what i am .
i am your lord and teacher . but i washed your feet . so you also should wash each other ’ s feet .
i did this as an example for you . so you should serve each other just as i served you .
believe me , servants are not greater than their master . those who are sent to do something are not greater than the one who sent them .
if you know these things , great blessings will be yours if you do them .
i am telling you this now before it happens . then when it happens , you will believe that i am .
i assure you , whoever accepts the person i send also accepts me . and whoever accepts me also accepts the one who sent me . ”
his followers all looked at each other . they did not understand who jesus was talking about .
one of the followers was next to jesus and was leaning close to him . this was the one jesus loved very much .
simon peter made signs to this follower to ask jesus who he was talking about .
that follower leaned closer to jesus and asked , “ lord , who is it ? ”
when judas took the bread , satan entered him . jesus said to judas , “ what you will do—do it quickly ! ”
no one at the table understood why jesus said this to judas .
judas ate the bread jesus gave him . then he immediately went out . it was night .
if god receives glory through him , he will give glory to the son through himself . and that will happen very soon . ”
“ i give you a new command : love each other . you must love each other just as i loved you .
all people will know that you are my followers if you love each other . ”
simon peter asked jesus , “ lord , where are you going ? ”
peter asked , “ lord , why can ’ t i follow you now ? i am ready to die for you ! ”
jesus said , “ don ’ t be troubled . trust in god , and trust in me .
you know the way to the place where i am going . ”
thomas said , “ lord , we don ’ t know where you are going , so how can we know the way ? ”
jesus answered , “ i am the way , the truth , and the life . the only way to the father is through me .
if you really knew me , you would know my father too . but now you know the father . you have seen him . ”
philip said to him , “ lord , show us the father . that is all we need . ”
believe me when i say that i am in the father and the father is in me . or believe because of the miracles i have done .
and if you ask for anything in my name , i will do it for you . then the father ’ s glory will be shown through the son .
if you ask me for anything in my name , i will do it .
“ if you love me , you will do what i command .
i will ask the father , and he will give you another helper to be with you forever .
“ i will not leave you all alone like orphans . i will come back to you .
in a very short time the people in the world will not see me anymore . but you will see me . you will live because i live .
on that day you will know that i am in the father . you will know that you are in me and i am in you .
then judas ( not judas iscariot ) said , “ lord , how will you make yourself known to us , but not to the world ? ”
“ i have told you all these things while i am with you .
i have told you this now , before it happens . then when it happens , you will believe .
“ i will not talk with you much longer . the ruler of this world is coming . he has no power over me .
but the world must know that i love the father . so i do exactly what the father told me to do .
jesus said , “ i am the true vine , and my father is the gardener .
he cuts off every branch of mine that does not produce fruit . he also trims every branch that produces fruit to prepare it to produce even more .
you have already been prepared to produce more fruit by the teaching i have given you .
show that you are my followers by producing much fruit . this will bring honor to my father .
“ i have loved you as the father has loved me . now continue in my love .
i have told you these things so that you can have the true happiness that i have . i want you to be completely happy .
this is what i command you : love each other as i have loved you .
the greatest love people can show is to die for their friends .
you are my friends if you do what i tell you to do .
this is my command : love each other .
“ if the world hates you , remember that they hated me first .
they will do to you whatever they did to me , because you belong to me . they don ’ t know the one who sent me .
“ whoever hates me also hates my father .
but this happened to make clear the full meaning of what is written in their law : ‘ they hated me for no reason . ’
and you will tell people about me too , because you have been with me from the beginning .
“ i have told you all this so that you won ’ t lose your faith when you face troubles .
they will do this because they have not known the father , and they have not known me .
i have told you all this now to prepare you . so when the time comes for these things to happen , you will remember that i warned you .
now i am going back to the one who sent me . and none of you asks me , ‘ where are you going ? ’
but you are filled with sadness because i have told you all this .
he will prove that they are guilty of sin , because they don ’ t believe in me .
and he will show them how wrong their judgment is , because their leader has already been condemned .
“ i have so much more to tell you , but it is too much for you to accept now .
the spirit of truth will bring glory to me by telling you what he receives from me .
all that the father has is mine . that is why i said that the spirit will tell you what he receives from me .
“ after a short time you won ’ t see me . then after another short time you will see me again . ”
they also asked , “ what does he mean by ‘ a short time ’ ? we don ’ t understand what he is saying . ”
the father himself loves you because you have loved me . and he loves you because you have believed that i came from god .
i came from the father into the world . now i am leaving the world and going back to the father . ”
then his followers said , “ you are already speaking plainly to us . you are not using words that hide the meaning .
jesus said , “ so now you believe ?
you gave the son power over all people so that he could give eternal life to all those you have given to him .
and this is eternal life : that people can know you , the only true god , and that they can know jesus christ , the one you sent .
i finished the work you gave me to do . i brought you glory on earth .
and now , father , give me glory with you . give me the glory i had with you before the world was made .
now they know that everything i have came from you .
i told them the words you gave me , and they accepted them . they realized the fact that i came from you and believed that you sent me .
all i have is yours , and all you have is mine . and my glory is seen in them .
“ i am not asking you to take them out of the world . but i am asking that you keep them safe from the evil one .
they don ’ t belong to the world , just as i don ’ t belong to the world .
make them ready for your service through your truth . your teaching is truth .
i have sent them into the world , just as you sent me into the world .
i am making myself completely ready to serve you . i do this for them , so that they also might be fully qualified for your service .
“ i pray not only for these followers but also for those who will believe in me because of their teaching .
when jesus finished praying , he left with his followers and went across the kidron valley . he went into a garden there , his followers still with him .
judas , the one responsible for handing jesus over , knew where this place was . he knew because jesus often met there with his followers .
jesus already knew everything that would happen to him . so he went out and asked them , “ who are you looking for ? ”
they answered , “ jesus from nazareth . ”
when jesus said , “ i am jesus , ” the men moved back and fell to the ground .
he asked them again , “ who are you looking for ? ”
jesus said , “ i told you that i am jesus . so if you are looking for me , let these other men go free . ”
this was to show the truth of what jesus said earlier : “ i have not lost anyone you gave me . ”
jesus said to peter , “ put your sword back in its place ! i must drink from the cup the father has given me . ”
then the soldiers with their commander and the jewish guards arrested jesus . they tied him
and brought him to annas , the father-in-law of caiaphas . caiaphas was the high priest that year .
he was also the one who had told the other jewish leaders that it would be better if one man died for all the people .
but peter waited outside near the door . the follower who knew the high priest came back outside and spoke to the gatekeeper . then he brought peter inside .
the girl at the gate said to peter , “ are you also one of the followers of that man ? ”
it was cold , so the servants and guards had built a fire . they were standing around it , warming themselves , and peter was standing with them .
the high priest asked jesus questions about his followers and what he taught them .
so why do you question me ? ask the people who heard my teaching . they know what i said . ”
so annas sent jesus to caiaphas the high priest . he was still tied .
but again peter said , “ no , i was not with him ! ” as soon as he said this , a rooster crowed .
so pilate went outside to them and asked , “ what do you say this man has done wrong ? ”
they answered , “ he is a bad man . that is why we brought him to you . ”
pilate said to them , “ you take him yourselves and judge him by your own law . ”
( this was to show the truth of what jesus said about how he would die . )
then pilate went back inside the palace . he called for jesus and asked him , “ are you the king of the jews ? ”
jesus said , “ is that your own question , or did other people tell you about me ? ”
pilate said , “ so you are a king . ”
they shouted back , “ no , not him ! let barabbas go free ! ” ( barabbas was a rebel . )
then pilate ordered that jesus be taken away and whipped .
the soldiers made a crown from thorny branches and put it on his head . then they put a purple robe around him .
they kept coming up to him and saying , “ hail to the king of the jews ! ” and they hit him in the face .
then jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . pilate said to the jews , “ here is the man ! ”
when the leading priests and the jewish guards saw jesus they shouted , “ kill him on a cross ! kill him on a cross ! ”
the jewish leaders answered , “ we have a law that says he must die , because he said he is the son of god . ”
when pilate heard this , he was more afraid .
so he went back inside the palace and asked jesus , “ where are you from ? ” but jesus did not answer him .
pilate said , “ you refuse to speak to me ? remember , i have the power to make you free or to kill you on a cross . ”
it was now almost noon on preparation day of passover week . pilate said to the jews , “ here is your king ! ”
they shouted , “ take him away ! take him away ! kill him on a cross ! ”
so pilate handed jesus over to them to be killed on a cross .
he carried his own cross to a place called “ the place of the skull. ” ( in aramaic the name of this place is “ golgotha . ” )
pilate told them to write a sign and put it on the cross . the sign said , “ jesus of nazareth , the king of the jews . ”
pilate answered , “ i will not change what i have written . ”
jesus ’ mother stood near his cross . her sister was also standing there with mary the wife of clopas , and mary magdalene .
then he said to the follower , “ here is your mother. ” so after that , this follower took jesus ’ mother to live in his home .
later , jesus knew that everything had been done . to make the scriptures come true he said , “ i am thirsty . ”
when he tasted the wine , he said , “ it is finished. ” then he bowed his head and died .
so the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men on the crosses beside jesus .
but when the soldiers came close to jesus , they saw that he was already dead . so they did not break his legs .
but one of the soldiers stuck his spear into jesus ’ side . immediately blood and water came out .
these things happened to give full meaning to the scriptures that said , “ none of his bones will be broken ”
and “ people will look at the one they stabbed . ”
these two men took jesus ’ body and wrapped it in pieces of linen cloth with the spices . ( this is how the jews bury people . )
the men put jesus in that tomb because it was near , and the jews were preparing to start their sabbath day .
so peter and the other follower started going to the tomb .
they were both running , but the other follower ran faster than peter and reached the tomb first .
he bent down and looked in . he saw the pieces of linen cloth lying there , but he did not go in .
then simon peter finally reached the tomb and went in . he saw the pieces of linen lying there .
he also saw the cloth that had been around jesus ’ head . it was folded up and laid in a different place from the pieces of linen .
then the other follower went in—the one who had reached the tomb first . he saw what had happened and believed .
( these followers did not yet understand from the scriptures that jesus must rise from death . )
then the followers went back home .
but mary stood outside the tomb , crying . while she was crying , she bent down and looked inside the tomb .
the angels asked mary , “ woman , why are you crying ? ”
when mary said this , she turned around and saw jesus standing there . but she did not know that it was jesus .
he asked her , “ woman , why are you crying ? who are you looking for ? ”
jesus said to her , “ mary . ”
mary magdalene went to the followers and told them , “ i saw the lord ! ” and she told them what he had said to her .
as soon as he said this , he showed them his hands and his side . when the followers saw the lord , they were very happy .
then he breathed on them and said , “ receive the holy spirit .
thomas ( called didymus ) was one of the twelve , but he was not with the other followers when jesus came .
thomas said to jesus , “ my lord and my god ! ”
jesus said to him , “ you believe because you see me . great blessings belong to the people who believe without seeing me ! ”
jesus did many other miraculous signs that his followers saw , which are not written in this book .
later , jesus appeared again to his followers by lake galilee . this is how it happened :
simon peter said , “ i am going out to fish . ”
early the next morning jesus stood on the shore . but the followers did not know it was jesus .
then he said to them , “ friends , have you caught any fish ? ”
then jesus said , “ bring some of the fish that you caught . ”
jesus walked over to get the bread and gave it to them . he also gave them the fish .
this was now the third time jesus appeared to his followers after he was raised from death .
again jesus said to him , “ simon , son of john , do you love me ? ”
a third time jesus said , “ simon , son of john , do you love me ? ”
( jesus said this to show how peter would die to give glory to god . ) then he said to peter , “ follow me ! ”
when peter saw him behind them , he asked jesus , “ lord , what about him ? ”
jesus answered , “ maybe i want him to live until i come . that should not matter to you . you follow me ! ”
the lord spoke to jonah son of amittai :
then the men said to each other , “ we should throw lots to find out why this is happening to us . ”
jonah said to them , “ i am a hebrew . i worship the lord , the god of heaven , who made the land and the sea . ”
so the men threw jonah into the sea . the storm stopped , and the sea became calm .
when the men saw this , they began to fear and respect the lord . they offered a sacrifice and made special promises to the lord .
while jonah was in the stomach of the fish , he prayed to the lord his god . he said ,
“ i was in very bad trouble .
“ you threw me into the sea .
then i thought , ‘ now i must go where you can not see me , ’
“ the seawater closed over me .
i was at the bottom of the sea ,
“ my soul gave up all hope ,
“ some people worship useless idols ,
i will give sacrifices to you ,
then the lord spoke to the fish , and it vomited jonah out of its stomach onto the dry land .
then the lord spoke to jonah again and said ,
“ go to that big city nineveh , and say what i tell you . ”
so jonah obeyed the lord and went to nineveh . it was a very large city . a person had to walk for three days to travel through it .
jonah went to the center of the city and began speaking to the people . he said , “ after 40 days , nineveh will be destroyed ! ”
the king wrote a special message and sent it throughout the city :
who knows ? maybe god will stop being angry and change his mind , and we will not be punished .
jonah was not happy that god saved the city . jonah became angry .
so now , lord , just kill me . it is better for me to die than to live . ”
then the lord said , “ do you think it is right for you to be angry ? ”
the next morning , god sent a worm to eat part of the plant . the worm began eating the plant , and the plant died .
but god said to jonah , “ do you think it is right for you to be angry just because this plant died ? ”
moses was the lord ’ s servant , and joshua son of nun was moses ’ helper . after moses died , the lord spoke to joshua and said ,
i promised moses that i would give you this land , so i will give you all the land wherever you go .
so joshua gave orders to the leaders of the people :
then joshua said to the tribes of reuben , gad , and half the tribe of manasseh ,
then the people answered joshua , “ we will do whatever you command us to do . we will go wherever you tell us to go .
then anyone who refuses to obey your commands or turns against you will be killed . just be strong and brave ! ”
but someone told the king of jericho , “ last night some men from israel came to look for weaknesses in our country . ”
rahab had hidden the two men , but she said , “ they did come here , but i didn ’ t know where they came from .
the two men were ready to sleep for the night , but rahab went to the roof to talk to them .
rahab ’ s house was built into the city wall , so she used a rope to let the men down through a window .
we are making this agreement with you . but if you tell anyone about what we are doing , we will be free from this agreement . ”
they said to him , “ the lord really has given us all the land . all the people in that country are afraid of us . ”
early the next morning , joshua and all the israelites got up and left acacia . they traveled to the jordan river and camped there before they crossed it .
after three days the leaders went through the camp .
they gave orders to the people : “ when you see the levite priests carrying the box of the agreement of the lord your god , follow them .
then joshua told the people , “ make yourselves pure . tomorrow the lord will do amazing things among us . ”
then joshua said to the israelites , “ come and listen to the words of the lord your god .
the box of the agreement of the lord of the whole world will go before you as you cross the jordan river .
now choose twelve men , one from each of the twelve tribes of israel .
the priests carried the box of the agreement , and the people left the place they had camped . the people started going across the jordan river .
after all the people had crossed the jordan river , the lord said to joshua ,
“ choose twelve men , one from each tribe .
so joshua chose one man from each tribe . then he called the twelve men together .
these rocks will be a sign for you . in the future , your children will ask you , ‘ what do these rocks mean ? ’
after the people finished crossing the river , the priests carried the lord ’ s holy box to the front of the people .
about 40,000 soldiers , prepared for war , passed before the lord . they were marching toward the plains of jericho .
that day the lord made joshua a great man to all the israelites . from that time on , they respected joshua just as they had moses .
then the lord said to joshua ,
“ command the priests carrying the box that holds the agreement to come out of the river . ”
so joshua commanded the priests , “ come out of the jordan river . ”
the people crossed the jordan river on the tenth day of the first month and camped at gilgal , east of jericho .
they carried with them the twelve rocks that they had taken from the jordan river , and joshua set them up at gilgal .
then joshua told the israelites , “ in the future your children will ask you , ‘ what do these rocks mean ? ’
tell them , ‘ these rocks help us remember the way the people of israel crossed the jordan river on dry land . ’
at that time the lord said to joshua , “ make knives from flint rocks and circumcise the men of israel . ”
so joshua made knives from flint rocks and circumcised the men of israel at gibeath haaraloth .
joshua finished circumcising all the men . the people camped at that place until all the men were healed .
the israelites celebrated passover while they were camped at gilgal on the plains of jericho . this was on the evening of the 14th day of the month .
the day after passover , the people ate food that grew in that land . they ate bread made without yeast and roasted grain .
the commander of the lord ’ s army answered , “ take off your sandals . the place where you are standing is holy. ” so joshua obeyed him .
march around the city with your army once every day for six days .
early the next morning joshua got up , and the priests carried the lord ’ s holy box again .
all the things made from silver , gold , bronze , and iron belong to the lord . they must be put in the lord ’ s treasury . ”
at that time joshua made this important promise . he said ,
so the lord was with joshua , and joshua became famous throughout the whole country .
i promise by my life , lord ! there is nothing i can say now . israel has surrendered to the enemy .
the lord said to joshua , “ why are you down there with your face on the ground ? stand up !
early the next morning , joshua led out all the israelites . each tribe came forward to stand before the lord , and he chose the tribe of judah .
achan answered , “ it is true ! i sinned against the lord , the god of israel . this is what i did :
so joshua sent some men to the tent . they ran to the tent and found the things hidden there . the silver was under the coat .
the men brought the things out of the tent and took them to joshua and all the israelites . they threw them on the ground before the lord .
so joshua led his whole army toward ai . then joshua chose 30,000 of his best fighting men and sent them out at night .
then you should come out of your hiding place and take control of the city . the lord your god will give you the power to win .
early the next morning joshua gathered the men together . then joshua and the leaders of israel led the men to ai .
then joshua chose about 5000 men . he sent these men to hide in the area west of the city , between bethel and ai .
joshua and all the men of israel let the army of ai push them back . joshua and his men began running east toward the desert .
the people in the city began to shout and started to chase them . all the people left the city .
all the men of ai and bethel chased the army of israel . the city was left open—no one stayed to protect the city .
but the king of ai was left alive . joshua ’ s men brought him to joshua .
all the people of ai died that day ; there were 12,000 men and women .
the israelites kept the animals and other things from the city for themselves . this is what the lord said they could do when he gave joshua the commands .
then joshua burned the city of ai . that city became an empty pile of rocks . it is still like that today .
then joshua built an altar for the lord , the god of israel . he built the altar on mount ebal .
there joshua copied onto the stones the law moses had written down . this was for all the people of israel to see .
all these kings came together and made plans to fight against joshua and the israelites .
the people from the city of gibeon heard about the way joshua had defeated jericho and ai .
the men put old sandals on their feet and wore old clothes . they found some old bread that was dry and moldy .
then they went to the camp of the israelites . this camp was near gilgal .
the hivite men said to joshua , “ we are your servants . ”
“ look at our bread . when we left home , it was warm and fresh . but now you can see that it is dry and old .
joshua agreed to make peace with them . he agreed to let them live . the leaders of israel agreed with this promise of joshua .
three days later the israelites learned that these men lived very near their camp .
now we are your servants . you can do whatever you think is right . ”
so the gibeonites became slaves , but joshua let them live . he did not allow the israelites to kill them .
“ come with me and help me attack gibeon . gibeon has made a peace agreement with joshua and the israelites . ”
so joshua marched out of gilgal with his whole army . his best fighting men were with him .
joshua and his army marched all night to gibeon , so it was a complete surprise when he attacked them .
on that day the lord gave israel the victory against the amorites . joshua stood before all the israelites and said to the lord :
after this , joshua and his army went back to the camp at gilgal .
but during the fight , the five kings ran away . they hid in a cave near makkedah ,
but someone found them hiding in that cave . joshua learned about this .
he said , “ cover the entrance to the cave with large rocks . put some men there to guard the cave .
joshua said , “ move the rocks that are covering the entrance to the cave . bring the five kings to me . ”
so joshua ’ s men brought the five kings out of the cave—the kings of jerusalem , hebron , jarmuth , lachish , and eglon .
then joshua killed the five kings and hanged their bodies on five trees . he left them hanging in the trees until evening .
then joshua and all the israelites traveled from makkedah to libnah and attacked that city .
then joshua and all the israelites left libnah and went to lachish . joshua and his army camped around that city and attacked it .
king horam of gezer came to help lachish , but joshua also defeated him and his army . no one was left alive .
then joshua and all the israelites traveled from lachish to eglon . they camped around eglon and attacked it .
that day they captured the city and killed everyone in the city . this was the same thing they had done to lachish .
then joshua and all the israelites traveled from eglon to hebron and attacked it .
then joshua and all the israelites went back to debir and attacked it .
joshua captured all the cities from kadesh barnea to gaza . he captured all the cities from goshen to gibeon .
then joshua and all the israelites returned to their camp at gilgal .
all these kings met together at the small river of merom . they joined their armies together into one camp and made plans for the battle against israel .
so joshua and his whole army surprised the enemy and attacked them at the river of merom .
joshua did what the lord said to do ; he cut the legs of their horses and burned their chariots .
then joshua went back and captured the city of hazor and killed its king . ( hazor was the leader of all the kingdoms that fought against israel . )
the army of israel killed everyone in that city and completely destroyed all the people . there was nothing left alive . then they burned the city .
joshua captured all these cities and killed all their kings . he completely destroyed everything in these cities—just as moses , the lord ’ s servant , had commanded .
joshua fought against them for many years .
there were no anakites left living in the land of israel . the only anakites who were left alive were in gaza , gath , and ashdod .
they also defeated king og of bashan . og was from the rephaites . he ruled the land in ashtaroth and edrei .
the king of jericho ,
the king of jerusalem ,
the king of jarmuth ,
the king of eglon ,
the king of debir ,
the king of hormah ,
the king of libnah ,
the king of makkedah ,
the king of tappuah ,
the king of aphek ,
the king of madon ,
the king of shimron meron ,
the king of taanach ,
the king of kedesh ,
the king of dor at mount dor ,
and the king of tirzah .
you have not yet taken the land of geshur or the land of the philistines .
you have not yet defeated the area of the gebalites . and also there is the area of lebanon east of baal gad below mount hermon to lebo hamath .
now divide the land among the nine tribes and half the tribe of manasseh . ”
the israelites did not force out the people of geshur and maacah . they still live among the israelites today .
moses had given each family group from the tribe of reuben some land . this is the land they received :
the land continued to heshbon . it included all the towns on the plain . those towns were dibon , bamoth baal , beth baal meon ,
jahaz , kedemoth , mephaath ,
kiriathaim , sibmah , zereth shahar on the hill in the valley ,
beth peor , the hills of pisgah , and beth jeshimoth .
the israelites defeated balaam son of beor . ( balaam tried to use magic to tell the future . ) the israelites killed many people during the fighting .
this is the land moses gave to the tribe of gad . he gave this land to each tribe :
their land included the area from heshbon to ramath mizpah and betonim , from mahanaim to the land of debir ,
this is the land moses gave to half the tribe of manasseh . half of all the families in the tribe of manasseh got this land :
eleazar the priest , joshua son of nun , and the leaders of all the tribes of israel decided what land to give to the people .
the lord had told moses how to divide the land among the tribes of israel . the israelites divided the land the way the lord had commanded .
i am still as strong today as i was the day moses sent me out . i am as ready to fight as i was then .
joshua blessed caleb son of jephunneh . joshua gave him the city of hebron as his own .
in the past that city was called kiriath arba . it was named for the greatest man among the anakites—a man named arba .
the southern border of judah ’ s land started at the south end of the dead sea .
the border continued to azmon , the brook of egypt , and then to the mediterranean sea . all that land was on their southern border .
their eastern border was the shore of the dead sea to the area where the jordan river flowed into the sea .
the mediterranean sea was the western border . so the land of judah was inside these four borders . the families of judah lived in this area .
then caleb fought against the people living in debir . ( in the past , debir was also called kiriath sepher . )
caleb said , “ i will give my daughter in marriage to the man who attacks and conquers kiriath sepher . ”
othniel was the son of caleb ’ s brother kenaz . othniel defeated that city , so caleb gave his daughter acsah to othniel to be his wife .
the tribe of judah got the land that god promised them . each family group got part of the land .

nibshan , salt city , and en gedi . in all , there were six towns and all the fields around them .
then the border continued from bethel ( luz ) to the arkite border at ataroth .
so the people of manasseh and ephraim got their land . ( manasseh and ephraim were sons of joseph . )
this is the land that was given to the people of ephraim : their eastern border started at ataroth addar near upper beth horon .
and the western border started at micmethath . the border turned to the east to taanath shiloh and continued east to janoah .
then it went from janoah down to ataroth and to naarah . the border continued until it touched jericho and ended at the jordan river .
many of the border towns of ephraim were actually in manasseh ’ s borders , but the ephraimites got the towns and the fields around them .
the lands of manasseh were in the area between asher and micmethath . this is near shechem . the border went south to the en tappuah area .
the people of manasseh were not able to defeat those cities . so the canaanites continued to live there .
but the israelites grew strong . when this happened , they forced the canaanites to work for them . but they did not force them to leave that land .
but at this time there were still seven tribes of israel that had not yet received their land .
joshua threw lots for them in front of the lord at shiloh . in this way joshua divided the land and gave each tribe its part of the land .
then the border went south to luz ( bethel ) , then down to ataroth addar . ataroth addar is on the hill south of lower beth horon .
the southern border started near kiriath jearim and went to the river of nephtoah .
it continued to the northern part of beth arabah . then the border went down into the jordan valley .
the jordan river was the eastern border . so this was the land that was given to the tribe of benjamin . these were the borders on all sides .
each family got its land . these are their cities : jericho , beth hoglah , emek keziz ,
beth arabah , zemaraim , bethel ,
avvim , parah , ophrah ,
kephar ammoni , ophni , and geba . there were twelve cities and the fields around them .
the tribe of benjamin also got gibeon , ramah , beeroth ,
mizpah , kephirah , mozah ,
rekem , irpeel , taralah ,
then joshua gave all the families in the tribe of simeon their share of the land . the land they got was inside the area that belonged to judah .
this is the land that was given to that tribe : beersheba ( also called sheba ) , moladah ,
hazar shual , balah , ezem ,
eltolad , bethul , hormah ,
ziklag , beth marcaboth , hazar susah ,
beth lebaoth , and sharuhen . there were 13 towns and all the fields around them .
they also got the towns of ain , rimmon , ether , and ashan . there were four towns and all the fields around them .
then the border went west to maralah and just touched dabbesheth . then it went along the ravine near jokneam .
then the border turned to the east . it went from sarid to kisloth tabor . then it went on to daberath and to japhia .
then the border continued to the east to gath hepher and eth kazin . it ended at rimmon . then it turned and went to neah .
at neah the border turned again , went north to hannathon , and then continued to the valley of iphtah el .
so these are the towns and fields around them that were given to zebulun . each family in zebulun got its part of the land .
the fourth part of the land was given to the tribe of issachar . each family in that tribe got its part of the land .
this is the land that was given to that tribe : jezreel , kesulloth , shunem ,
hapharaim , shion , anaharath ,

remeth , en gannim , en haddah , and beth pazzez .
these cities and towns were part of the land that was given to the tribe of issachar . each family got its part of the land .
the fifth part of land was given to the tribe of asher . each family in that tribe got its part of the land .
this is the land that was given to that tribe : helkath , hali , beten , acshaph ,
allammelech , amad , and mishal .
then the border went to abdon , rehob , hammon , and kanah . it continued to the greater sidon area .
ummah , aphek , and rehob .
these cities and the fields around them were given to the tribe of asher . each family in that tribe got its share of the land .
the sixth part of land was given to the tribe of naphtali . each family in that tribe got its share of the land .
there were some very strong cities inside these borders . they were ziddim , zer , hammath , rakkath , kinnereth ,
adamah , ramah , hazor ,
kedesh , edrei , en hazor ,
iron , migdal el , horem , beth anath , and beth shemesh . in all , there were 19 towns and all the fields around them .
these cities and the fields around them were given to the tribe of naphtali . each family in that tribe got its land .
then land was given to the tribe of dan . each family in that tribe got its land .

elon , timnah , ekron ,

jehud , bene berak , gath rimmon ,
me jarkon , rakkon , and the area near joppa .
all these cities and fields around them were given to the tribe of dan . each family got its share of the land .
then the lord said to joshua :
“ through moses , i told you to choose some cities to be cities of safety .
anyone who kills someone accidentally can go to a city of safety to hide from the relatives who want to kill him .
you should stay in that city until the court has judged you and until the high priest dies . then you may go back to your hometown . ”
so the israelites obeyed this command from the lord and gave the levites these towns and the land around them for their animals :
the other kohath families were given ten towns in the areas that belonged to ephraim , dan , and half of manasseh .
the people from the merari family were given 12 towns . these towns came from the areas that belonged to reuben , gad , and zebulun .
so the israelites gave the levites these towns and the fields around them , just as the lord had told moses .
these are the names of the towns that were in the areas that belonged to judah and simeon .
the first choice of towns was given to the levites from the kohath family group .
but the fields and the small towns around the city of kiriath arba belonged to caleb son of jephunneh .
they also gave aaron ’ s descendants cities that belonged to the tribe of benjamin . these cities were gibeon , geba ,
anathoth , and almon . they gave them these four towns and some of the land near the towns for their animals .
the other people from the kohathite family groups were given towns that were in the areas that belonged to the tribe of ephraim . they got these towns :
the city of shechem from the hill country of ephraim ( which was a city of safety ) , gezer ,
kibzaim , and beth horon . in all , ephraim gave them four towns and some land around each town for their animals .
the tribe of dan gave them eltekeh , gibbethon ,
aijalon , and gath rimmon . in all , dan gave them four towns and some land around each town for their animals .
in all , the rest of the people from the kohath family groups got ten towns and some land around each town for their animals .
the gershon family groups were also from the tribe of levi . they got these towns :
the tribe of issachar gave them kishion , daberath ,
jarmuth , and en gannim . in all , issachar gave them four towns and some land around each town for their animals .
the tribe of asher gave them mishal , abdon ,
helkath , and rehob . in all , asher gave them four towns and some land around each town for their animals .
in all , the gershon family groups got 13 towns and some land around each town for their animals .
in all , the last family of levites , the merari family , got 12 towns .
each of these towns had some land in it for their animals . that was true for every town .
the lord kept every promise that he made to the israelites . there were no promises that he failed to keep . every promise came true .
then joshua called a meeting of all the people from the tribes of reuben , gad , and half the tribe of manasseh .
all this time you have supported all the other israelites . you carefully obeyed all the commands that the lord your god gave you .
then joshua said goodbye to them , and they left and went home .
they went to the place called geliloth , near the jordan river in the land of canaan . there they built a beautiful altar .
all the israelites became very angry with these three tribes . they met together and decided to fight against them .
they also sent ten of the leaders of the tribes there . there was one man from each family group of israel who was at shiloh .
so these eleven men went to gilead . they went to talk to the people of reuben , gad , and manasseh . the eleven men said to them ,
the people from the tribes of reuben , gad , and manasseh answered the eleven men . they said ,
“ so we decided to build this altar . but we did not plan to use it for burning offerings and sacrifices .
the people of reuben and gad named the altar “ proof that we believe the lord is god . ”
the lord gave israel peace from their enemies around them . he made israel safe . many years passed , and joshua became very old .
you have seen what the lord did to our enemies . he did this to help us . the lord your god fought for you .
“ you must be careful to obey every command written in the book of the law of moses . never turn away from that law .
you must continue to follow the lord your god . you have done this in the past , and you must continue to do it .
“ the lord helped you defeat many great and powerful nations . he forced them to leave . no nation has been able to defeat you .
with his help , one man from israel could defeat 1000 enemy soldiers , because the lord your god fights for you , as he promised .
so you must continue to love the lord your god .
but i refused to listen to balaam ’ s prayer . so he asked me to bless you , and i saved you from the enemy .
then the people answered , “ we will never stop following the lord . we will never serve other gods !
then the people said to joshua , “ no , we will serve the lord ! ”
then the people said to joshua , “ we will serve the lord our god . we will obey him . ”
so that day joshua made an agreement for the people . he made this agreement at the town called shechem . it became a law for them to follow .
then joshua told the people to go home . so everyone went back to his own land .
after that the lord ’ s servant joshua son of nun died . he was 110 years old .
joshua was buried on his own land at timnath serah , in the hill country of ephraim , north of mount gaash .
greetings from jude , a servant of jesus christ and a brother of james .
mercy , peace , and love be yours more and more .
enoch , the seventh descendant from adam , said this about these people : “ look , the lord is coming with thousands and thousands of his holy angels
dear friends , remember what the apostles of our lord jesus christ said would happen .
these are the people who divide you . they are not spiritual , because they don ’ t have the spirit .
but you , dear friends , use your most holy faith to build yourselves up even stronger . pray with the help of the holy spirit .
keep yourselves safe in god ’ s love , as you wait for the lord jesus christ in his mercy to give you eternal life .
help those who have doubts .
god is strong and can keep you from falling . he can bring you before his glory without any wrong in you and give you great joy .
the lord said to the israelites , “ the tribe of judah will go . i will let them take this land . ”
the lord helped the men of judah defeat the canaanites and the perizzites . they killed 10,000 men at the city of bezek .
in the city of bezek , they found the ruler of bezek and fought him , and they defeated the canaanites and the perizzites .
the men of judah fought against jerusalem and captured it . they used their swords to kill the people of jerusalem . then they burned the city .
later , they went down to fight against some more canaanites who lived in the hill country , in the negev , and in the western foothills .
the men of judah also captured the cities of gaza , ashkelon , and ekron and all the small towns around them .
the tribe of benjamin could not force the jebusites to leave jerusalem . so even today , the jebusites live with the people of benjamin in jerusalem .
the descendants of joseph went to fight against the city of bethel , and the lord was with them .
they sent some spies to the city of bethel ( which was then called luz ) .
he went to the land where the hittites lived and built a city . he named it luz , and that city is still called luz today .
the people of asher did not force the other people to leave the cities of acco , sidon , ahlab , aczib , helbah , aphek , and rehob .
the people of asher did not force those canaanites to leave their land , so the canaanites continued to live with them .
the land of the amorites was from scorpion pass to sela and up into the hill country past sela .
after the angel gave the israelites this message from the lord , the people cried loudly .
so they named the place bokim . there they offered sacrifices to the lord .
then joshua told the people to go home , so each tribe went to take their area of land .
joshua son of nun , the servant of the lord , died at the age of 110 years .
after that whole generation died , the next generation grew up . this new generation did not know about the lord or what he had done for the israelites .
so the israelites did something very evil before the lord . they began serving the false god baal .
the israelites stopped following the lord and began worshiping baal and ashtoreth .
then the lord chose leaders called judges . these leaders saved the israelites from the enemies who took their possessions .
i will use them to test the israelites . i will see if the israelites can keep the lord ’ s commands as their ancestors did . ”
the israelites lived with the canaanites , hittites , the amorites , perizzites , hivites , and jebusites .
the lord saw that the israelites did evil things . they forgot about the lord their god and served the false gods baal and asherah .
so the land was at peace for 40 years , until othniel son of kenaz died .
king eglon of moab ruled over the israelites for 18 years .
so ehud brought the gift to king eglon of moab . eglon was a very fat man .
after offering the gift , ehud left the palace with the men who had carried the gift .
ehud went to king eglon . the king was sitting all alone in the upper room of his palace .
then ehud went out of the private room , closed the doors to the upper room , and locked the king inside .
while the servants were waiting for the king , ehud had time to escape . he passed by the statues and went toward the place named seirah .
he said to the israelites , “ follow me ! the lord has helped us defeat our enemies , the moabites . ”
they killed about 10,000 strong and brave men from moab . not one moabite man escaped .
so on that day the israelites began to rule over the moabites , and there was peace in the land for 80 years .
after ehud died , the people again did what the lord said was wrong .
sisera had 900 iron chariots , and he was very cruel to the israelites for 20 years . so they cried to the lord for help .
there was a woman prophet named deborah . she was the wife of a man named lappidoth . she was judge of israel at that time .
someone told sisera that barak son of abinoam was at mount tabor .
so sisera gathered his 900 iron chariots and all the men with him , and they marched from the city of harosheth haggoyim to the kishon river .
on that day god defeated king jabin of canaan for the israelites .
so the israelites became stronger and stronger until they defeated king jabin of canaan . the israelites finally destroyed him .
on the day that the israelites defeated sisera , deborah and barak son of abinoam sang this song :
“ the men of israel prepared for battle .
“ listen , kings .
“ lord , in the past you came from seir .
the mountains shook before the lord , the god of mount sinai ,
“ in the days of shamgar son of anath ,
“ there were no soldiers in israel
“ god chose new leaders
“ my heart is with the commanders of israel .
“ pay attention you people riding on white donkeys ,
at the watering holes for the animals ,
“ wake up , wake up , deborah !
“ now , survivors , go to the leaders .
“ the men of ephraim came from the hill country of amalek .
the leaders of issachar were with deborah .
so why did you sit there against the walls of your sheep pens ?
the people of gilead stayed in their camps on the other side of the jordan river .
“ but the men of zebulun and naphtali risked their lives
the kings of canaan came to fight ,
the stars fought them from heaven .
the kishon river , that ancient river ,
the horses ’ hooves hammered the ground .
“ the angel of the lord said , ‘ curse the city of meroz .
jael was the wife of heber the kenite .
sisera asked for water .
then jael reached out and took a tent peg .
he sank down between jael ’ s feet .
“ there is sisera ’ s mother , looking out the window ,
“ her wisest servant girl answers her .
‘ i ’ m sure they won the war ,
“ may all your enemies die like this , lord !
again the israelites did what the lord said was wrong . so for seven years the lord allowed the midianites to defeat the israelites .
they did that because the midianites and amalekites from the east always came and destroyed their crops .
the israelites became very poor because of the midianites . so the israelites cried to the lord for help .
the midianites did all these bad things , so the israelites cried to the lord for help .
then gideon said to him , “ if you would , please give me some proof that you really are the lord .
but the lord said to gideon , “ calm down ! don ’ t be afraid ! you will not die ! ”
the spirit of the lord filled gideon . so gideon blew a trumpet to call the family of abiezer to follow him .
then gideon said to god , “ you said that you would help me save the israelites . give me proof .
that night god did that very thing . just the sheepskin was dry , but the ground around it was wet with dew .
so make an announcement to your men . tell them , ‘ anyone who is afraid may leave mount gilead and go back home . ’ ”
during the night the lord spoke to gideon and said , “ get up . i will let you defeat the midianite army . go down to their camp .
if you are afraid to go alone , take your servant purah with you . go into the camp of the midianites .
listen to what they are saying . after that you will not be afraid to attack them . ”
then gideon divided the 300 men into three groups . he gave each man a trumpet and an empty jar with a burning torch inside it .
gideon ’ s men stayed where they were . but inside the camp , the men of midian began shouting and running away .
then soldiers from the tribes of naphtali , asher , and all of manasseh were told to chase the midianites .
then gideon and his 300 men came to the jordan river and went across to the other side , but they were tired and hungry .
so gideon said to the men of penuel , “ after i win the victory , i will come back here and pull this tower down . ”
zebah and zalmunna , kings of the midianites , ran away . but gideon chased and caught them . gideon and his men defeated the enemy army .
then gideon son of joash returned from the battle . he and his men returned by going through a mountain pass called the pass of heres .
gideon took the elders of the city of succoth and beat them with thorns and briers from the desert .
gideon also pulled down the tower in the city of penuel and killed the men living in that city .
then gideon said to zebah and zalmunna , “ you killed some men on mount tabor . what were the men like ? ”
gideon son of joash went home .
gideon had 70 sons of his own . he had so many sons because he had many wives .
he had a slave woman who lived in the city of shechem . he had a son by her . he named that son abimelech .
as soon as gideon died , the israelites again were not faithful to god—they followed baal . they made baal berith their god .
the israelites did not remember the lord their god , who had saved them from all their enemies living around them .
the israelites were not loyal to the family of jerub-baal ( gideon ) , even though he had done many good things for them .
“ then the trees said to the fig tree , ‘ come and be our king . ’
“ but the fig tree answered , ‘ should i stop making my good , sweet fruit just to go and sway over the other trees ? ’
“ then the trees said to the vine , ‘ come and be our king . ’
“ finally , all the trees said to the thornbush , ‘ come and be our king . ’
but remember what my father did for you . he fought for you and risked his life when he saved you from the midianites .
but leaders of shechem and the house of millo , if you have not acted right , may abimelech destroy you . and may abimelech be destroyed too ! ”
after jotham had said this , he ran away and escaped to the city named beer . he stayed there because he was afraid of his brother abimelech .
abimelech ruled the israelites for three years .
zebul was the governor of the city of shechem . zebul heard what gaal son of ebed said , and he became very angry .
zebul sent messengers to abimelech in the city of arumah . this is the message :
so now you and your men should come tonight and hide in the fields outside the city .
when gaal saw the soldiers , he said to zebul , “ look , there are people coming down from the mountains . ”
so gaal led the leaders of shechem out to fight abimelech .
then abimelech returned to the city of arumah . zebul forced gaal and his brothers to leave the city of shechem .
the next day the people of shechem went out to the fields to work . abimelech found out about it .
abimelech and his group ran to a place near the gate to shechem . the other two groups ran out to the people in the fields and killed them .
abimelech heard that all the leaders of the tower of shechem had gathered together .
then abimelech and his men went to the city of thebez and captured that city .
abimelech and his men came to the tower to attack it . abimelech went up to the door of the tower to burn it .
the israelites saw that abimelech was dead , so they all went back home .
in that way god punished abimelech for all the bad things he had done . abimelech sinned against his own father by killing his 70 brothers .
god also punished the men of the city of shechem for the bad things they had done . so the things said by jotham son of gideon came true .
tola was a judge for the israelites for 23 years . then he died and was buried in the city of shamir .
jair died and was buried in the city of kamon .
so the lord became angry with the israelites and allowed the philistines and the ammonites to defeat them .
the ammonites then went across the jordan river to fight against the people of judah , benjamin , and ephraim . the ammonites brought many troubles to the israelites .
you cried to me when the people of sidon , the amalekites , and the midianites hurt you . i also saved you from those people .
but you left me and started worshiping other gods , so i refuse to save you again .
you like worshiping those gods , so go call to them for help . let them save you when you are in trouble . ”
but the israelites said to the lord , “ we have sinned . do whatever you want to do to us , but please save us today . ”
then the israelites threw away the foreign gods and began to worship the lord again . so he felt sorry for them when he saw them suffering .
the ammonites gathered together for war . their camp was in the area of gilead . the israelites gathered together . their camp was at the city of mizpah .
so jephthah went away because of his brothers and lived in the land of tob . in the land of tob , some rough men began to follow jephthah .
after a time the ammonites fought with the israelites .
the elders said to jephthah , “ come and be our leader so that we can fight the ammonites . ”
so the messengers of jephthah took this message back to jephthah . then jephthah sent the messengers to the king of the ammonites again .
they took this message :
when the israelites came out of the land of egypt , they went into the desert . they went to the red sea . then they went to kadesh .
the israelites got all the land of the amorites from the arnon river to the jabbok river . the land also went from the desert to the jordan river .
the king of the ammonites refused to listen to this message from jephthah .
jephthah made a promise to the lord . he said , “ if you will let me defeat the ammonites ,
then jephthah went to the land of the ammonites . he fought the ammonites , and the lord helped him defeat them .
every year the young women of israel would go out for four days to remember the daughter of jephthah from gilead and to cry for her .
jephthah was a judge for the israelites for six years . then jephthah from gilead died and was buried in his town in gilead .
after jephthah , a man named ibzan was a judge for the israelites . ibzan was from the city of bethlehem .
then ibzan died and was buried in the city of bethlehem .
then elon from the tribe of zebulun died and was buried in the city of aijalon in the land of zebulun .
after elon died , a man named abdon son of hillel was a judge for the israelites . abdon was from the city of pirathon .
abdon had 40 sons and 30 grandsons . they rode on 70 donkeys . abdon was a judge for the israelites for eight years .
again the people started doing what the lord said was wrong . so the lord allowed the philistines to rule over them for 40 years .
don ’ t drink any wine or any other strong drink . don ’ t eat any food that is unclean ,
so the woman ran to tell her husband , “ the man is back ! the man who came to me the other day is here . ”
so manoah said , “ may what you say happen . tell me , what kind of life will the boy live ? what will he do ? ”
the angel of the lord said to manoah , “ your wife must do everything i told her .
the angel of the lord said , “ why do you ask my name ? it is too amazing for you to believe . ”
he finally understood that the man was really the angel of the lord . the angel of the lord did not appear to manoah and his wife again .
manoah said to his wife , “ we have seen god . surely we will die because of this . ”
so the woman had a boy . she named him samson . he grew and the lord blessed him .
samson went down to the city of timnah . he saw a young philistine woman there .
so samson went down to the city and talked to the philistine woman . she pleased him .
samson ’ s father went down to see the philistine woman . the custom was for the bridegroom to give a party . so samson gave a party .
when the philistines saw that he was having a party , they sent 30 men to be with him .
samson told them this riddle :
so before the sun went down on the seventh day of the party , the philistine men had the answer . they came to samson and said ,
so samson ’ s wife was given to his best man .
but samson said to him , “ now i have a good reason to hurt you philistines . no one will blame me now . ”
the philistines asked , “ who did this ? ”
samson attacked the philistines and killed many of them . then he went and stayed in a cave in a place named the rock of etam .
the philistines went to the land of judah and stopped near a place named lehi . their army camped there .
the men of the tribe of judah asked them , “ why have you philistines come here to fight us ? ”
then they said to samson , “ we have come to tie you up . we will give you to the philistines . ”
samson found a jawbone of a dead donkey and killed 1000 philistine men with it .
when samson finished speaking , he threw the jawbone down . so that place was named ramath lehi .
samson was a judge for the israelites for 20 years during the time of the philistines .
one day samson went to the city of gaza . he saw a prostitute there and went in to stay the night with her .
later , samson fell in love with a woman named delilah , who was from sorek valley .
so delilah said to samson , “ tell me why you are so strong . how could someone tie you up and make you helpless ? ”
then the rulers of the philistines brought seven fresh , new bowstrings to delilah , and she tied samson with the bowstrings .
she kept bothering samson day after day . he got so tired of her asking him about his secret that he felt like he was going to die .
but his hair began to grow again .
when the philistines saw samson , they praised their god . they said ,
there was a man named micah who lived in the hill country of ephraim .
micah had a temple for worshiping idols . he made an ephod and some house idols . then micah chose one of his sons to be his priest .
( at that time the israelites did not have a king , so everyone did what they thought was right . )
there was a young man who was a levite from the city of bethlehem in judah . he had been living among the tribe of judah .
micah asked him , “ where have you come from ? ”
the young levite agreed to live with micah . he became like one of micah ’ s own sons .
micah chose him to be his priest . so the young man became a priest and lived in micah ’ s house .
the young man told them what micah had done for him . “ micah hired me , ” he said . “ i am his priest . ”
so they said to him , “ please ask god if our search for a place to live will be successful . ”
the priest said to the five men , “ yes . go in peace . the lord will lead you on your way . ”
the five men went back to the cities of zorah and eshtaol . their relatives asked them , “ what did you learn ? ”
so 600 men from the tribe of dan left the cities of zorah and eshtaol . they were ready for war .
from there the 600 men traveled on to the hill country of ephraim . then they came to micah ’ s house .
so they stopped at micah ’ s house , where the young levite lived . they asked the young man how he was .
the 600 men from the tribe of dan stood at the entrance of the gate . they all had their weapons and were ready for war .
then the men of dan turned around and went on their way . micah knew that these men were too strong for him , so he went back home .
at that time the israelites did not have a king .
the levite got up to leave , but his father-in-law persuaded him to stay the night again .
the old man saw the traveler in the public square and asked , “ where are you going ? where did you come from ? ”
the levite said to her , “ get up ; let ’ s go. ” but there was no answer .
now , all you men of israel , speak up . give your decision about what we should do . ”
now this is what we will do to the city of gibeah . we will throw lots to let god show us who will lead the attack .
so all the men of israel gathered together at the city of gibeah , united together and in agreement as to what they were doing .
the tribes of israel sent men to the tribe of benjamin with this message : “ what about this terrible thing that some of your men have done ?
the people from the tribe of benjamin got 26,000 soldiers together who were trained for war . they also had 700 trained soldiers from the city of gibeah .
all the tribes of israel , except benjamin , gathered together 400,000 fighting men with swords . each one was a trained soldier .
the israelites went up to the city of bethel . at bethel they asked god , “ which tribe will be first to attack the tribe of benjamin ? ”
the next morning the israelites got up . they made a camp near the city of gibeah .
then the army of israel took their positions for battle against the army of benjamin at the city of gibeah .
then the army of israel came near the army of benjamin . this was the second day of the war .
the men of israel asked the lord a question . ( in those days god ’ s box of the agreement was there at bethel .
then the army of israel hid some men all around the city of gibeah .
the army of israel went to fight against the city of gibeah on the third day . they got ready for battle as they had done before .
the men of benjamin said , “ we are winning as before ! ”
so the people of benjamin saw that they were defeated .
the men who were hiding rushed into the city of gibeah . they spread out and killed everyone in the city with their swords .
so 18,000 brave and strong fighters from the army of benjamin were killed .
on that day 25,000 men of the army of benjamin were killed . all of them fought bravely with their swords .
but 600 men from benjamin ran into the desert to the place called the rock of rimmon and stayed there for four months .
the israelites went to the city of bethel . there they sat before god until evening . they cried loudly as they sat there .
early the next day , the israelites built an altar . they put burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to god on that altar .
then the israelites felt sorry for their relatives , the people of benjamin . they said , “ today , one tribe has been separated from israel .
the israelites counted everyone to see who was there and who was not . they found that no one from jabesh gilead was there .
the israelites felt sorry for the men of benjamin . they felt sorry for them because the lord had separated them from the other tribes of israel .
so the elders told the men of benjamin about their idea . they said , “ go and hide in the vineyards .
then the israelites went home . they went to their own land and tribe .
in those days the israelites did not have a king , so everyone did whatever they thought was right .
jerusalem once was a city full of people ,
she cries bitterly in the night .
judah suffered very much ,
the roads to zion are very sad ,
jerusalem ’ s enemies have won .
the beauty of daughter zion has gone away .
jerusalem sinned very badly .
jerusalem ’ s skirts were dirty .
the enemy stretched out his hand .
all the people of jerusalem are groaning .
all you who pass by on the road , you don ’ t seem to care .
the lord sent fire from above
“ my sins were tied up like a yoke .
“ the lord rejected all my powerful men
“ i cry about all these things .
zion spread out her hands .
now jerusalem says , “ i refused to listen to the lord ,
i called out to my lovers ,
“ look at me , lord . i am in distress !
“ listen to me , i am groaning .
“ look how evil my enemies are !
look how the lord has covered daughter zion
the lord destroyed the houses of jacob .
he was angry , and he destroyed
he bent his bow like an enemy .
the lord has become like an enemy .
he pulled up his own tent
he rejected his altar ,
the lord planned to destroy
jerusalem ’ s gates have sunk into the ground .
the elders of zion sit on the ground .
my eyes are worn out with tears ,
they ask their mothers ,
my dear jerusalem , what can i say about you ?
your prophets saw visions for you ,
those who pass by on the road
all your enemies laugh at you .
the lord did what he planned to do .
cry out with all your heart to the lord !
get up throughout the night and cry for help .
look at us , lord !
young men and old men
you invited terror to come to me from all around .
i am a man who has seen much trouble .
he led and brought me
he turned his hand against me .
he wore out my flesh and skin .
he built up bitterness and trouble against me .
he put me in the dark ,
he shut me in , so i could not get out .
even when i cry out and ask for help ,
he has blocked up my path with stones .
he is like a bear about to attack me ,
he led me off my path .
he made his bow ready .
he shot me in the stomach
i have become a joke to all my people .
he gave me this poison to drink .
he pushed my teeth into rocky ground .
i thought i would never have peace again .
i said to myself , “ i no longer have any hope
remember , i am very sad ,
i remember well all my troubles ,
but then i think about this ,
we are still alive because
every morning he shows it in new ways !
i say to myself , “ the lord is my god ,
the lord is good to those who wait for him .
it is good to wait quietly
it is good for a man to wear his yoke
he should sit alone and be quiet
he should bow down to the lord .
he should turn his cheek to the one who hits him
when he punishes , he also has mercy .
he does not enjoy causing people pain .
he does not like any prisoner on earth
he does not like anyone to be unfair to another person .
the lord does not like anyone to cheat another person .
no one can say something and make it happen ,
no one alive can complain
let us check and see what we have done .
let us lift up our hearts and our hands
let us say to him , “ we have sinned and have been stubborn .
you wrapped yourself with anger .
you wrapped yourself in a cloud
you made us like garbage and dirt
we have been frightened .
my eyes flow with streams of tears .
my eyes will flow without stopping .
i will continue to cry
my eyes make me sad , when i see
they threw me alive into a pit
water came up over my head .
lord , i called your name
you heard my voice .
you came to me on the day that i called out to you .
lord , you have seen my trouble .
you have seen how my enemies have hurt me .
you heard them insult me , lord .
the words and the thoughts of my enemies
when they sit down and when they stand up .
give them back what they deserve , lord .
chase them in anger and destroy them .
see how the gold has grown dark ,
the precious people of zion
even a wild dog feeds her babies .
those who ate rich food
the sin of the daughter of my people was very great .
some of the men of judah were dedicated to god in a special way .
but now their faces are blacker than soot .
it was better for those who were killed by the sword
the lord used all of his anger .
the kings of the earth could not believe what had happened .
this happened because the prophets
the prophets and priests walked around
people shouted , “ go away !
the lord himself destroyed them .
we have worn out our eyes looking for help ,
our enemies hunted us all the time .
the men who chased us
the king was very important to us .
be happy , people of edom .
your punishment is complete , zion .
remember , lord , what happened to us .
our land has been turned over to strangers .
we have become orphans .
we have to buy the water that we drink .
we are forced to wear a yoke on our necks .
we made an agreement with egypt .
our ancestors sinned against you , and now they are dead .
slaves have become our rulers .
we risk our lives to get food .
our skin is hot like an oven .
the enemy raped the women of zion .
the enemy hanged our princes .
the enemy made our young men grind grain at the mill .
the elders no longer sit at the gates of the city .
we have no more joy in our hearts .
the crown has fallen from our head .
for this reason , our hearts have become sick ,
mount zion is a wasteland .
but you rule forever , lord .
you seem to have forgotten us forever .
bring us back to you , lord .
you were very angry with us .
so the lord called out to moses from inside the meeting tent and said ,
you must remove the skin from that animal and then cut the animal into pieces .
aaron ’ s sons , the priests , will put the fire on the altar and arrange the wood on the fire .
they will lay the pieces of the animal , including the head and fat , on top of the burning wood .
“ if you offer a sheep or a goat as a burnt offering , it must be a male that has nothing wrong with it .
“ if you offer a bird as a burnt offering to the lord , that bird must be a dove or a young pigeon .
he will remove the bird ’ s tail and inner parts and throw them onto the pile of ashes east of the altar .
the rest of that grain offering will belong to aaron and his sons . this gift to the lord is very holy .
if you bring a grain offering cooked in a baking pan , it must be made from fine flour without yeast and mixed with oil .
you must break it into pieces and pour oil over it . it is a grain offering .
if you bring a grain offering cooked in a frying pan , it must be made from fine flour mixed with oil .
the rest of that grain offering will belong to aaron and his sons . this gift to the lord is very holy .
you must put oil and frankincense on it . it is a grain offering .
if you bring a lamb as an offering to the lord ,
then the priest will take that part to the altar to be burned up as food , a gift to the lord .
“ if the offering is a goat , you must bring it before the lord .
then the priest will bring that food as a sweet-smelling gift to the lord . the fat belongs to the lord .
this rule will continue forever through all your generations . wherever you live , you must never eat fat or blood . ”
the lord spoke to moses and said ,
“ tell the israelites this : a person might sin without meaning to and do something that the lord commanded should not be done . for example :
then the anointed priest must get some of the blood from the bull and take it into the meeting tent .
he must put his finger in the blood and sprinkle the blood seven times before the lord in front of the curtain of the most holy place .
then the priest must take all the fat from the bull of the sin offering . he must take the fat that is on and around the inner parts .
the priest must lift up these things and burn them on the altar for burnt offerings , just as he does for the fellowship offering .
the anointed priest must get some of the bull ’ s blood and take it into the meeting tent .
he must put his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times in front of the curtain before the lord .
then he must take all the fat from the animal and bring it to the altar .
if he learns about his sin , he must bring a male goat that has nothing wrong with it as his offering .
if you learn about that sin , you must bring a female goat that has nothing wrong with it as your sin offering .
you must put your hand on the animal ’ s head and kill it at the place for the burnt offering .
“ if you bring a lamb as your sin offering , then you must bring a female lamb that has nothing wrong with it .
you must put your hand on the animal ’ s head and kill it as a sin offering in the place where people kill the burnt offering .
if you are guilty of any of these things , you must confess whatever you did wrong .
the lord gave this command to moses for the people :
you are guilty , and you must pay the guilt offering to the lord . ”
the lord told moses these rules for the people :
you must also bring a ram to the lord that has nothing wrong with it ( or the same amount in silver ) to the priest .
the lord said to moses ,
then he must take off the special clothes and put on the other clothes and carry the ashes outside the camp to a special place that is pure .
that fire must always be kept burning on the altar . it must never be allowed to stop burning .
“ this is the law for the grain offering : the sons of aaron will bring it to the front of the altar as an offering to the lord .
the lord said to moses ,
every grain offering that a priest gives must be completely burned . it must not be eaten . ”
the lord said to moses ,
the priest who offers the sin offering must eat it . but he must eat it in a holy place , in the courtyard around the meeting tent .
touching the meat of the sin offering makes a person or a thing holy .
“ any male in a priest ’ s family may eat the sin offering . it is very holy .
“ these are the rules for the guilt offering , which is very holy :
“ the priest must offer all the fat from the guilt offering . he must offer the fat tail and the fat that covers the inner parts .
he must bring these things to the altar as a gift to the lord . it is a guilt offering .
“ any male in a priest ’ s family may eat the guilt offering . it is very holy , so it must be eaten in a holy place .
the guilt offering is like the sin offering . the same rules are for both offerings . the priest who does the sacrificing will get the meat for food .
he will also get the skin from the burnt offering .
“ this is the law of the sacrifice of fellowship offerings that you bring to the lord :
you must also bring loaves of bread made with yeast to go with your fellowship offering .
if any meat from this sacrifice is still left over on the third day , it must be burned in the fire .
but anyone who is unclean and eats the meat from the fellowship offerings that was offered to the lord must be separated from their people .
the lord said to moses ,
“ tell the israelites : you must not eat any fat from your cattle , sheep , or goats .
you may use the fat from any animal that has died by itself or was torn by other animals , but you must never eat it .
whoever eats the fat from an animal that was offered as a gift to the lord must be separated from their people .
“ no matter where you live , you must never eat blood from any bird or any animal .
anyone who eats blood must be separated from their people . ”
the lord said to moses ,
“ tell the israelites : if you bring a fellowship offering to the lord , you must present that gift to the lord yourself .
the priest will burn the fat on the altar , but the breast of the animal will belong to aaron and his sons .
you must also give the right thigh from the fellowship offering as a gift to the priest .
that part of the fellowship offering will belong to the priest who carries the blood and fat to the altar .
the lord commanded the israelites to give those parts to the priests once they have been anointed . that will be their share from the israelites forever .
these are the laws about burnt offerings , grain offerings , sin offerings , guilt offerings , fellowship offerings , and offerings for when the priests are appointed .
the lord gave these laws to moses on mount sinai when he commanded the israelites to bring their offerings to the lord in the desert of sinai .
the lord said to moses ,
then gather the people together at the entrance of the meeting tent . ”
moses did what the lord commanded him . the people met together at the entrance of the meeting tent .
then moses said to them , “ this is what the lord has commanded must be done . ”
moses brought aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water .
moses put the judgment pouch on aaron and put the urim and thummim inside its pocket .
then moses took the anointing oil and sprinkled it on the holy tent and on everything in it . in this way he made them holy .
he poured some of the anointing oil on aaron ’ s head to make him holy .
then moses brought out the bull of the sin offering . aaron and his sons put their hands on the bull ’ s head .
then moses brought the ram of the burnt offering . aaron and his sons put their hands on the ram ’ s head .
then moses killed the ram . he sprinkled the blood around on the altar .
then he put all of it in the hands of aaron and his sons . moses lifted these pieces to show he was offering them before the lord .
if any of the meat or bread is left , burn it .
the ceremony for appointing the priests will last for seven days . you must not leave the entrance of the meeting tent until that time is finished .
everything we did today was what the lord commanded us to do in order to make you pure .
so aaron and his sons did everything that the lord had commanded moses .
on the eighth day , moses called for aaron and his sons and the elders of israel .
so all the people came to the meeting tent . they all brought the things that moses had commanded . all the people stood before the lord .
moses said , “ you must do what the lord commanded . then the glory of the lord will appear to you . ”
so aaron went to the altar . he killed the bull for the sin offering . this sin offering was for himself .
then aaron burned the meat and skin on a fire outside the camp .
next , aaron killed the animal for the burnt offering . his sons brought the blood to him , and he sprinkled the blood around on the altar .
aaron ’ s sons gave the pieces and head of the burnt offering to aaron , and he burned them on the altar .
he also washed the inner parts and the legs of the burnt offering and burned them on the altar .
he brought the burnt offering and offered it , just as the lord had commanded .
he brought the grain offering to the altar . he took a handful of the grain and put it on the altar beside that morning ’ s daily sacrifice .
aaron ’ s sons put these fat parts on the breasts of the bull and the ram . aaron burned them on the altar .
he lifted the breasts and the gift of the right thigh to show he was offering them before the lord , just as moses had commanded .
moses and aaron went into the meeting tent . they came out and blessed the people . then the glory of the lord appeared to all the people .
so fire came from the lord and destroyed nadab and abihu , and they died there in front of the lord .
so mishael and elzaphan obeyed moses . they carried the bodies of nadab and abihu outside the camp . nadab and abihu were still wearing their special woven shirts .
then the lord said to aaron ,
you must be able to clearly tell the difference between what is holy and what is not holy , between what is clean and what is unclean .
and you must teach the people about all the laws that the lord gave them through moses . ”
the portion of food for you and your sons will come from the special gifts to the lord , so you must eat that food in a holy place .
when moses heard this , he agreed .
the lord said to moses and aaron ,
“ tell the israelites : these are the animals you can eat :
don ’ t eat the meat from these animals . don ’ t even touch their dead bodies ! they are unclean for you .
“ you may eat everything that lives in the sea or in a river that has fins and scales .
it is a sickening thought for you to touch anything that lives in the water and does not have fins and scales .
kites , all kinds of falcons ,
all kinds of black birds ,
ostriches , nighthawks , sea gulls , all kinds of hawks ,
owls , cormorants , great owls ,
water hens , pelicans , carrion vultures ,
storks , all kinds of herons , hoopoes , and bats .
“ don ’ t eat insects that have wings and crawl . even the thought of eating them should make you sick !
but you may eat insects if they have legs with joints above their feet so that they can jump .
you may also eat all kinds of locusts , all kinds of winged locusts , all kinds of crickets , and all kinds of grasshoppers .
“ but stay away from all the other insects that have wings and crawl .
they will make you unclean . if you touch the dead bodies of these insects , you will become unclean until evening .
if you pick up one of these dead insects , you must wash your clothes . you will be unclean until evening .
“ these small animals are unclean for you : moles , mice , all kinds of great lizards ,
geckos , crocodiles , lizards , sand reptiles , and chameleons .
whoever touches their dead bodies will be unclean until evening .
if any of these unclean animals dies and falls into a clay dish , anything in the dish will become unclean . and you must break the dish .
if water from the unclean clay dish touches any food , that food will become unclean . any drink in the unclean dish will become unclean .
if any part of a dead , unclean animal falls on seed that is to be planted , that seed is still clean .
but if you put water on some seed and if any part of a dead , unclean animal falls on those seeds , they are unclean for you .
“ also , if an animal which you use for food dies , whoever touches its dead body will be unclean until evening .
“ you must treat all the crawling animals that live on the dirt as disgusting things that you must not eat .
don ’ t let them make you filthy . you must not become unclean ,
because i am the lord your god . i am holy , so you should keep yourselves holy . don ’ t make yourselves unclean with these crawling things .
these are the rules about all the tame animals , birds , all the animals in the sea , and all the animals that crawl on the ground .
these rules will help the people know which animals are unclean and which animals they are allowed to eat and which ones they can not eat .
the lord said to moses ,
“ tell the israelites :
the baby boy must be circumcised on the eighth day .
the lord said to moses and aaron ,
the priest must look , and if the rash has spread , he must announce that the person is unclean . the disease is leprosy .
“ whoever has leprosy must be brought to the priest .
but if the skin is raw , that person is not clean .
when the priest sees the raw skin , he must announce that the person is unclean . the raw skin is not clean . it is leprosy .
“ if the raw skin changes and becomes white , the person must come to the priest .
“ someone might get a boil on their skin that heals over .
if the spot spreads on the skin , the priest must announce that the person is unclean ; it is an infection .
“ someone might get an infection on the scalp or beard .
if the disease does not seem deeper than the skin , but there is no dark hair in it , the priest must separate that person for seven days .
the person must shave . but the diseased area should not be shaved . the priest must separate that person for seven more days .
but if the disease spreads on the skin after the person has become clean ,
“ if anyone has white spots on the skin ,
“ a man might begin to lose the hair on his head . it is only baldness , so he is clean .
a man might lose hair from the sides of his head . he is clean . it is only another kind of baldness .
but if there is a red and white infection on his scalp , it is a skin disease .
a priest must look at him . if the swelling of the infection is red and white and looks like the leprosy on other parts of his body ,
then he has leprosy on his scalp . the person is unclean . the priest must announce that he is unclean .
they are unclean the whole time that they have the infection . they are unclean and must live outside the camp .
if the mildew is green or red , it must be shown to the priest .
the priest must look at it and put it in a separate place for seven days .
he must order the people to wash it . then he must separate the clothing for seven more days .
but the mildew might come back to that piece of leather or cloth . if that happens , the mildew is spreading , and the object must be burned .
but if the mildew did not come back after washing , that piece of leather or cloth is clean , whether the cloth was woven or knitted . ”
these are the rules for mildew on pieces of leather or cloth , whether the cloth is woven or knitted .
the lord said to moses ,
“ these are the rules for people who have had a skin disease and have been made well . these rules are for making them clean .
the priest must go to them outside the camp and look to see if the skin disease is healed .
then the priest must order one bird to be killed in a clay bowl over running water .
the priest will also take some of the oil and pour it into his own left palm .
“ then the priest must offer the sin offering to make that person pure . after that he will kill the animal for the burnt offering .
the priest will take the lamb for the guilt offering and the oil , and he will lift them up to show they were offered before the lord .
he will also pour some of this oil into his own left palm .
he will use the finger of his right hand to sprinkle some of the oil that is in his left palm seven times before the lord .
“ then the priest must offer one of the doves or young pigeons . ( he must offer whichever the person can afford . )
the lord also said to moses and aaron ,
the person who owns that house must come and tell the priest , ‘ i see something like mildew in my house . ’
he must go out of the house and lock the house for seven days .
“ on the seventh day the priest must come back and check the house . if the mildew has spread on the walls of the house ,
then new stones must be put in the walls , and the walls must be covered with new plaster .
“ maybe someone took away the old stones and plaster and put in new stones and plaster . and maybe mildew again appears in that house .
the house must be torn down . all the stones , plaster , and pieces of wood must be taken to the special unclean place outside the city .
anyone who goes into that house will be unclean until evening .
anyone who eats in that house or lies down in there must wash their clothes .
he will kill one bird in a clay bowl over running water .
in this way he will use these things to make the house clean .
these are the rules for any infection of leprosy ,
for mildew on pieces of cloth or in a house .
these are the rules for swellings , rashes , or bright spots on the skin .
these rules teach when something is clean and when something is unclean . these are the rules about these kinds of disease .
the lord also said to moses and aaron ,
“ say to the israelites : whoever has a genital discharge is unclean .
the person is unclean whether the discharge continues to flow or whether it stops .
“ if a man with a discharge lies on a bed , that bed becomes unclean . everything he sits on will become unclean .
if you touch that bed , you must wash your clothes and bathe in water . you will be unclean until evening .
if you sit on anything that he sat on , you must wash your clothes and bathe in water . you will be unclean until evening .
if you touch him , you must wash your clothes and bathe in water . you will be unclean until evening .
if he spits on you , you must wash your clothes and bathe in water . you will be unclean until evening .
if that man sits on a saddle , it will become unclean .
if you touch or carry anything that was under him , you will be unclean until evening .
if he touches you , you must wash your clothes and bathe in water . you will be unclean until evening .
“ if a man has a flow of semen , he must bathe his whole body in water . he will be unclean until evening .
if the semen is on any clothing or leather , that clothing or leather must be washed with water . it will be unclean until evening .
everything she lies on during her monthly time of bleeding will be unclean . and everything she sits on during that time will be unclean .
whoever touches her bed must wash their clothes and bathe in water . they will be unclean until evening .
whoever touches anything she has sat on must wash their clothes and bathe in water . they will be unclean until evening .
it doesn ’ t matter if they touched the woman ’ s bed or if they touched something she sat on , they will be unclean until evening .
whoever touches these things will be unclean until evening . they must wash their own clothes and bathe in water .
after the woman ’ s discharge stops , she must wait seven days . after that she will be clean .
then on the eighth day , she must bring two doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the meeting tent .
these are the rules for anyone with a discharge from the body . these rules are for men who become unclean from a flow of semen .
two of aaron ’ s sons died while offering incense to the lord . after that time , the lord spoke to moses .
“ before aaron enters the most holy place , he will offer a bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering .
“ from the whole community of israel , aaron will accept two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering .
then he will offer the bull for the sin offering . this sin offering is for himself . he will do this to purify himself and his family .
“ then aaron will take the two goats and bring them before the lord at the doorway of the meeting tent .
aaron will throw lots for the two goats . one lot will be for the lord . the other lot will be for azazel .
“ then aaron will offer the goat chosen by the lot for the lord . aaron will make this goat a sin offering .
then he will burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar .
“ the man who led the goat to azazel must wash his clothes and his whole body with water . after that he may come into the camp .
then the man who burns them must wash his clothes and bathe his whole body with water . after that he may come into the camp .
because on this day , the priest will do this to make you pure and wash away your sins . then you will be clean to the lord .
you must humble yourselves because this day is a very important day of rest for you . this law will continue forever .
and make the most holy place , the meeting tent , and the altar pure . he will also make the priests and all the people pure .
that law will continue forever . once every year you will purify the israelites from all their sins . ”
the lord said to moses ,
“ speak to aaron and to his sons , and to all the israelites . tell them this is what the lord has commanded :
any one of you israelites might kill a bull , a lamb , or a goat . you might be in the camp or outside the camp .
in this way you will stop being unfaithful to me by offering sacrifices to your ‘ goat gods. ’ this law will continue forever .
“ tell the people : any citizen of israel , traveler , or foreigner living among you might want to offer a burnt offering or some other sacrifice .
“ i will turn against those who eat blood whether they are citizens of israel or foreigners living among you , i will separate them from their people .
that is why i am telling you israelites and the foreigners living among you that you must not eat blood .
if you don ’ t wash your clothes and bathe your whole body , you will be responsible for your guilt . ”
the lord said to moses ,
“ tell the israelites : i am the lord your god .
you must obey my rules and follow my laws . be sure to follow my rules because i am the lord your god .
you must obey my rules and my laws , because whoever obeys them will live . i am the lord .
“ you must never have sexual relations with your close relatives . i am the lord .
“ you must never have sexual relations with your father or mother . she is your mother , so you must not have sexual relations with her .
“ if your father and his wife have a daughter , she is your sister . you must not have sexual relations with her .
“ you must not have sexual relations with your father ’ s sister . she is your father ’ s close relative .
you must not have sexual relations with your mother ’ s sister . she is your mother ’ s close relative .
“ you must not have sexual relations with your daughter-in-law . she is your son ’ s wife , so you must not have sexual relations with her .
“ you must not have sexual relations with your brother ’ s wife . that would be like having sexual relations with your brother .
“ you must not go near a woman to have sexual relations with her during her monthly time of bleeding . she is unclean during this time .
“ you must not have sexual relations with your neighbor ’ s wife . this will only make you filthy .
“ men , you must not have sexual relations with another man as with a woman . that is a terrible sin !
they made the land filthy . now the land is sick of those things , and it will vomit out the people who live there .
those who lived in the land before you have done all these terrible things . so the land became filthy .
whoever does any of these terrible sins must be separated from their people !
the lord said to moses ,
“ tell all the israelites : i am the lord your god . i am holy , so you must be holy .
“ each of you must honor your mother and father and keep my special days of rest . i am the lord your god !
“ do not worship idols . do not make statues of gods for yourselves . i am the lord your god .
“ when you offer a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to the lord , you must offer it in the right way so that you will be accepted .
you must not eat any of that sacrifice on the third day . it will be unclean , and it will not be accepted .
“ you must not steal . you must not cheat people . you must not lie to each other .
“ you must not cheat or rob your neighbor . you must not hold a hired worker ’ s salary overnight until morning .
forget about the wrong things people do to you . don ’ t try to get even . love your neighbor as yourself . i am the lord .
the man must bring his guilt offering to the lord at the entrance of the meeting tent . he must bring a ram for a guilt offering .
in the fourth year , the fruit from that tree will belong to the lord , a holy offering of praise to him .
“ you must not eat any meat with blood still in it .
you must not cut your body as a way to remember the dead . you must not make any tattoo marks on yourselves . i am the lord .
“ you must not work on my special days of rest . you must honor my holy place . i am the lord .
“ do not go to mediums or wizards for advice—they will only make you unclean . i am the lord your god .
“ show honor to old people . stand up when they come into the room . and show respect to your leaders . i am the lord .
“ do not do bad things to foreigners living in your country .
“ you must be fair when you judge people , and you must be fair when you measure and weigh things .
“ you must remember all my laws and rules . and you must obey them . i am the lord . ”
the lord said to moses ,
maybe the common people will ignore them . maybe they will not kill those who gave their children to molech .
“ be special . make yourselves holy , because i am the lord your god .
remember and obey my laws . i am the lord . and i have made you my special people .
“ whoever curses their father or mother must be put to death . they cursed their father or mother , so they are responsible for their own death !
“ if a man has sexual relations with an animal , both the man and the animal must be put to death .
i have separated you from other nations to be my own special people . so you must be holy because i am the lord , and i am holy .
but a priest must not make himself unclean if the dead person was only one of his slaves .
“ priests must not shave their heads bald . they must not shave off the edges of their beards . they must not make any cuts in their bodies .
“ the high priest must marry a woman who is a virgin .
in this way people will show respect for his children . i , the lord , have separated the high priest for his special work . ”
the lord said to moses ,
“ tell aaron : if any of your descendants have anything wrong with them , they must not carry the special bread to god .
men with broken feet or hands ,
men with bent backs , men who are dwarfs , men who are cross-eyed , men with rashes or bad skin diseases , and men with crushed testicles .
he is from the family of priests , so he can eat the holy bread . he can also eat the very holy bread .
so moses told these things to aaron , aaron ’ s sons , and all the israelites .
the lord god said to moses ,
he will be clean only after the sun goes down . then he can eat the holy food because it is his share .
a priest ’ s daughter might marry a man who is not a priest . if she does that , she can not eat any of the holy offerings .
“ whoever eats some of the holy food by mistake must give the priest the price of that food and add another one-fifth of the price as a fine .
“ the israelites will bring offerings to the lord . these offerings become holy , so the priests must not let them be used in a wrong way .
the lord god said to moses ,
the lord said to moses ,
but you must not kill the animal and its mother on the same day . this rule is the same for cattle and sheep .
you must eat the whole animal that day . you must not leave any of the meat for the next morning . i am the lord .
“ remember my commands , and obey them . i am the lord .
show respect for my holy name . i must be very special to the israelites . i , the lord , have made you my special people .
i brought you out of egypt in order to be your god . i am the lord . ”
the lord said to moses ,
“ tell the israelites : you will announce the lord ’ s chosen festivals as holy meetings . these are my special festivals .
“ these are the lord ’ s chosen festivals . you will announce the holy meetings at the times chosen for them .
the lord ’ s passover is on the 14th day of the first month just before dark .
“ the lord ’ s festival of unleavened bread is on the 15th day of the same month . you will eat unleavened bread for seven days .
on the first day of this festival , you will have a special meeting . you must not do any work on that day .
the lord said to moses ,
“ from that sunday morning ( the day you bring the sheaf to be presented to god ) , count seven weeks .
on the sunday following the seventh week ( that is , 50 days later ) , you will bring a new grain offering to the lord .
you will also offer one male goat for a sin offering and two one-year-old male lambs as a fellowship offering .
on that same day you will call a holy meeting . you must not do any work . this law continues forever in all your homes .
again the lord said to moses ,
you must not do any work . you must bring an offering as a gift to the lord . ”
the lord said to moses ,
“ anyone who refuses to fast on this day must be separated from their people .
if anyone does any work on this day , i will destroy that person from among the people .
you must not do any work at all . this is a law that continues forever for you , wherever you live .
again the lord said to moses ,
“ tell the israelites : on the 15th day of the seventh month is the festival of shelters . this festival to the lord will continue for seven days .
there will be a holy meeting on the first day . you must not do any work .
you will celebrate this festival to the lord for seven days each year . this law will continue forever . you will celebrate this festival in the seventh month .
you will live in temporary shelters for seven days . all the people born in israel will live in them .
so moses told the israelites about all the special meetings to honor the lord .
the lord said to moses ,
“ command the israelites to bring to you pure oil from crushed olives . that oil is for the lamps that must burn without stopping .
aaron must always keep the lamps burning on the lampstand of pure gold before the lord .
“ take fine flour and bake twelve loaves with it . use 16 cups of flour for each loaf .
put them in two rows on the golden table before the lord . six loaves will be in each row .
put pure frankincense on each row . this will help the lord remember the gift .
every sabbath day aaron will put the bread in order before the lord . this must be done forever . this agreement with the israelites will continue forever .
there was a son of an israelite woman and an egyptian father . he was walking among the israelites , and he started fighting in camp .
the people held him as a prisoner and waited for the lord ’ s command to be made clear to them .
then the lord said to moses ,
you must tell the israelites : anyone who curses their god must be punished .
“ and whoever kills another person must be put to death .
whoever kills an animal that belongs to another person must give another animal to take its place .
“ and whoever causes an injury to their neighbor must be given the same kind of injury :
whoever kills an animal must pay for the animal . but whoever kills another person must be put to death .
“ the law will be the same for foreigners and for people from your own country . this is because i am the lord your god . ”
the lord spoke to moses at mount sinai . he said ,
you will plant seed in your field for six years . you will trim your vineyards for six years and bring in its fruits .
and there will be enough food for your cattle and other animals to eat .
that year is jubilee . it will be a holy time for you . you will eat the crops that come from the field .
in the year of jubilee , you will go back to your own property .
“ don ’ t cheat your neighbors when you sell your land to them . don ’ t cheat one another when you buy or sell land .
you must not cheat each other . you must honor your god . i am the lord your god .
“ remember my laws and rules . obey them and you will live safely in your country .
and the land will produce good crops for you . then you will have plenty of food , and you will live safely on the land .
i will order my blessing to come to you during the sixth year . the land will continue growing crops for three years .
“ the land really belongs to me , so you can not sell it permanently . you are only foreigners and travelers living on my land with me .
people might sell their land , but the family will always get their land back .
if someone in your country becomes very poor and must sell their property , a close relative must come and buy it back .
if there is not a close relative to buy back the land , the person might get enough money to buy it back .
“ but about the cities of the levites : the levites can buy back at any time their houses in the cities that belong to them .
also , the fields and pastures around the levite cities can not be sold . they belong to the levites forever .
“ if anyone from your own country becomes too poor to support themselves , you must let them live with you like a visitor .
don ’ t charge them any interest on money you might loan to them . respect your god and let those from your own country live with you .
don ’ t charge them interest on any money you lend them . and don ’ t try to make a profit from the food you sell them .
i am the lord your god . i brought you out of the land of egypt to give the land of canaan to you and to become your god .
“ if anyone from your own country becomes so poor that they must sell themselves to you , don ’ t make them work like slaves .
they will be like hired workers and visitors with you until the year of jubilee .
then they can leave you , take their children , and go back to their family . they can go back to the property of their ancestors ,
because they are my servants . i brought them out of slavery in egypt . they must not become slaves again .
you must not be a cruel master to them . you must respect your god .
“ about your men and women slaves : you may get men and women slaves from the other nations around you .
also , you may get children as slaves if they come from the families of the foreigners living in your land . these child slaves will belong to you .
these people have the right to be bought back and become free . someone from their own country can buy them back .
if only a few years are left until the year of jubilee , the one who was sold must pay a small part of the original price .
but that person will live like a hired worker with the foreigner every year . don ’ t let the foreigner be a cruel master over that person .
this is because the israelites are my servants . they are the servants who i brought out of slavery in egypt . i am the lord your god !
“ remember my special days of rest and honor my holy place . i am the lord .
“ remember my laws and commands , and obey them .
“ you will chase your enemies and defeat them . you will kill them with your swords .
five of you will chase 100 men , and 100 of you will chase 10,000 men . you will defeat your enemies and kill them with your sword .
“ then i will turn to you . i will let you have many children . i will keep my agreement with you .
also , i will place my holy tent among you . i will not turn away from you .
i will walk with you and be your god . and you will be my people .
“ but if you don ’ t obey me and all my commands , bad things will happen to you .
if you refuse to obey my laws and commands , you have broken my agreement .
“ after these things , if you still don ’ t obey me , i will punish you seven times more for your sins .
and i will also destroy the great cities that make you proud . the skies will not give rain , and the earth will not produce crops .
you will work hard , but it will not help . your land will not give any crops , and your trees will not grow their fruit .
“ if you don ’ t learn your lesson after all this , and if you still turn against me ,
then i will also turn against you . i—yes , i myself—will punish you seven times for your sins .
“ if you still refuse to listen to me , and if you still turn against me ,
then i will really show my anger ! i—yes , i myself—will punish you seven times for your sins .
you will become so hungry that you will eat the bodies of your sons and daughters .
i will destroy your cities . i will make your holy places empty . i will stop smelling your offerings .
i will make your land empty . and your enemies who come to live there will be shocked at it .
during the time that the land is empty , it will get the time of rest that you did not give it while you lived there .
they will run as if someone is chasing them with a sword . they will fall over each other—even when no one is chasing them .
you will be lost in other nations . you will disappear in the land of your enemies .
so the survivors will rot away in their sin in their enemies ’ countries . they will rot away in their sins just as their ancestors did .
the lord said to moses ,
“ tell the israelites : you might promise to give someone to the lord as a servant . the priest must set a price for that person .
the price for a man from 20 to 60 years old is 50 shekels of silver . ( you must use the official measure for the silver . )
the price for a woman who is 20 to 60 years old is 30 shekels .
the price for a man from 5 to 20 years old is 20 shekels . for a woman the price is 10 shekels .
the price for a boy from one month to five years old is 5 shekels . for a girl , the price is 3 shekels .
the price for a man who is 60 years old or older is 15 shekels . the price for a woman is 10 shekels .
if you want to buy back the animal , then you must add one-fifth to the price .
but if you want to get the house back , you must add one-fifth to the price . then you will get the house back .
if you give your field to god during the year of jubilee , then its value will be whatever the priest decides .
if you want to buy the field back , you must add one-fifth to that price . then you will get the field back .
if you don ’ t buy the field back and the land is sold to someone else , you can not get the land back .
“ if you dedicate a field to the lord that you had bought , and it is not a part of your family ’ s property ,
then the priest must count the years to the year of jubilee and decide the price for the land . then that land will belong to the lord .
at the year of jubilee , the land will go to the family that originally owned the land .
“ you must use the official measure in paying these prices . the shekel by that measure weighs 20 gerahs .
if this gift is a person , that person can not be bought back . that person must be killed .
“ a tenth of all crops belongs to the lord . this means the crops from fields and the fruit from trees—a tenth belongs to the lord .
so if you want to get back your tenth , you must add one-fifth to its price and then buy it back .
“ the priests will take every tenth animal from a person ’ s cattle or sheep . every tenth animal will belong to the lord .
these are the commands that the lord gave moses at mount sinai for the israelites .
what they have written agrees with what we learned from the people who saw those events from the beginning . they also served god by telling people his message .
i studied it all carefully from the beginning . then i decided to write it down for you in an organized way .
i did this so that you can be sure that what you have been taught is true .
zechariah and elizabeth were both good people who pleased god . they did everything the lord commanded , always following his instructions completely .
but they had no children . elizabeth could not have a baby , and both of them were very old .
zechariah was serving as a priest before god for his group . it was his group ’ s time to serve .
there was a large crowd outside praying at the time the incense was offered .
then , on the right side of the incense table , an angel of the lord came and stood before zechariah .
when he saw the angel , zechariah was upset and very afraid .
you will be very happy , and many others will share your joy over his birth .
“ john will help many people of israel return to the lord their god .
outside , the people were still waiting for zechariah . they were surprised that he was staying so long in the temple .
when his time of service was finished , he went home .
later , zechariah ’ s wife elizabeth became pregnant . so she did not go out of her house for five months . she said ,
“ look what the lord has done for me ! he decided to help me . now people will stop thinking there is something wrong with me . ”
the angel came to her and said , “ greetings ! the lord is with you ; you are very special to him . ”
but mary was very confused about what the angel said . she wondered , “ what does this mean ? ”
the angel said to her , “ don ’ t be afraid , mary , because god is very pleased with you .
listen ! you will become pregnant and have a baby boy . you will name him jesus .
he will be great . people will call him the son of the most high god , and the lord god will make him king like his ancestor david .
he will rule over the people of jacob forever ; his kingdom will never end . ”
mary said to the angel , “ how will this happen ? i am still a virgin . ”
god can do anything ! ”
mary said , “ i am the lord ’ s servant . let this thing you have said happen to me ! ” then the angel went away .
mary got up and went quickly to a town in the hill country of judea .
she went into zechariah ’ s house and greeted elizabeth .
when elizabeth heard mary ’ s greeting , the unborn baby inside her jumped , and she was filled with the holy spirit .
in a loud voice she said to mary , “ god has blessed you more than any other woman . and god has blessed the baby you will have .
you are the mother of my lord , and you have come to me ! why has something so good happened to me ?
when i heard your voice , the baby inside me jumped with joy .
great blessings are yours because you believed what the lord said to you ! you believed this would happen . ”
i am very happy because god is my savior .
i am not important ,
yes , the powerful one has done great things for me .
he reached out his arm and showed his power .
he brought down rulers from their thrones
he filled the hungry with good things ,
god has helped israel—the people he chose to serve him .
he has done what he promised to our ancestors ,
mary stayed with elizabeth for about three months and then went home .
when it was time for elizabeth to give birth , she had a boy .
her neighbors and relatives heard that the lord was very good to her , and they were happy for her .
when the baby was eight days old , they came to circumcise him . they wanted to name him zechariah because this was his father ’ s name .
but his mother said , “ no , he will be named john . ”
the people said to elizabeth , “ but no one in your family has that name . ”
then they made signs to his father , “ what would you like to name him ? ”
zechariah asked for something to write on . then he wrote , “ his name is john. ” everyone was surprised .
then zechariah could talk again , and he began praising god .
and all their neighbors were afraid . in all the hill country of judea , people continued talking about these things .
then zechariah , john ’ s father , was filled with the holy spirit and told the people a message from god :
“ praise to the lord god of israel .
he has given us a powerful savior
this is what he promised
he will save us from our enemies
god said he would show mercy to our fathers ,
this was the promise he made to our father abraham ,
a promise to free us from the power of our enemies ,
in a way that is holy and right for as long as we live .
“ now you , little boy , will be called a prophet of the most high god .
you will make his people understand that they will be saved
“ with the loving mercy of our god ,
it will bring light to those who live in darkness , in the fear of death .
this was the first counting of all the people while quirinius was governor of syria .
everyone traveled to their own hometowns to have their name put on the list .
joseph registered with mary because she was engaged to marry him . ( she was now pregnant . )
while joseph and mary were in bethlehem , the time came for her to have the baby .
that night , some shepherds were out in the fields near bethlehem watching their sheep .
an angel of the lord appeared to them , and the glory of the lord was shining around them . the shepherds were very afraid .
the angel said to them , “ don ’ t be afraid . i have some very good news for you—news that will make everyone happy .
today your savior was born in david ’ s town . he is the messiah , the lord .
this is how you will know him : you will find a baby wrapped in pieces of cloth and lying in a feeding box . ”
then a huge army of angels from heaven joined the first angel , and they were all praising god , saying ,
“ praise god in heaven ,
so they went running and found mary and joseph . and there was the baby , lying in the feeding box .
when they saw the baby , they told what the angels said about this child .
everyone was surprised when they heard what the shepherds told them .
mary continued to think about these things , trying to understand them .
the holy spirit told him that he would not die before he saw the messiah from the lord .
simeon took the baby in his arms and thanked god :
“ now , lord , you can let me , your servant , die in peace as you said .
i have seen with my own eyes how you will save your people .
now all people can see your plan .
he is a light to show your way to the other nations .
jesus ’ father and mother were amazed at what simeon said about him .
so the secret thoughts of many will be made known . and the things that happen will be painful for you—like a sword cutting through your heart . ”
joseph and mary finished doing all the things that the law of the lord commanded . then they went home to nazareth , their own town in galilee .
the little boy jesus was developing into a mature young man , full of wisdom . god was blessing him .
every year jesus ’ parents went to jerusalem for the passover festival .
when jesus was twelve years old , they went to the festival as usual .
when the festival was over , they went home , but jesus stayed in jerusalem . his parents did not know about it .
they traveled for a whole day thinking that jesus was with them in the group . they began looking for him among their family and close friends ,
but they did not find him . so they went back to jerusalem to look for him there .
after three days they found him . jesus was sitting in the temple area with the religious teachers , listening and asking them questions .
everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and wise answers .
but they did not understand the meaning of what he said to them .
jesus went with them to nazareth and obeyed them . his mother was still thinking about all these things .
as jesus grew taller , he continued to grow in wisdom . god was pleased with him and so were the people who knew him .
it was the 15th year of the rule of tiberius caesar . these men were under caesar :
this is like the words written in the book of isaiah the prophet :
every valley will be filled ,
the ax is now ready to cut down the trees . every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire . ”
the people asked john , “ what should we do ? ”
he answered , “ if you have two shirts , share with someone who does not have one . if you have food , share that too . ”
even the tax collectors came to john . they wanted to be baptized . they said to him , “ teacher , what should we do ? ”
he told them , “ don ’ t take more taxes from people than you have been ordered to collect . ”
the soldiers asked him , “ what about us ? what should we do ? ”
everyone was hoping for the messiah to come , and they wondered about john . they thought , “ maybe he is the messiah . ”
john said many other things like this to encourage the people to change , and he told them the good news .
so herod added another bad thing to all his other wrongs : he put john in jail .
when all the people were being baptized , jesus came and was baptized too . and while he was praying , the sky opened ,
when jesus began to teach , he was about 30 years old . people thought that jesus was joseph ’ s son .
eli was the son of matthat .
joseph was the son of mattathias .
naggai was the son of maath .
joda was the son of joanan .
neri was the son of melchi .
er was the son of joshua .
levi was the son of simeon .
eliakim was the son of melea .
david was the son of jesse .
nahshon was the son of amminadab .
judah was the son of jacob .
nahor was the son of serug .
shelah was the son of cainan .
lamech was the son of methuselah .
cainan was the son of enos .
now filled with the holy spirit , jesus returned from the jordan river . and then the spirit led him into the desert .
there the devil tempted jesus for 40 days . jesus ate nothing during this time , and when it was finished , he was very hungry .
the devil said to him , “ if you are the son of god , tell this rock to become bread . ”
jesus answered , “ the scriptures say ,
then the devil took jesus and in a moment of time showed him all the kingdoms of the world .
i will give it all to you , if you will only worship me . ”
jesus answered , “ the scriptures say ,
it is also written ,
jesus answered , “ but the scriptures also say , ‘ you must not test the lord your god . ’ ”
the devil finished tempting jesus in every way and went away to wait until a better time .
jesus went back to galilee with the power of the spirit . stories about him spread all over the area around galilee .
he began to teach in the synagogues , and everyone praised him .
the book of isaiah the prophet was given to him . he opened the book and found the place where this is written :
“ the spirit of the lord is on me .
and to announce that the time has come for the lord to show his kindness . ”
jesus closed the book , gave it back to the helper , and sat down . as everyone in the synagogue watched him closely ,
he began to speak to them . he said , “ while you heard me reading these words just now , they were coming true ! ”
then he said , “ the truth is , a prophet is not accepted in his own hometown .
when the people in the synagogue heard this , they were very angry .
but he walked through the middle of the crowd and went away .
jesus went to capernaum , a city in galilee . on the sabbath day he taught the people .
they were amazed at his teaching because he spoke with authority .
in the synagogue there was a man who had an evil spirit from the devil inside him . the man shouted loudly ,
and so the news about jesus spread to every place in the whole area .
he stood very close to her and ordered the sickness to go away . the sickness left her , and she got up and began serving them .
then jesus told the good news in the synagogues in judea .
as jesus stood beside lake galilee , a crowd of people pushed to get closer to him and to hear the teachings of god .
jesus saw two boats at the shore of the lake . the fishermen were washing their nets .
the fishermen put their nets into the water . their nets were filled with so many fish that they began to break .
james and john , the sons of zebedee , were amazed too . ( james and john worked together with simon . )
the men brought their boats to the shore . they left everything and followed jesus .
jesus said , “ i want to heal you . be healed ! ” then he touched the man , and immediately the leprosy disappeared .
but the news about jesus spread more and more . many people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses .
jesus often went away to other places to be alone so that he could pray .
jesus saw how much faith they had and said to the sick man , “ friend , your sins are forgiven . ”
but jesus knew what they were thinking and said , “ why do you have these questions in your minds ?
the man immediately stood up in front of everyone . he picked up his mat and walked home , praising god .
levi got up , left everything , and followed jesus .
then levi gave a big dinner at his house for jesus . at the table there were many tax collectors and some other people too .
jesus answered them , “ it is the sick people who need a doctor , not those who are healthy .
i have not come to ask good people to change . i have come to ask sinners to change the way they live . ”
but the time will come when the groom will be taken away from them . then his friends will fast . ”
you always put new wine into new wineskins .
no one who drinks old wine wants new wine . they say , ‘ the old wine is just fine . ’ ”
some pharisees said , “ why are you doing that ? it is against the law of moses to do that on the sabbath day . ”
jesus answered , “ you have read about what david did when he and the people with him were hungry .
then jesus said to the pharisees , “ the son of man is lord over the sabbath day . ”
on another sabbath day jesus went into the synagogue and taught the people . a man with a crippled right hand was there .
a few days later , jesus went out to a mountain to pray . he stayed there all night praying to god .
the next morning he called his followers . he chose twelve of them and called them apostles . these are the ones he chose :
simon ( jesus named him peter ) ,
judas , the son of james ,
they all came to hear jesus teach and to be healed of their sicknesses . he healed the people who were troubled by evil spirits .
everyone was trying to touch him , because power was coming out from him . jesus healed them all .
jesus looked at his followers and said ,
great blessings belong to you who are hungry now .
“ but how bad it will be for you rich people ,
how bad it will be for you people who are full now ,
“ how bad it is when everyone says nothing but good about you . just look at the false prophets . their ancestors always said good things about them .
“ but i say to you people who are listening to me , love your enemies . do good to those who hate you .
ask god to bless the people who ask for bad things to happen to you . pray for the people who are mean to you .
give to everyone who asks you for something . when someone takes something that is yours , don ’ t ask for it back .
do for others what you want them to do for you .
“ if you love only those who love you , should you get any special praise for doing that ? no , even sinners love those who love them !
if you do good only to those who do good to you , should you get any special praise for doing that ? no , even sinners do that !
give love and mercy the same as your father gives love and mercy .
jesus told them this story : “ can a blind man lead another blind man ? no . both of them will fall into a ditch .
students are not better than their teacher . but when they have been fully taught , they will be like their teacher .
“ a good tree does not produce bad fruit . and a bad tree does not produce good fruit .
“ why do you call me , ‘ lord , lord , ’ but you don ’ t do what i say ?
the people who come to me , who listen to my teachings and obey them—i will show you what they are like :
jesus finished saying all these things to the people . then he went into capernaum .
in capernaum there was an army officer . he had a servant who was very sick ; he was near death . the officer loved the servant very much .
the men went to jesus . they begged jesus to help the officer . they said , “ this officer is worthy to have your help .
he loves our people and he built the synagogue for us . ”
that is why i did not come to you myself . you need only to give the order , and my servant will be healed .
the group that was sent to jesus went back to the house . there they found that the servant was healed .
the next day jesus and his followers went to a town called nain . a big crowd was traveling with them .
when the lord saw the woman , he felt very sorry for her and said , “ don ’ t cry . ”
then the boy sat up and began to talk , and jesus gave him back to his mother .
this news about jesus spread all over judea and to all the other places around there .
john ’ s followers told him about all these things . john called for two of his followers .
he sent them to the lord to ask , “ are you the one we heard was coming , or should we wait for someone else ? ”
right then jesus healed many people of their sicknesses and diseases . he healed those who had evil spirits and made many who were blind able to see again .
great blessings belong to those who don ’ t have a problem accepting me . ”
so what did you go out to see ? a prophet ? yes , john is a prophet . but i tell you , he is more than that .
this scripture was written about him :
i tell you , no one ever born is greater than john . but even the least important person in god ’ s kingdom is greater than john . ”
but the pharisees and experts in the law refused to accept god ’ s plan for themselves ; they did not let john baptize them . )
“ what shall i say about the people of this time ? what can i compare them to ? what are they like ?
they are like children sitting in the marketplace . one group of children calls to the other children and says ,
john the baptizer came and did not eat the usual food or drink wine . and you say , ‘ he has a demon inside him . ’
but wisdom is shown to be right by those who accept it . ”
one of the pharisees asked jesus to eat with him . jesus went into the pharisee ’ s house and took a place at the table .
in response , jesus said to the pharisee , “ simon , i have something to say to you . ”
simon answered , “ i think it would be the one who owed him the most money . ”
you did not greet me with a kiss , but she has been kissing my feet since i came in .
you did not honor me with oil for my head , but she rubbed my feet with her sweet-smelling oil .
then jesus said to her , “ your sins are forgiven . ”
the people sitting at the table began to think to themselves , “ who does this man think he is ? how can he forgive sins ? ”
jesus said to the woman , “ because you believed , you are saved from your sins . go in peace . ”
a large crowd came together . people came to jesus from every town , and he told them this story :
other seed fell on rock . it began to grow but then died because it had no water .
some other seed fell among thorny weeds . this seed grew , but later the weeds stopped the plants from growing .
the rest of the seed fell on good ground . this seed grew and made 100 times more grain . ”
jesus ’ followers asked him , “ what does this story mean ? ”
“ this is what the story means : the seed is god ’ s teaching .
everything that is hidden will become clear . every secret thing will be made known , and everyone will see it .
jesus ’ mother and brothers came to visit him . but they could not get close to him , because there were so many people .
someone said to jesus , “ your mother and your brothers are standing outside . they want to see you . ”
jesus answered them , “ my mother and my brothers are those who listen to god ’ s teaching and obey it . ”
one day jesus and his followers got into a boat . he said to them , “ come with me across the lake. ” and so they started across .
while they were sailing , jesus slept . a big storm blew across the lake , and the boat began to fill with water . they were in danger .
the followers went to jesus and woke him . they said , “ master ! master ! we will drown ! ”
he said to his followers , “ where is your faith ? ”
jesus and his followers sailed on across the lake . they sailed to the area where the gerasene people live , across from galilee .
jesus asked him , “ what is your name ? ”
the demons begged jesus not to send them into the bottomless pit .
the men who were caring for the pigs ran away and told the story in the fields and in the town .
the men who saw these things happen told the others all about how jesus made the man well .
all those who lived in the area around gerasa asked jesus to go away because they were afraid .
the man he had healed begged to go with him . but jesus sent him away , saying ,
“ go back home and tell people what god did for you . ”
when jesus went back to galilee , the people welcomed him . everyone was waiting for him .
a woman was there who had been bleeding for twelve years . she had spent all her money on doctors , but no doctor was able to heal her .
the woman came behind jesus and touched the bottom of his coat . at that moment , her bleeding stopped .
then jesus said , “ who touched me ? ”
but jesus said , “ someone touched me . i felt power go out from me . ”
jesus said to her , “ my daughter , you are made well because you believed . go in peace . ”
jesus heard this and said to jairus , “ don ’ t be afraid ! just believe and your daughter will be well . ”
jesus went to the house . he let only peter , john , james , and the girl ’ s father and mother go inside with him .
the people laughed at him , because they knew that the girl was dead .
but jesus held her hand and called to her , “ little girl , stand up ! ”
her spirit came back into her , and she stood up immediately . jesus said , “ give her something to eat . ”
the girl ’ s parents were amazed . he told them not to tell anyone about what happened .
jesus called his twelve apostles together . he gave them power to heal sicknesses and power to force demons out of people .
he sent them to tell about god ’ s kingdom and to heal the sick .
when you go into a house , stay there until it is time to leave .
if the people in the town will not welcome you , go outside the town and shake the dust off your feet as a warning to them . ”
so the apostles went out . they traveled through all the towns . they told the good news and healed people everywhere .
herod the ruler heard about all these things that were happening . he was confused because some people said , “ john the baptizer has risen from death . ”
others said , “ elijah has come to us. ” and some others said , “ one of the prophets from long ago has risen from death . ”
but jesus said to the apostles , “ you give them something to eat . ”
( there were about 5000 men there . )
so the followers did this and everyone sat down .
one time jesus was praying alone . his followers came together there , and he asked them , “ who do the people say i am ? ”
then jesus said to his followers , “ and who do you say i am ? ”
jesus warned them not to tell anyone .
any of you who try to save the life you have will lose it . but you who give up your life for me will save it .
it is worth nothing for you to have the whole world if you yourself are destroyed or lost .
believe me when i say that some of you people standing here will see god ’ s kingdom before you die . ”
about eight days after jesus said these things , he took peter , john , and james and went up on a mountain to pray .
while jesus was praying , his face began to change . his clothes became shining white .
then two men were there , talking with him . they were moses and elijah .
they also looked bright and glorious . they were talking with jesus about his death that would happen in jerusalem .
peter and the others were asleep . but they woke up and saw the glory of jesus . they also saw the two men who were standing with him .
while peter was saying these things , a cloud came all around them . peter , john , and james were afraid when the cloud covered them .
a voice came from the cloud and said , “ this is my son . he is the one i have chosen . obey him . ”
the next day , jesus , peter , john , and james came down from the mountain . a large group of people met jesus .
a man in the group shouted to him , “ teacher , please come and look at my son . he is the only child i have .
i begged your followers to make the evil spirit leave my son , but they could not do it . ”
all the people were amazed at the great power of god .
“ don ’ t forget what i will tell you now : the son of man will soon be handed over to the control of other men . ”
jesus ’ followers began to have an argument about which one of them was the greatest .
jesus knew what they were thinking , so he took a little child and stood the child beside him .
jesus said to him , “ don ’ t stop him . whoever is not against you is for you . ”
the time was coming near when jesus would leave and go back to heaven . he decided to go to jerusalem .
he sent some men ahead of him . they went into a town in samaria to make everything ready for him .
but the people there would not welcome jesus because he was going toward jerusalem .
but jesus turned and criticized them for saying this .
then he and his followers went to another town .
they were all traveling along the road . someone said to jesus , “ i will follow you anywhere you go . ”
jesus said to another man , “ follow me ! ”
but jesus said to him , “ let the people who are dead bury their own dead . you must go and tell about god ’ s kingdom . ”
another man said , “ i will follow you , lord , but first let me go and say goodbye to my family . ”
jesus said , “ anyone who begins to plow a field but looks back is not prepared for god ’ s kingdom . ”
“ you can go now . but listen ! i am sending you , and you will be like sheep among wolves .
don ’ t carry any money , a bag , or sandals . don ’ t stop to talk with people on the road .
before you go into a house , say , ‘ peace be with this home . ’
“ if you go into a town and the people welcome you , eat the food they give you .
heal the sick people who live there , and tell them , ‘ god ’ s kingdom is now very near you ! ’
“ but if you go into a town and the people don ’ t welcome you , then go out into the streets of that town and say ,
‘ even the dirt from your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you . but remember that god ’ s kingdom is coming soon . ’
i tell you , on the judgment day it will be worse for the people of that town than for the people of sodom .
but on the judgment day it will be worse for you than for tyre and sidon .
and you , capernaum , will you be lifted up to heaven ? no , you will be thrown down to the place of death !
jesus said to them , “ i saw satan falling like lightning from the sky .
then an expert in the law stood up to test jesus . he said , “ teacher , what must i do to get eternal life ? ”
jesus said to him , “ what is written in the law ? what do you understand from it ? ”
jesus said , “ your answer is right . do this and you will have eternal life . ”
but the man wanted to show that the way he was living was right . so he said to jesus , “ but who is my neighbor ? ”
then jesus said , “ which one of these three men do you think was really a neighbor to the man who was hurt by the robbers ? ”
the teacher of the law answered , “ the one who helped him . ”
while jesus and his followers were traveling , he went into a town , and a woman named martha let him stay at her house .
she had a sister named mary . mary was sitting at jesus ’ feet and listening to him teach .
but the lord answered her , “ martha , martha , you are getting worried and upset about too many things .
only one thing is important . mary has made the right choice , and it will never be taken away from her . ”
jesus said to the followers , “ this is how you should pray :
give us the food we need for each day .
yes , whoever continues to ask will receive . whoever continues to look will find . and whoever continues to knock will have the door opened for them .
do any of you have a son ? what would you do if your son asked you for a fish ? would any father give him a snake ?
or , if he asked for an egg , would you give him a scorpion ? of course not !
but some of the people said , “ he uses the power of satan to force demons out of people . satan is the ruler of demons . ”
some others there wanted to test jesus . they asked him to do a miracle as a sign from god .
so if satan is fighting against himself , how will his kingdom survive ? you say that i use the power of satan to force out demons .
but i use the power of god to force out demons . this shows that god ’ s kingdom has now come to you .
“ when a strong man with many weapons guards his own house , the things in his house are safe .
“ whoever is not with me is against me . and anyone who does not work with me is working against me .
when it comes back , it finds that home all neat and clean .
but jesus said , “ the people who hear the teaching of god and obey it—they are the ones who have god ’ s blessing . ”
so be careful ! don ’ t let the light in you become darkness .
after jesus had finished speaking , a pharisee asked jesus to eat with him . so he went and took a place at the table .
but the pharisee was surprised when he saw that jesus did not wash his hands first before the meal .
you are foolish ! the same one who made what is outside also made what is inside .
so pay attention to what is inside . give to the people who need help . then you will be fully clean .
it will be bad for you , because you are like hidden graves . people walk on them without knowing it . ”
it will be bad for you , because you build tombs for the prophets . but these are the same prophets your ancestors killed !
and now you show all people that you agree with what your ancestors did . they killed the prophets , and you build tombs for the prophets !
“ so you people who live now will be punished for the deaths of all the prophets who were killed since the beginning of the world .
they were trying to find a way to catch jesus saying something wrong .
everything that is hidden will be shown , and everything that is secret will be made known .
“ when birds are sold , five small birds cost only two pennies . but god does not forget any of them .
yes , god even knows how many hairs you have on your head . don ’ t be afraid . you are worth much more than many birds .
“ whoever says something against the son of man can be forgiven . but whoever speaks against the holy spirit will not be forgiven .
“ when men bring you into the synagogues before the leaders and other important men , don ’ t worry about what you will say .
the holy spirit will teach you at that time what you should say . ”
but jesus said to him , “ who said i should be your judge or decide how to divide your father ’ s things between you two ? ”
then jesus said to them , “ be careful and guard against all kinds of greed . people do not get life from the many things they own . ”
then jesus used this story : “ there was a rich man who had some land . his land grew a very good crop of food .
he thought to himself , ‘ what will i do ? i have no place to keep all my crops . ’
“ this is how it will be for anyone who saves things only for himself . to god that person is not rich . ”
life is more important than food , and the body is more important than what you put on it .
none of you can add any time to your life by worrying about it .
and if you can ’ t do the little things , why worry about the big things ?
“ so don ’ t always think about what you will eat or what you will drink . don ’ t worry about it .
that ’ s what all those people who don ’ t know god are always thinking about . but your father knows that you need these things .
what you should be thinking about is god ’ s kingdom . then he will give you all these other things you need .
“ don ’ t fear , little flock . your father wants to share his kingdom with you .
your heart will be where your treasure is .
“ be ready ! be fully dressed and have your lights shining .
“ what would a homeowner do if he knew when a thief was coming ? you know he would not let the thief break in .
so you also must be ready , because the son of man will come at a time when you don ’ t expect him ! ”
peter said , “ lord , did you tell this story for us or for all people ? ”
when the master comes and finds him doing the work he gave him , it will be a day of blessing for that servant !
i can tell you without a doubt , the master will choose that servant to take care of everything he owns .
jesus continued speaking : “ i came to bring fire to the world . i wish it were already burning !
there is a kind of baptism that i must suffer through . i feel very troubled until it is finished .
do you think i came to give peace to the world ? no , i came to divide the world !
from now on , a family of five will be divided , three against two , and two against three .
a father and son will be divided :
when you feel the wind begin to blow from the south , you say , ‘ it will be a hot day. ’ and you are right .
you hypocrites ! you can understand the weather . why don ’ t you understand what is happening now ?
“ why can ’ t you decide for yourselves what is right ?
i tell you , you will not get out of there until you have paid every cent you owe . ”
jesus answered , “ do you think this happened to those people because they were more sinful than all other people from galilee ?
no , they were not . but if you don ’ t decide now to change your lives , you will all be destroyed like those people !
and what about those 18 people who died when the tower of siloam fell on them ? do you think they were more sinful than everyone else in jerusalem ?
they were not . but i tell you if you don ’ t decide now to change your lives , you will all be destroyed too ! ”
maybe the tree will have fruit on it next year . if it still does not produce , then you can cut it down . ’ ”
jesus taught in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day .
when jesus saw her , he called to her , “ woman , you have been made free from your sickness ! ”
he laid his hands on her , and immediately she was able to stand up straight . she began praising god .
the lord answered , “ you people are hypocrites ! all of you untie your work animals and lead them to drink water every day—even on the sabbath day .
when jesus said this , all those who were criticizing him felt ashamed of themselves . and all the people were happy for the wonderful things he was doing .
then jesus said , “ what is god ’ s kingdom like ? what can i compare it to ?
jesus said again , “ what can i compare god ’ s kingdom with ?
it is like yeast that a woman mixes into a big bowl of flour to make bread . the yeast makes all the dough rise . ”
jesus was teaching in every town and village . he continued to travel toward jerusalem .
someone said to him , “ lord , how many people will be saved ? only a few ? ”
then you will say , ‘ we ate and drank with you . you taught in the streets of our town . ’
people will come from the east , west , north , and south . they will sit down at the table in god ’ s kingdom .
just then some pharisees came to jesus and said , “ go away from here and hide . herod wants to kill you ! ”
after that i must go , because all prophets should die in jerusalem .
on a sabbath day , jesus went to the home of a leading pharisee to eat with him . the people there were all watching him very closely .
a man with a bad disease was there in front of him .
jesus said to the pharisees and experts in the law , “ is it right or wrong to heal on the sabbath day ? ”
but they would not answer his question . so he took the man and healed him . then he sent the man away .
the pharisees and teachers of the law could say nothing against what he said .
then jesus noticed that some of the guests were choosing the best places to sit . so he told this story :
“ when someone invites you to a wedding , don ’ t sit in the most important seat . they may have invited someone more important than you .
everyone who makes themselves important will be made humble . but everyone who makes themselves humble will be made important . ”
instead , when you give a feast , invite the poor , the crippled , and the blind .
jesus said to him , “ a man gave a big dinner . he invited many people .
when it was time to eat , he sent his servant to tell the guests , ‘ come . the food is ready . ’
another man said , ‘ i have just bought five pairs of work animals ; i must go and try them out . please excuse me . ’
a third man said , ‘ i just got married ; i can ’ t come . ’
i tell you , not one of those people i invited first will eat any of this food i prepared . ’ ”
many people were traveling with jesus . he said to them ,
whoever will not carry the cross that is given to them when they follow me can not be my follower .
they would say , ‘ this man began to build , but he was not able to finish . ’
“ it is the same for each of you . you must leave everything you have to follow me . if not , you can not be my follower .
“ salt is a good thing . but if the salt loses its salty taste , you can ’ t make it salty again .
it is worth nothing . you can ’ t even use it as dirt or dung . people just throw it away .
many tax collectors and sinners came to listen to jesus .
then the pharisees and the teachers of the law began to complain , “ look , this man welcomes sinners and even eats with them ! ”
then jesus told them this story :
and when you find it , you will be very happy . you will carry it
home , go to your friends and neighbors and say to them , ‘ be happy with me because i found my lost sheep ! ’
in the same way , it ’ s a happy time for the angels of god when one sinner decides to change . ”
then jesus said , “ there was a man who had two sons .
after he spent everything he had , there was a terrible famine throughout the country . he was hungry and needed money .
so he went and got a job with one of the people who lived there . the man sent him into the fields to feed pigs .
he was so hungry that he wanted to eat the food the pigs were eating . but no one gave him anything .
i will leave and go to my father . i will say to him : father , i have sinned against god and have done wrong to you .
i am no longer worthy to be called your son . but let me be like one of your hired workers . ’
so he left and went to his father .
and bring our best calf and kill it so that we can celebrate with plenty to eat .
“ the older son had been out in the field . when he came near the house , he heard the sound of music and dancing .
so he called to one of the servant boys and asked , ‘ what does all this mean ? ’
“ the older son was angry and would not go in to the party . so his father went out and begged him to come in .
but then this son of yours comes home after wasting your money on prostitutes , and you kill the best calf for him ! ’
“ his father said to him , ‘ oh , my son , you are always with me , and everything i have is yours .
whoever can be trusted with small things can also be trusted with big things . whoever is dishonest in little things will be dishonest in big things too .
if you can not be trusted with worldly riches , you will not be trusted with the true riches .
and if you can not be trusted with the things that belong to someone else , you will not be given anything of your own .
the pharisees were listening to all these things . they criticized jesus because they all loved money .
but even the smallest part of a letter in the law can not be changed . it would be easier for heaven and earth to pass away .
there was also a very poor man named lazarus . lazarus ’ body was covered with sores . he was often put by the rich man ’ s gate .
lazarus wanted only to eat the scraps of food left on the floor under the rich man ’ s table . and the dogs came and licked his sores .
“ later , lazarus died . the angels took him and placed him in the arms of abraham . the rich man also died and was buried .
he was sent to the place of death and was in great pain . he saw abraham far away with lazarus in his arms .
“ the rich man said , ‘ then please , father abraham , send lazarus to my father ’ s house on earth .
i have five brothers . he could warn my brothers so that they will not come to this place of pain . ’
“ but abraham said , ‘ they have the law of moses and the writings of the prophets to read ; let them learn from that . ’
jesus said to his followers , “ things will surely happen that will make people sin . but it will be very bad for anyone who makes this happen .
even if they do something wrong to you seven times in one day , but they say they are sorry each time , you should forgive them . ”
the apostles said to the lord , “ give us more faith ! ”
the servant should not get any special thanks for doing his job . he is only doing what his master told him to do .
jesus was traveling to jerusalem . he went from galilee to samaria .
he came into a small town , and ten men met him there . they did not come close to him , because they all had leprosy .
but the men shouted , “ jesus ! master ! please help us ! ”
when jesus saw the men , he said , “ go and show yourselves to the priests . ”
when one of them saw that he was healed , he went back to jesus . he praised god loudly .
he bowed down at jesus ’ feet and thanked him . ( he was a samaritan . )
jesus said , “ ten men were healed ; where are the other nine ?
this man is not even one of our people . is he the only one who came back to give praise to god ? ”
then jesus said to the man , “ stand up ! you can go . you were healed because you believed . ”
some of the pharisees asked jesus , “ when will god ’ s kingdom come ? ”
“ when the son of man comes again , you will know it . on that day he will shine like lightning flashes across the sky .
but first , the son of man must suffer many things . the people of today will refuse to accept him .
“ when the son of man comes again , it will be the same as it was when noah lived .
people were eating , drinking , and getting married even on the day when noah entered the boat . then the flood came and killed them all .
they were doing these things even on the day when lot left town . then fire and sulfur rained down from the sky and killed them all .
this is exactly how it will be when the son of man comes again .
remember what happened to lot ’ s wife !
“ whoever tries to keep the life they have will lose it . but whoever gives up their life will save it .
that night there may be two people sleeping in one room . one will be taken and the other will be left .
there may be two women working together . one will be taken and the other will be left . ”
the followers asked jesus , “ where will this be , lord ? ”
then jesus taught the followers that they should always pray and never lose hope . he used this story to teach them :
“ once there was a judge in a town . he did not care about god . he also did not care what people thought about him .
the lord said , “ listen , there is meaning in what the bad judge said .
god ’ s people shout to him night and day , and he will always give them what is right . he will not be slow to answer them .
there were some people who thought they were very good and looked down on everyone else . jesus used this story to teach them :
“ one time there was a pharisee and a tax collector . one day they both went to the temple to pray .
i fast twice a week , and i give a tenth of everything i get ! ’
the truth is , you must accept god ’ s kingdom like a little child accepts things , or you will never enter it . ”
a religious leader asked jesus , “ good teacher , what must i do to get eternal life ? ”
jesus said to him , “ why do you call me good ? only god is good .
but the leader said , “ i have obeyed all these commands since i was a boy . ”
when jesus saw that the man was sad , he said , “ it will be very hard for rich people to enter god ’ s kingdom .
it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter god ’ s kingdom . ”
when the people heard this , they said , “ then who can be saved ? ”
jesus answered , “ god can do things that are not possible for people to do . ”
peter said , “ look , we left everything we had and followed you . ”
jesus said , “ i can promise that everyone who has left their home , wife , brothers , parents , or children for god ’ s kingdom
he will be handed over to the foreigners , who will laugh at him , insult him , and spit on him .
they will beat him with whips and then kill him . but on the third day after his death , he will rise to life again . ”
the apostles tried to understand this , but they could not ; the meaning was hidden from them .
jesus came near the city of jericho . there was a blind man sitting beside the road . he was begging people for money .
when he heard the people coming down the road , he asked , “ what is happening ? ”
they told him , “ jesus , the one from nazareth , is coming here . ”
the blind man was excited and said , “ jesus , son of david , please help me ! ”
jesus stopped there and said , “ bring that man to me ! ” when he came close , jesus asked him ,
“ what do you want me to do for you ? ”
jesus said to him , “ you can see now . you are healed because you believed . ”
then the man was able to see . he followed jesus , thanking god . everyone who saw this praised god for what happened .
jesus was going through the city of jericho .
in jericho there was a man named zacchaeus . he was a wealthy , very important tax collector .
he wanted to see who jesus was . there were many others who wanted to see jesus too . zacchaeus was too short to see above the people .
so he ran to a place where he knew jesus would come . then he climbed a sycamore tree so he could see him .
zacchaeus hurried and came down . he was happy to have jesus in his house .
everyone saw this . they began to complain , “ look at the kind of man jesus is staying with . zacchaeus is a sinner ! ”
the son of man came to find lost people and save them . ”
the first servant came and said , ‘ sir , i earned ten bags of money with the one bag you gave me . ’
“ the second servant said , ‘ sir , with your one bag of money i earned five bags . ’
the king said to this servant , ‘ you can rule over five cities . ’
“ the men said to the king , ‘ but sir , that servant already has ten bags of money . ’
after jesus said these things , he continued traveling toward jerusalem .
he came near bethphage and bethany , towns near the hill called the mount of olives . he sent out two of his followers .
if anyone asks you why you are taking the donkey , you should say , ‘ the master needs it . ’ ”
the two followers went into town . they found the donkey exactly like jesus told them .
they untied it , but its owners came out . they said to the followers , “ why are you untying our donkey ? ”
the followers answered , “ the master needs it . ”
so the followers brought the donkey to jesus . they put their coats on its back . then they put jesus on the donkey .
he rode along the road toward jerusalem . the followers spread their coats on the road before him .
some of the pharisees said to jesus , “ teacher , tell your followers not to say these things . ”
but jesus answered , “ i tell you , if my followers didn ’ t say them , these stones would shout them . ”
jesus came near jerusalem . looking at the city , he began to cry for it
and said , “ i wish you knew today what would bring you peace . but it is hidden from you now .
a time is coming when your enemies will build a wall around you and hold you in on all sides .
jesus went into the temple area . he began to throw out the people who were selling things there .
but they did not know how they could do it , because everyone was listening to him . the people were very interested in what jesus said .
they said , “ tell us what authority you have to do these things . who gave you this authority ? ”
jesus answered , “ i will ask you a question too . tell me :
when john baptized people , did his authority come from god or was it only from other people ? ”
so they answered , “ we don ’ t know the answer . ”
so jesus said to them , “ then i will not tell you who gave me the authority to do these things . ”
so the man sent another servant . they beat this servant too and showed no respect for him . they sent the servant away with nothing .
so the man sent a third servant to the farmers . they hurt this servant badly and threw him out .
so the farmers threw the son out of the vineyard and killed him .
he will come and kill those farmers . then he will lease the land to some other farmers . ”
but jesus looked into their eyes and said , “ then what does this verse mean :
everyone who falls on that stone will be broken . if that stone falls on you , it will crush you ! ”
tell us , is it right for us to pay taxes to caesar or not ? ”
but jesus knew that these men were trying to trick him . he said to them ,
“ show me a silver coin . whose name and picture are on it ? ”
he said to them , “ then give to caesar what belongs to caesar , and give to god what belongs to god . ”
some sadducees came to jesus . ( sadducees believe that people will not rise from death . ) they asked him ,
one time there were seven brothers . the first brother married a woman but died . he had no children .
then the second brother married the woman , and he died .
and the third brother married the woman , and he died . the same thing happened with all the other brothers . they all died and had no children .
the woman was the last to die .
but all seven brothers married her . so when people rise from death , whose wife will this woman be ? ”
jesus said to the sadducees , “ on earth , people marry each other .
some people will be worthy to be raised from death and live again after this life . in that life they will not marry .
in that life people are like angels and can not die . they are children of god , because they have been raised from death .
so they were not still dead , because he is the god only of living people . yes , to god they are all still living . ”
some of the teachers of the law said , “ teacher , your answer was very good . ”
no one was brave enough to ask him another question .
then jesus said , “ why do people say that the messiah is the son of david ?
in the book of psalms , david himself says ,
and i will put your enemies under your power . ’
david calls the messiah ‘ lord. ’ so how can the messiah also be david ’ s son ? ”
while all the people were listening to jesus , he said to his followers ,
but they cheat widows and take their homes . then they try to make themselves look good by saying long prayers . god will punish them very much . ”
jesus looked up and saw some rich people putting their gifts to god into the temple collection box .
then he saw a poor widow put two small copper coins into the box .
he said , “ this poor widow gave only two small coins . but the truth is , she gave more than all those rich people .
some followers asked jesus , “ teacher , when will these things happen ? what will show us that it is time for these things to happen ? ”
when you hear about wars and riots , don ’ t be afraid . these things must happen first . then the end will come later . ”
then jesus said to them , “ nations will fight against other nations . kingdoms will fight against other kingdoms .
but this will give you an opportunity to tell about me .
decide now not to worry about what you will say .
i will give you the wisdom to say things that none of your enemies can answer .
even your parents , brothers , relatives , and friends will turn against you . they will have some of you killed .
everyone will hate you because you follow me .
but none of these things can really harm you .
you will save yourselves by continuing strong in your faith through all these things .
“ you will see armies all around jerusalem . then you will know that the time for its destruction has come .
the prophets wrote many things about the time when god will punish his people . the time i am talking about is when all these things must happen .
they will be afraid and worried about what will happen to the world . everything in the sky will be changed .
then people will see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
when these things begin to happen , stand up tall and don ’ t be afraid . know that it is almost time for god to free you ! ”
then jesus told this story : “ look at all the trees . the fig tree is a good example .
when it turns green , you know that summer is very near .
in the same way , when you see all these things happening , you will know that god ’ s kingdom is very near .
“ i assure you that all these things will happen while some of the people of this time are still living .
the whole world , earth and sky , will be destroyed , but my words will last forever .
it will come as a surprise to everyone on earth .
during the day jesus taught the people in the temple area . at night he went out of the city and stayed all night on the mount of olives .
every morning all the people got up early to go listen to jesus at the temple .
it was almost time for the jewish festival of unleavened bread , called the passover .
one of jesus ’ twelve apostles was named judas iscariot . satan entered him ,
the priests were very happy about this . they promised to give judas money for doing this .
the day of unleavened bread came . this was the day when the jews always killed the lambs for the passover .
jesus said to peter and john , “ go and prepare the passover meal for us to eat . ”
they said to him , “ where do you want us to prepare the meal ? ”
“ when you go into the city , you will see a man carrying a jar of water . follow him . he will go into a house .
tell the owner of the house , ‘ the teacher asks that you please show us the room where he and his followers can eat the passover meal . ’
then the owner will show you a large room upstairs that is ready for us . prepare the meal there . ”
so peter and john left . everything happened the way jesus said . so they prepared the passover meal .
the time came for them to eat the passover meal . jesus and the apostles were together at the table .
jesus said to them , “ i wanted very much to eat this passover meal with you before i die .
i will never eat another passover meal until it is given its full meaning in god ’ s kingdom . ”
then jesus took a cup of wine . he gave thanks to god for it and said , “ take this cup and give it to everyone here .
i will never drink wine again until god ’ s kingdom comes . ”
jesus said , “ but here on this table is the hand of the one who will hand me over to my enemies .
then the apostles asked each other , “ which one of us would do that ? ”
later , the apostles began to argue about which one of them was the most important .
“ you men have stayed with me through many struggles .
so i give you authority to rule with me in the kingdom the father has given me .
you will eat and drink at my table in that kingdom . you will sit on thrones and judge the twelve tribes of israel .
“ satan has asked to test you men like a farmer tests his wheat . o simon , simon ,
i have prayed that you will not lose your faith ! help your brothers be stronger when you come back to me . ”
but peter said to jesus , “ lord , i am ready to go to jail with you . i will even die with you ! ”
then jesus said to the apostles , “ remember when i sent you out without money , a bag , or sandals ? did you need anything ? ”
the followers said , “ look , lord , here are two swords . ”
then jesus went about 50 steps away from them . he knelt down and prayed ,
then an angel from heaven came to help him .
jesus was full of pain ; he struggled hard in prayer . sweat dripped from his face like drops of blood falling to the ground .
when he finished praying , he went to his followers . he found them asleep , worn out from their grieving .
jesus said to them , “ why are you sleeping ? get up and pray for strength against temptation . ”
but jesus said to him , “ judas , are you using the kiss of friendship to hand over the son of man to his enemies ? ”
the followers of jesus were standing there too . they saw what was happening and said to jesus , “ lord , should we use our swords ? ”
and one of them did use his sword . he cut off the right ear of the servant of the high priest .
jesus said , “ stop ! ” then he touched the servant ’ s ear and healed him .
they arrested jesus and took him away to the house of the high priest . peter followed jesus but stayed back at a distance .
the soldiers started a fire in the middle of the yard and sat together . peter sat with them .
but peter said this was not true . he said , “ lady , i don ’ t know him . ”
a short time later , someone else saw peter and said , “ you are also one of them . ”
but peter said , “ man , i don ’ t know what you are talking about ! ”
then peter went outside and cried bitterly .
the men guarding jesus made fun of him and beat him .
and they shouted all kinds of insults at him .
they said , “ if you are the messiah , then tell us that you are . ”
and if i ask you , you will not answer .
but beginning now , the son of man will sit at the right side of god all-powerful . ”
they all said , “ then are you the son of god ? ” jesus said to them , “ you are right in saying that i am . ”
they said , “ why do we need witnesses now ? we all heard what he said ! ”
then the whole group stood up and led jesus away to pilate .
pilate asked jesus , “ are you the king of the jews ? ”
pilate said to the leading priests and the people , “ i find nothing wrong with this man . ”
but they kept on saying , “ his teaching is causing trouble all over judea . he began in galilee , and now he is here ! ”
pilate heard this and asked if jesus was from galilee .
he learned that jesus was under herod ’ s authority . herod was in jerusalem at that time , so pilate sent jesus to him .
he asked him many questions , but jesus said nothing .
the leading priests and teachers of the law were standing there shouting things against jesus .
in the past pilate and herod had always been enemies . but on that day they became friends .
pilate called all the people together with the leading priests and the jewish leaders .
herod didn ’ t find him guilty either . he sent him back to us . look , he has done nothing bad enough for the death penalty .
so , after i punish him a little , i will let him go free . ”
but they all shouted , “ kill him ! let barabbas go free ! ”
( barabbas was a man who was in jail for starting a riot in the city and for murder . )
pilate wanted to let jesus go free . so again pilate told them that he would let him go .
but they shouted again , “ kill him ! kill him on a cross ! ”
but the people continued to shout . they demanded that jesus be killed on a cross . their shouting got so loud that
pilate decided to give them what they wanted .
a large crowd followed jesus . some of the women were sad and crying . they felt sorry for him .
but jesus turned and said to the women , “ women of jerusalem , don ’ t cry for me . cry for yourselves and for your children too .
then the people will say to the mountains , ‘ fall on us ! ’ they will say to the hills , ‘ cover us ! ’
if this can happen to someone who is good , what will happen to those who are guilty ? ”
there were also two criminals led out with jesus to be killed .
jesus said , “ father , forgive them . they don ’ t know what they are doing . ”
even the soldiers laughed at jesus and made fun of him . they came and offered him some sour wine .
they said , “ if you are the king of the jews , save yourself ! ”
( at the top of the cross these words were written : “ this is the king of the jews . ” )
but the other criminal stopped him . he said , “ you should fear god . all of us will die soon .
you and i are guilty . we deserve to die because we did wrong . but this man has done nothing wrong . ”
then he said , “ jesus , remember me when you begin ruling as king ! ”
then jesus said to him , “ i promise you , today you will be with me in paradise . ”
it was about noon , but it turned dark throughout the land until three o ’ clock in the afternoon ,
because the sun stopped shining . the curtain in the temple was torn into two pieces .
jesus shouted , “ father , i put my life in your hands ! ” after jesus said this , he died .
the army officer there saw what happened . he praised god , saying , “ i know this man was a good man ! ”
many people had come out of the city to see all this . when they saw it , they felt very sorry and left .
he went to pilate and asked for the body of jesus .
it was late on preparation day . when the sun went down , the sabbath day would begin .
the women who had come from galilee with jesus followed joseph . they saw the tomb . inside they saw where he put jesus ’ body .
then they left to prepare some sweet-smelling spices to put on the body .
very early sunday morning , the women came to the tomb where jesus ’ body was laid . they brought the sweet-smelling spices they had prepared .
they saw that the heavy stone that covered the entrance had been rolled away .
they went in , but they did not find the body of the lord jesus .
they did not understand this . while they were wondering about it , two men in shining clothes stood beside them .
jesus is not here . he has risen from death . do you remember what he said in galilee ?
then the women remembered what jesus had said .
the women left the tomb and went to the eleven apostles and the other followers . they told them everything that happened at the tomb .
these women were mary magdalene , joanna , mary , the mother of james , and some others . they told the apostles everything that happened .
but the apostles did not believe what they said . it sounded like nonsense .
that same day two of jesus ’ followers were going to a town named emmaus . it is about seven miles from jerusalem .
they were talking about everything that had happened .
while they were talking , discussing these things , jesus himself came near and walked with them .
( but the two men were not allowed to recognize jesus . )
he asked them , “ what ’ s this i hear you discussing with each other as you walk ? ”
the one named cleopas said , “ you must be the only person in jerusalem who doesn ’ t know what has just happened there . ”
jesus said , “ what are you talking about ? ”
but our leaders and the leading priests handed him over to be judged and killed . they nailed him to a cross .
we were hoping that he would be the one to free israel . but then all this happened .
but today some of our women told us an amazing thing . early this morning they went to the tomb where the body of jesus was laid .
then jesus said to the two men , “ you are foolish and slow to realize what is true . you should believe everything the prophets said .
the prophets said the messiah must suffer these things before he begins his time of glory . ”
they came near the town of emmaus , and jesus acted as if he did not plan to stop there .
joining them at the supper table , jesus took some bread and gave thanks . then he broke some off and gave it to them .
just then the men were allowed to recognize him . but when they saw who he was , he disappeared .
said , “ the lord really has risen from death ! he appeared to simon . ”
then the two men told what had happened on the road . they talked about how they recognized jesus when he shared the bread with them .
this surprised the followers . they were afraid . they thought they were seeing a ghost .
but jesus said , “ why are you troubled ? why do you doubt what you see ?
after jesus told them this , he showed them his hands and his feet .
they gave him a piece of cooked fish .
while the followers watched , he took the fish and ate it .
then jesus helped the followers understand these scriptures about him .
jesus said to them , “ it is written that the messiah would be killed and rise from death on the third day .
remember that i will send you the one my father promised . stay in the city until you are given that power from heaven . ”
jesus led his followers out of jerusalem almost to bethany . he raised his hands and blessed his followers .
while he was blessing them , he was separated from them and carried into heaven .
they worshiped him and went back to jerusalem very happy .
they stayed at the temple all the time , praising god .
this is a message from the lord to israel . god used malachi to tell this message to the people .
the lord said , “ i love you people . ”
and i did not accept esau . i destroyed his hill country . his country was destroyed , and now only wild dogs live there . ”
the people of edom might say , “ we were destroyed , but we will go back and rebuild our cities . ”
you people saw these things , and you said , “ the lord is great , even outside of israel ! ”
“ you bring unclean bread to my altar .
“ priests , this rule is for you .
the lord will remove them from judah ’ s family . they might bring gifts to the lord all-powerful—but it will not help .
then the lord will accept the gifts from judah and jerusalem . it will be as it was in the past—as the time long ago .
“ i am the lord , and i don ’ t change . you are jacob ’ s children , and you have not been completely destroyed .
“ people should not steal things from god , but you stole things from me .
in this way your whole nation has stolen things from me , so bad things are happening to you . ”
i will not let pests destroy your crops . all your grapevines will produce grapes. ” this is what the lord all-powerful said .
“ people from other nations will be good to you . you will have a wonderful country. ” this is what the lord all-powerful said .
the lord says , “ you said cruel things to me . ”
we think proud people are happy . evil people succeed . they do evil things to test god ’ s patience , and god does not punish them . ”
“ look , i will send elijah the prophet to you . he will come before that great and terrible time of judgment from the lord .
the good news about jesus the messiah , the son of god , begins
with what the prophet isaiah said would happen . he wrote :
“ there is someone shouting in the desert :
john wore clothes made from camel ’ s hair and a leather belt around his waist . he ate locusts and wild honey .
i baptize you with water , but the one who is coming will baptize you with the holy spirit . ”
about that time jesus came from the town of nazareth in galilee to the place where john was . john baptized jesus in the jordan river .
as jesus was coming up out of the water , he saw the sky torn open . the spirit came down on him like a dove .
a voice came from heaven and said , “ you are my son , the one i love . i am very pleased with you . ”
then the spirit sent jesus into the desert alone .
he was there for 40 days , being tempted by satan . during this time he was out among the wild animals . then angels came and helped him .
after john was put in prison , jesus went into galilee and told people the good news from god .
so they immediately left their nets and followed jesus .
jesus and his followers went to capernaum . on the sabbath day , jesus went into the synagogue and taught the people .
they were amazed at his teaching . he did not teach like their teachers of the law . he taught like someone with authority .
while jesus was in the synagogue , a man was there who had an evil spirit inside him . the man shouted ,
“ jesus of nazareth ! what do you want with us ? did you come to destroy us ? i know who you are—god ’ s holy one ! ”
jesus , his voice full of warning , said , “ be quiet , and come out of him ! ”
the evil spirit made the man shake . then the spirit made a loud noise and came out of him .
so the news about jesus spread quickly everywhere in the area of galilee .
jesus and the followers left the synagogue . they all went with james and john to the home of simon and andrew .
simon ’ s mother-in-law was very sick . she was in bed and had a fever . the people there told jesus about her .
that night , after the sun went down , the people brought to jesus many who were sick . they also brought those who had demons inside them .
everyone in the town gathered at the door of that house .
later , simon and his friends went to look for jesus .
they found him and said , “ everyone is looking for you ! ”
so jesus traveled everywhere in galilee . he spoke in the synagogues , and he forced demons out of people .
these last words made jesus angry . but he touched him and said , “ i want to heal you . be healed ! ”
immediately the leprosy disappeared , and the man was healed .
jesus told the man to go , but he gave him a strong warning :
a few days later , jesus came back to capernaum . the news spread that he was back home .
some people brought a paralyzed man to see him . he was being carried by four of them .
when jesus saw how much faith they had , he said to the paralyzed man , “ young man , your sins are forgiven . ”
some of the teachers of the law were sitting there . they saw what jesus did , and they said to themselves ,
“ why does this man say things like that ? what an insult to god ! no one but god can forgive sins . ”
jesus knew immediately what these teachers of the law were thinking . so he said to them , “ why do you have these questions in your minds ?
“ i tell you , stand up . take your mat and go home . ”
jesus went to the lake again , and many people followed him there . so jesus taught them .
but the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them . then they will fast .
on the sabbath day , jesus and his followers were walking through some grain fields . the followers picked some grain to eat .
some pharisees said to jesus , “ why are your followers doing this ? it is against the law to pick grain on the sabbath . ”
jesus answered , “ you have read what david did when he and the people with him were hungry and needed food .
then jesus said to the pharisees , “ the sabbath day was made to help people . people were not made to be ruled by the sabbath .
so the son of man is lord of every day , even the sabbath . ”
another time jesus went into the synagogue . in the synagogue there was a man with a crippled hand .
jesus said to the man with the crippled hand , “ stand up here so that everyone can see you . ”
then the pharisees left and made plans with the herodians about a way to kill jesus .
jesus went away with his followers to the lake . a large crowd of people from galilee followed them .
he had healed many of them , so all the sick people were pushing toward him to touch him .
but jesus gave the spirits a strong warning not to tell anyone who he was .
then jesus went up on a hill and invited those he wanted to go with him . so they joined him there .
he also wanted them to have the power to force demons out of people .
these are the names of the twelve men jesus chose :
james and his brother john , the sons of zebedee ( the ones jesus named boanerges , which means “ sons of thunder ” ) ,
judas iscariot ( the one who handed jesus over to his enemies ) .
then jesus went home , but again a large crowd gathered there . there were so many people that he and his followers could not eat .
his family heard about all these things . they went to get him because people said he was crazy .
so jesus called them together and talked to them using some stories . he said , “ satan will not force his own demons out of people .
a kingdom that fights against itself will not survive .
and a family that is divided will not survive .
if satan is against himself and is fighting against his own people , he will not survive . that would be the end of satan .
but anyone who speaks against the holy spirit will never be forgiven . they will always be guilty of that sin . ”
jesus said this because the teachers of the law had accused him of having an evil spirit inside him .
then jesus ’ mother and brothers came . they stood outside and sent someone in to tell him to come out .
many people were sitting around jesus . they said to him , “ your mother , your brothers , and your sisters are waiting for you outside . ”
jesus asked , “ who is my mother ? who are my brothers ? ”
then he looked at the people sitting around him and said , “ these people are my mother and my brothers !
my true brother and sister and mother are those who do what god wants . ”
jesus used stories to teach them many things . one of his lessons included this story :
“ listen ! a farmer went out to sow seed .
while he was scattering the seed , some of it fell by the road . the birds came and ate all that seed .
other seed fell on rocky ground , where there was not enough dirt . it grew quickly there because the soil was not deep .
but then the sun rose and the plants were burned . they died because they did not have deep roots .
some other seed fell among thorny weeds . the weeds grew and stopped the good plants from growing . so they did not make grain .
then jesus said , “ you people who hear me , listen ! ”
later , jesus was away from the people . the twelve apostles and his other followers asked him about the stories .
jesus said , “ only you can know the secret truth about god ’ s kingdom . but to those other people i tell everything by using stories .
i do this so that
then jesus said to the followers , “ do you understand this story ? if you don ’ t , how will you understand any story ?
the farmer is like someone who plants god ’ s teaching in people .
“ other people are like the seed planted on rocky ground . they hear the teaching , and they quickly and gladly accept it .
“ others are like the seed planted among the thorny weeds . they hear the teaching ,
everything that is hidden will be made clear . every secret thing will be made known .
you people who hear me , listen !
the people who have some understanding will receive more . but those who do not have much will lose even the small amount they have . ”
then jesus said , “ god ’ s kingdom is like a man who plants seed in the ground .
without any help the ground produces grain . first the plant grows , then the head , and then all the grain in the head .
when the grain is ready , the man cuts it . this is the harvest time . ”
then jesus said , “ what can i use to show you what god ’ s kingdom is like ? what story can i use to explain it ?
god ’ s kingdom is like a mustard seed , which is smaller than any other seed on earth that you can plant .
jesus used many stories like these to teach the people . he taught them all they could understand .
he always used stories to teach them . but when he was alone with his followers , jesus explained everything to them .
that day , at evening , jesus said to his followers , “ come with me across the lake . ”
so they left the crowd behind and went with jesus in the boat he was already in . there were also other boats that went with them .
a very bad wind came up on the lake . the waves were coming over the sides and into the boat , and it was almost full of water .
he said to his followers , “ why are you afraid ? do you still have no faith ? ”
they were very afraid and asked each other , “ what kind of man is this ? even the wind and the water obey him ! ”
jesus and his followers went across the lake to the area where the gerasene people lived .
he lived in the burial caves . no one could keep him tied up , even with chains .
many times people had put chains on his hands and feet , but he broke the chains . no one was strong enough to control him .
day and night he stayed around the burial caves and on the hills . he would scream and cut himself with rocks .
while jesus was still far away , the man saw him . he ran to jesus and bowed down before him .
then jesus asked the man , “ what is your name ? ”
the spirits inside the man begged jesus again and again not to send them out of that area .
a large herd of pigs was eating on a hill near there .
the evil spirits begged jesus , “ send us to the pigs . let us go into them . ”
then the people began to beg jesus to leave their area .
jesus was preparing to leave in the boat . the man who was now free from the demons begged to go with him .
so the man left and told the people in the ten towns about the great things jesus did for him . everyone was amazed .
jesus went back to the other side of the lake in the boat . there , a large crowd of people gathered around him on the shore .
a leader of the synagogue came . his name was jairus . he saw jesus and bowed down before him .
so jesus went with jairus . many people followed jesus . they were pushing very close around him .
there among the people was a woman who had been bleeding for the past twelve years .
the woman heard about jesus , so she followed him with the other people and touched his coat .
she thought , “ if i can just touch his clothes , that will be enough to heal me . ”
as soon as she touched his coat , her bleeding stopped . she felt that her body was healed from all the suffering .
jesus immediately felt power go out from him , so he stopped and turned around . “ who touched my clothes ? ” he asked .
the followers said to jesus , “ there are so many people pushing against you . but you ask , ‘ who touched me ? ’ ”
but jesus continued looking for the one who touched him .
he said to her , “ dear woman , you are made well because you believed . go in peace . you will not suffer anymore . ”
but jesus did not care what the men said . he said to the synagogue leader , “ don ’ t be afraid ; just believe . ”
jesus let only peter , james , and john the brother of james go with him .
they went to the synagogue leader ’ s house , where jesus saw many people crying loudly . there was a lot of confusion .
but everyone laughed at him .
the girl immediately stood up and began walking . ( she was twelve years old . ) the father and mother and the followers were amazed .
jesus gave the father and mother very strict orders not to tell people about this . then he told them to give the girl some food to eat .
jesus left and went back to his hometown . his followers went with him .
jesus was not able to do any miracles there except the healing of some sick people by laying his hands on them .
he was surprised that the people there had no faith . then he went to other villages in that area and taught .
jesus called his twelve apostles together . he sent them out in groups of two and gave them power over evil spirits .
this is what he told them : “ take nothing for your trip except a stick for walking . take no bread , no bag , and no money .
you can wear sandals , but don ’ t take extra clothes .
when you enter a house , stay there until you leave that town .
the apostles left and went to other places . they talked to the people and told them to change their hearts and lives .
they forced many demons out of people and put olive oil on many who were sick and healed them .
other people said , “ he is elijah . ”
herod heard these things about jesus . he said , “ i killed john by cutting off his head . now he has been raised from death ! ”
john told herod , “ it is not right for you to be married to your brother ’ s wife . ”
so herodias hated john . she wanted him dead , but she was not able to persuade herod to kill him .
the daughter of herodias came to the party and danced . when she danced , herod and the people eating with him were very pleased .
he promised her , “ anything you ask for i will give to you—even half of my kingdom . ”
the girl went to her mother and asked , “ what should i ask king herod to give me ? ”
king herod was very sad , but he didn ’ t want to break the promise he had made to her in front of his guests .
he brought the head back on a plate and gave it to the girl , and the girl gave it to her mother .
john ’ s followers heard about what happened , so they came and got john ’ s body and put it in a tomb .
the apostles jesus had sent out came back to him . they gathered around him and told him about all they had done and taught .
so jesus and his followers went away alone . they went in a boat to a place where no one lived .
so send the people away . they need to go to the farms and towns around here to buy some food to eat . ”
but jesus answered , “ you give them some food to eat . ”
jesus asked them , “ how many loaves of bread do you have now ? go and see . ”
then jesus said to them , “ tell everyone to sit in groups on the green grass . ”
so all the people sat in groups . there were about 50 or 100 people in each group .
they all ate until they were full .
after they finished eating , the followers filled twelve baskets with the pieces of bread and fish that were left .
there were about 5000 men there who ate .
after he said goodbye to them , he went up into the hills to pray .
that night , the boat was still in the middle of the lake . jesus was alone on the land .
but the followers saw jesus walking on the water . they thought he was a ghost , and they started screaming .
when he got into the boat with the followers , the wind stopped . the followers were completely amazed .
they could not believe what happened . it was like the miracle he did with the bread . they still didn ’ t understand what that meant .
jesus and his followers went across the lake and came to shore at gennesaret . they tied the boat there .
when they were out of the boat , the people there saw jesus . they knew who he was ,
so they ran to tell others throughout that area . they brought sick people on mats to every place jesus went .
some pharisees and some teachers of the law came from jerusalem and gathered around jesus .
they saw that some of his followers ate food with hands that were not clean , meaning that they did not wash their hands in a special way .
jesus answered , “ you are all hypocrites . isaiah was right when he wrote these words from god about you :
their worship of me is worthless .
you have stopped following god ’ s commands , preferring instead the man-made rules you got from others . ”
then he said , “ you show great skill in avoiding the commands of god so that you can follow your own teachings !
you are telling people that they do not have to do anything for their father or mother .
jesus called the people to him again . he said , “ everyone should listen to me and understand what i am saying .
there is nothing people can put in their mouth that will make them wrong . people are made wrong by what comes from inside them . ”
then jesus left the people and went into the house . the followers asked jesus about what he had told the people .
he said , “ do you still have trouble understanding ? surely you know that nothing that enters the mouth from the outside can make people unacceptable to god .
and jesus said , “ the things that make people wrong are the things that come from the inside .
all these bad things begin inside a person , in the mind : bad thoughts , sexual sins , stealing , murder ,
these evil things come from inside a person . and these are the things that make people unacceptable to god . ”
she was not a jew . she was born in phoenicia , an area in syria . she begged jesus to force the demon out of her daughter .
then he told her , “ that is a very good answer . you may go . the demon has left your daughter . ”
the woman went home and found her daughter lying on the bed . the demon was gone .
then jesus left the area around tyre and went through sidon . on his way to lake galilee he went through the area of the ten towns .
jesus looked up to the sky and with a loud sigh he said , “ ephphatha ! ” ( this means “ open ! ” )
as soon as jesus did this , the man was able to hear . he was able to use his tongue , and he began to speak clearly .
jesus told the people not to tell anyone about this . but the more he told them not to say anything , the more people they told .
another time there were many people with jesus . the people had nothing to eat . so he called his followers to him and said ,
“ i feel sorry for these people . they have been with me for three days , and now they have nothing to eat .
jesus ’ followers answered , “ but we are far away from any towns . where can we get enough bread to feed all these people ? ”
then jesus asked them , “ how many loaves of bread do you have ? ”
the followers also had a few small fish . jesus gave thanks for the fish and told them to give the fish to the people .
they all ate until they were full . then the followers filled seven baskets with the pieces of food that were left .
there were about 4000 men who ate . after they ate , jesus told them to go home .
then he went in a boat with his followers to the area of dalmanutha .
the pharisees came to jesus and asked him questions . they wanted to test him . so they asked him to do a miracle as a sign from god .
then jesus left them and went in the boat to the other side of the lake .
the followers had only one loaf of bread with them in the boat . they forgot to bring more bread .
jesus warned them , “ be careful ! guard against the yeast of the pharisees and the yeast of herod . ”
the followers discussed the meaning of this . they said , “ he said this because we have no bread . ”
i divided five loaves of bread for 5000 people . remember how many baskets you filled with pieces of food that were not eaten ? ”
“ and when i divided seven loaves of bread for 4000 people , how many baskets did you fill with the leftover pieces ? ”
then he said to them , “ you remember these things i did , but you still don ’ t understand ? ”
jesus and his followers came to bethsaida . some people brought a blind man to him and begged him to touch the man .
the man looked up and said , “ yes , i see people . they look like trees walking around . ”
jesus told him to go home . he said , “ don ’ t go into the town . ”
they answered , “ some people say you are john the baptizer . others say you are elijah . and others say you are one of the prophets . ”
then jesus asked , “ who do you say i am ? ”
jesus told the followers , “ don ’ t tell anyone who i am . ”
jesus told them everything that would happen . he did not keep anything secret .
it is worth nothing for you to have the whole world if you yourself are lost .
you could never pay enough to buy back your life .
his clothes became shining white—whiter than anyone on earth could make them .
then two men were there talking with jesus . they were elijah and moses .
peter did not know what to say , because he and the other two followers were so afraid .
the followers looked , but they saw only jesus there alone with them .
so the followers waited to say anything about what they saw . but they discussed among themselves what jesus meant about rising from death .
they asked him , “ why do the teachers of the law say that elijah must come first ? ”
when the people saw jesus , they were very surprised and ran to welcome him .
jesus asked , “ what are you arguing about with the teachers of the law ? ”
a man answered , “ teacher , i brought my son to you . he is controlled by an evil spirit that keeps him from talking .
jesus asked the boy ’ s father , “ how long has this been happening to him ? ”
jesus said to the father , “ why did you say ‘ if you can ’ ? all things are possible for the one who believes . ”
immediately the father shouted , “ i do believe . help me to believe more ! ”
but jesus took hold of his hand and helped him stand up .
jesus answered , “ that kind of spirit can be forced out only with prayer . ”
then jesus and his followers left there and went through galilee . jesus did not want the people to know where they were .
but the followers did not understand what he meant , and they were afraid to ask him .
but the followers did not answer , because their argument on the road was about which one of them was the greatest .
then jesus took a small child and stood the child in front of the followers . he held the child in his arms and said ,
“ whoever accepts children like these in my name is accepting me . and anyone who accepts me is also accepting the one who sent me . ”
jesus said , “ don ’ t stop him . whoever uses my name to do powerful things will not soon say bad things about me .
whoever is not against us is with us .
i can assure you that anyone who helps you by giving you a drink of water because you belong to the messiah will definitely get a reward .
the worms that eat the people in hell never die . the fire there is never stopped .
“ everyone will be salted with fire .
jesus answered , “ what did moses command you to do ? ”
the pharisees said , “ moses allowed a man to divorce his wife by writing a certificate of divorce . ”
jesus said , “ moses wrote that command for you because you refused to accept god ’ s teaching .
but when god made the world , ‘ he made people male and female . ’
‘ that is why a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife .
and the two people will become one. ’ so they are no longer two , but one .
god has joined them together , so no one should separate them . ”
later , when the followers and jesus were in the house , they asked him again about the question of divorce .
he said , “ whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman has sinned against his wife . he is guilty of adultery .
and the woman who divorces her husband and marries another man is also guilty of adultery . ”
the truth is , you must accept god ’ s kingdom like a little child accepts things , or you will never enter it . ”
then jesus held the children in his arms . he laid his hands on them and blessed them .
jesus answered , “ why do you call me good ? only god is good .
the man said , “ teacher , i have obeyed all these commands since i was a boy . ”
then jesus looked at his followers and said to them , “ it will be very hard for a rich person to enter god ’ s kingdom ! ”
the followers were amazed at what jesus said . but he said again , “ my children , it is very hard to enter god ’ s kingdom !
it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter god ’ s kingdom ! ”
the followers were even more amazed and said to each other , “ then who can be saved ? ”
jesus looked at them and said , “ that is something people can not do , but god can . he can do anything . ”
peter said to jesus , “ we left everything to follow you ! ”
then james and john , sons of zebedee , came to jesus and said , “ teacher , we want to ask you to do something for us . ”
jesus asked , “ what do you want me to do for you ? ”
the sons answered , “ yes , we can ! ”
but it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or my left . god has prepared those places for the ones he chooses . ”
when the other ten followers heard this , they were angry with james and john .
but it should not be that way with you . whoever wants to be your leader must be your servant .
whoever wants to be first must serve the rest of you like a slave .
he heard that jesus from nazareth was walking by . so he began shouting , “ jesus , son of david , please help me ! ”
many people criticized the blind man and told him to be quiet . but he shouted more and more , “ son of david , please help me ! ”
jesus stopped and said , “ tell him to come here . ”
the blind man stood up quickly . he left his coat there and went to jesus .
jesus asked the man , “ what do you want me to do for you ? ”
jesus said , “ go . you are healed because you believed. ” immediately the man was able to see again . he followed jesus down the road .
if anyone asks you why you are taking the donkey , tell them , ‘ the master needs it . he will send it back soon . ’ ”
the followers went into the town . they found a young donkey tied in the street near the door of a house , and they untied it .
some people were standing there and saw this . they asked , “ what are you doing ? why are you untying that donkey ? ”
the followers answered the way jesus told them , and the people let them take the donkey .
the followers brought the donkey to jesus . they put their coats on it , and jesus sat on it .
many people spread their coats on the road for jesus . others cut branches in the fields and spread the branches on the road .
some of them were walking ahead of jesus . others were walking behind him . everyone shouted ,
“ god bless the kingdom of our father david .
the next day , jesus was leaving bethany . he was hungry .
so jesus said to the tree , “ people will never eat fruit from you again. ” his followers heard him say this .
he refused to allow anyone to carry things through the temple area .
that night jesus and his followers left the city .
jesus answered , “ have faith in god .
so i tell you to ask for what you want in prayer . and if you believe that you have received those things , then they will be yours .
they said , “ tell us ! what authority do you have to do these things ? who gave you this authority ? ”
jesus answered , “ i will ask you a question . you answer my question . then i will tell you whose authority i use to do these things .
tell me : when john baptized people , did his authority come from god or was it only from other people ? answer me . ”
so the leaders answered jesus , “ we don ’ t know the answer . ”
“ later , it was time for the grapes to be picked . so the man sent a servant to the farmers to get his share of the grapes .
but the farmers grabbed the servant and beat him . they sent him away with nothing .
then the man sent another servant to the farmers . they hit this servant on the head , showing no respect for him .
so they took the son , threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him .
“ so what will the man who owns the vineyard do ? he will go and kill those farmers . then he will lease the land to others .
surely you have read this in the scriptures :
the lord did this ,
later , the jewish leaders sent some pharisees and some men from the group called herodians to jesus . they wanted to catch him saying something wrong .
then some sadducees came to jesus . ( sadducees believe that no one will rise from death . ) they asked him a question :
there were seven brothers . the first brother married but died . he had no children .
so the second brother married the woman . but he also died and had no children . the same thing happened with the third brother .
all seven brothers married the woman and died . none of the brothers had any children with her . and she was the last to die .
but all seven brothers had married her . so at the time when people rise from death , whose wife will she be ? ”
when people rise from death , there will be no marriage . people will not be married to each other . all people will be like angels in heaven .
so they were not still dead , because he is the god only of living people . you sadducees are so wrong ! ”
jesus answered , “ the most important command is this : ‘ people of israel , listen ! the lord our god is the only lord .
love the lord your god with all your heart , all your soul , all your mind , and all your strength . ’
the second most important command is this : ‘ love your neighbor the same as you love yourself. ’ these two commands are the most important . ”
jesus was teaching in the temple area . he asked , “ why do the teachers of the law say that the messiah is the son of david ?
with the help of the holy spirit , david himself says ,
david himself calls the messiah ‘ lord. ’ so how can the messiah be david ’ s son ? ” many people listened to jesus and were very pleased .
they love to have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets .
but they cheat widows and take their homes . then they try to make themselves look good by saying long prayers . god will punish them very much . ”
jesus sat near the temple collection box and watched as people put money into it . many rich people put in a lot of money .
then a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins , worth less than a penny .
jesus was leaving the temple area . one of his followers said to him , “ teacher , look how big those stones are ! what beautiful buildings ! ”
“ tell us when these things will happen . and what will show us it is time for them to happen ? ”
jesus said to them , “ be careful ! don ’ t let anyone fool you .
many people will come and use my name . they will say , ‘ i am the messiah , ’ and they will fool many people .
before the end comes , the good news must be told to all nations .
all people will hate you because you follow me . but those who remain faithful to the end will be saved .
if someone is in the field , they must not go back to get a coat .
“ during that time it will be hard for women who are pregnant or have small babies .
pray that these things will not happen in winter ,
false messiahs and false prophets will come and do miracles and wonders , trying to fool the people god has chosen , if that is possible .
so be careful . now i have warned you about all this before it happens .
“ during the days following that time of trouble ,
the stars will fall from the sky ,
