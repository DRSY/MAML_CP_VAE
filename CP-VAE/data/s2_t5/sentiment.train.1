the former treatise i made , o theophilus , concerning all that jesus began both to do and to teach ,
until the day in which he was received up , after that he had given commandment through the holy spirit unto the apostles whom he had chosen :
for john indeed baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized in the holy spirit not many days hence .
they therefore , when they were come together , asked him , saying , lord , dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to israel ?
and he said unto them , it is not for you to know times or seasons , which the father hath set within his own authority .
and when he had said these things , as they were looking , he was taken up ; and a cloud received him out of their sight .
and while they were looking stedfastly into heaven as he went , behold two men stood by them in white apparel ;
then returned they unto jerusalem from the mount called olivet , which is nigh unto jerusalem , a sabbath day ’ s journey off .
these all with one accord continued stedfastly in prayer , with the women , and mary the mother of jesus , and with his brethren .
for he was numbered among us , and received his portion in this ministry .
for it is written in the book of psalms ,
of the men therefore that have companied with us all the time that the lord jesus went in and went out among us ,
and they put forward two , joseph called barsabbas , who was surnamed justus , and matthias .
and they prayed , and said , thou , lord , who knowest the hearts of all men , show of these two the one whom thou hast chosen ,
to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which judas fell away , that he might go to his own place .
and they gave lots for them ; and the lot fell upon matthias ; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles .
and when the day of pentecost was now come , they were all together in one place .
and suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind , and it filled all the house where they were sitting .
and there appeared unto them tongues parting asunder , like as of fire ; and it sat upon each one of them .
and they were all filled with the holy spirit , and began to speak with other tongues , as the spirit gave them utterance .
now there were dwelling at jerusalem jews , devout men , from every nation under heaven .
and when this sound was heard , the multitude came together , and were confounded , because that every man heard them speaking in his own language .
and they were all amazed and marvelled , saying , behold , are not all these that speak galilaeans ?
and how hear we , every man in our own language wherein we were born ?
parthians and medes and elamites , and the dwellers in mesopotamia , in judaea and cappadocia , in pontus and asia ,
in phrygia and pamphylia , in egypt and the parts of libya about cyrene , and sojourners from rome , both jews and proselytes ,
cretans and arabians , we hear them speaking in our tongues the mighty works of god .
and they were all amazed , and were perplexed , saying one to another , what meaneth this ?
but others mocking said , they are filled with new wine .
for these are not drunken , as ye suppose ; seeing it is but the third hour of the day ;
but this is that which hath been spoken through the prophet joel :
and it shall be in the last days , saith god ,
yea and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days
and i will show wonders in the heaven above ,
the sun shall be turned into darkness ,
and it shall be , that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved .
him , being delivered up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god , ye by the hand of lawless men did crucify and slay :
whom god raised up , having loosed the pangs of death : because it was not possible that he should be holden of it .
for david saith concerning him ,
therefore my heart was glad , and my tongue rejoiced ;
because thou wilt not leave my soul unto hades ,
thou madest known unto me the ways of life ;
he foreseeing this spake of the resurrection of the christ , that neither was he left unto hades , nor did his flesh see corruption .
this jesus did god raise up , whereof we all are witnesses .
for david ascended not into the heavens : but he saith himself ,
till i make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet .
let all the house of israel therefore know assuredly , that god hath made him both lord and christ , this jesus whom ye crucified .
and with many other words he testified , and exhorted them , saying , save yourselves from this crooked generation .
they then that received his word were baptized : and there were added unto them in that day about three thousand souls .
and they continued stedfastly in the apostles ’ teaching and fellowship , in the breaking of bread and the prayers .
and fear came upon every soul : and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles .
and all that believed were together , and had all things common ;
and they sold their possessions and goods , and parted them to all , according as any man had need .
praising god , and having favor with all the people . and the lord added to them day by day those that were saved .
now peter and john were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer , being the ninth hour .
who seeing peter and john about to go into the temple , asked to receive an alms .
and peter , fastening his eyes upon him , with john , said , look on us .
and he gave heed unto them , expecting to receive something from them .
and he took him by the right hand , and raised him up : and immediately his feet and his ankle-bones received strength .
and leaping up , he stood , and began to walk ; and he entered with them into the temple , walking , and leaping , and praising god .
and all the people saw him walking and praising god :
and as he held peter and john , all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called solomon ’ s , greatly wondering .
but ye denied the holy and righteous one , and asked for a murderer to be granted unto you ,
and killed the prince of life ; whom god raised from the dead ; whereof we are witnesses .
and now , brethren , i know that in ignorance ye did it , as did also your rulers .
but the things which god foreshowed by the mouth of all the prophets , that his christ should suffer , he thus fulfilled .
and that he may send the christ who hath been appointed for you , even jesus :
and it shall be , that every soul that shall not hearken to that prophet , shall be utterly destroyed from among the people .
yea and all the prophets from samuel and them that followed after , as many as have spoken , they also told of these days .
unto you first god , having raised up his servant , sent him to bless you , in turning away every one of you from your iniquities .
and as they spake unto the people , the priests and the captain of the temple and the sadducees came upon them ,
being sore troubled because they taught the people , and proclaimed in jesus the resurrection from the dead .
and they laid hands on them , and put them in ward unto the morrow : for it was now eventide .
but many of them that heard the word believed ; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in jerusalem ;
and annas the high priest was there , and caiaphas , and john , and alexander , and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest .
and when they had set them in the midst , they inquired , by what power , or in what name , have ye done this ?
then peter , filled with the holy spirit , said unto them , ye rulers of the people , and elders ,
if we this day are examined concerning a good deed done to an impotent man , by what means this man is made whole ;
he is the stone which was set at nought of you the builders , which was made the head of the corner .
and in none other is there salvation : for neither is there any other name under heaven , that is given among men , wherein we must be saved .
and seeing the man that was healed standing with them , they could say nothing against it .
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
but that it spread no further among the people , let us threaten them , that they speak henceforth to no man in this name .
and they called them , and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus .
for we can not but speak the things which we saw and heard .
for the man was more than forty years old , on whom this miracle of healing was wrought .
and being let go , they came to their own company , and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto them .
who by the holy spirit , by the mouth of our father david thy servant , didst say ,
the kings of the earth set themselves in array ,
to do whatsoever thy hand and thy council foreordained to come to pass .
and now , lord , look upon their threatenings : and grant unto thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness ,
while thou stretchest forth thy hand to heal ; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy servant jesus .
and with great power gave the apostles their witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus : and great grace was upon them all .
and laid them at the apostles ’ feet : and distribution was made unto each , according as any one had need .
having a field , sold it , and brought the money and laid it at the apostles ’ feet .
but a certain man named ananias , with sapphira his wife , sold a possession ,
and ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost : and great fear came upon all that heard it .
and the young men arose and wrapped him round , and they carried him out and buried him .
and it was about the space of three hours after , when his wife , not knowing what was done , came in .
and peter answered unto her , tell me whether ye sold the land for so much . and she said , yea , for so much .
and great fear came upon the whole church , and upon all that heard these things .
and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people : and they were all with one accord in solomon ’ s porch .
but of the rest durst no man join himself to them : howbeit the people magnified them ;
and believers were the more added to the lord , multitudes both of men and women :
and laid hands on the apostles , and put them in public ward .
but an angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors , and brought them out , and said ,
go ye , and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life .
but the officers that came found them not in the prison ; and they returned , and told ,
now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words , they were much perplexed concerning them whereunto this would grow .
and there came one and told them , behold , the men whom ye put in the prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people .
then went the captain with the officers , and brought them , but without violence ; for they feared the people , lest they should be stoned .
and when they had brought them , they set them before the council . and the high priest asked them ,
but peter and the apostles answered and said , we must obey god rather than men .
the god of our fathers raised up jesus , whom ye slew , hanging him on a tree .
him did god exalt with his right hand to be a prince and a saviour , to give repentance to israel , and remission of sins .
and we are witnesses of these things ; and so is the holy spirit , whom god hath given to them that obey him .
but they , when they heard this , were cut to the heart , and were minded to slay them .
and he said unto them , ye men of israel , take heed to yourselves as touching these men , what ye are about to do .
but if it is of god , ye will not be able to overthrow them ; lest haply ye be found even to be fighting against god .
they therefore departed from the presence of the council , rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name .
and every day , in the temple and at home , they ceased not to teach and to preach jesus as the christ .
but we will continue stedfastly in prayer , and in the ministry of the word .
whom they set before the apostles : and when they had prayed , they laid their hands upon them .
and stephen , full of grace and power , wrought great wonders and signs among the people .
and they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake .
then they suborned men , who said , we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses , and against god .
and set up false witnesses , who said , this man ceaseth not to speak words against this holy place , and the law :
for we have heard him say , that this jesus of nazareth shall destroy this place , and shall change the customs which moses delivered unto us .
and all that sat in the council , fastening their eyes on him , saw his face as it had been the face of an angel .
and the high priest said , are these things so ?
and said unto him , get thee out of thy land , and from thy kindred , and come into the land which i shall show thee .
and the patriarchs , moved with jealousy against joseph , sold him into egypt : and god was with him ,
now there came a famine over all egypt and canaan , and great affliction : and our fathers found no sustenance .
but when jacob heard that there was grain in egypt , he sent forth our fathers the first time .
and at the second time joseph was made known to his brethren ; and joseph ’ s race became manifest unto pharaoh .
and joseph sent , and called to him jacob his father , and all his kindred , threescore and fifteen souls .
and jacob went down into egypt ; and he died , himself and our fathers ;
and they were carried over unto shechem , and laid in the tomb that abraham bought for a price in silver of the sons of hamor in shechem .
but as the time of the promise drew nigh which god vouchsafed unto abraham , the people grew and multiplied in egypt ,
till there arose another king over egypt , who knew not joseph .
the same dealt craftily with our race , and ill-treated our fathers , that they should cast out their babes to the end they might not live .
at which season moses was born , and was exceeding fair ; and he was nourished three months in his father ’ s house :
and when he was cast out , pharaoh ’ s daughter took him up , and nourished him for her own son .
and moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the egyptians ; and he was mighty in his words and works .
but when he was well-nigh forty years old , it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of israel .
and seeing one of them suffer wrong , he defended him , and avenged him that was oppressed , smiting the egyptian :
and he supposed that his brethren understood that god by his hand was giving them deliverance ; but they understood not .
but he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away , saying , who made thee a ruler and a judge over us ?
wouldest thou kill me , as thou killedst the egyptian yesterday ?
and moses fled at this saying , and became a sojourner in the land of midian , where he begat two sons .
and when forty years were fulfilled , an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sinai , in a flame of fire in a bush .
and when moses saw it , he wondered at the sight : and as he drew near to behold , there came a voice of the lord ,
i am the god of thy fathers , the god of abraham , and of isaac , and of jacob . and moses trembled , and durst not behold .
and the lord said unto him , loose the shoes from thy feet : for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground .
this man led them forth , having wrought wonders and signs in egypt , and in the red sea , and in the wilderness forty years .
this is that moses , who said unto the children of israel , a prophet shall god raise up unto you from among your brethren , like unto me .
to whom our fathers would not be obedient , but thrust him from them , and turned back in their hearts unto egypt ,
and they made a calf in those days , and brought a sacrifice unto the idol , and rejoiced in the works of their hands .
but god turned , and gave them up to serve the host of heaven ; as it is written in the book of the prophets ,
and ye took up the tabernacle of moloch ,
who found favor in the sight of god , and asked to find a habitation for the god of jacob .
but solomon built him a house .
howbeit the most high dwelleth not in houses made with hands ; as saith the prophet ,
the heaven is my throne ,
did not my hand make all these things ?
ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears , ye do always resist the holy spirit : as your fathers did , so do ye .
ye who received the law as it was ordained by angels , and kept it not .
now when they heard these things , they were cut to the heart , and they gnashed on him with their teeth .
and said , behold , i see the heavens opened , and the son of man standing on the right hand of god .
but they cried out with a loud voice , and stopped their ears , and rushed upon him with one accord ;
and they cast him out of the city , and stoned him : and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named saul .
and they stoned stephen , calling upon the lord , and saying , lord jesus , receive my spirit .
and saul was consenting unto his death .
and devout men buried stephen , and made great lamentation over him .
but saul laid waste the church , entering into every house , and dragging men and women committed them to prison .
they therefore that were scattered abroad went about preaching the word .
and philip went down to the city of samaria , and proclaimed unto them the christ .
and the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by philip , when they heard , and saw the signs which he did .
and there was much joy in that city .
to whom they all gave heed , from the least to the greatest , saying , this man is that power of god which is called great .
and they gave heed to him , because that of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries .
but when they believed philip preaching good tidings concerning the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
and simon also himself believed : and being baptized , he continued with philip ; and beholding signs and great miracles wrought , he was amazed .
now when the apostles that were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god , they sent unto them peter and john :
who , when they were come down , prayed for them , that they might receive the holy spirit :
for as yet it was fallen upon none of them : only they had been baptized into the name of the lord jesus .
then laid they their hands on them , and they received the holy spirit .
now when simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles ’ hands the holy spirit was given , he offered them money ,
saying , give me also this power , that on whomsoever i lay my hands , he may receive the holy spirit .
but peter said unto him , thy silver perish with thee , because thou hast thought to obtain the gift of god with money .
thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter : for thy heart is not right before god .
repent therefore of this thy wickedness , and pray the lord , if perhaps the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee .
for i see that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity .
and simon answered and said , pray ye for me to the lord , that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me .
they therefore , when they had testified and spoken the word of the lord , returned to jerusalem , and preached the gospel to many villages of the samaritans .
and he was returning and sitting in his chariot , and was reading the prophet isaiah .
and the spirit said unto philip , go near , and join thyself to this chariot .
and philip ran to him , and heard him reading isaiah the prophet , and said , understandest thou what thou readest ?
and he said , how can i , except some one shall guide me ? and he besought philip to come up and sit with him .
now the passage of the scripture which he was reading was this ,
in his humiliation his judgment was taken away :
and the eunuch answered philip , and said , i pray thee , of whom speaketh the prophet this ? of himself , or of some other ?
and philip opened his mouth , and beginning from this scripture , preached unto him jesus .
and he commanded the chariot to stand still : and they both went down into the water , both philip and the eunuch ; and he baptized him .
but philip was found at azotus : and passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities , till he came to caesarea .
but saul , yet breathing threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the lord , went unto the high priest ,
and as he journeyed , it came to pass that he drew nigh unto damascus : and suddenly there shone round about him a light out of heaven :
and he fell upon the earth , and heard a voice saying unto him , saul , saul , why persecutest thou me ?
and he said , who art thou , lord ? and he said , i am jesus whom thou persecutest :
but rise , and enter into the city , and it shall be told thee what thou must do .
and the men that journeyed with him stood speechless , hearing the voice , but beholding no man .
and he was three days without sight , and did neither eat nor drink .
and he hath seen a man named ananias coming in , and laying his hands on him , that he might receive his sight .
but ananias answered , lord , i have heard from many of this man , how much evil he did to thy saints at jerusalem :
and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call upon thy name .
for i will show him how many things he must suffer for my name ’ s sake .
and straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales , and he received his sight ; and he arose and was baptized ;
and he took food and was strengthened .
and straightway in the synagogues he proclaimed jesus , that he is the son of god .
but saul increased the more in strength , and confounded the jews that dwelt at damascus , proving that this is the christ .
and when many days were fulfilled , the jews took counsel together to kill him :
but their plot became known to saul . and they watched the gates also day and night that they might kill him :
but his disciples took him by night , and let him down through the wall , lowering him in a basket .
and he was with them going in and going out at jerusalem ,
preaching boldly in the name of the lord : and he spake and disputed against the grecian jews ; but they were seeking to kill him .
and when the brethren knew it , they brought him down to caesarea , and sent him forth to tarsus .
and it came to pass , as peter went throughout all parts , he came down also to the saints that dwelt at lydda .
and there he found a certain man named aeneas , who had kept his bed eight years ; for he was palsied .
and peter said unto him , aeneas , jesus christ healeth thee : arise , and make thy bed . and straightway he arose .
and all that dwelt at lydda and in sharon saw him , and they turned to the lord .
and he gave her his hand , and raised her up ; and calling the saints and widows , he presented her alive .
and it became known throughout all joppa : and many believed on the lord .
and it came to pass , that he abode many days in joppa with one simon a tanner .
now there was a certain man in caesarea , cornelius by name , a centurion of the band called the italian band ,
a devout man , and one that feared god with all his house , who gave much alms to the people , and prayed to god always .
and now send men to joppa , and fetch one simon , who is surnamed peter :
he lodgeth with one simon a tanner , whose house is by the sea side .
and when the angel that spake unto him was departed , he called two of his household-servants , and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually ;
and having rehearsed all things unto them , he sent them to joppa .
and he became hungry , and desired to eat : but while they made ready , he fell into a trance ;
and he beholdeth the heaven opened , and a certain vessel descending , as it were a great sheet , let down by four corners upon the earth :
wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts and creeping things of the earth and birds of the heaven .
and there came a voice to him , rise , peter ; kill and eat .
but peter said , not so , lord ; for i have never eaten anything that is common and unclean .
and a voice came unto him again the second time , what god hath cleansed , make not thou common .
and this was done thrice : and straightway the vessel was received up into heaven .
and called and asked whether simon , who was surnamed peter , were lodging there .
and while peter thought on the vision , the spirit said unto him , behold , three men seek thee .
but arise , and get thee down , and go with them , nothing doubting : for i have sent them .
and peter went down to the men , and said , behold , i am he whom ye seek : what is the cause wherefore ye are come ?
so he called them in and lodged them .
and on the morrow they entered into caesarea . and cornelius was waiting for them , having called together his kinsmen and his near friends .
and when it came to pass that peter entered , cornelius met him , and fell down at his feet , and worshipped him .
but peter raised him up , saying , stand up ; i myself also am a man .
and as he talked with him , he went in , and findeth many come together :
wherefore also i came without gainsaying , when i was sent for . i ask therefore with what intent ye sent for me .
and saith , cornelius , thy prayer is heard , and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of god .
and peter opened his mouth , and said ,
but in every nation he that feareth him , and worketh righteousness , is acceptable to him .
the word which he sent unto the children of israel , preaching good tidings of peace by jesus christ ( he is lord of all ) —
that saying ye yourselves know , which was published throughout all judaea , beginning from galilee , after the baptism which john preached ;
him god raised up the third day , and gave him to be made manifest ,
to him bear all the prophets witness , that through his name every one that believeth on him shall receive remission of sins .
while peter yet spake these words , the holy spirit fell on all them that heard the word .
for they heard them speak with tongues , and magnify god . then answered peter ,
can any man forbid the water , that these should not be baptized , who have received the holy spirit as well as we ?
and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of jesus christ . then prayed they him to tarry certain days .
now the apostles and the brethren that were in judaea heard that the gentiles also had received the word of god .
and when peter was come up to jerusalem , they that were of the circumcision contended with him ,
saying , thou wentest in to men uncircumcised , and didst eat with them .
but peter began , and expounded the matter unto them in order , saying ,
and i heard also a voice saying unto me , rise , peter ; kill and eat .
but i said , not so , lord : for nothing common or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth .
but a voice answered the second time out of heaven , what god hath cleansed , make not thou common .
and this was done thrice : and all were drawn up again into heaven .
and behold , forthwith three men stood before the house in which we were , having been sent from caesarea unto me .
who shall speak unto thee words , whereby thou shalt be saved , thou and all thy house .
and as i began to speak , the holy spirit fell on them , even as on us at the beginning .
and i remembered the word of the lord , how he said , john indeed baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized in the holy spirit .
and when they heard these things , they held their peace , and glorified god , saying , then to the gentiles also hath god granted repentance unto life .
and the hand of the lord was with them : and a great number that believed turned unto the lord .
and the report concerning them came to the ears of the church which was in jerusalem : and they sent forth barnabas as far as antioch :
for he was a good man , and full of the holy spirit and of faith : and much people was added unto the lord .
and he went forth to tarsus to seek for saul ;
now in these days there came down prophets from jerusalem unto antioch .
and the disciples , every man according to his ability , determined to send relief unto the brethren that dwelt in judaea :
which also they did , sending it to the elders by the hand of barnabas and saul .
now about that time herod the king put forth his hands to afflict certain of the church .
and he killed james the brother of john with the sword .
and when he saw that it pleased the jews , he proceeded to seize peter also . and those were the days of unleavened bread .
peter therefore was kept in the prison : but prayer was made earnestly of the church unto god for him .
and he went out , and followed ; and he knew not that it was true which was done by the angel , but thought he saw a vision .
and when he knocked at the door of the gate , a maid came to answer , named rhoda .
and when she knew peter ’ s voice , she opened not the gate for joy , but ran in , and told that peter stood before the gate .
and they said unto her , thou art mad . but she confidently affirmed that it was even so . and they said , it is his angel .
but peter continued knocking : and when they had opened , they saw him , and were amazed .
now as soon as it was day , there was no small stir among the soldiers , what was become of peter .
and upon a set day herod arrayed himself in royal apparel , and sat on the throne , and made an oration unto them .
and the people shouted , saying , the voice of a god , and not of a man .
but the word of god grew and multiplied .
and barnabas and saul returned from jerusalem , when they had fulfilled their ministration , taking with them john whose surname was mark .
and as they ministered to the lord , and fasted , the holy spirit said , separate me barnabas and saul for the work whereunto i have called them .
then , when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them , they sent them away .
so they , being sent forth by the holy spirit , went down to seleucia ; and from thence they sailed to cyprus .
and when they were at salamis , they proclaimed the word of god in the synagogues of the jews : and they had also john as their attendant .
and when they had gone through the whole island unto paphos , they found a certain sorcerer , a false prophet , a jew , whose name was bar-jesus ;
but elymas the sorcerer ( for so is his name by interpretation ) withstood them , seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith .
but saul , who is also called paul , filled with the holy spirit , fastened his eyes on him ,
then the proconsul , when he saw what was done , believed , being astonished at the teaching of the lord .
now paul and his company set sail from paphos , and came to perga in pamphylia : and john departed from them and returned to jerusalem .
but they , passing through from perga , came to antioch of pisidia ; and they went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and sat down .
and paul stood up , and beckoning with the hand said ,
and for about the time of forty years as a nursing-father bare he them in the wilderness .
and when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of canaan , he gave them their land for an inheritance , for about four hundred and fifty years :
and after these things he gave them judges until samuel the prophet .
of this man ’ s seed hath god according to promise brought unto israel a saviour , jesus ;
when john had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of israel .
brethren , children of the stock of abraham , and those among you that fear god , to us is the word of this salvation sent forth .
and though they found no cause of death in him , yet asked they of pilate that he should be slain .
and when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him , they took him down from the tree , and laid him in a tomb .
but god raised him from the dead :
and he was seen for many days of them that came up with him from galilee to jerusalem , who are now his witnesses unto the people .
and we bring you good tidings of the promise made unto the fathers ,
because he saith also in another psalm , thou wilt not give thy holy one to see corruption .
for david , after he had in his own generation served the counsel of god , fell asleep , and was laid unto his fathers , and saw corruption :
but he whom god raised up saw no corruption .
be it known unto you therefore , brethren , that through this man is proclaimed unto you remission of sins :
and by him every one that believeth is justified from all things , from which ye could not be justified by the law of moses .
beware therefore , lest that come upon you which is spoken in the prophets :
behold , ye despisers , and wonder , and perish ;
and as they went out , they besought that these words might be spoken to them the next sabbath .
and the next sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of god .
but when the jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with jealousy , and contradicted the things which were spoken by paul , and blasphemed .
for so hath the lord commanded us , saying ,
and as the gentiles heard this , they were glad , and glorified the word of god : and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed .
and the word of the lord was spread abroad throughout all the region .
but they shook off the dust of their feet against them , and came unto iconium .
and the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy spirit .
but the jews that were disobedient stirred up the souls of the gentiles , and made them evil affected against the brethren .
but the multitude of the city was divided ; and part held with the jews , and part with the apostles .
and when there was made an onset both of the gentiles and of the jews with their rulers , to treat them shamefully and to stone them ,
they became aware of it , and fled unto the cities of lycaonia , lystra and derbe , and the region round about :
and there they preached the gospel .
and at lystra there sat a certain man , impotent in his feet , a cripple from his mother ’ s womb , who never had walked .
the same heard paul speaking : who , fastening his eyes upon him , and seeing that he had faith to be made whole ,
said with a loud voice , stand upright on thy feet . and he leaped up and walked .
and they called barnabas , jupiter ; and paul , mercury , because he was the chief speaker .
and the priest of jupiter whose temple was before the city , brought oxen and garlands unto the gates , and would have done sacrifice with the multitudes .
but when the apostles , barnabas and paul , heard of it , they rent their garments , and sprang forth among the multitude , crying out
who in the generations gone by suffered all the nations to walk in their own ways .
and with these sayings scarce restrained they the multitudes from doing sacrifice unto them .
and when they had preached the gospel to that city , and had made many disciples , they returned to lystra , and to iconium , and to antioch ,
confirming the souls of the disciples , exhorting them to continue in the faith , and that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of god .
and they passed through pisidia , and came to pamphylia .
and when they had spoken the word in perga , they went down to attalia ;
and thence they sailed to antioch , from whence they had been committed to the grace of god for the work which they had fulfilled .
and they tarried no little time with the disciples .
and certain men came down from judaea and taught the brethren , saying , except ye be circumcised after the custom of moses , ye can not be saved .
and the apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider of this matter .
and when there had been much questioning , peter rose up , and said unto them ,
and god , who knoweth the heart , bare them witness , giving them the holy spirit , even as he did unto us ;
and he made no distinction between us and them , cleansing their hearts by faith .
but we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the lord jesus , in like manner as they .
and all the multitude kept silence ; and they hearkened unto barnabas and paul rehearsing what signs and wonders god had wrought among the gentiles through them .
and after they had held their peace , james answered , saying ,
symeon hath rehearsed how first god visited the gentiles , to take out of them a people for his name .
and to this agree the words of the prophets ; as it is written ,
after these things i will return ,
that the residue of men may seek after the lord ,
saith the lord , who maketh these things known from of old .
wherefore my judgment is , that we trouble not them that from among the gentiles turn to god ;
but that we write unto them , that they abstain from the pollutions of idols , and from fornication , and from what is strangled , and from blood .
for moses from generations of old hath in every city them that preach him , being read in the synagogues every sabbath .
forasmuch as we have heard that certain who went out from us have troubled you with words , subverting your souls ; to whom we gave no commandment ;
it seemed good unto us , having come to one accord , to choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul ,
men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ .
we have sent therefore judas and silas , who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of mouth .
for it seemed good to the holy spirit , and to us , to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things :
so they , when they were dismissed , came down to antioch ; and having gathered the multitude together , they delivered the epistle .
and when they had read it , they rejoiced for the consolation .
and judas and silas , being themselves also prophets , exhorted the brethren with many words , and confirmed them .
and after they had spent some time there , they were dismissed in peace from the brethren unto those that had sent them forth .
but paul and barnabas tarried in antioch , teaching and preaching the word of the lord , with many others also .
and barnabas was minded to take with them john also , who was called mark .
but paul thought not good to take with them him who withdrew from them from pamphylia , and went not with them to the work .
and there arose a sharp contention , so that they parted asunder one from the other , and barnabas took mark with him , and sailed away unto cyprus :
but paul chose silas , and went forth , being commended by the brethren to the grace of the lord .
and he went through syria and cilicia , confirming the churches .
the same was well reported of by the brethren that were at lystra and iconium .
so the churches were strengthened in the faith , and increased in number daily .
and they went through the region of phrygia and galatia , having been forbidden of the holy spirit to speak the word in asia ;
and when they were come over against mysia , they assayed to go into bithynia ; and the spirit of jesus suffered them not ;
and passing by mysia , they came down to troas .
and when he had seen the vision , straightway we sought to go forth into macedonia , concluding that god had called us to preach the gospel unto them .
setting sail therefore from troas , we made a straight course to samothrace , and the day following to neapolis ;
and when they had brought them unto the magistrates , they said , these men , being jews , do exceedingly trouble our city ,
and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to receive , or to observe , being romans .
and the multitude rose up together against them : and the magistrates rent their garments off them , and commanded to beat them with rods .
and when they had laid many stripes upon them , they cast them into prison , charging the jailor to keep them safely :
who , having received such a charge , cast them into the inner prison , and made their feet fast in the stocks .
but about midnight paul and silas were praying and singing hymns unto god , and the prisoners were listening to them ;
but paul cried with a loud voice , saying , do thyself no harm : for we are all here .
and he called for lights and sprang in , and , trembling for fear , fell down before paul and silas ,
and brought them out and said , sirs , what must i do to be saved ?
and they said , believe on the lord jesus , and thou shalt be saved , thou and thy house .
and they spake the word of the lord unto him , with all that were in his house .
and he took them the same hour of the night , and washed their stripes ; and was baptized , he and all his , immediately .
and he brought them up into his house , and set food before them , and rejoiced greatly , with all his house , having believed in god .
but when it was day , the magistrates sent the serjeants , saying , let those men go .
and the jailor reported the words to paul , saying , the magistrates have sent to let you go : now therefore come forth , and go in peace .
and the serjeants reported these words unto the magistrates : and they feared when they heard that they were romans ;
and they came and besought them ; and when they had brought them out , they asked them to go away from the city .
now when they had passed through amphipolis and apollonia , they came to thessalonica , where was a synagogue of the jews :
and paul , as his custom was , went in unto them , and for three sabbath days reasoned with them from the scriptures ,
whom jason hath received : and these all act contrary to the decrees of caesar , saying that there is another king , one jesus .
and they troubled the multitude and the rulers of the city , when they heard these things .
and when they had taken security from jason and the rest , they let them go .
and the brethren immediately sent away paul and silas by night unto beroea : who when they were come thither went into the synagogue of the jews .
many of them therefore believed ; also of the greek women of honorable estate , and of men , not a few .
and then immediately the brethren sent forth paul to go as far as to the sea : and silas and timothy abode there still .
now while paul waited for them at athens , his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld the city full of idols .
so he reasoned in the synagogue with the jews and the devout persons , and in the marketplace every day with them that met him .
for thou bringest certain strange things to our ears : we would know therefore what these things mean .
( now all the athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else , but either to tell or to hear some new thing . )
and paul stood in the midst of the areopagus , and said ,
the god that made the world and all things therein , he , being lord of heaven and earth , dwelleth not in temples made with hands ;
that they should seek god , if haply they might feel after him and find him , though he is not far from each one of us :
for in him we live , and move , and have our being ; as certain even of your own poets have said ,
the times of ignorance therefore god overlooked ; but now he commandeth men that they should all everywhere repent :
now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead , some mocked ; but others said , we will hear thee concerning this yet again .
thus paul went out from among them .
but certain men clave unto him , and believed : among whom also was dionysius the areopagite , and a woman named damaris , and others with them .
after these things he departed from athens , and came to corinth .
and because he was of the same trade , he abode with them , and they wrought ; for by their trade they were tentmakers .
and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath , and persuaded jews and greeks .
but when silas and timothy came down from macedonia , paul was constrained by the word , testifying to the jews that jesus was the christ .
and crispus , the ruler of the synagogue , believed in the lord with all his house ; and many of the corinthians hearing believed , and were baptized .
and the lord said unto paul in the night by a vision , be not afraid , but speak and hold not thy peace :
for i am with thee , and no man shall set on thee to harm thee : for i have much people in this city .
and he dwelt there a year and six months , teaching the word of god among them .
but when gallio was proconsul of achaia , the jews with one accord rose up against paul and brought him before the judgment-seat ,
saying , this man persuadeth men to worship god contrary to the law .
and he drove them from the judgment-seat .
and they all laid hold on sosthenes , the ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the judgment-seat . and gallio cared for none of these things .
and they came to ephesus , and he left them there : but he himself entered into the synagogue , and reasoned with the jews .
and when they asked him to abide a longer time , he consented not ;
but taking his leave of them , and saying , i will return again unto you if god will , he set sail from ephesus .
and when he had landed at caesarea , he went up and saluted the church , and went down to antioch .
and having spent some time there , he departed , and went through the region of galatia , and phrygia , in order , establishing all the disciples .
now a certain jew named apollos , an alexandrian by race , an eloquent man , came to ephesus ; and he was mighty in the scriptures .
for he powerfully confuted the jews , and that publicly , showing by the scriptures that jesus was the christ .
and it came to pass , that , while apollos was at corinth , paul having passed through the upper country came to ephesus , and found certain disciples :
and he said , into what then were ye baptized ? and they said , into john ’ s baptism .
and when they heard this , they were baptized into the name of the lord jesus .
and when paul had laid his hands upon them , the holy spirit came on them ; and they spake with tongues , and prophesied .
and they were in all about twelve men .
and he entered into the synagogue , and spake boldly for the space of three months , reasoning and persuading as to the things concerning the kingdom of god .
and this continued for the space of two years ; so that all they that dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord , both jews and greeks .
and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul :
insomuch that unto the sick were carried away from his body handkerchiefs or aprons , and the diseases departed from them , and the evil spirits went out .
and there were seven sons of one sceva , a jew , a chief priest , who did this .
and the evil spirit answered and said unto them , jesus i know , and paul i know ; but who are ye ?
many also of them that had believed came , confessing , and declaring their deeds .
so mightily grew the word of the lord and prevailed .
and having sent into macedonia two of them that ministered unto him , timothy and erastus , he himself stayed in asia for a while .
and about that time there arose no small stir concerning the way .
for a certain man named demetrius , a silversmith , who made silver shrines of diana , brought no little business unto the craftsmen ;
whom he gathered together , with the workmen of like occupation , and said , sirs , ye know that by this business we have our wealth .
and when they heard this they were filled with wrath , and cried out , saying , great is diana of the ephesians .
and when paul was minded to enter in unto the people , the disciples suffered him not .
and certain also of the asiarchs , being his friends , sent unto him and besought him not to adventure himself into the theatre .
some therefore cried one thing , and some another : for the assembly was in confusion ; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together .
but when they perceived that he was a jew , all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out , great is diana of the ephesians .
seeing then that these things can not be gainsaid , ye ought to be quiet , and to do nothing rash .
for ye have brought hither these men , who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess .
but if ye seek anything about other matters , it shall be settled in the regular assembly .
and when he had thus spoken , he dismissed the assembly .
and after the uproar ceased , paul having sent for the disciples and exhorted them , took leave of them , and departed to go into macedonia .
and when he had gone through those parts , and had given them much exhortation , he came into greece .
but these had gone before , and were waiting for us at troas .
and we sailed away from philippi after the days of unleavened bread , and came unto them to troas in five days ; where we tarried seven days .
and there were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered together .
and paul went down , and fell on him , and embracing him said , make ye no ado ; for his life is in him .
and they brought the lad alive , and were not a little comforted .
and when he met us at assos , we took him in , and came to mitylene .
and from miletus he sent to ephesus , and called to him the elders of the church .
and when they were come to him , he said unto them ,
serving the lord with all lowliness of mind , and with tears , and with trials which befell me by the plots of the jews ;
how i shrank not from declaring unto you anything that was profitable , and teaching you publicly , and from house to house ,
testifying both to jews and to greeks repentance toward god , and faith toward our lord jesus christ .
and now , behold , i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem , not knowing the things that shall befall me there :
save that the holy spirit testifieth unto me in every city , saying that bonds and afflictions abide me .
and now , behold , i know that ye all , among whom i went about preaching the kingdom , shall see my face no more .
wherefore i testify unto you this day , that i am pure from the blood of all men .
for i shrank not from declaring unto you the whole counsel of god .
i know that after my departing grievous wolves shall enter in among you , not sparing the flock ;
and from among your own selves shall men arise , speaking perverse things , to draw away the disciples after them .
wherefore watch ye , remembering that by the space of three years i ceased not to admonish every one night and day with tears .
i coveted no man ’ s silver , or gold , or apparel .
ye yourselves know that these hands ministered unto my necessities , and to them that were with me .
and when he had thus spoken , he kneeled down and prayed with them all .
and they all wept sore , and fell on paul ’ s neck and kissed him ,
and having found a ship crossing over unto phoenicia , we went aboard , and set sail .
and having found the disciples , we tarried there seven days : and these said to paul through the spirit , that he should not set foot in jerusalem .
and we went on board the ship , but they returned home again .
and when we had finished the voyage from tyre , we arrived at ptolemais ; and we saluted the brethren , and abode with them one day .
now this man had four virgin daughters , who prophesied .
and as we tarried there some days , there came down from judaea a certain prophet , named agabus .
and when we heard these things , both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to jerusalem .
and when he would not be persuaded , we ceased , saying , the will of the lord be done .
and after these days we took up our baggage and went up to jerusalem .
and when we were come to jerusalem , the brethren received us gladly .
and the day following paul went in with us unto james ; and all the elders were present .
and when he had saluted them , he rehearsed one by one the things which god had wrought among the gentiles through his ministry .
what is it therefore ? they will certainly hear that thou art come .
do therefore this that we say to thee : we have four men that have a vow on them ;
for they had before seen with him in the city trophimus the ephesian , whom they supposed that paul had brought into the temple .
and as they were seeking to kill him , tidings came up to the chief captain of the band , that all jerusalem was in confusion .
and when he came upon the stairs , so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the crowd ;
for the multitude of the people followed after , crying out , away with him .
art thou not then the egyptian , who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the assassins ?
brethren and fathers , hear ye the defence which i now make unto you .
and when they heard that he spake unto them in the hebrew language , they were the more quiet : and he saith ,
and i persecuted this way unto the death , binding and delivering into prisons both men and women .
and i fell unto the ground , and heard a voice saying unto me , saul , saul , why persecutest thou me ?
and i answered , who art thou , lord ? and he said unto me , i am jesus of nazareth , whom thou persecutest .
and they that were with me beheld indeed the light , but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me .
and when i could not see for the glory of that light , being led by the hand of them that were with me i came into damascus .
and one ananias , a devout man according to the law , well reported of by all the jews that dwelt there ,
came unto me , and standing by me said unto me , brother saul , receive thy sight . and in that very hour i looked up on him .
for thou shalt be a witness for him unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard .
and now why tarriest thou ? arise , and be baptized , and wash away thy sins , calling on his name .
and it came to pass , that , when i had returned to jerusalem , and while i prayed in the temple , i fell into a trance ,
and saw him saying unto me , make haste , and get thee quickly out of jerusalem ; because they will not receive of thee testimony concerning me .
and i said , lord , they themselves know that i imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee :
and when the blood of stephen thy witness was shed , i also was standing by , and consenting , and keeping the garments of them that slew him .
and he said unto me , depart : for i will send thee forth far hence unto the gentiles .
and as they cried out , and threw off their garments , and cast dust into the air ,
and the chief captain came and said unto him , tell me , art thou a roman ? and he said , yea .
and the chief captain answered , with a great sum obtained i this citizenship . and paul said , but i am a roman born .
and paul , looking stedfastly on the council , said , brethren , i have lived before god in all good conscience until this day .
and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth .
and they that stood by said , revilest thou god ’ s high priest ?
and when he had so said , there arose a dissension between the pharisees and sadducees ; and the assembly was divided .
for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection , neither angel , nor spirit ; but the pharisees confess both .
and they were more than forty that made this conspiracy .
but paul ’ s sister ’ s son heard of their lying in wait , and he came and entered into the castle and told paul .
and paul called unto him one of the centurions , and said , bring this young man unto the chief captain ; for he hath something to tell him .
and the chief captain took him by the hand , and going aside asked him privately , what is it that thou hast to tell me ?
so the chief captain let the young man go , charging him , tell no man that thou hast signified these things to me .
and he bade them provide beasts , that they might set paul thereon , and bring him safe unto felix the governor .
and he wrote a letter after this form :
claudius lysias unto the most excellent governor felix , greeting .
and desiring to know the cause wherefore they accused him , i brought him down unto their council :
whom i found to be accused about questions of their law , but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds .
so the soldiers , as it was commanded them , took paul and brought him by night to antipatris .
but on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him , and returned to the castle :
and they , when they came to caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor , presented paul also before him .
and when he had read it , he asked of what province he was ; and when he understood that he was of cilicia ,
i will hear thee fully , said he , when thine accusers also are come : and he commanded him to be kept in herod ’ s palace .
and after five days the high priest ananias came down with certain elders , and with an orator , one tertullus ; and they informed the governor against paul .
and when he was called , tertullus began to accuse him , saying ,
we accept it in all ways and in all places , most excellent felix , with all thankfulness .
but , that i be not further tedious unto thee , i entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words .
who moreover assayed to profane the temple : on whom also we laid hold :
from whom thou wilt be able , by examining him thyself , to take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him .
and the jews also joined in the charge , affirming that these things were so .
and when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak , paul answered ,
seeing that thou canst take knowledge that it is not more than twelve days since i went up to worship at jerusalem :
and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd , nor in the synagogues , nor in the city .
neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me .
having hope toward god , which these also themselves look for , that there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust .
herein i also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offence toward god and men always .
now after some years i came to bring alms to my nation , and offerings :
amidst which they found me purified in the temple , with no crowd , nor yet with tumult : but there were certain jews from asia—
who ought to have been here before thee , and to make accusation , if they had aught against me .
or else let these men themselves say what wrong-doing they found when i stood before the council ,
he hoped withal that money would be given him of paul : wherefore also he sent for him the oftener , and communed with him .
but when two years were fulfilled , felix was succeeded by porcius festus ; and desiring to gain favor with the jews , felix left paul in bonds .
festus therefore , having come into the province , after three days went up to jerusalem from caesarea .
and the chief priests and the principal men of the jews informed him against paul ; and they besought him ,
asking a favor against him , that he would send for him to jerusalem ; laying a plot to kill him on the way .
howbeit festus answered , that paul was kept in charge at caesarea , and that he himself was about to depart thither shortly .
while paul said in his defence , neither against the law of the jews , nor against the temple , nor against caesar , have i sinned at all .
then festus , when he had conferred with the council , answered , thou hast appealed unto caesar : unto caesar shalt thou go .
now when certain days were passed , agrippa the king and bernice arrived at caesarea , and saluted festus .
about whom , when i was at jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me , asking for sentence against him .
concerning whom , when the accusers stood up , they brought no charge of such evil things as i supposed ;
but had certain questions against him of their own religion , and of one jesus , who was dead , whom paul affirmed to be alive .
and i , being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things , asked whether he would go to jerusalem and there be judged of these matters .
but when paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor , i commanded him to be kept till i should send him to caesar .
and agrippa said unto festus , i also could wish to hear the man myself . to-morrow , saith he , thou shalt hear him .
but i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death : and as he himself appealed to the emperor i determined to send him .
for it seemeth to me unreasonable , in sending a prisoner , not withal to signify the charges against him .
and agrippa said unto paul , thou art permitted to speak for thyself . then paul stretched forth his hand , and made his defence :
especially because thou art expert in all customs and questions which are among the jews : wherefore i beseech thee to hear me patiently .
my manner of life then from my youth up , which was from the beginning among mine own nation and at jerusalem , know all the jews ;
having knowledge of me from the first , if they be willing to testify , that after the straitest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee .
and now i stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made of god unto our fathers ;
why is it judged incredible with you , if god doth raise the dead ?
i verily thought with myself that i ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth .
whereupon as i journeyed to damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests ,
and i said , who art thou , lord ? and the lord said , i am jesus whom thou persecutest .
delivering thee from the people , and from the gentiles , unto whom i send thee ,
wherefore , o king agrippa , i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision :
for this cause the jews seized me in the temple , and assayed to kill me .
how that the christ must suffer , and how that he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim light both to the people and to the gentiles .
and as he thus made his defence , festus saith with a loud voice , paul , thou art mad ; thy much learning is turning thee mad .
but paul saith , i am not mad , most excellent festus ; but speak forth words of truth and soberness .
king agrippa , believest thou the prophets ? i know that thou believest .
and agrippa said unto paul , with but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me a christian .
and the king rose up , and the governor , and bernice , and they that sat with them :
and when they had withdrawn , they spake one to another , saying , this man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds .
and agrippa said unto festus , this man might have been set at liberty , if he had not appealed unto caesar .
and when it was determined that we should sail for italy , they delivered paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named julius , of the augustan band .
and the next day we touched at sidon : and julius treated paul kindly , and gave him leave to go unto his friends and refresh himself .
and putting to sea from thence , we sailed under the lee of cyprus , because the winds were contrary .
and when we had sailed across the sea which is off cilicia and pamphylia , we came to myra , a city of lycia .
and there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sailing for italy ; and he put us therein .
and with difficulty coasting along it we came unto a certain place called fair havens ; nigh whereunto was the city of lasea .
and when much time was spent , and the voyage was now dangerous , because the fast was now already gone by , paul admonished them ,
but the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship , than to those things which were spoken by paul .
and when the south wind blew softly , supposing that they had obtained their purpose , they weighed anchor and sailed along crete , close in shore .
but after no long time there beat down from it a tempestuous wind , which is called euraquilo :
and when the ship was caught , and could not face the wind , we gave way to it , and were driven .
and running under the lee of a small island called cauda , we were able , with difficulty , to secure the boat :
and as we labored exceedingly with the storm , the next day they began to throw the freight overboard ;
and the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship .
and now i exhort you to be of good cheer ; for there shall be no loss of life among you , but only of the ship .
for there stood by me this night an angel of the god whose i am , whom also i serve ,
saying , fear not , paul ; thou must stand before caesar : and lo , god hath granted thee all them that sail with thee .
wherefore , sirs , be of good cheer : for i believe god , that it shall be even so as it hath been spoken unto me .
but we must be cast upon a certain island .
and they sounded , and found twenty fathoms ; and after a little space , they sounded again , and found fifteen fathoms .
and fearing lest haply we should be cast ashore on rocky ground , they let go four anchors from the stern , and wished for the day .
paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers , except these abide in the ship , ye can not be saved .
then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat , and let her fall off .
then were they all of good cheer , and themselves also took food .
and we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls .
and when they had eaten enough , they lightened the ship , throwing out the wheat into the sea .
and the soldiers ’ counsel was to kill the prisoners , lest any of them should swim out , and escape .
and when we were escaped , then we knew that the island was called melita .
howbeit he shook off the creature into the fire , and took no harm .
and when this was done , the rest also that had diseases in the island came , and were cured :
who also honored us with many honors ; and when we sailed , they put on board such things as we needed .
and after three months we set sail in a ship of alexandria which had wintered in the island , whose sign was the twin brothers .
and touching at syracuse , we tarried there three days .
where we found brethren , and were entreated to tarry with them seven days : and so we came to rome .
and when we entered into rome , paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him .
who , when they had examined me , desired to set me at liberty , because there was no cause of death in me .
but when the jews spake against it , i was constrained to appeal unto caesar ; not that i had aught whereof to accuse my nation .
for this cause therefore did i entreat you to see and to speak with me : for because of the hope of israel i am bound with this chain .
but we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest : for as concerning this sect , it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against .
and some believed the things which were spoken , and some disbelieved .
for this people ’ s heart is waxed gross ,
be it known therefore unto you , that this salvation of god is sent unto the gentiles : they will also hear .
and he abode two whole years in his own hired dwelling , and received all that went in unto him ,
preaching the kingdom of god , and teaching the things concerning the lord jesus christ with all boldness , none forbidding him .
but i will send a fire into the house of hazael , and it shall devour the palaces of ben-hadad .
but i will send a fire on the wall of gaza , and it shall devour the palaces thereof .
but i will send a fire on the wall of tyre , and it shall devour the palaces thereof .
but i will send a fire upon teman , and it shall devour the palaces of bozrah .
and their king shall go into captivity , he and his princes together , saith jehovah .
and i will cut off the judge from the midst thereof , and will slay all the princes thereof with him , saith jehovah .
but i will send a fire upon judah , and it shall devour the palaces of jerusalem .
also i brought you up out of the land of egypt , and led you forty years in the wilderness , to possess the land of the amorite .
but ye gave the nazirites wine to drink , and commanded the prophets , saying , prophesy not .
behold , i will press you in your place , as a cart presseth that is full of sheaves .
and flight shall perish from the swift ; and the strong shall not strengthen his force ; neither shall the mighty deliver himself ;
and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day , saith jehovah .
you only have i known of all the families of the earth : therefore i will visit upon you all your iniquities .
shall two walk together , except they have agreed ?
will a lion roar in the forest , when he hath no prey ? will a young lion cry out of his den , if he have taken nothing ?
shall the trumpet be blown in a city , and the people not be afraid ? shall evil befall a city , and jehovah hath not done it ?
surely the lord jehovah will do nothing , except he reveal his secret unto his servants the prophets .
the lion hath roared ; who will not fear ? the lord jehovah hath spoken ; who can but prophesy ?
for they know not to do right , saith jehovah , who store up violence and robbery in their palaces .
hear ye , and testify against the house of jacob , saith the lord jehovah , the god of hosts .
and i will smite the winter-house with the summer-house ; and the houses of ivory shall perish , and the great houses shall have an end , saith jehovah .
and ye shall go out at the breaches , every one straight before her ; and ye shall cast yourselves into harmon , saith jehovah .
come to beth-el , and transgress ; to gilgal , and multiply transgression ; and bring your sacrifices every morning , and your tithes every three days ;
so two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water , and were not satisfied : yet have ye not returned unto me , saith jehovah .
therefore thus will i do unto thee , o israel ; and because i will do this unto thee , prepare to meet thy god , o israel .
hear ye this word which i take up for a lamentation over you , o house of israel .
the virgin of israel is fallen ; she shall no more rise : she is cast down upon her land ; there is none to raise her up .
for thus saith jehovah unto the house of israel , seek ye me , and ye shall live ;
ye who turn justice to wormwood , and cast down righteousness to the earth ,
that bringeth sudden destruction upon the strong , so that destruction cometh upon the fortress .
they hate him that reproveth in the gate , and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly .
therefore he that is prudent shall keep silence in such a time ; for it is an evil time .
seek good , and not evil , that ye may live ; and so jehovah , the god of hosts , will be with you , as ye say .
and in all vineyards shall be wailing ; for i will pass through the midst of thee , saith jehovah .
woe unto you that desire the day of jehovah ! wherefore would ye have the day of jehovah ? it is darkness , and not light .
shall not the day of jehovah be darkness , and not light ? even very dark , and no brightness in it ?
i hate , i despise your feasts , and i will take no delight in your solemn assemblies .
yea , though ye offer me your burnt-offerings and meal-offerings , i will not accept them ; neither will i regard the peace-offerings of your fat beasts .
take thou away from me the noise of thy songs ; for i will not hear the melody of thy viols .
but let justice roll down as waters , and righteousness as a mighty stream .
did ye bring unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years , o house of israel ?
yea , ye have borne the tabernacle of your king and the shrine of your images , the star of your god , which ye made to yourselves .
therefore will i cause you to go into captivity beyond damascus , saith jehovah , whose name is the god of hosts .
—ye that put far away the evil day , and cause the seat of violence to come near ;
that sing idle songs to the sound of the viol ; that invent for themselves instruments of music , like david ;
that drink wine in bowls , and anoint themselves with the chief oils ; but they are not grieved for the affliction of joseph .
therefore shall they now go captive with the first that go captive ; and the revelry of them that stretched themselves shall pass away .
and it shall come to pass , if there remain ten men in one house , that they shall die .
for , behold , jehovah commandeth , and the great house shall be smitten with breaches , and the little house with clefts .
shall horses run upon the rock ? will one plow there with oxen ? that ye have turned justice into gall , and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood ;
ye that rejoice in a thing of nought , that say , have we not taken to us horns by our own strength ?
jehovah repented concerning this : it shall not be , saith jehovah .
then said i , o lord jehovah , cease , i beseech thee : how shall jacob stand ? for he is small .
jehovah repented concerning this : this also shall not be , saith the lord jehovah .
thus he showed me : and , behold , the lord stood beside a wall made by a plumb-line , with a plumb-line in his hand .
for thus amos saith , jeroboam shall die by the sword , and israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land .
also amaziah said unto amos , o thou seer , go , flee thou away into the land of judah , and there eat bread , and prophesy there :
but prophesy not again any more at beth-el ; for it is the king ’ s sanctuary , and it is a royal house .
and jehovah took me from following the flock , and jehovah said unto me , go , prophesy unto my people israel .
now therefore hear thou the word of jehovah : thou sayest , prophesy not against israel , and drop not thy word against the house of isaac ;
thus the lord jehovah showed me : and , behold , a basket of summer fruit .
hear this , o ye that would swallow up the needy , and cause the poor of the land to fail ,
that we may buy the poor for silver , and the needy for a pair of shoes , and sell the refuse of the wheat ?
jehovah hath sworn by the excellency of jacob , surely i will never forget any of their works .
in that day shall the fair virgins and the young men faint for thirst .
though they dig into sheol , thence shall my hand take them ; and though they climb up to heaven , thence will i bring them down .
all the sinners of my people shall die by the sword , who say , the evil shall not overtake nor meet us .
that they may possess the remnant of edom , and all the nations that are called by my name , saith jehovah that doeth this .
paul , an apostle of christ jesus through the will of god , and timothy our brother ,
to the saints and faithful brethren in christ that are at colossae : grace to you and peace from god our father .
we give thanks to god the father of our lord jesus christ , praying always for you ,
having heard of your faith in christ jesus , and of the love which ye have toward all the saints ,
because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens , whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel ,
even as ye learned of epaphras our beloved fellow-servant , who is a faithful minister of christ on our behalf ,
who also declared unto us your love in the spirit .
to walk worthily of the lord unto all pleasing , bearing fruit in every good work , and increasing in the knowledge of god ;
strengthened with all power , according to the might of his glory , unto all patience and longsuffering with joy ;
giving thanks unto the father , who made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light ;
who delivered us out of the power of darkness , and translated us into the kingdom of the son of his love ;
in whom we have our redemption , the forgiveness of our sins :
who is the image of the invisible god , the firstborn of all creation ;
and he is before all things , and in him all things consist .
for it was the good pleasure of the father that in him should all the fulness dwell ;
and you , being in time past alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works ,
yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death , to present you holy and without blemish and unreproveable before him :
whereof i was made a minister , according to the dispensation of god which was given me to you-ward , to fulfil the word of god ,
even the mystery which hath been hid for ages and generations : but now hath it been manifested to his saints ,
whom we proclaim , admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom , that we may present every man perfect in christ ;
whereunto i labor also , striving according to his working , which worketh in me mightily .
in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden .
this i say , that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech .
as therefore ye received christ jesus the lord , so walk in him ,
rooted and builded up in him , and established in your faith , even as ye were taught , abounding in thanksgiving .
for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily ,
and in him ye are made full , who is the head of all principality and power :
having been buried with him in baptism , wherein ye were also raised with him through faith in the working of god , who raised him from the dead .
having despoiled the principalities and the powers , he made a show of them openly , triumphing over them in it .
let no man therefore judge you in meat , or in drink , or in respect of a feast day or a new moon or a sabbath day :
which are a shadow of the things to come ; but the body is christ ’ s .
if ye died with christ from the rudiments of the world , why , as though living in the world , do ye subject yourselves to ordinances ,
handle not , nor taste , nor touch
( all which things are to perish with the using ) , after the precepts and doctrines of men ?
if then ye were raised together with christ , seek the things that are above , where christ is , seated on the right hand of god .
set your mind on the things that are above , not on the things that are upon the earth .
for ye died , and your life is hid with christ in god .
when christ , who is our life , shall be manifested , then shall ye also with him be manifested in glory .
put to death therefore your members which are upon the earth : fornication , uncleanness , passion , evil desire , and covetousness , which is idolatry ;
for which things ’ sake cometh the wrath of god upon the sons of disobedience :
wherein ye also once walked , when ye lived in these things ;
but now do ye also put them all away : anger , wrath , malice , railing , shameful speaking out of your mouth :
lie not one to another ; seeing that ye have put off the old man with his doings ,
and have put on the new man , that is being renewed unto knowledge after the image of him that created him :
where there can not be greek and jew , circumcision and uncircumcision , barbarian , scythian , bondman , freeman ; but christ is all , and in all .
put on therefore , as god ’ s elect , holy and beloved , a heart of compassion , kindness , lowliness , meekness , longsuffering ;
forbearing one another , and forgiving each other , if any man have a complaint against any ; even as the lord forgave you , so also do ye :
and above all these things put on love , which is the bond of perfectness .
and let the peace of christ rule in your hearts , to the which also ye were called in one body ; and be ye thankful .
and whatsoever ye do , in word or in deed , do all in the name of the lord jesus , giving thanks to god the father through him .
wives , be in subjection to your husbands , as is fitting in the lord .
husbands , love your wives , and be not bitter against them .
children , obey your parents in all things , for this is well-pleasing in the lord .
fathers , provoke not your children , that they be not discouraged .
whatsoever ye do , work heartily , as unto the lord , and not unto men ;
knowing that from the lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance : ye serve the lord christ .
for he that doeth wrong shall receive again for the wrong that he hath done : and there is no respect of persons .
masters , render unto your servants that which is just and equal ; knowing that ye also have a master in heaven .
continue stedfastly in prayer , watching therein with thanksgiving ;
that i may make it manifest , as i ought to speak .
walk in wisdom toward them that are without , redeeming the time .
let your speech be always with grace , seasoned with salt , that ye may know how ye ought to answer each one .
all my affairs shall tychicus make known unto you , the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-servant in the lord :
whom i have sent unto you for this very purpose , that ye may know our state , and that he may comfort your hearts ;
together with onesimus , the faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you . they shall make known unto you all things that are done here .
aristarchus my fellow-prisoner saluteth you , and mark , the cousin of barnabas ( touching whom ye received commandments ; if he come unto you , receive him ) ,
for i bear him witness , that he hath much labor for you , and for them in laodicea , and for them in hierapolis .
luke , the beloved physician , and demas salute you .
salute the brethren that are in laodicea , and nymphas , and the church that is in their house .
and say to archippus , take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the lord , that thou fulfil it .
the salutation of me paul with mine own hand . remember my bonds . grace be with you .
paul , and silvanus , and timothy , unto the church of the thessalonians in god the father and the lord jesus christ : grace to you and peace .
we give thanks to god always for you all , making mention of you in our prayers ;
remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our lord jesus christ , before our god and father ;
knowing , brethren beloved of god , your election ,
and ye became imitators of us , and of the lord , having received the word in much affliction , with joy of the holy spirit ;
so that ye became an ensample to all that believe in macedonia and in achaia .
and to wait for his son from heaven , whom he raised from the dead , even jesus , who delivereth us from the wrath to come .
for yourselves , brethren , know our entering in unto you , that it hath not been found vain :
for our exhortation is not of error , nor of uncleanness , nor in guile :
for neither at any time were we found using words of flattery , as ye know , nor a cloak of covetousness , god is witness ;
nor seeking glory of men , neither from you nor from others , when we might have claimed authority as apostles of christ .
but we were gentle in the midst of you , as when a nurse cherisheth her own children :
ye are witnesses , and god also , how holily and righteously and unblamably we behaved ourselves toward you that believe :
as ye know how we dealt with each one of you , as a father with his own children , exhorting you , and encouraging you , and testifying ,
to the end that ye should walk worthily of god , who calleth you into his own kingdom and glory .
who both killed the lord jesus and the prophets , and drove out us , and please not god , and are contrary to all men ;
because we would fain have come unto you , i paul once and again ; and satan hindered us .
for what is our hope , or joy , or crown of glorying ? are not even ye , before our lord jesus at his coming ?
for ye are our glory and our joy .
wherefore when we could no longer forbear , we thought it good to be left behind at athens alone ;
and sent timothy , our brother and god ’ s minister in the gospel of christ , to establish you , and to comfort you concerning your faith ;
that no man be moved by these afflictions ; for yourselves know that hereunto we are appointed .
for this cause , brethren , we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith :
for now we live , if ye stand fast in the lord .
for what thanksgiving can we render again unto god for you , for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our god ;
night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face , and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith ?
now may our god and father himself , and our lord jesus , direct our way unto you :
and the lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we also do toward you ;
to the end he may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before our god and father , at the coming of our lord jesus with all his saints .
for ye know what charge we gave you through the lord jesus .
for this is the will of god , even your sanctification , that ye abstain from fornication ;
that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor ,
not in the passion of lust , even as the gentiles who know not god ;
for god called us not for uncleanness , but in sanctification .
therefore he that rejecteth , rejecteth not man , but god , who giveth his holy spirit unto you .
but concerning love of the brethren ye have no need that one write unto you : for ye yourselves are taught of god to love one another ;
for indeed ye do it toward all the brethren that are in all macedonia . but we exhort you , brethren , that ye abound more and more ;
and that ye study to be quiet , and to do your own business , and to work with your hands , even as we charged you ;
that ye may walk becomingly toward them that are without , and may have need of nothing .
for if we believe that jesus died and rose again , even so them also that are fallen asleep in jesus will god bring with him .
wherefore comfort one another with these words .
but concerning the times and the seasons , brethren , ye have no need that aught be written unto you .
for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night .
but ye , brethren , are not in darkness , that that day should overtake you as a thief :
for ye are all sons of light , and sons of the day : we are not of the night , nor of darkness ;
so then let us not sleep , as do the rest , but let us watch and be sober .
for they that sleep sleep in the night ; and they that are drunken are drunken in the night .
for god appointed us not unto wrath , but unto the obtaining of salvation through our lord jesus christ ,
who died for us , that , whether we wake or sleep , we should live together with him .
wherefore exhort one another , and build each other up , even as also ye do .
but we beseech you , brethren , to know them that labor among you , and are over you in the lord , and admonish you ;
and to esteem them exceeding highly in love for their work ’ s sake . be at peace among yourselves .
and we exhort you , brethren , admonish the disorderly , encourage the faint-hearted , support the weak , be longsuffering toward all .
see that none render unto any one evil for evil ; but always follow after that which is good , one toward another , and toward all .
in everything give thanks : for this is the will of god in christ jesus to you-ward .
quench not the spirit ;
prove all things ; hold fast that which is good ;
abstain from every form of evil .
faithful is he that calleth you , who will also do it .
brethren , pray for us .
salute all the brethren with a holy kiss .
i adjure you by the lord that this epistle be read unto all the brethren .
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you .
paul , and silvanus , and timothy , unto the church of the thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ ;
grace to you and peace from god the father and the lord jesus christ .
so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of god for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which ye endure ;
if so be that it is a righteous thing with god to recompense affliction to them that afflict you ,
and to you that are afflicted rest with us , at the revelation of the lord jesus from heaven with the angels of his power in flaming fire ,
rendering vengeance to them that know not god , and to them that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus :
who shall suffer punishment , even eternal destruction from the face of the lord and from the glory of his might ,
now we beseech you , brethren , touching the coming of our lord jesus christ , and our gathering together unto him ;
remember ye not , that , when i was yet with you , i told you these things ?
and now ye know that which restraineth , to the end that he may be revealed in his own season .
for the mystery of lawlessness doth already work : only there is one that restraineth now , until he be taken out of the way .
even he , whose coming is according to the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders ,
and with all deceit of unrighteousness for them that perish ; because they received not the love of the truth , that they might be saved .
and for this cause god sendeth them a working of error , that they should believe a lie :
that they all might be judged who believed not the truth , but had pleasure in unrighteousness .
whereunto he called you through our gospel , to the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus christ .
so then , brethren , stand fast , and hold the traditions which ye were taught , whether by word , or by epistle of ours .
now our lord jesus christ himself , and god our father who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace ,
comfort your hearts and establish them in every good work and word .
finally , brethren , pray for us , that the word of the lord may run and be glorified , even as also it is with you ;
and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men ; for all have not faith .
but the lord is faithful , who shall establish you , and guard you from the evil one .
and we have confidence in the lord touching you , that ye both do and will do the things which we command .
and the lord direct your hearts into the love of god , and into the patience of christ .
for yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us : for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you ;
not because we have not the right , but to make ourselves an ensample unto you , that ye should imitate us .
for even when we were with you , this we commanded you , if any will not work , neither let him eat .
for we hear of some that walk among you disorderly , that work not at all , but are busybodies .
now them that are such we command and exhort in the lord jesus christ , that with quietness they work , and eat their own bread .
but ye , brethren , be not weary in well-doing .
and yet count him not as an enemy , but admonish him as a brother .
now the lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways . the lord be with you all .
the salutation of me paul with mine own hand , which is the token in every epistle : so i write .
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all .
paul , an apostle of christ jesus according to the commandment of god our saviour , and christ jesus our hope ;
unto timothy , my true child in faith : grace , mercy , peace , from god the father and christ jesus our lord .
as i exhorted thee to tarry at ephesus , when i was going into macedonia , that thou mightest charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine ,
neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies , which minister questionings , rather than a dispensation of god which is in faith ; so do i now .
but the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned :
from which things some having swerved have turned aside unto vain talking ;
desiring to be teachers of the law , though they understand neither what they say , nor whereof they confidently affirm .
but we know that the law is good , if a man use it lawfully ,
according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed god , which was committed to my trust .
i thank him that enabled me , even christ jesus our lord , for that he counted me faithful , appointing me to his service ;
though i was before a blasphemer , and a persecutor , and injurious : howbeit i obtained mercy , because i did it ignorantly in unbelief ;
and the grace of our lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in christ jesus .
faithful is the saying , and worthy of all acceptation , that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners ; of whom i am chief :
now unto the king eternal , immortal , invisible , the only god , be honor and glory for ever and ever . amen .
holding faith and a good conscience ; which some having thrust from them made shipwreck concerning the faith :
of whom is hymenaeus and alexander ; whom i delivered unto satan , that they might be taught not to blaspheme .
i exhort therefore , first of all , that supplications , prayers , intercessions , thanksgivings , be made for all men ;
for kings and all that are in high place ; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity .
this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our saviour ;
who would have all men to be saved , and come to the knowledge of the truth .
for there is one god , one mediator also between god and men , himself man , christ jesus ,
who gave himself a ransom for all ; the testimony to be borne in its own times ;
whereunto i was appointed a preacher and an apostle ( i speak the truth , i lie not ) , a teacher of the gentiles in faith and truth .
i desire therefore that the men pray in every place , lifting up holy hands , without wrath and disputing .
in like manner , that women adorn themselves in modest apparel , with shamefastness and sobriety ; not with braided hair , and gold or pearls or costly raiment ;
but ( which becometh women professing godliness ) through good works .
let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection .
but i permit not a woman to teach , nor to have dominion over a man , but to be in quietness .
for adam was first formed , then eve ;
and adam was not beguiled , but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression :
but she shall be saved through her child-bearing , if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety .
faithful is the saying , if a man seeketh the office of a bishop , he desireth a good work .
the bishop therefore must be without reproach , the husband of one wife , temperate , sober-minded , orderly , given to hospitality , apt to teach ;
no brawler , no striker ; but gentle , not contentious , no lover of money ;
one that ruleth well his own house , having his children in subjection with all gravity ;
( but if a man knoweth not how to rule his own house , how shall he take care of the church of god ? )
not a novice , lest being puffed up he fall into the condemnation of the devil .
moreover he must have good testimony from them that are without ; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil .
deacons in like manner must be grave , not double-tongued , not given to much wine , not greedy of filthy lucre ;
holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience .
and let these also first be proved ; then let them serve as deacons , if they be blameless .
women in like manner must be grave , not slanderers , temperate , faithful in all things .
let deacons be husbands of one wife , ruling their children and their own houses well .
for they that have served well as deacons gain to themselves a good standing , and great boldness in the faith which is in christ jesus .
these things write i unto thee , hoping to come unto thee shortly ;
and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness ;
but the spirit saith expressly , that in later times some shall fall away from the faith , giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons ,
through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies , branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron ;
forbidding to marry , and commanding to abstain from meats , which god created to be received with thanksgiving by them that believe and know the truth .
for every creature of god is good , and nothing is to be rejected , if it be received with thanksgiving :
for it is sanctified through the word of god and prayer .
but refuse profane and old wives ’ fables . and exercise thyself unto godliness :
faithful is the saying , and worthy of all acceptation .
these things command and teach .
till i come , give heed to reading , to exhortation , to teaching .
neglect not the gift that is in thee , which was given thee by prophecy , with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery .
be diligent in these things ; give thyself wholly to them ; that thy progress may be manifest unto all .
take heed to thyself , and to thy teaching . continue in these things ; for in doing this thou shalt save both thyself and them that hear thee .
rebuke not an elder , but exhort him as a father ; the younger men as brethren :
the elder women as mothers ; the younger as sisters , in all purity .
honor widows that are widows indeed .
now she that is a widow indeed , and desolate , hath her hope set on god , and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day .
but she that giveth herself to pleasure is dead while she liveth .
these things also command , that they may be without reproach .
but if any provideth not for his own , and specially his own household , he hath denied the faith , and is worse than an unbeliever .
let none be enrolled as a widow under threescore years old , having been the wife of one man ,
but younger widows refuse : for when they have waxed wanton against christ , they desire to marry ;
having condemnation , because they have rejected their first pledge .
i desire therefore that the younger widows marry , bear children , rule the household , give no occasion to the adversary for reviling :
for already some are turned aside after satan .
let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor , especially those who labor in the word and in teaching .
for the scripture saith , thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn . and , the laborer is worthy of his hire .
against an elder receive not an accusation , except at the mouth of two or three witnesses .
them that sin reprove in the sight of all , that the rest also may be in fear .
lay hands hastily on no man , neither be partaker of other men ’ s sins : keep thyself pure .
be no longer a drinker of water , but use a little wine for thy stomach ’ s sake and thine often infirmities .
some men ’ s sins are evident , going before unto judgment ; and some men also they follow after .
in like manner also there are good works that are evident ; and such as are otherwise can not be hid .
let as many as are servants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor , that the name of god and the doctrine be not blasphemed .
he is puffed up , knowing nothing , but doting about questionings and disputes of words , whereof cometh envy , strife , railings , evil surmisings ,
wranglings of men corrupted in mind and bereft of the truth , supposing that godliness is a way of gain .
but godliness with contentment is great gain :
for we brought nothing into the world , for neither can we carry anything out ;
but having food and covering we shall be therewith content .
but thou , o man of god , flee these things ; and follow after righteousness , godliness , faith , love , patience , meekness .
i charge thee in the sight of god , who giveth life to all things , and of christ jesus , who before pontius pilate witnessed the good confession ;
that thou keep the commandment , without spot , without reproach , until the appearing of our lord jesus christ :
which in its own times he shall show , who is the blessed and only potentate , the king of kings , and lord of lords ;
who only hath immortality , dwelling in light unapproachable ; whom no man hath seen , nor can see : to whom be honor and power eternal . amen .
that they do good , that they be rich in good works , that they be ready to distribute , willing to communicate ;
laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come , that they may lay hold on the life which is life indeed .
o timothy , guard that which is committed unto thee , turning away from the profane babblings and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called ;
which some professing have erred concerning the faith .
paul , an apostle of christ jesus through the will of god , according to the promise of the life which is in christ jesus ,
to timothy , my beloved child : grace , mercy , peace , from god the father and christ jesus our lord .
i thank god , whom i serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience , how unceasing is my remembrance of thee in my supplications , night and day
longing to see thee , remembering thy tears , that i may be filled with joy ;
for which cause i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god , which is in thee through the laying on of my hands .
for god gave us not a spirit of fearfulness ; but of power and love and discipline .
be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our lord , nor of me his prisoner : but suffer hardship with the gospel according to the power of god ;
but hath now been manifested by the appearing of our saviour christ jesus , who abolished death , and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel ,
whereunto i was appointed a preacher , and an apostle , and a teacher .
hold the pattern of sound words which thou hast heard from me , in faith and love which is in christ jesus .
that good thing which was committed unto thee guard through the holy spirit which dwelleth in us .
this thou knowest , that all that are in asia turned away from me ; of whom are phygelus and hermogenes .
the lord grant mercy unto the house of onesiphorus : for he oft refreshed me , and was not ashamed of my chain ;
but , when he was in rome , he sought me diligently , and found me
thou therefore , my child , be strengthened in the grace that is in christ jesus .
and the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses , the same commit thou to faithful men , who shall be able to teach others also .
suffer hardship with me , as a good soldier of christ jesus .
no soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of this life ; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier .
and if also a man contend in the games , he is not crowned , except he have contended lawfully .
the husbandman that laboreth must be the first to partake of the fruits .
consider what i say ; for the lord shall give thee understanding in all things .
remember jesus christ , risen from the dead , of the seed of david , according to my gospel :
wherein i suffer hardship unto bonds , as a malefactor ; but the word of god is not bound .
therefore i endure all things for the elect ’ s sake , that they also may obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory .
faithful is the saying : for if we died with him , we shall also live with him :
if we endure , we shall also reign with him : if we shall deny him , he also will deny us :
if we are faithless , he abideth faithful ; for he can not deny himself .
give diligence to present thyself approved unto god , a workman that needeth not to be ashamed , handling aright the word of truth .
but shun profane babblings : for they will proceed further in ungodliness ,
and their word will eat as doth a gangrene : of whom is hymenaeus and philetus ;
men who concerning the truth have erred , saying that the resurrection is past already , and overthrow the faith of some .
but flee youthful lusts , and follow after righteousness , faith , love , peace , with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart .
but foolish and ignorant questionings refuse , knowing that they gender strifes .
and the lord ’ s servant must not strive , but be gentle towards all , apt to teach , forbearing ,
in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves ; if peradventure god may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth ,
and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil , having been taken captive by him unto his will .
but know this , that in the last days grievous times shall come .
for men shall be lovers of self , lovers of money , boastful , haughty , railers , disobedient to parents , unthankful , unholy ,
without natural affection , implacable , slanderers , without self-control , fierce , no lovers of good ,
traitors , headstrong , puffed up , lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of god ;
holding a form of godliness , but having denied the power thereof : from these also turn away .
for of these are they that creep into houses , and take captive silly women laden with sins , led away by divers lusts ,
ever learning , and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth .
and even as jannes and jambres withstood moses , so do these also withstand the truth ; men corrupted in mind , reprobate concerning the faith .
but they shall proceed no further : for their folly shall be evident unto all men , as theirs also came to be .
but thou didst follow my teaching , conduct , purpose , faith , longsuffering , love , patience ,
yea , and all that would live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution .
but evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse , deceiving and being deceived .
but abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of , knowing of whom thou hast learned them ;
and that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus .
every scripture inspired of god is also profitable for teaching , for reproof , for correction , for instruction which is in righteousness :
that the man of god may be complete , furnished completely unto every good work .
preach the word ; be urgent in season , out of season ; reprove , rebuke , exhort , with all longsuffering and teaching .
for the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine ; but , having itching ears , will heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts ;
and will turn away their ears from the truth , and turn aside unto fables .
but be thou sober in all things , suffer hardship , do the work of an evangelist , fulfil thy ministry .
for i am already being offered , and the time of my departure is come .
i have fought the good fight , i have finished the course , i have kept the faith :
give diligence to come shortly unto me :
for demas forsook me , having loved this present world , and went to thessalonica ; crescens to galatia , titus to dalmatia .
only luke is with me . take mark , and bring him with thee ; for he is useful to me for ministering .
but tychicus i sent to ephesus .
the cloak that i left at troas with carpus , bring when thou comest , and the books , especially the parchments .
alexander the coppersmith did me much evil : the lord will render to him according to his works :
of whom do thou also beware ; for he greatly withstood our words .
at my first defence no one took my part , but all forsook me : may it not be laid to their account .
salute prisca and aquila , and the house of onesiphorus .
erastus remained at corinth : but trophimus i left at miletus sick .
give diligence to come before winter . eubulus saluteth thee , and pudens , and linus , and claudia , and all the brethren .
the lord be with thy spirit . grace be with you .
in the third year of the reign of jehoiakim king of judah came nebuchadnezzar king of babylon unto jerusalem , and besieged it .
now among these were , of the children of judah , daniel , hananiah , mishael , and azariah .
now god made daniel to find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs .
then said daniel to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over daniel , hananiah , mishael , and azariah :
prove thy servants , i beseech thee , ten days ; and let them give us pulse to eat , and water to drink .
so he hearkened unto them in this matter , and proved them ten days .
so the steward took away their dainties , and the wine that they should drink , and gave them pulse .
now as for these four youths , god gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom : and daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams .
and at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in , the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before nebuchadnezzar .
and daniel continued even unto the first year of king cyrus .
and in the second year of the reign of nebuchadnezzar , nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams ; and his spirit was troubled , and his sleep went from him .
and the king said unto them , i have dreamed a dream , and my spirit is troubled to know the dream .
they answered the second time and said , let the king tell his servants the dream , and we will show the interpretation .
the king answered and said , i know of a certainty that ye would gain time , because ye see the thing is gone from me .
for this cause the king was angry and very furious , and commanded to destroy all the wise men of babylon .
so the decree went forth , and the wise men were to be slain ; and they sought daniel and his companions to be slain .
and daniel went in , and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time , and he would show the king the interpretation .
then daniel went to his house , and made the thing known to hananiah , mishael , and azariah , his companions :
then was the secret revealed unto daniel in a vision of the night . then daniel blessed the god of heaven .
daniel answered and said , blessed be the name of god for ever and ever ; for wisdom and might are his .
he revealeth the deep and secret things ; he knoweth what is in the darkness , and the light dwelleth with him .
as for this image , its head was of fine gold , its breast and its arms of silver , its belly and its thighs of brass ,
its legs of iron , its feet part of iron , and part of clay .
this is the dream ; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king .
and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee ; and another third kingdom of brass , which shall bear rule over all the earth .
and as the toes of the feet were part of iron , and part of clay , so the kingdom shall be partly strong , and partly broken .
then the king nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face , and worshipped daniel , and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors unto him .
then the herald cried aloud , to you it is commanded , o peoples , nations , and languages ,
and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace .
wherefore at that time certain chaldeans came near , and brought accusation against the jews .
they answered and said to nebuchadnezzar the king , o king , live for ever .
and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth , shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace .
then nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring shadrach , meshach , and abed-nego . then they brought these men before the king .
shadrach , meshach , and abed-nego answered and said to the king , o nebuchadnezzar , we have no need to answer thee in this matter .
and he commanded certain mighty men that were in his army to bind shadrach , meshach , and abed-nego , and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace .
and these three men , shadrach , meshach , and abed-nego , fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
then the king promoted shadrach , meshach , and abed-nego in the province of babylon .
nebuchadnezzar the king , unto all the peoples , nations , and languages , that dwell in all the earth : peace be multiplied unto you .
it hath seemed good unto me to show the signs and wonders that the most high god hath wrought toward me .
how great are his signs ! and how mighty are his wonders ! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and his dominion is from generation to generation .
i , nebuchadnezzar , was at rest in my house , and flourishing in my palace .
i saw a dream which made me afraid ; and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me .
therefore made i a decree to bring in all the wise men of babylon before me , that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream .
the tree grew , and was strong , and the height thereof reached unto heaven , and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth .
i saw in the visions of my head upon my bed , and , behold , a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven .
let his heart be changed from man ’ s , and let a beast ’ s heart be given unto him ; and let seven times pass over him .
the tree that thou sawest , which grew , and was strong , whose height reached unto heaven , and the sight thereof to all the earth ;
this is the interpretation , o king , and it is the decree of the most high , which is come upon my lord the king :
all this came upon the king nebuchadnezzar .
at the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of babylon .
belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords , and drank wine before the thousand .
they drank wine , and praised the gods of gold , and of silver , of brass , of iron , of wood , and of stone .
then came in all the king ’ s wise men ; but they could not read the writing , nor make known to the king the interpretation .
then was king belshazzar greatly troubled , and his countenance was changed in him , and his lords were perplexed .
i have heard of thee , that the spirit of the gods is in thee , and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in thee .
o thou king , the most high god gave nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom , and greatness , and glory , and majesty :
and thou his son , o belshazzar , hast not humbled thy heart , though thou knewest all this ,
then was the part of the hand sent from before him , and this writing was inscribed .
and this is the writing that was inscribed : mene , mene , tekel , upharsin .
this is the interpretation of the thing : mene ; god hath numbered thy kingdom , and brought it to an end .
tekel ; thou art weighed in the balances , and art found wanting .
peres ; thy kingdom is divided , and given to the medes and persians .
in that night belshazzar the chaldean king was slain .
and darius the mede received the kingdom , being about threescore and two years old .
it pleased darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps , who should be throughout the whole kingdom ;
and over them three presidents , of whom daniel was one ; that these satraps might give account unto them , and that the king should have no damage .
then said these men , we shall not find any occasion against this daniel , except we find it against him concerning the law of his god .
then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king , and said thus unto him , king darius , live for ever .
wherefore king darius signed the writing and the interdict .
then these men assembled together , and found daniel making petition and supplication before his god .
then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fasting ; neither were instruments of music brought before him : and his sleep fled from him .
then the king arose very early in the morning , and went in haste unto the den of lions .
then said daniel unto the king , o king , live for ever .
then king darius wrote unto all the peoples , nations , and languages , that dwell in all the earth : peace be multiplied unto you .
he delivereth and rescueth , and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth , who hath delivered daniel from the power of the lions .
so this daniel prospered in the reign of darius , and in the reign of cyrus the persian .
daniel spake and said , i saw in my vision by night , and , behold , the four winds of heaven brake forth upon the great sea .
and four great beasts came up from the sea , diverse one from another .
and as for the rest of the beasts , their dominion was taken away : yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time .
as for me , daniel , my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
these great beasts , which are four , are four kings , that shall arise out of the earth .
but the saints of the most high shall receive the kingdom , and possess the kingdom for ever , even for ever and ever .
i beheld , and the same horn made war with the saints , and prevailed against them ;
until the ancient of days came , and judgment was given to the saints of the most high , and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom .
but the judgment shall be set , and they shall take away his dominion , to consume and to destroy it unto the end .
and he said unto me , unto two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings ; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed .
the ram which thou sawest , that had the two horns , they are the kings of media and persia .
and the rough he-goat is the king of greece : and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king .
in the first year of darius the son of ahasuerus , of the seed of the medes , who was made king over the realm of the chaldeans ,
and i set my face unto the lord god , to seek by prayer and supplications , with fasting and sackcloth and ashes .
we have sinned , and have dealt perversely , and have done wickedly , and have rebelled , even turning aside from thy precepts and from thine ordinances ;
o lord , to us belongeth confusion of face , to our kings , to our princes , and to our fathers , because we have sinned against thee .
to the lord our god belong mercies and forgiveness ; for we have rebelled against him ;
neither have we obeyed the voice of jehovah our god , to walk in his laws , which he set before us by his servants the prophets .
and he instructed me , and talked with me , and said , o daniel , i am now come forth to give thee wisdom and understanding .
in those days i , daniel , was mourning three whole weeks .
i ate no pleasant bread , neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth , neither did i anoint myself at all , till three whole weeks were fulfilled .
and in the four and twentieth day of the first month , as i was by the side of the great river , which is hiddekel ,
i lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and , behold , a man clothed in linen , whose loins were girded with pure gold of uphaz :
and , behold , a hand touched me , which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands .
now i am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days ; for the vision is yet for many days .
and when he had spoken unto me according to these words , i set my face toward the ground , and was dumb .
then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man , and he strengthened me .
and as for me , in the first year of darius the mede , i stood up to confirm and strengthen him .
and a mighty king shall stand up , that shall rule with great dominion , and do according to his will .
and he shall come into the realm of the king of the south , but he shall return into his own land .
and the multitude shall be lifted up , and his heart shall be exalted ; and he shall cast down tens of thousands , but he shall not prevail .
then he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land ; but he shall stumble and fall , and shall not be found .
and the overwhelming forces shall be overwhelmed from before him , and shall be broken ; yea , also the prince of the covenant .
and after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully ; for he shall come up , and shall become strong , with a small people .
yea , they that eat of his dainties shall destroy him , and his army shall overflow ; and many shall fall down slain .
at the time appointed he shall return , and come into the south ; but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former .
and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he pervert by flatteries ; but the people that know their god shall be strong , and do exploits .
now when they shall fall , they shall be helped with a little help ; but many shall join themselves unto them with flatteries .
neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers , nor the desire of women , nor regard any god ; for he shall magnify himself above all .
he shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries ; and the land of egypt shall not escape .
and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake , some to everlasting life , and some to shame and everlasting contempt .
and they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament ; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever .
and i heard , but i understood not : then said i , o my lord , what shall be the issue of these things ?
and he said , go thy way , daniel ; for the words are shut up and sealed till the time of the end .
blessed is he that waiteth , and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days .
but go thou thy way till the end be ; for thou shalt rest , and shalt stand in thy lot , at the end of the days .
it is eleven days ’ journey from horeb by the way of mount seir unto kadesh-barnea .
beyond the jordan , in the land of moab , began moses to declare this law , saying ,
jehovah our god spake unto us in horeb , saying , ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain :
and i spake unto you at that time , saying , i am not able to bear you myself alone :
jehovah your god hath multiplied you , and , behold , ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude .
jehovah , the god of your fathers , make you a thousand times as many as ye are , and bless you , as he hath promised you !
how can i myself alone bear your cumbrance , and your burden , and your strife ?
take you wise men , and understanding , and known , according to your tribes , and i will make them heads over you .
and ye answered me , and said , the thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do .
and i commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do .
and i said unto you , ye are come unto the hill-country of the amorites , which jehovah our god giveth unto us .
and the thing pleased me well ; and i took twelve men of you , one man for every tribe :
and they turned and went up into the hill-country , and came unto the valley of eshcol , and spied it out .
yet ye would not go up , but rebelled against the commandment of jehovah your god :
then i said unto you , dread not , neither be afraid of them .
jehovah your god who goeth before you , he will fight for you , according to all that he did for you in egypt before your eyes ,
yet in this thing ye did not believe jehovah your god ,
and jehovah heard the voice of your words , and was wroth , and sware , saying ,
surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see the good land , which i sware to give unto your fathers ,
also jehovah was angry with me for your sakes , saying , thou also shalt not go in thither :
joshua the son of nun , who standeth before thee , he shall go in thither : encourage thou him ; for he shall cause israel to inherit it .
but as for you , turn you , and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the red sea .
and ye returned and wept before jehovah ; but jehovah hearkened not to your voice , nor gave ear unto you .
so ye abode in kadesh many days , according unto the days that ye abode there .
and jehovah spake unto me , saying ,
ye have compassed this mountain long enough : turn you northward .
ye shall purchase food of them for money , that ye may eat ; and ye shall also buy water of them for money , that ye may drink .
so we passed by from our brethren the children of esau , that dwell in seir , from the way of the arabah from elath and from ezion-geber .
( the emim dwelt therein aforetime , a people great , and many , and tall , as the anakim :
these also are accounted rephaim , as the anakim ; but the moabites call them emim .
now rise up , and get you over the brook zered . and we went over the brook zered .
moreover the hand of jehovah was against them , to destroy them from the midst of the camp , until they were consumed .
so it came to pass , when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people ,
that jehovah spake unto me , saying ,
thou art this day to pass over ar , the border of moab :
( that also is accounted a land of rephaim : rephaim dwelt therein aforetime ; but the ammonites call them zamzummim ,
and i sent messengers out of the wilderness of kedemoth unto sihon king of heshbon with words of peace , saying ,
let me pass through thy land : i will go along by the highway , i will turn neither unto the right hand nor to the left .
then sihon came out against us , he and all his people , unto battle at jahaz .
and jehovah our god delivered him up before us ; and we smote him , and his sons , and all his people .
and we took all his cities at that time , and utterly destroyed every inhabited city , with the women and the little ones ; we left none remaining :
only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves , with the spoil of the cities which we had taken .
all these were cities fortified with high walls , gates , and bars ; besides the unwalled towns a great many .
and we utterly destroyed them , as we did unto sihon king of heshbon , utterly destroying every inhabited city , with the women and the little ones .
but all the cattle , and the spoil of the cities , we took for a prey unto ourselves .
( which hermon the sidonians call sirion , and the amorites call it senir ) ;
all the cities of the plain , and all gilead , and all bashan , unto salecah and edrei , cities of the kingdom of og in bashan .
and i gave gilead unto machir .
ye shall not fear them ; for jehovah your god , he it is that fighteth for you .
and i besought jehovah at that time , saying ,
let me go over , i pray thee , and see the good land that is beyond the jordan , that goodly mountain , and lebanon .
so we abode in the valley over against beth-peor .
but ye that did cleave unto jehovah your god are alive every one of you this day .
for what great nation is there , that hath a god so nigh unto them , as jehovah our god is whensoever we call upon him ?
and what great nation is there , that hath statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law , which i set before you this day ?
and he declared unto you his covenant , which he commanded you to perform , even the ten commandments ; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone .
and jehovah commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances , that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it .
lest ye corrupt yourselves , and make you a graven image in the form of any figure , the likeness of male or female ,
the likeness of any beast that is on the earth , the likeness of any winged bird that flieth in the heavens ,
the likeness of anything that creepeth on the ground , the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth ;
but i must die in this land , i must not go over the jordan ; but ye shall go over , and possess that good land .
for jehovah thy god is a devouring fire , a jealous god .
and jehovah will scatter you among the peoples , and ye shall be left few in number among the nations , whither jehovah shall lead you away .
did ever a people hear the voice of god speaking out of the midst of the fire , as thou hast heard , and live ?
unto thee it was showed , that thou mightest know that jehovah he is god ; there is none else besides him .
then moses set apart three cities beyond the jordan toward the sunrising ;
and this is the law which moses set before the children of israel :
these are the testimonies , and the statutes , and the ordinances , which moses spake unto the children of israel , when they came forth out of egypt ,
from aroer , which is on the edge of the valley of the arnon , even unto mount sion ( the same is hermon ) ,
and all the arabah beyond the jordan eastward , even unto the sea of the arabah , under the slopes of pisgah .
jehovah our god made a covenant with us in horeb .
jehovah made not this covenant with our fathers , but with us , even us , who are all of us here alive this day .
jehovah spake with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire
i am jehovah thy god , who brought thee out of the land of egypt , out of the house of bondage .
thou shalt have no other gods before me .
and showing lovingkindness unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments .
thou shalt not take the name of jehovah thy god in vain : for jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain .
observe the sabbath day , to keep it holy , as jehovah thy god commanded thee .
six days shalt thou labor , and do all thy work ;
thou shalt not kill .
neither shalt thou commit adultery .
neither shalt thou steal .
neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbor .
go say to them , return ye to your tents .
ye shall observe to do therefore as jehovah your god hath commanded you : ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
hear , o israel : jehovah our god is one jehovah :
and thou shalt love jehovah thy god with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy might .
and these words , which i command thee this day , shall be upon thy heart ;
and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand , and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes .
and thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house , and upon thy gates .
then beware lest thou forget jehovah , who brought thee forth out of the land of egypt , out of the house of bondage .
thou shalt fear jehovah thy god ; and him shalt thou serve , and shalt swear by his name .
ye shall not go after other gods , of the gods of the peoples that are round about you ;
ye shall not tempt jehovah your god , as ye tempted him in massah .
ye shall diligently keep the commandments of jehovah your god , and his testimonies , and his statutes , which he hath commanded thee .
to thrust out all thine enemies from before thee , as jehovah hath spoken .
then thou shalt say unto thy son , we were pharaoh ’ s bondmen in egypt : and jehovah brought us out of egypt with a mighty hand ;
and jehovah showed signs and wonders , great and sore , upon egypt , upon pharaoh , and upon all his house , before our eyes ;
and he brought us out from thence , that he might bring us in , to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers .
and it shall be righteousness unto us , if we observe to do all this commandment before jehovah our god , as he hath commanded us .
neither shalt thou make marriages with them ; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son , nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son .
thou shalt therefore keep the commandment , and the statutes , and the ordinances , which i command thee this day , to do them .
thou shalt be blessed above all peoples : there shall not be male or female barren among you , or among your cattle .
if thou shalt say in thy heart , these nations are more than i ; how can i dispossess them ?
thou shalt not be afraid of them : thou shalt well remember what jehovah thy god did unto pharaoh , and unto all egypt ;
moreover jehovah thy god will send the hornet among them , until they that are left , and hide themselves , perish from before thee .
thou shalt not be affrighted at them ; for jehovah thy god is in the midst of thee , a great god and a terrible .
but jehovah thy god will deliver them up before thee , and will discomfit them with a great discomfiture , until they be destroyed .
thy raiment waxed not old upon thee , neither did thy foot swell , these forty years .
and thou shalt consider in thy heart , that , as a man chasteneth his son , so jehovah thy god chasteneth thee .
and thou shalt keep the commandments of jehovah thy god , to walk in his ways , and to fear him .
for jehovah thy god bringeth thee into a good land , a land of brooks of water , of fountains and springs , flowing forth in valleys and hills ;
a land of wheat and barley , and vines and fig-trees and pomegranates ; a land of olive-trees and honey ;
and thou shalt eat and be full , and thou shalt bless jehovah thy god for the good land which he hath given thee .
beware lest thou forget jehovah thy god , in not keeping his commandments , and his ordinances , and his statutes , which i command thee this day :
lest , when thou hast eaten and art full , and hast built goodly houses , and dwelt therein ;
and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply , and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied , and all that thou hast is multiplied ;
and lest thou say in thy heart , my power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth .
as the nations that jehovah maketh to perish before you , so shall ye perish ; because ye would not hearken unto the voice of jehovah your god .
know therefore , that jehovah thy god giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness ; for thou art a stiffnecked people .
also in horeb ye provoked jehovah to wrath , and jehovah was angry with you to destroy you .
furthermore jehovah spake unto me , saying , i have seen this people , and , behold , it is a stiffnecked people :
and i took hold of the two tables , and cast them out of my two hands , and brake them before your eyes .
for i was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure , wherewith jehovah was wroth against you to destroy you . but jehovah hearkened unto me that time also .
and jehovah was very angry with aaron to destroy him : and i prayed for aaron also at the same time .
and at taberah , and at massah , and at kibroth-hattaavah , ye provoked jehovah to wrath .
ye have been rebellious against jehovah from the day that i knew you .
so i fell down before jehovah the forty days and forty nights that i fell down , because jehovah had said he would destroy you .
remember thy servants , abraham , isaac , and jacob ; look not unto the stubbornness of this people , nor to their wickedness , nor to their sin ,
yet they are thy people and thine inheritance , which thou broughtest out by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm .
and i will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou brakest , and thou shalt put them in the ark .
from thence they journeyed unto gudgodah ; and from gudgodah to jotbathah , a land of brooks of water .
wherefore levi hath no portion nor inheritance with his brethren ; jehovah is his inheritance , according as jehovah thy god spake unto him . )
to keep the commandments of jehovah , and his statutes , which i command thee this day for thy good ?
behold , unto jehovah thy god belongeth heaven and the heaven of heavens , the earth , with all that is therein .
circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart , and be no more stiffnecked .
he doth execute justice for the fatherless and widow , and loveth the sojourner , in giving him food and raiment .
love ye therefore the sojourner ; for ye were sojourners in the land of egypt .
thou shalt fear jehovah thy god ; him shalt thou serve ; and to him shalt thou cleave , and by his name shalt thou swear .
he is thy praise , and he is thy god , that hath done for thee these great and terrible things , which thine eyes have seen .
thy fathers went down into egypt with threescore and ten persons ; and now jehovah thy god hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude .
therefore thou shalt love jehovah thy god , and keep his charge , and his statutes , and his ordinances , and his commandments , alway .
and his signs , and his works , which he did in the midst of egypt unto pharaoh the king of egypt , and unto all his land ;
and what he did unto you in the wilderness , until ye came unto this place ;
but your eyes have seen all the great work of jehovah which he did .
but the land , whither ye go over to possess it , is a land of hills and valleys , and drinketh water of the rain of heaven ,
and i will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle , and thou shalt eat and be full .
take heed to yourselves , lest your heart be deceived , and ye turn aside , and serve other gods , and worship them ;
and thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house , and upon thy gates ;
then will jehovah drive out all these nations from before you , and ye shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves .
behold , i set before you this day a blessing and a curse :
the blessing , if ye shall hearken unto the commandments of jehovah your god , which i command you this day ;
and ye shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which i set before you this day .
ye shall not do so unto jehovah your god .
ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day , every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes ;
for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance , which jehovah thy god giveth thee .
take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest ;
only ye shall not eat the blood ; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water .
take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the levite as long as thou livest in thy land .
even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten , so thou shalt eat thereof : the unclean and the clean may eat thereof alike .
only be sure that thou eat not the blood : for the blood is the life ; and thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh .
thou shalt not eat it ; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water .
only thy holy things which thou hast , and thy vows , thou shalt take , and go unto the place which jehovah shall choose ;
what thing soever i command you , that shall ye observe to do : thou shalt not add thereto , nor diminish from it .
if there arise in the midst of thee a prophet , or a dreamer of dreams , and he give thee a sign or a wonder ,
thou shalt not consent unto him , nor hearken unto him ; neither shall thine eye pity him , neither shalt thou spare , neither shalt thou conceal him :
but thou shalt surely kill him ; thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
and all israel shall hear , and fear , and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is in the midst of thee .
if thou shalt hear tell concerning one of thy cities , which jehovah thy god giveth thee to dwell there , saying ,
ye are the children of jehovah your god : ye shall not cut yourselves , nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead .
thou shalt not eat any abominable thing .
these are the beasts which ye may eat : the ox , the sheep , and the goat ,
the hart , and the gazelle , and the roebuck , and the wild goat , and the pygarg , and the antelope , and the chamois .
and every beast that parteth the hoof , and hath the hoof cloven in two , and cheweth the cud , among the beasts , that may ye eat .
these ye may eat of all that are in the waters : whatsoever hath fins and scales may ye eat ;
and whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye shall not eat ; it is unclean unto you .
of all clean birds ye may eat .
but these are they of which ye shall not eat : the eagle , and the gier-eagle , and the ospray ,
and the glede , and the falcon , and the kite after its kind ,
and every raven after its kind ,
and the ostrich , and the night-hawk , and the sea-mew , and the hawk after its kind ,
the little owl , and the great owl , and the horned owl ,
and the pelican , and the vulture , and the cormorant ,
and the stork , and the heron after its kind , and the hoopoe , and the bat .
and all winged creeping things are unclean unto you : they shall not be eaten .
of all clean birds ye may eat .
thou shalt surely tithe all the increase of thy seed , that which cometh forth from the field year by year .
then shalt thou turn it into money , and bind up the money in thy hand , and shalt go unto the place which jehovah thy god shall choose :
and the levite that is within thy gates , thou shalt not forsake him ; for he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee .
at the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release .
of a foreigner thou mayest exact it : but whatsoever of thine is with thy brother thy hand shall release .
if only thou diligently hearken unto the voice of jehovah thy god , to observe to do all this commandment which i command thee this day .
but thou shalt surely open thy hand unto him , and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need in that which he wanteth .
and when thou lettest him go free from thee , thou shalt not let him go empty :
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of egypt , and jehovah thy god redeemed thee : therefore i command thee this thing to-day .
thou shalt eat it before jehovah thy god year by year in the place which jehovah shall choose , thou and thy household .
and if it have any blemish , as if it be lame or blind , any ill blemish whatsoever , thou shalt not sacrifice it unto jehovah thy god .
thou shalt eat it within thy gates : the unclean and the clean shall eat it alike , as the gazelle , and as the hart .
only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof ; thou shalt pour it out upon the ground as water .
thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates , which jehovah thy god giveth thee ;
six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread ; and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to jehovah thy god ; thou shalt do no work therein .
seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee : from the time thou beginnest to put the sickle to the standing grain shalt thou begin to number seven weeks .
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in egypt : and thou shalt observe and do these statutes .
thou shalt keep the feast of tabernacles seven days , after that thou hast gathered in from thy threshing-floor and from thy winepress :
every man shall give as he is able , according to the blessing of jehovah thy god which he hath given thee .
that which is altogether just shalt thou follow , that thou mayest live , and inherit the land which jehovah thy god giveth thee .
thou shalt not plant thee an asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of jehovah thy god , which thou shalt make thee .
neither shalt thou set thee up a pillar ; which jehovah thy god hateth .
and all the people shall hear , and fear , and do no more presumptuously .
neither shall he multiply wives to himself , that his heart turn not away : neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold .
and they shall have no inheritance among their brethren : jehovah is their inheritance , as he hath spoken unto them .
for jehovah thy god hath chosen him out of all thy tribes , to stand to minister in the name of jehovah , him and his sons for ever .
then he shall minister in the name of jehovah his god , as all his brethren the levites do , who stand there before jehovah .
they shall have like portions to eat , besides that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony .
when thou art come into the land which jehovah thy god giveth thee , thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations .
or a charmer , or a consulter with a familiar spirit , or a wizard , or a necromancer .
for whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto jehovah : and because of these abominations jehovah thy god doth drive them out from before thee .
thou shalt be perfect with jehovah thy god .
jehovah thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee , of thy brethren , like unto me ; unto him ye shall hearken ;
and jehovah said unto me , they have well said that which they have spoken .
and it shall come to pass , that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name , i will require it of him .
and if thou say in thy heart , how shall we know the word which jehovah hath not spoken ?
thou shalt set apart three cities for thee in the midst of thy land , which jehovah thy god giveth thee to possess it .
and this is the case of the manslayer , that shall flee thither and live : whoso killeth his neighbor unawares , and hated him not in time past ;
wherefore i command thee , saying , thou shalt set apart three cities for thee .
that innocent blood be not shed in the midst of thy land , which jehovah thy god giveth thee for an inheritance , and so blood be upon thee .
then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence , and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood , that he may die .
thine eye shall not pity him , but thou shalt put away the innocent blood from israel , that it may go well with thee .
if an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify against him of wrong-doing ,
then both the men , between whom the controversy is , shall stand before jehovah , before the priests and the judges that shall be in those days ;
and the judges shall make diligent inquisition : and , behold , if the witness be a false witness , and have testified falsely against his brother ;
then shall ye do unto him , as he had thought to do unto his brother : so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee .
and those that remain shall hear , and fear , and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of thee .
and thine eyes shall not pity ; life shall go for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot .
and it shall be , when ye draw nigh unto the battle , that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people ,
for jehovah your god is he that goeth with you , to fight for you against your enemies , to save you .
when thou drawest nigh unto a city to fight against it , then proclaim peace unto it .
and if it will make no peace with thee , but will make war against thee , then thou shalt besiege it :
and when jehovah thy god delivereth it into thy hand , thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword :
thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee , which are not of the cities of these nations .
but of the cities of these peoples , that jehovah thy god giveth thee for an inheritance , thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth ;
that they teach you not to do after all their abominations , which they have done unto their gods ; so would ye sin against jehovah your god .
then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth , and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain :
and they shall answer and say , our hands have not shed this blood , neither have our eyes seen it .
so shalt thou put away the innocent blood from the midst of thee , when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of jehovah .
when thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies , and jehovah thy god delivereth them into thy hands , and thou carriest them away captive ,
and seest among the captives a beautiful woman , and thou hast a desire unto her , and wouldest take her to thee to wife ;
then thou shalt bring her home to thy house ; and she shall shave her head , and pare her nails ;
and if a man have committed a sin worthy of death , and he be put to death , and thou hang him on a tree ;
thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together .
thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff , wool and linen together .
thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four borders of thy vesture , wherewith thou coverest thyself .
if any man take a wife , and go in unto her , and hate her ,
and the damsel ’ s father shall say unto the elders , i gave my daughter unto this man to wife , and he hateth her ;
and the elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him ;
but if this thing be true , that the tokens of virginity were not found in the damsel ;
if there be a damsel that is a virgin betrothed unto a husband , and a man find her in the city , and lie with her ;
for he found her in the field , the betrothed damsel cried , and there was none to save her .
a man shall not take his father ’ s wife , and shall not uncover his father ’ s skirt .
he that is wounded in the stones , or hath his privy member cut off , shall not enter into the assembly of jehovah .
a bastard shall not enter into the assembly of jehovah ; even to the tenth generation shall none of his enter into the assembly of jehovah .
nevertheless jehovah thy god would not hearken unto balaam ; but jehovah thy god turned the curse into a blessing unto thee , because jehovah thy god loved thee .
thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever .
thou shalt not abhor an edomite ; for he is thy brother : thou shalt not abhor an egyptian ; because thou wast a sojourner in his land .
the children of the third generation that are born unto them shall enter into the assembly of jehovah .
when thou goest forth in camp against thine enemies , then thou shalt keep thee from every evil thing .
thou shalt have a place also without the camp , whither thou shalt go forth abroad :
thou shalt not deliver unto his master a servant that is escaped from his master unto thee :
there shall be no prostitute of the daughters of israel , neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of israel .
thou shalt not lend upon interest to thy brother ; interest of money , interest of victuals , interest of anything that is lent upon interest .
but if thou shalt forbear to vow , it shall be no sin in thee .
and when she is departed out of his house , she may go and be another man ’ s wife .
no man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge ; for he taketh a man ’ s life to pledge .
remember what jehovah thy god did unto miriam , by the way as ye came forth out of egypt .
when thou dost lend thy neighbor any manner of loan , thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge .
thou shalt stand without , and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring forth the pledge without unto thee .
and if he be a poor man , thou shalt not sleep with his pledge ;
thou shalt not wrest the justice due to the sojourner , or to the fatherless , nor take the widow ’ s raiment to pledge ;
but thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in egypt , and jehovah thy god redeemed thee thence : therefore i command thee to do this thing .
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of egypt : therefore i command thee to do this thing .
thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the grain .
then the elders of his city shall call him , and speak unto him : and if he stand , and say , i like not to take her ;
and his name shall be called in israel , the house of him that hath his shoe loosed .
then thou shalt cut off her hand , thine eye shall have no pity .
thou shalt not have in thy bag diverse weights , a great and a small .
thou shalt not have in thy house diverse measures , a great and a small .
for all that do such things , even all that do unrighteously , are an abomination unto jehovah thy god .
remember what amalek did unto thee by the way as ye came forth out of egypt ;
and the priest shall take the basket out of thy hand , and set it down before the altar of jehovah thy god .
and the egyptians dealt ill with us , and afflicted us , and laid upon us hard bondage :
and he hath brought us into this place , and hath given us this land , a land flowing with milk and honey .
and moses and the elders of israel commanded the people , saying , keep all the commandment which i command you this day .
and there shalt thou build an altar unto jehovah thy god , an altar of stones : thou shalt lift up no iron tool upon them .
thou shalt build the altar of jehovah thy god of unhewn stones ; and thou shalt offer burnt-offerings thereon unto jehovah thy god :
and thou shalt sacrifice peace-offerings , and shalt eat there ; and thou shalt rejoice before jehovah thy god .
and thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly .
thou shalt therefore obey the voice of jehovah thy god , and do his commandments and his statutes , which i command thee this day .
and moses charged the people the same day , saying ,
and these shall stand upon mount ebal for the curse : reuben , gad , and asher , and zebulun , dan , and naphtali .
and the levites shall answer , and say unto all the men of israel with a loud voice ,
cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that removeth his neighbor ’ s landmark . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that wresteth the justice due to the sojourner , fatherless , and widow . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that lieth with his mother-in-law . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that smiteth his neighbor in secret . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that taketh a bribe to slay an innocent person . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that confirmeth not the words of this law to do them . and all the people shall say , amen .
and all these blessings shall come upon thee , and overtake thee , if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of jehovah thy god .
blessed shalt thou be in the city , and blessed shalt thou be in the field .
blessed shall be thy basket and thy kneading-trough .
blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in , and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out .
and all the peoples of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of jehovah ; and they shall be afraid of thee .
cursed shalt thou be in the city , and cursed shalt thou be in the field .
cursed shall be thy basket and thy kneading-trough .
cursed shall be the fruit of thy body , and the fruit of thy ground , the increase of thy cattle , and the young of thy flock .
cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in , and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out .
jehovah will make the pestilence cleave unto thee , until he have consumed thee from off the land , whither thou goest in to possess it .
and thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass , and the earth that is under thee shall be iron .
jehovah will make the rain of thy land powder and dust : from heaven shall it come down upon thee , until thou be destroyed .
jehovah will smite thee with madness , and with blindness , and with astonishment of heart ;
so that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see .
and thou shalt become an astonishment , a proverb , and a byword , among all the peoples whither jehovah shall lead thee away .
thou shalt carry much seed out into the field , and shalt gather little in ; for the locust shall consume it .
thou shalt plant vineyards and dress them , but thou shalt neither drink of the wine , nor gather the grapes ; for the worm shall eat them .
thou shalt have olive-trees throughout all thy borders , but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil ; for thine olive shall cast its fruit .
thou shalt beget sons and daughters , but they shall not be thine ; for they shall go into captivity .
all thy trees and the fruit of thy ground shall the locust possess .
the sojourner that is in the midst of thee shall mount up above thee higher and higher ; and thou shalt come down lower and lower .
he shall lend to thee , and thou shalt not lend to him : he shall be the head , and thou shalt be the tail .
and they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder , and upon thy seed for ever .
because thou servedst not jehovah thy god with joyfulness , and with gladness of heart , by reason of the abundance of all things ;
a nation of fierce countenance , that shall not regard the person of the old , nor show favor to the young ,
and he will bring upon thee again all the diseases of egypt , which thou wast afraid of ; and they shall cleave unto thee .
and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee ; and thou shalt fear night and day , and shalt have no assurance of thy life .
the great trials which thine eyes saw , the signs , and those great wonders :
but jehovah hath not given you a heart to know , and eyes to see , and ears to hear , unto this day .
ye have not eaten bread , neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink ; that ye may know that i am jehovah your god .
and we took their land , and gave it for an inheritance unto the reubenites , and to the gadites , and to the half-tribe of the manassites .
keep therefore the words of this covenant , and do them , that ye may prosper in all that ye do .
that thou mayest enter into the covenant of jehovah thy god , and into his oath , which jehovah thy god maketh with thee this day ;
neither with you only do i make this covenant and this oath ,
but with him that standeth here with us this day before jehovah our god , and also with him that is not here with us this day
( for ye know how we dwelt in the land of egypt , and how we came through the midst of the nations through which ye passed ;
and ye have seen their abominations , and their idols , wood and stone , silver and gold , which were among them ) ;
even all the nations shall say , wherefore hath jehovah done thus unto this land ? what meaneth the heat of this great anger ?
and went and served other gods , and worshipped them , gods that they knew not , and that he had not given unto them :
therefore the anger of jehovah was kindled against this land , to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book ;
if any of thine outcasts be in the uttermost parts of heaven , from thence will jehovah thy god gather thee , and from thence will he fetch thee :
and jehovah thy god will put all these curses upon thine enemies , and on them that hate thee , that persecuted thee .
and thou shalt return and obey the voice of jehovah , and do all his commandments which i command thee this day .
for this commandment which i command thee this day , it is not too hard for thee , neither is it far off .
but the word is very nigh unto thee , in thy mouth , and in thy heart , that thou mayest do it .
see , i have set before thee this day life and good , and death and evil ;
but if thy heart turn away , and thou wilt not hear , but shalt be drawn away , and worship other gods , and serve them ;
and moses went and spake these words unto all israel .
and jehovah will do unto them as he did to sihon and to og , the kings of the amorites , and unto their land ; whom he destroyed .
and jehovah will deliver them up before you , and ye shall do unto them according unto all the commandment which i have commanded you .
and jehovah appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud : and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the tent .
and i will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought , in that they are turned unto other gods .
so moses wrote this song the same day , and taught it the children of israel .
and it came to pass , when moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book , until they were finished ,
that moses commanded the levites , that bare the ark of the covenant of jehovah , saying ,
and moses spake in the ears of all the assembly of israel the words of this song , until they were finished .
give ear , ye heavens , and i will speak ;
my doctrine shall drop as the rain ;
for i will proclaim the name of jehovah :
the rock , his work is perfect ;
they have dealt corruptly with him , they are not his children , it is their blemish ;
do ye thus requite jehovah ,
remember the days of old ,
when the most high gave to the nations their inheritance ,
for jehovah ’ s portion is his people ;
he found him in a desert land ,
as an eagle that stirreth up her nest ,
jehovah alone did lead him ,
he made him ride on the high places of the earth ,
butter of the herd , and milk of the flock ,
but jeshurun waxed fat , and kicked :
they moved him to jealousy with strange gods ;
they sacrificed unto demons , which were no god ,
of the rock that begat thee thou art unmindful ,
and jehovah saw it , and abhorred them ,
and he said , i will hide my face from them ,
they have moved me to jealousy with that which is not god ;
for a fire is kindled in mine anger ,
i will heap evils upon them ;
they shall be wasted with hunger , and devoured with burning heat
without shall the sword bereave ,
i said , i would scatter them afar ,
were it not that i feared the provocation of the enemy ,
for they are a nation void of counsel ,
oh that they were wise , that they understood this ,
how should one chase a thousand ,
for their rock is not as our rock ,
for their vine is of the vine of sodom ,
their wine is the poison of serpents ,
is not this laid up in store with me ,
vengeance is mine , and recompense ,
for jehovah will judge his people ,
and he will say , where are their gods ,
which did eat the fat of their sacrifices ,
see now that i , even i , am he ,
for i lift up my hand to heaven ,
if i whet my glittering sword ,
i will make mine arrows drunk with blood ,
rejoice , o ye nations , with his people :
and moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people , he , and hoshea the son of nun .
and moses made an end of speaking all these words to all israel ;
and jehovah spake unto moses that selfsame day , saying ,
for thou shalt see the land before thee ; but thou shalt not go thither into the land which i give the children of israel .
and this is the blessing , wherewith moses the man of god blessed the children of israel before his death .
yea , he loveth the people ;
moses commanded us a law ,
and he was king in jeshurun ,
let reuben live , and not die ;
and this is the blessing of judah : and he said ,
and of levi he said ,
who said of his father , and of his mother , i have not seen him ;
they shall teach jacob thine ordinances ,
bless , jehovah , his substance ,
of benjamin he said ,
and of joseph he said ,
and for the precious things of the fruits of the sun ,
and for the chief things of the ancient mountains ,
and for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof ,
the firstling of his herd , majesty is his ;
and of zebulun he said ,
they shall call the peoples unto the mountain ;
and of gad he said ,
and he provided the first part for himself ,
and of dan he said ,
and of naphtali he said ,
and of asher he said ,
thy bars shall be iron and brass ;
there is none like unto god , o jeshurun ,
the eternal god is thy dwelling-place ,
and israel dwelleth in safety ,
happy art thou , o israel :
and all naphtali , and the land of ephraim and manasseh , and all the land of judah , unto the hinder sea ,
and the south , and the plain of the valley of jericho the city of palm-trees , unto zoar .
so moses the servant of jehovah died there in the land of moab , according to the word of jehovah .
and he buried him in the valley in the land of moab over against beth-peor : but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day .
and moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died : his eye was not dim , nor his natural force abated .
and the children of israel wept for moses in the plains of moab thirty days : so the days of weeping in the mourning for moses were ended .
and there hath not arisen a prophet since in israel like unto moses , whom jehovah knew face to face ,
and in all the mighty hand , and in all the great terror , which moses wrought in the sight of all israel .
the words of the preacher , the son of david , king in jerusalem .
vanity of vanities , saith the preacher ; vanity of vanities , all is vanity .
what profit hath man of all his labor wherein he laboreth under the sun ?
one generation goeth , and another generation cometh ; but the earth abideth for ever .
the sun also ariseth , and the sun goeth down , and hasteth to its place where it ariseth .
all the rivers run into the sea , yet the sea is not full ; unto the place whither the rivers go , thither they go again .
all things are full of weariness ; man can not utter it : the eye is not satisfied with seeing , nor the ear filled with hearing .
is there a thing whereof it may be said , see , this is new ? it hath been long ago , in the ages which were before us .
i the preacher was king over israel in jerusalem .
i have seen all the works that are done under the sun ; and , behold , all is vanity and a striving after wind .
that which is crooked can not be made straight ; and that which is wanting can not be numbered .
and i applied my heart to know wisdom , and to know madness and folly : i perceived that this also was a striving after wind .
for in much wisdom is much grief ; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow .
i said in my heart , come now , i will prove thee with mirth ; therefore enjoy pleasure : and , behold , this also was vanity .
i said of laughter , it is mad ; and of mirth , what doeth it ?
i made me great works ; i builded me houses ; i planted me vineyards ;
i made me gardens and parks , and i planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit ;
i made me pools of water , to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared ;
so i was great , and increased more than all that were before me in jerusalem : also my wisdom remained with me .
then i saw that wisdom excelleth folly , as far as light excelleth darkness .
the wise man ’ s eyes are in his head , and the fool walketh in darkness : and yet i perceived that one event happeneth to them all .
so i hated life , because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me ; for all is vanity and a striving after wind .
and i hated all my labor wherein i labored under the sun , seeing that i must leave it unto the man that shall be after me .
therefore i turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor wherein i had labored under the sun .
for what hath a man of all his labor , and of the striving of his heart , wherein he laboreth under the sun ?
for who can eat , or who can have enjoyment , more than i ?
for everything there is a season , and a time for every purpose under heaven :
a time to be born , and a time to die ; a time to plant , and a time to pluck up that which is planted ;
a time to kill , and a time to heal ; a time to break down , and a time to build up ;
a time to weep , and a time to laugh ; a time to mourn , and a time to dance ;
a time to cast away stones , and a time to gather stones together ; a time to embrace , and a time to refrain from embracing ;
a time to seek , and a time to lose ; a time to keep , and a time to cast away ;
a time to rend , and a time to sew ; a time to keep silence , and a time to speak ;
a time to love , and a time to hate ; a time for war , and a time for peace .
what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth ?
i have seen the travail which god hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith .
i know that there is nothing better for them , than to rejoice , and to do good so long as they live .
and also that every man should eat and drink , and enjoy good in all his labor , is the gift of god .
that which is hath been long ago ; and that which is to be hath long ago been : and god seeketh again that which is passed away .
i said in my heart , god will judge the righteous and the wicked ; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work .
all go unto one place ; all are of the dust , and all turn to dust again .
who knoweth the spirit of man , whether it goeth upward , and the spirit of the beast , whether it goeth downward to the earth ?
wherefore i praised the dead that have been long dead more than the living that are yet alive ;
yea , better than them both did i esteem him that hath not yet been , who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun .
the fool foldeth his hands together , and eateth his own flesh .
better is a handful , with quietness , than two handfuls with labor and striving after wind .
then i returned and saw vanity under the sun .
two are better than one , because they have a good reward for their labor .
again , if two lie together , then they have warmth ; but how can one be warm alone ?
and if a man prevail against him that is alone , two shall withstand him ; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken .
better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king , who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more .
for out of prison he came forth to be king ; yea , even in his kingdom he was born poor .
i saw all the living that walk under the sun , that they were with the youth , the second , that stood up in his stead .
for a dream cometh with a multitude of business , and a fool ’ s voice with a multitude of words .
when thou vowest a vow unto god , defer not to pay it ; for he hath no pleasure in fools : pay that which thou vowest .
better is it that thou shouldest not vow , than that thou shouldest vow and not pay .
for in the multitude of dreams there are vanities , and in many words : but fear thou god .
moreover the profit of the earth is for all : the king himself is served by the field .
he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver ; nor he that loveth abundance , with increase : this also is vanity .
when goods increase , they are increased that eat them ; and what advantage is there to the owner thereof , save the beholding of them with his eyes ?
the sleep of a laboring man is sweet , whether he eat little or much ; but the fulness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep .
there is a grievous evil which i have seen under the sun , namely , riches kept by the owner thereof to his hurt :
and those riches perish by evil adventure ; and if he hath begotten a son , there is nothing in his hand .
all his days also he eateth in darkness , and he is sore vexed , and hath sickness and wrath .
for he shall not much remember the days of his life ; because god answereth him in the joy of his heart .
there is an evil which i have seen under the sun , and it is heavy upon men :
for it cometh in vanity , and departeth in darkness , and the name thereof is covered with darkness ;
moreover it hath not seen the sun nor known it ; this hath rest rather than the other :
yea , though he live a thousand years twice told , and yet enjoy no good , do not all go to one place ?
all the labor of man is for his mouth , and yet the appetite is not filled .
for what advantage hath the wise more than the fool ? or what hath the poor man , that knoweth how to walk before the living ?
better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire : this also is vanity and a striving after wind .
seeing there are many things that increase vanity , what is man the better ?
a good name is better than precious oil ; and the day of death , than the day of one ’ s birth .
sorrow is better than laughter ; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made glad .
the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning ; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth .
it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise , than for a man to hear the song of fools .
for as the crackling of thorns under a pot , so is the laughter of the fool : this also is vanity .
surely extortion maketh the wise man foolish ; and a bribe destroyeth the understanding .
better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof ; and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit .
be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry ; for anger resteth in the bosom of fools .
say not thou , what is the cause that the former days were better than these ? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this .
wisdom is as good as an inheritance ; yea , more excellent is it for them that see the sun .
consider the work of god : for who can make that straight , which he hath made crooked ?
be not righteous overmuch ; neither make thyself overwise : why shouldest thou destroy thyself ?
be not overmuch wicked , neither be thou foolish : why shouldest thou die before thy time ?
wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers that are in a city .
surely there is not a righteous man upon earth , that doeth good , and sinneth not .
also take not heed unto all words that are spoken , lest thou hear thy servant curse thee ;
for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others .
all this have i proved in wisdom : i said , i will be wise ; but it was far from me .
that which is , is far off and exceeding deep ; who can find it out ?
behold , this have i found , saith the preacher , laying one thing to another , to find out the account ;
behold , this only have i found : that god made man upright ; but they have sought out many inventions .
i counsel thee , keep the king ’ s command , and that in regard of the oath of god .
be not hasty to go out of his presence ; persist not in an evil thing : for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him .
for the king ’ s word hath power ; and who may say unto him , what doest thou ?
whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing ; and a wise man ’ s heart discerneth time and judgment :
for to every purpose there is a time and judgment ; because the misery of man is great upon him :
for he knoweth not that which shall be ; for who can tell him how it shall be ?
because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil .
but it shall not be well with the wicked , neither shall he prolong his days , which are as a shadow ; because he feareth not before god .
for to him that is joined with all the living there is hope ; for a living dog is better than a dead lion .
go thy way , eat thy bread with joy , and drink thy wine with a merry heart ; for god hath already accepted thy works .
let thy garments be always white ; and let not thy head lack oil .
i have also seen wisdom under the sun on this wise , and it seemed great unto me :
now there was found in it a poor wise man , and he by his wisdom delivered the city ; yet no man remembered that same poor man .
then said i , wisdom is better than strength : nevertheless the poor man ’ s wisdom is despised , and his words are not heard .
the words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry of him that ruleth among fools .
wisdom is better than weapons of war ; but one sinner destroyeth much good .
dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor ; so doth a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor .
a wise man ’ s heart is at his right hand ; but a fool ’ s heart at his left .
yea also , when the fool walketh by the way , his understanding faileth him , and he saith to every one that he is a fool .
if the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee , leave not thy place ; for gentleness allayeth great offences .
there is an evil which i have seen under the sun , as it were an error which proceedeth from the ruler :
folly is set in great dignity , and the rich sit in a low place .
i have seen servants upon horses , and princes walking like servants upon the earth .
he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it ; and whoso breaketh through a wall , a serpent shall bite him .
whoso heweth out stones shall be hurt therewith ; and he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby .
if the iron be blunt , and one do not whet the edge , then must he put to more strength : but wisdom is profitable to direct .
if the serpent bite before it is charmed , then is there no advantage in the charmer .
the words of a wise man ’ s mouth are gracious ; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself .
the beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness ; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness .
a fool also multiplieth words : yet man knoweth not what shall be ; and that which shall be after him , who can tell him ?
the labor of fools wearieth every one of them ; for he knoweth not how to go to the city .
woe to thee , o land , when thy king is a child , and thy princes eat in the morning !
by slothfulness the roof sinketh in ; and through idleness of the hands the house leaketh .
a feast is made for laughter , and wine maketh glad the life ; and money answereth all things .
cast thy bread upon the waters ; for thou shalt find it after many days .
give a portion to seven , yea , even unto eight ; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth .
he that observeth the wind shall not sow ; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap .
truly the light is sweet , and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun .
therefore remove sorrow from thy heart , and put away evil from thy flesh ; for youth and the dawn of life are vanity .
before the sun , and the light , and the moon , and the stars , are darkened , and the clouds return after the rain ;
and the dust returneth to the earth as it was , and the spirit returneth unto god who gave it .
vanity of vanities , saith the preacher ; all is vanity .
the preacher sought to find out acceptable words , and that which was written uprightly , even words of truth .
the words of the wise are as goads ; and as nails well fastened are the words of the masters of assemblies , which are given from one shepherd .
and furthermore , my son , be admonished : of making many books there is no end ; and much study is a weariness of the flesh .
this is the end of the matter ; all hath been heard : fear god , and keep his commandments ; for this is the whole duty of man .
for god will bring every work into judgment , with every hidden thing , whether it be good , or whether it be evil .
paul , an apostle of christ jesus through the will of god , to the saints that are at ephesus , and the faithful in christ jesus :
grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ .
blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ , who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in christ :
even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love :
having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through jesus christ unto himself , according to the good pleasure of his will ,
to the praise of the glory of his grace , which he freely bestowed on us in the beloved :
in whom we have our redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of our trespasses , according to the riches of his grace ,
which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence ,
making known unto us the mystery of his will , according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him
in whom also we were made a heritage , having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will ;
to the end that we should be unto the praise of his glory , we who had before hoped in christ :
which is an earnest of our inheritance , unto the redemption of god ’ s own possession , unto the praise of his glory .
cease not to give thanks for you , making mention of you in my prayers ;
that the god of our lord jesus christ , the father of glory , may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him ;
and what the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe , according to that working of the strength of his might
which he wrought in christ , when he raised him from the dead , and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places ,
and he put all things in subjection under his feet , and gave him to be head over all things to the church ,
which is his body , the fulness of him that filleth all in all .
and you did he make alive , when ye were dead through your trespasses and sins ,
but god , being rich in mercy , for his great love wherewith he loved us ,
even when we were dead through our trespasses , made us alive together with christ ( by grace have ye been saved ) ,
and raised us up with him , and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places , in christ jesus :
that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in christ jesus :
for by grace have ye been saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves , it is the gift of god ;
not of works , that no man should glory .
for we are his workmanship , created in christ jesus for good works , which god afore prepared that we should walk in them .
but now in christ jesus ye that once were far off are made nigh in the blood of christ .
for he is our peace , who made both one , and brake down the middle wall of partition ,
and might reconcile them both in one body unto god through the cross , having slain the enmity thereby :
and he came and preached peace to you that were far off , and peace to them that were nigh :
for through him we both have our access in one spirit unto the father .
so then ye are no more strangers and sojourners , but ye are fellow-citizens with the saints , and of the household of god ,
being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , christ jesus himself being the chief corner stone ;
in whom each several building , fitly framed together , groweth into a holy temple in the lord ;
in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of god in the spirit .
for this cause i paul , the prisoner of christ jesus in behalf of you gentiles , —
if so be that ye have heard of the dispensation of that grace of god which was given me to you-ward ;
how that by revelation was made known unto me the mystery , as i wrote before in few words ,
whereby , when ye read , ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of christ ;
which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men , as it hath now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the spirit ;
to wit , that the gentiles are fellow-heirs , and fellow-members of the body , and fellow-partakers of the promise in christ jesus through the gospel ,
whereof i was made a minister , according to the gift of that grace of god which was given me according to the working of his power .
unto me , who am less than the least of all saints , was this grace given , to preach unto the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ ;
and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which for ages hath been hid in god who created all things ;
to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of god ,
according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord :
in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him .
wherefore i ask that ye may not faint at my tribulations for you , which are your glory .
for this cause i bow my knees unto the father ,
from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named ,
that he would grant you , according to the riches of his glory , that ye may be strengthened with power through his spirit in the inward man ;
that christ may dwell in your hearts through faith ; to the end that ye , being rooted and grounded in love ,
may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth ,
and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge , that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of god .
now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think , according to the power that worketh in us ,
unto him be the glory in the church and in christ jesus unto all generations for ever and ever . amen .
i therefore , the prisoner in the lord , beseech you to walk worthily of the calling wherewith ye were called ,
with all lowliness and meekness , with longsuffering , forbearing one another in love ;
giving diligence to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace .
there is one body , and one spirit , even as also ye were called in one hope of your calling ;
one lord , one faith , one baptism ,
one god and father of all , who is over all , and through all , and in all .
but unto each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of christ .
( now this , he ascended , what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth ?
he that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens , that he might fill all things . )
and he gave some to be apostles ; and some , prophets ; and some , evangelists ; and some , pastors and teachers ;
for the perfecting of the saints , unto the work of ministering , unto the building up of the body of christ :
but speaking truth in love , may grow up in all things into him , who is the head , even christ ;
this i say therefore , and testify in the lord , that ye no longer walk as the gentiles also walk , in the vanity of their mind ,
being darkened in their understanding , alienated from the life of god , because of the ignorance that is in them , because of the hardening of their heart ;
who being past feeling gave themselves up to lasciviousness , to work all uncleanness with greediness .
but ye did not so learn christ ;
if so be that ye heard him , and were taught in him , even as truth is in jesus :
that ye put away , as concerning your former manner of life , the old man , that waxeth corrupt after the lusts of deceit ;
and that ye be renewed in the spirit of your mind ,
and put on the new man , that after god hath been created in righteousness and holiness of truth .
wherefore , putting away falsehood , speak ye truth each one with his neighbor : for we are members one of another .
be ye angry , and sin not : let not the sun go down upon your wrath :
neither give place to the devil .
and grieve not the holy spirit of god , in whom ye were sealed unto the day of redemption .
let all bitterness , and wrath , and anger , and clamor , and railing , be put away from you , with all malice :
and be ye kind one to another , tenderhearted , forgiving each other , even as god also in christ forgave you .
be ye therefore imitators of god , as beloved children ;
but fornication , and all uncleanness , or covetousness , let it not even be named among you , as becometh saints ;
nor filthiness , nor foolish talking , or jesting , which are not befitting : but rather giving of thanks .
let no man deceive you with empty words : for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the sons of disobedience .
be not ye therefore partakers with them ;
for ye were once darkness , but are now light in the lord : walk as children of light
( for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth ) ,
proving what is well-pleasing unto the lord ;
and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather even reprove them ;
for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of .
but all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light : for everything that is made manifest is light .
wherefore he saith , awake , thou that sleepest , and arise from the dead , and christ shall shine upon thee .
look therefore carefully how ye walk , not as unwise , but as wise ;
redeeming the time , because the days are evil .
wherefore be ye not foolish , but understand what the will of the lord is .
and be not drunken with wine , wherein is riot , but be filled with the spirit ;
speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody with your heart to the lord ;
giving thanks always for all things in the name of our lord jesus christ to god , even the father ;
subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of christ .
wives , be in subjection unto your own husbands , as unto the lord .
for the husband is the head of the wife , as christ also is the head of the church , being himself the saviour of the body .
but as the church is subject to christ , so let the wives also be to their husbands in everything .
husbands , love your wives , even as christ also loved the church , and gave himself up for it ;
that he might sanctify it , having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word ,
even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies . he that loveth his own wife loveth himself :
for no man ever hated his own flesh ; but nourisheth and cherisheth it , even as christ also the church ;
because we are members of his body .
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife ; and the two shall become one flesh .
this mystery is great : but i speak in regard of christ and of the church .
nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself ; and let the wife see that she fear her husband .
children , obey your parents in the lord : for this is right .
honor thy father and mother ( which is the first commandment with promise ) ,
that it may be well with thee , and thou mayest live long on the earth .
and , ye fathers , provoke not your children to wrath : but nurture them in the chastening and admonition of the lord .
servants , be obedient unto them that according to the flesh are your masters , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as unto christ ;
not in the way of eyeservice , as men-pleasers ; but as servants of christ , doing the will of god from the heart ;
with good will doing service , as unto the lord , and not unto men :
knowing that whatsoever good thing each one doeth , the same shall he receive again from the lord , whether he be bond or free .
finally , be strong in the lord , and in the strength of his might .
put on the whole armor of god , that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil .
wherefore take up the whole armor of god , that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day , and , having done all , to stand .
stand therefore , having girded your loins with truth , and having put on the breastplate of righteousness ,
and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace ;
withal taking up the shield of faith , wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one .
and take the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the spirit , which is the word of god :
with all prayer and supplication praying at all seasons in the spirit , and watching thereunto in all perseverance and supplication for all the saints ,
and on my behalf , that utterance may be given unto me in opening my mouth , to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel ,
for which i am an ambassador in chains ; that in it i may speak boldly , as i ought to speak .
whom i have sent unto you for this very purpose , that ye may know our state , and that he may comfort your hearts .
peace be to the brethren , and love with faith , from god the father and the lord jesus christ .
grace be with all them that love our lord jesus christ with a love incorruptible .
that in those days , when the king ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in shushan the palace ,
when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days , even a hundred and fourscore days .
also vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king ahasuerus .
then the king said to the wise men , who knew the times ( for so was the king ’ s manner toward all that knew law and judgment ;
what shall we do unto the queen vashti according to law , because she hath not done the bidding of the king ahasuerus by the chamberlains ?
and the saying pleased the king and the princes ; and the king did according to the word of memucan :
after these things , when the wrath of king ahasuerus was pacified , he remembered vashti , and what she had done , and what was decreed against her .
then said the king ’ s servants that ministered unto him , let there be fair young virgins sought for the king :
and let the maiden that pleaseth the king be queen instead of vashti . and the thing pleased the king ; and he did so .
esther had not made known her people nor her kindred ; for mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known .
and mordecai walked every day before the court of the women ’ s house , to know how esther did , and what would become of her .
so esther was taken unto king ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month , which is the month tebeth , in the seventh year of his reign .
and when the virgins were gathered together the second time , then mordecai was sitting in the king ’ s gate .
and the thing became known to mordecai , who showed it unto esther the queen ; and esther told the king thereof in mordecai ’ s name .
then the king ’ s servants , that were in the king ’ s gate , said unto mordecai , why transgressest thou the king ’ s commandment ?
and when haman saw that mordecai bowed not down , nor did him reverence , then was haman full of wrath .
and the king took his ring from his hand , and gave it unto haman the son of hammedatha the agagite , the jews ’ enemy .
and the king said unto haman , the silver is given to thee , the people also , to do with them as it seemeth good to thee .
and he came even before the king ’ s gate : for none might enter within the king ’ s gate clothed with sackcloth .
so hathach went forth to mordecai unto the broad place of the city , which was before the king ’ s gate .
and hathach came and told esther the words of mordecai .
then esther spake unto hathach , and gave him a message unto mordecai , saying :
and they told to mordecai esther ’ s words .
then mordecai bade them return answer unto esther , think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king ’ s house , more than all the jews .
then esther bade them return answer unto mordecai ,
so mordecai went his way , and did according to all that esther had commanded him .
and esther said , if it seem good unto the king , let the king and haman come this day unto the banquet that i have prepared for him .
then answered esther , and said , my petition and my request is :
nevertheless haman refrained himself , and went home ; and he sent and fetched his friends and zeresh his wife .
yet all this availeth me nothing , so long as i see mordecai the jew sitting at the king ’ s gate .
on that night could not the king sleep ; and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles , and they were read before the king .
and the king ’ s servants said unto him , behold , haman standeth in the court . and the king said , let him come in .
and haman said unto the king , for the man whom the king delighteth to honor ,
and mordecai came again to the king ’ s gate . but haman hasted to his house , mourning and having his head covered .
while they were yet talking with him , came the king ’ s chamberlains , and hasted to bring haman unto the banquet that esther had prepared .
so the king and haman came to banquet with esther the queen .
and esther said , an adversary and an enemy , even this wicked haman . then haman was afraid before the king and the queen .
so they hanged haman on the gallows that he had prepared for mordecai . then was the king ’ s wrath pacified .
then the king held out to esther the golden sceptre . so esther arose , and stood before the king .
for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people ? or how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred ?
upon one day in all the provinces of king ahasuerus , namely , upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which is the month adar .
the jews had light and gladness , and joy and honor .
for mordecai was great in the king ’ s house , and his fame went forth throughout all the provinces ; for the man mordecai waxed greater and greater .
and in shushan the palace the jews slew and destroyed five hundred men .
and parshandatha , and dalphon , and aspatha ,
and poratha , and adalia , and aridatha ,
and parmashta , and arisai , and aridai , and vaizatha ,
the ten sons of haman the son of hammedatha , the jews ’ enemy , slew they ; but on the spoil they laid not their hand .
on that day the number of those that were slain in shushan the palace was brought before the king .
and the king commanded it so to be done : and a decree was given out in shushan ; and they hanged haman ’ s ten sons .
and mordecai wrote these things , and sent letters unto all the jews that were in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus , both nigh and far ,
to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month adar , and the fifteenth day of the same , yearly ,
and the jews undertook to do as they had begun , and as mordecai had written unto them ;
then esther the queen , the daughter of abihail , and mordecai the jew , wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of purim .
and he sent letters unto all the jews , to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of ahasuerus , with words of peace and truth ,
and the commandment of esther confirmed these matters of purim ; and it was written in the book .
and the king ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land , and upon the isles of the sea .
now these are the names of the sons of israel , who came into egypt ( every man and his household came with jacob ) :
reuben , simeon , levi , and judah ,
issachar , zebulun , and benjamin ,
dan and naphtali , gad and asher .
and all the souls that came out of the loins of jacob were seventy souls : and joseph was in egypt already .
and joseph died , and all his brethren , and all that generation .
and the children of israel were fruitful , and increased abundantly , and multiplied , and waxed exceeding mighty ; and the land was filled with them .
now there arose a new king over egypt , who knew not joseph .
and he said unto his people , behold , the people of the children of israel are more and mightier than we :
therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens . and they built for pharaoh store-cities , pithom and raamses .
but the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad . and they were grieved because of the children of israel .
and the egyptians made the children of israel to serve with rigor :
and the king of egypt spake to the hebrew midwives , of whom the name of the one was shiphrah , and the name of the other puah :
but the midwives feared god , and did not as the king of egypt commanded them , but saved the men-children alive .
and the king of egypt called for the midwives , and said unto them , why have ye done this thing , and have saved the men-children alive ?
and god dealt well with the midwives : and the people multiplied , and waxed very mighty .
and it came to pass , because the midwives feared god , that he made them households .
and pharaoh charged all his people , saying , every son that is born ye shall cast into the river , and every daughter ye shall save alive .
and there went a man of the house of levi , and took to wife a daughter of levi .
and the woman conceived , and bare a son : and when she saw him that he was a goodly child , she hid him three months .
and his sister stood afar off , to know what would be done to him .
and pharaoh ’ s daughter said to her , go . and the maiden went and called the child ’ s mother .
now the priest of midian had seven daughters : and they came and drew water , and filled the troughs to water their father ’ s flock .
and the shepherds came and drove them away ; but moses stood up and helped them , and watered their flock .
and when they came to reuel their father , he said , how is it that ye are come so soon to-day ?
and they said , an egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds , and moreover he drew water for us , and watered the flock .
and moses was content to dwell with the man : and he gave moses zipporah his daughter .
and she bare a son , and he called his name gershom ; for he said , i have been a sojourner in a foreign land .
and god heard their groaning , and god remembered his covenant with abraham , with isaac , and with jacob .
and god saw the children of israel , and god took knowledge of them .
and moses said , i will turn aside now , and see this great sight , why the bush is not burnt .
and he said , draw not nigh hither : put off thy shoes from off thy feet , for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground .
and now , behold , the cry of the children of israel is come unto me : moreover i have seen the oppression wherewith the egyptians oppress them .
come now therefore , and i will send thee unto pharaoh , that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt .
and i know that the king of egypt will not give you leave to go , no , not by a mighty hand .
and jehovah said unto him , what is that in thy hand ? and he said , a rod .
now therefore go , and i will be with thy mouth , and teach thee what thou shalt speak .
and he said , oh , lord , send , i pray thee , by the hand of him whom thou wilt send .
and thou shalt take in thy hand this rod , wherewith thou shalt do the signs .
and jehovah said unto moses in midian , go , return into egypt ; for all the men are dead that sought thy life .
and thou shalt say unto pharaoh , thus saith jehovah , israel is my son , my first-born :
and it came to pass on the way at the lodging-place , that jehovah met him , and sought to kill him .
so he let him alone . then she said , a bridegroom of blood art thou , because of the circumcision .
and moses told aaron all the words of jehovah wherewith he had sent him , and all the signs wherewith he had charged him .
and moses and aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of israel :
and aaron spake all the words which jehovah had spoken unto moses , and did the signs in the sight of the people .
and the king of egypt said unto them , wherefore do ye , moses and aaron , loose the people from their works ? get you unto your burdens .
and pharaoh said , behold , the people of the land are now many , and ye make them rest from their burdens .
and the same day pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people , and their officers , saying ,
ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick , as heretofore : let them go and gather straw for themselves .
let heavier work be laid upon the men , that they may labor therein ; and let them not regard lying words .
go yourselves , get you straw where ye can find it ; for nought of your work shall be diminished .
so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of egypt to gather stubble for straw .
and the taskmasters were urgent , saying , fulfil your works , your daily tasks , as when there was straw .
then the officers of the children of israel came and cried unto pharaoh , saying , wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants ?
but he said , ye are idle , ye are idle : therefore ye say , let us go and sacrifice to jehovah .
go therefore now , and work ; for there shall no straw be given you , yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks .
and they met moses and aaron , who stood in the way , as they came forth from pharaoh :
and moses returned unto jehovah , and said , lord , wherefore hast thou dealt ill with this people ? why is it that thou hast sent me ?
for since i came to pharaoh to speak in thy name , he hath dealt ill with this people ; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all .
and god spake unto moses , and said unto him , i am jehovah :
and i appeared unto abraham , unto isaac , and unto jacob , as god almighty ; but by my name jehovah i was not known to them .
and i have also established my covenant with them , to give them the land of canaan , the land of their sojournings , wherein they sojourned .
and moreover i have heard the groaning of the children of israel , whom the egyptians keep in bondage ; and i have remembered my covenant .
and moses spake so unto the children of israel : but they hearkened not unto moses for anguish of spirit , and for cruel bondage .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
go in , speak unto pharaoh king of egypt , that he let the children of israel go out of his land .
the sons of gershon : libni and shimei , according to their families .
and the sons of merari : mahli and mushi . these are the families of the levites according to their generations .
and the sons of izhar : korah , and nepheg , and zichri .
and the sons of uzziel : mishael , and elzaphan , and sithri .
and the sons of korah : assir , and elkanah , and abiasaph ; these are the families of the korahites .
these are that aaron and moses , to whom jehovah said , bring out the children of israel from the land of egypt according to their hosts .
these are they that spake to pharaoh king of egypt , to bring out the children of israel from egypt : these are that moses and aaron .
and it came to pass on the day when jehovah spake unto moses in the land of egypt ,
that jehovah spake unto moses , saying , i am jehovah : speak thou unto pharaoh king of egypt all that i speak unto thee .
and moses said before jehovah , behold , i am of uncircumcised lips , and how shall pharaoh hearken unto me ?
and jehovah said unto moses , see , i have made thee as god to pharaoh ; and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet .
and i will harden pharaoh ’ s heart , and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of egypt .
and the egyptians shall know that i am jehovah , when i stretch forth my hand upon egypt , and bring out the children of israel from among them .
and moses and aaron did so ; as jehovah commanded them , so did they .
and moses was fourscore years old , and aaron fourscore and three years old , when they spake unto pharaoh .
and jehovah spake unto moses and unto aaron , saying ,
then pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers : and they also , the magicians of egypt , did in like manner with their enchantments .
for they cast down every man his rod , and they became serpents : but aaron ’ s rod swallowed up their rods .
and pharaoh ’ s heart was hardened , and he hearkened not unto them ; as jehovah had spoken .
and jehovah said unto moses , pharaoh ’ s heart is stubborn , he refuseth to let the people go .
and the fish that are in the river shall die , and the river shall become foul ; and the egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river .
and pharaoh turned and went into his house , neither did he lay even this to heart .
and all the egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink ; for they could not drink of the water of the river .
and seven days were fulfilled , after that jehovah had smitten the river .
and if thou refuse to let them go , behold , i will smite all thy borders with frogs :
and the frogs shall come up both upon thee , and upon thy people , and upon all thy servants .
and aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of egypt ; and the frogs came up , and covered the land of egypt .
and the magicians did in like manner with their enchantments , and brought up frogs upon the land of egypt .
and moses and aaron went out from pharaoh : and moses cried unto jehovah concerning the frogs which he had brought upon pharaoh .
and jehovah did according to the word of moses ; and the frogs died out of the houses , out of the courts , and out of the fields .
and they gathered them together in heaps ; and the land stank .
but when pharaoh saw that there was respite , he hardened his heart , and hearkened not unto them ; as jehovah had spoken .
and the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice , but they could not : and there were lice upon man , and upon beast .
and i will put a division between my people and thy people : by to-morrow shall this sign be .
and pharaoh called for moses and for aaron , and said , go ye , sacrifice to your god in the land .
we will go three days ’ journey into the wilderness , and sacrifice to jehovah our god , as he shall command us .
and moses went out from pharaoh , and entreated jehovah .
and pharaoh hardened his heart this time also , and he did not let the people go .
for if thou refuse to let them go , and wilt hold them still ,
and jehovah appointed a set time , saying , to-morrow jehovah shall do this thing in the land .
and jehovah did that thing on the morrow ; and all the cattle of egypt died ; but of the cattle of the children of israel died not one .
and the magicians could not stand before moses because of the boils ; for the boils were upon the magicians , and upon all the egyptians .
and jehovah hardened the heart of pharaoh , and he hearkened not unto them ; as jehovah had spoken unto moses .
for now i had put forth my hand , and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence , and thou hadst been cut off from the earth :
as yet exaltest thou thyself against my people , that thou wilt not let them go ?
he that feared the word of jehovah among the servants of pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses :
and he that regarded not the word of jehovah left his servants and his cattle in the field .
only in the land of goshen , where the children of israel were , was there no hail .
entreat jehovah ; for there hath been enough of these mighty thunderings and hail ; and i will let you go , and ye shall stay no longer .
but as for thee and thy servants , i know that ye will not yet fear jehovah god .
and the flax and the barley were smitten : for the barley was in the ear , and the flax was in bloom .
but the wheat and the spelt were not smitten : for they were not grown up .
and the heart of pharaoh was hardened , and he did not let the children of israel go ; as jehovah had spoken by moses .
else , if thou refuse to let my people go , behold , to-morrow will i bring locusts into thy border :
then pharaoh called for moses and aaron in haste ; and he said , i have sinned against jehovah your god , and against you .
and he went out from pharaoh , and entreated jehovah .
but jehovah hardened pharaoh ’ s heart , and he did not let the children of israel go .
and moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven ; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of egypt three days ;
they saw not one another , neither rose any one from his place for three days : but all the children of israel had light in their dwellings .
and moses said , thou must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt-offerings , that we may sacrifice unto jehovah our god .
but jehovah hardened pharaoh ’ s heart , and he would not let them go .
and moses said , thou hast spoken well ; i will see thy face again no more .
and moses said , thus saith jehovah , about midnight will i go out into the midst of egypt :
and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of egypt , such as there hath not been , nor shall be any more .
and jehovah said unto moses , pharaoh will not hearken unto you ; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of egypt .
and jehovah spake unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt , saying ,
this month shall be unto you the beginning of months : it shall be the first month of the year to you .
your lamb shall be without blemish , a male a year old : ye shall take it from the sheep , or from the goats :
and ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month ; and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it at even .
and they shall take of the blood , and put it on the two side-posts and on the lintel , upon the houses wherein they shall eat it .
and they shall eat the flesh in that night , roast with fire , and unleavened bread ; with bitter herbs they shall eat it .
eat not of it raw , nor boiled at all with water , but roast with fire ; its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof .
and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; but that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire .
ye shall eat nothing leavened ; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread .
and ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever .
and it shall come to pass , when your children shall say unto you , what mean ye by this service ?
and the children of israel went and did so ; as jehovah had commanded moses and aaron , so did they .
take both your flocks and your herds , as ye have said , and be gone ; and bless me also .
and the egyptians were urgent upon the people , to send them out of the land in haste ; for they said , we are all dead men .
and the people took their dough before it was leavened , their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders .
and jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the egyptians , so that they let them have what they asked . and they despoiled the egyptians .
and the children of israel journeyed from rameses to succoth , about six hundred thousand on foot that were men , besides children .
and a mixed multitude went up also with them ; and flocks , and herds , even very much cattle .
now the time that the children of israel dwelt in egypt was four hundred and thirty years .
and jehovah said unto moses and aaron , this is the ordinance of the passover : there shall no foreigner eat thereof ;
but every man ’ s servant that is bought for money , when thou hast circumcised him , then shall he eat thereof .
a sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof .
all the congregation of israel shall keep it .
one law shall be to him that is home-born , and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you .
thus did all the children of israel ; as jehovah commanded moses and aaron , so did they .
and it came to pass the selfsame day , that jehovah did bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt by their hosts .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
sanctify unto me all the first-born , whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of israel , both of man and of beast : it is mine .
this day ye go forth in the month abib .
seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread , and in the seventh day shall be a feast to jehovah .
and thou shalt tell thy son in that day , saying , it is because of that which jehovah did for me when i came forth out of egypt .
thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year .
and they took their journey from succoth , and encamped in etham , in the edge of the wilderness .
the pillar of cloud by day , and the pillar of fire by night , departed not from before the people .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and pharaoh will say of the children of israel , they are entangled in the land , the wilderness hath shut them in .
and he made ready his chariot , and took his people with him :
and he took six hundred chosen chariots , and all the chariots of egypt , and captains over all of them .
jehovah will fight for you , and ye shall hold your peace .
and jehovah said unto moses , wherefore criest thou unto me ? speak unto the children of israel , that they go forward .
and the egyptians shall know that i am jehovah , when i have gotten me honor upon pharaoh , upon his chariots , and upon his horsemen .
and the egyptians pursued , and went in after them into the midst of the sea , all pharaoh ’ s horses , his chariots , and his horsemen .
thus jehovah saved israel that day out of the hand of the egyptians ; and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the sea-shore .
then sang moses and the children of israel this song unto jehovah , and spake , saying ,
jehovah is my strength and song ,
jehovah is a man of war :
pharaoh ’ s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea ;
the deeps cover them :
thy right hand , o jehovah , is glorious in power ,
and in the greatness of thine excellency thou overthrowest them that rise up against thee : thou sendest forth thy wrath , it consumeth them as stubble .
and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were piled up ,
the enemy said , i will pursue , i will overtake , i will divide the spoil ;
thou didst blow with thy wind , the sea covered them :
who is like unto thee , o jehovah , among the gods ?
thou stretchedst out thy right hand ,
thou in thy lovingkindness hast led the people that thou hast redeemed :
the peoples have heard , they tremble :
then were the chiefs of edom dismayed ;
terror and dread falleth upon them ;
thou wilt bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance ,
jehovah shall reign for ever and ever .
and miriam answered them ,
and the people murmured against moses , saying , what shall we drink ?
and they came to elim , where were twelve springs of water , and threescore and ten palm-trees : and they encamped there by the waters .
and the whole congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron in the wilderness :
and moses said unto aaron , say unto all the congregation of the children of israel , come near before jehovah ; for he hath heard your murmurings .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and the children of israel did so , and gathered some more , some less .
and moses said unto them , let no man leave of it till the morning .
and they gathered it morning by morning , every man according to his eating : and when the sun waxed hot , it melted .
and they laid it up till the morning , as moses bade : and it did not become foul , neither was there any worm therein .
and moses said , eat that to-day ; for to-day is a sabbath unto jehovah : to-day ye shall not find it in the field .
six days ye shall gather it ; but on the seventh day is the sabbath , in it there shall be none .
and it came to pass on the seventh day , that there went out some of the people to gather , and they found none .
and jehovah said unto moses , how long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws ?
so the people rested on the seventh day .
as jehovah commanded moses , so aaron laid it up before the testimony , to be kept .
now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah .
and moses cried unto jehovah , saying , what shall i do unto this people ? they are almost ready to stone me .
then came amalek , and fought with israel in rephidim .
and it came to pass , when moses held up his hand , that israel prevailed ; and when he let down his hand , amalek prevailed .
and joshua discomfited amalek and his people with the edge of the sword .
and moses built an altar , and called the name of it jehovah-nissi ;
and he said , jehovah hath sworn : jehovah will have war with amalek from generation to generation .
and jethro , moses ’ father-in-law , took zipporah , moses ’ wife , after he had sent her away ,
and her two sons ; of whom the name of the one was gershom ; for he said , i have been a sojourner in a foreign land :
and jethro , moses ’ father-in-law , came with his sons and his wife unto moses into the wilderness where he was encamped , at the mount of god :
and he said unto moses , i , thy father-in-law jethro , am come unto thee , and thy wife , and her two sons with her .
and jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which jehovah had done to israel , in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the egyptians .
now i know that jehovah is greater than all gods ; yea , in the thing wherein they dealt proudly against them .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that moses sat to judge the people : and the people stood about moses from the morning unto the evening .
and moses said unto his father-in-law , because the people come unto me to inquire of god :
and moses ’ father-in-law said unto him , the thing that thou doest is not good .
and thou shalt teach them the statutes and the laws , and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk , and the work that they must do .
so moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law , and did all that he had said .
and they judged the people at all seasons : the hard causes they brought unto moses , but every small matter they judged themselves .
and moses let his father-in-law depart ; and he went his way into his own land .
in the third month after the children of israel were gone forth out of the land of egypt , the same day came they into the wilderness of sinai .
ye have seen what i did unto the egyptians , and how i bare you on eagles ’ wings , and brought you unto myself .
and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests , and a holy nation . these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel .
and moses came and called for the elders of the people , and set before them all these words which jehovah commanded him .
and all the people answered together , and said , all that jehovah hath spoken we will do . and moses reported the words of the people unto jehovah .
and jehovah said unto moses , go unto the people , and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow , and let them wash their garments ,
and be ready against the third day ; for the third day jehovah will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount sinai .
and moses went down from the mount unto the people , and sanctified the people ; and they washed their garments .
and he said unto the people , be ready against the third day : come not near a woman .
and moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet god ; and they stood at the nether part of the mount .
and when the voice of the trumpet waxed louder and louder , moses spake , and god answered him by a voice .
and jehovah said unto moses , go down , charge the people , lest they break through unto jehovah to gaze , and many of them perish .
and let the priests also , that come near to jehovah , sanctify themselves , lest jehovah break forth upon them .
so moses went down unto the people , and told them .
and god spake all these words , saying ,
i am jehovah thy god , who brought thee out of the land of egypt , out of the house of bondage .
thou shalt have no other gods before me .
and showing lovingkindness unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments .
thou shalt not take the name of jehovah thy god in vain ; for jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain .
remember the sabbath day , to keep it holy .
six days shalt thou labor , and do all thy work ;
honor thy father and thy mother , that thy days may be long in the land which jehovah thy god giveth thee .
thou shalt not kill .
thou shalt not commit adultery .
thou shalt not steal .
thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor .
and they said unto moses , speak thou with us , and we will hear ; but let not god speak with us , lest we die .
and the people stood afar off , and moses drew near unto the thick darkness where god was .
and jehovah said unto moses , thus thou shalt say unto the children of israel , ye yourselves have seen that i have talked with you from heaven .
ye shall not make other gods with me ; gods of silver , or gods of gold , ye shall not make unto you .
neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar , that thy nakedness be not uncovered thereon .
now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them .
if thou buy a hebrew servant , six years he shall serve : and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing .
if he come in by himself , he shall go out by himself : if he be married , then his wife shall go out with him .
but if the servant shall plainly say , i love my master , my wife , and my children ; i will not go out free :
and if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant , she shall not go out as the men-servants do .
and if he espouse her unto his son , he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters .
if he take him another wife ; her food , her raiment , and her duty of marriage , shall he not diminish .
and if he do not these three things unto her , then shall she go out for nothing , without money .
he that smiteth a man , so that he dieth , shall surely be put to death .
and if a man lie not in wait , but god deliver him into his hand ; then i will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee .
and if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor , to slay him with guile ; thou shalt take him from mine altar , that he may die .
and he that smiteth his father , or his mother , shall be surely put to death .
and he that stealeth a man , and selleth him , or if he be found in his hand , he shall surely be put to death .
and he that curseth his father or his mother , shall surely be put to death .
and if men contend , and one smite the other with a stone , or with his fist , and he die not , but keep his bed ;
and if a man smite his servant , or his maid , with a rod , and he die under his hand ; he shall surely be punished .
notwithstanding , if he continue a day or two , he shall not be punished : for he is his money .
but if any harm follow , then thou shalt give life for life ,
eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot ,
burning for burning , wound for wound , stripe for stripe .
if there be laid on him a ransom , then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him .
whether it have gored a son , or have gored a daughter , according to this judgment shall it be done unto him .
if the ox gore a man-servant or a maid-servant , there shall be given unto their master thirty shekels of silver , and the ox shall be stoned .
the owner of the pit shall make it good ; he shall give money unto the owner thereof , and the dead beast shall be his .
if the thief be found breaking in , and be smitten so that he dieth , there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him .
if the theft be found in his hand alive , whether it be ox , or ass , or sheep ; he shall pay double .
but if it be stolen from him , he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof .
if it be torn in pieces , let him bring it for witness ; he shall not make good that which was torn .
if the owner thereof be with it , he shall not make it good : if it be a hired thing , it came for its hire .
and if a man entice a virgin that is not betrothed , and lie with her , he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife .
if her father utterly refuse to give her unto him , he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins .
thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live .
whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death .
he that sacrificeth unto any god , save unto jehovah only , shall be utterly destroyed .
and a sojourner shalt thou not wrong , neither shalt thou oppress him : for ye were sojourners in the land of egypt .
ye shall not afflict any widow , or fatherless child .
if thou afflict them at all , and they cry at all unto me , i will surely hear their cry ;
and my wrath shall wax hot , and i will kill you with the sword ; and your wives shall be widows , and your children fatherless .
if thou at all take thy neighbor ’ s garment to pledge , thou shalt restore it unto him before the sun goeth down :
thou shalt not revile god , nor curse a ruler of thy people .
thou shalt not delay to offer of thy harvest , and of the outflow of thy presses . the first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto me .
thou shalt not take up a false report : put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness .
thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil ; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to turn aside after a multitude to wrest justice :
neither shalt thou favor a poor man in his cause .
if thou meet thine enemy ’ s ox or his ass going astray , thou shalt surely bring it back to him again .
if thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden , thou shalt forbear to leave him , thou shalt surely release it with him .
thou shalt not wrest the justice due to thy poor in his cause .
keep thee far from a false matter ; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not : for i will not justify the wicked .
and thou shalt take no bribe : for a bribe blindeth them that have sight , and perverteth the words of the righteous .
and a sojourner shalt thou not oppress : for ye know the heart of a sojourner , seeing ye were sojourners in the land of egypt .
and six years thou shalt sow thy land , and shalt gather in the increase thereof :
three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year .
three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the lord jehovah .
thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread ; neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning .
behold , i send an angel before thee , to keep thee by the way , and to bring thee into the place which i have prepared .
there shall none cast her young , nor be barren , in thy land : the number of thy days i will fulfil .
and i will send the hornet before thee , which shall drive out the hivite , the canaanite , and the hittite , from before thee .
i will not drive them out from before thee in one year , lest the land become desolate , and the beasts of the field multiply against thee .
by little and little i will drive them out from before thee , until thou be increased , and inherit the land .
thou shalt make no covenant with them , nor with their gods .
and moses alone shall come near unto jehovah ; but they shall not come near ; neither shall the people go up with him .
and he sent young men of the children of israel , who offered burnt-offerings , and sacrificed peace-offerings of oxen unto jehovah .
and moses took half of the blood , and put it in basins ; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar .
then went up moses , and aaron , nadab , and abihu , and seventy of the elders of israel :
and upon the nobles of the children of israel he laid not his hand : and they beheld god , and did eat and drink .
and moses rose up , and joshua his minister : and moses went up into the mount of god .
and moses went up into the mount , and the cloud covered the mount .
and the appearance of the glory of jehovah was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of israel .
and moses entered into the midst of the cloud , and went up into the mount : and moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
speak unto the children of israel , that they take for me an offering : of every man whose heart maketh him willing ye shall take my offering .
and this is the offering which ye shall take of them : gold , and silver , and brass ,
and blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine linen , and goats ’ hair ,
and rams ’ skins dyed red , and sealskins , and acacia wood ,
oil for the light , spices for the anointing oil , and for the sweet incense ,
onyx stones , and stones to be set , for the ephod , and for the breastplate .
and let them make me a sanctuary , that i may dwell among them .
according to all that i show thee , the pattern of the tabernacle , and the pattern of all the furniture thereof , even so shall ye make it .
and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold , within and without shalt thou overlay it , and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about .
and thou shalt make staves of acacia wood , and overlay them with gold .
and thou shalt put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark , wherewith to bear the ark .
the staves shall be in the rings of the ark : they shall not be taken from it .
and thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which i shall give thee .
and thou shalt make two cherubim of gold ; of beaten work shalt thou make them , at the two ends of the mercy-seat .
and thou shalt put the mercy-seat above upon the ark ; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that i shall give thee .
and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold , and make thereto a crown of gold round about .
and thou shalt make unto it a border of a handbreadth round about ; and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about .
and thou shalt make for it four rings of gold , and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof .
close by the border shall the rings be , for places for the staves to bear the table .
and thou shalt make the staves of acacia wood , and overlay them with gold , that the table may be borne with them .
and thou shalt set upon the table showbread before me alway .
and in the candlestick four cups made like almond-blossoms , the knops thereof , and the flowers thereof ;
their knops and their branches shall be of one piece with it ; the whole of it one beaten work of pure gold .
and thou shalt make the lamps thereof , seven : and they shall light the lamps thereof , to give light over against it .
and the snuffers thereof , and the snuffdishes thereof , shall be of pure gold .
of a talent of pure gold shall it be made , with all these vessels .
and see that thou make them after their pattern , which hath been showed thee in the mount .
the length of each curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits , and the breadth of each curtain four cubits : all the curtains shall have one measure .
five curtains shall be coupled together one to another ; and the other five curtains shall be coupled one to another .
and thou shalt make fifty clasps of gold , and couple the curtains one to another with the clasps : and the tabernacle shall be one whole .
and thou shalt make curtains of goats ’ hair for a tent over the tabernacle : eleven curtains shalt thou make them .
the length of each curtain shall be thirty cubits , and the breadth of each curtain four cubits : the eleven curtains shall have one measure .
and thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves , and six curtains by themselves , and shalt double over the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tent .
and thou shalt make fifty clasps of brass , and put the clasps into the loops , and couple the tent together , that it may be one .
and the overhanging part that remaineth of the curtains of the tent , the half curtain that remaineth , shall hang over the back of the tabernacle .
and thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams ’ skins dyed red , and a covering of sealskins above .
and thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood , standing up .
ten cubits shall be the length of a board , and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board .
two tenons shall there be in each board , joined one to another : thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle .
and thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle , twenty boards for the south side southward .
and for the second side of the tabernacle , on the north side , twenty boards ,
and their forty sockets of silver ; two sockets under one board , and two sockets under another board .

it shall have two shoulder-pieces joined to the two ends thereof , that it may be joined together .
and thou shalt take two onyx stones , and grave on them the names of the children of israel :
six of their names on the one stone , and the names of the six that remain on the other stone , according to their birth .

and thou shalt put it on a lace of blue , and it shall be upon the mitre ; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be .
and thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover the flesh of their nakedness ; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach :
and unleavened bread , and cakes unleavened mingled with oil , and wafers unleavened anointed with oil : of fine wheaten flour shalt thou make them .
and thou shalt put them into one basket , and bring them in the basket , with the bullock and the two rams .
and aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tent of meeting , and shalt wash them with water .

and thou shalt kill the bullock before jehovah , at the door of the tent of meeting .
but the flesh of the bullock , and its skin , and its dung , shalt thou burn with fire without the camp : it is a sin-offering .
thou shalt also take the one ram ; and aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram .
and thou shalt slay the ram , and thou shalt take its blood , and sprinkle it round about upon the altar .
and thou shalt take the other ram ; and aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram .

and thus shalt thou do unto aaron , and to his sons , according to all that i have commanded thee : seven days shalt thou consecrate them .
seven days thou shalt make atonement for the altar , and sanctify it : and the altar shall be most holy ; whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy .
now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar : two lambs a year old day by day continually .
the one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning ; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even :
and there i will meet with the children of israel ; and the tent shall be sanctified by my glory .
and i will dwell among the children of israel , and will be their god .
and thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon : of acacia wood shalt thou make it .
and thou shalt make the staves of acacia wood , and overlay them with gold .
and aaron shall burn thereon incense of sweet spices : every morning , when he dresseth the lamps , he shall burn it .
and when aaron lighteth the lamps at even , he shall burn it , a perpetual incense before jehovah throughout your generations .
ye shall offer no strange incense thereon , nor burnt-offering , nor meal-offering ; and ye shall pour no drink-offering thereon .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered , from twenty years old and upward , shall give the offering of jehovah .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat :
moreover jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and of cassia five hundred , after the shekel of the sanctuary , and of olive oil a hin ;
and thou shalt make it a holy anointing oil , a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer : it shall be a holy anointing oil .
and thou shalt anoint therewith the tent of meeting , and the ark of the testimony ,
and the table and all the vessels thereof , and the candlestick and the vessels thereof , and the altar of incense ,
and the altar of burnt-offering with all the vessels thereof , and the laver and the base thereof .
and thou shalt sanctify them , that they may be most holy : whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy .
and thou shalt anoint aaron and his sons , and sanctify them , that they may minister unto me in the priest ’ s office .
and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel , saying , this shall be a holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations .
whosoever compoundeth any like it , or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger , he shall be cut off from his people .
and thou shalt make of it incense , a perfume after the art of the perfumer , seasoned with salt , pure and holy :
and the incense which thou shalt make , according to the composition thereof ye shall not make for yourselves : it shall be unto thee holy for jehovah .
whosoever shall make like unto that , to smell thereof , he shall be cut off from his people .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
see , i have called by name bezalel the son of uri , the son of hur , of the tribe of judah :
and i have filled him with the spirit of god , in wisdom , and in understanding , and in knowledge , and in all manner of workmanship ,
to devise skilful works , to work in gold , and in silver , and in brass ,
and in cutting of stones for setting , and in carving of wood , to work in all manner of workmanship .
the tent of meeting , and the ark of the testimony , and the mercy-seat that is thereupon , and all the furniture of the tent ,
and the table and its vessels , and the pure candlestick with all its vessels , and the altar of incense ,
and the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels , and the laver and its base ,
and the anointing oil , and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place : according to all that i have commanded thee shall they do .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
wherefore the children of israel shall keep the sabbath , to observe the sabbath throughout their generations , for a perpetual covenant .
and all the people brake off the golden rings which were in their ears , and brought them unto aaron .
and when aaron saw this , he built an altar before it ; and aaron made proclamation , and said , to-morrow shall be a feast to jehovah .
and jehovah said unto moses , i have seen this people , and , behold , it is a stiffnecked people :
and jehovah repented of the evil which he said he would do unto his people .
and the tables were the work of god , and the writing was the writing of god , graven upon the tables .
and when joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted , he said unto moses , there is a noise of war in the camp .
and moses said unto aaron , what did this people unto thee , that thou hast brought a great sin upon them ?
and aaron said , let not the anger of my lord wax hot : thou knowest the people , that they are set on evil .
and when moses saw that the people were broken loose ( for aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies ) ,
and the sons of levi did according to the word of moses : and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men .
and moses returned unto jehovah , and said , oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold .
yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin— ; and if not , blot me , i pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written .
and jehovah said unto moses , whosoever hath sinned against me , him will i blot out of my book .
and jehovah smote the people , because they made the calf , which aaron made .
and when the people heard these evil tidings , they mourned : and no man did put on him his ornaments .
and the children of israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount horeb onward .
and he said , my presence shall go with thee , and i will give thee rest .
and he said unto him , if thy presence go not with me , carry us not up hence .
and he said , show me , i pray thee , thy glory .
and he said , thou canst not see my face ; for man shall not see me and live .
and jehovah said , behold , there is a place by me , and thou shalt stand upon the rock :
and i will take away my hand , and thou shalt see my back ; but my face shall not be seen .
and be ready by the morning , and come up in the morning unto mount sinai , and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount .
and jehovah descended in the cloud , and stood with him there , and proclaimed the name of jehovah .
and moses made haste , and bowed his head toward the earth , and worshipped .
but ye shall break down their altars , and dash in pieces their pillars , and ye shall cut down their asherim
( for thou shalt worship no other god : for jehovah , whose name is jealous , is a jealous god ) ;
thou shalt make thee no molten gods .
all that openeth the womb is mine ; and all thy cattle that is male , the firstlings of cow and sheep .
six days thou shalt work , but on the seventh day thou shalt rest : in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest .
and thou shalt observe the feast of weeks , even of the first-fruits of wheat harvest , and the feast of ingathering at the year ’ s end .
three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the lord jehovah , the god of israel .
thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread ; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning .
and jehovah said unto moses , write thou these words : for after the tenor of these words i have made a covenant with thee and with israel .
and when aaron and all the children of israel saw moses , behold , the skin of his face shone ; and they were afraid to come nigh him .
and moses called unto them ; and aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him : and moses spake to them .
and afterward all the children of israel came nigh : and he gave them in commandment all that jehovah had spoken with him in mount sinai .
and when moses had done speaking with them , he put a veil on his face .
ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day .
and moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of israel , saying , this is the thing which jehovah commanded , saying ,
and blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine linen , and goats ’ hair ,
and rams ’ skins dyed red , and sealskins , and acacia wood ,
and oil for the light , and spices for the anointing oil , and for the sweet incense ,
and onyx stones , and stones to be set , for the ephod , and for the breastplate .
and let every wise-hearted man among you come , and make all that jehovah hath commanded :
the tabernacle , its tent , and its covering , its clasps , and its boards , its bars , its pillars , and its sockets ;
the ark , and the staves thereof , the mercy-seat , and the veil of the screen ;
the table , and its staves , and all its vessels , and the showbread ;
the candlestick also for the light , and its vessels , and its lamps , and the oil for the light ;
the altar of burnt-offering , with its grating of brass , its staves , and all its vessels , the laver and its base ;
the hangings of the court , the pillars thereof , and their sockets , and the screen for the gate of the court ;
the pins of the tabernacle , and the pins of the court , and their cords ;
and all the congregation of the children of israel departed from the presence of moses .
and all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats ’ hair .
and the rulers brought the onyx stones , and the stones to be set , for the ephod , and for the breastplate ;
and the spice , and the oil ; for the light , and for the anointing oil , and for the sweet incense .
and he hath filled him with the spirit of god , in wisdom , in understanding , and in knowledge , and in all manner of workmanship ;
and to devise skilful works , to work in gold , and in silver , and in brass ,
and in cutting of stones for setting , and in carving of wood , to work in all manner of skilful workmanship .
and he hath put in his heart that he may teach , both he , and oholiab , the son of ahisamach , of the tribe of dan .
and all the wise men , that wrought all the work of the sanctuary , came every man from his work which they wrought ;
and they spake unto moses , saying , the people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which jehovah commanded to make .
for the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it , and too much .
the length of each curtain was eight and twenty cubits , and the breadth of each curtain four cubits : all the curtains had one measure .
and he coupled five curtains one to another : and the other five curtains he coupled one to another .
and he made fifty clasps of gold , and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps : so the tabernacle was one .
and he made curtains of goats ’ hair for a tent over the tabernacle : eleven curtains he made them .
the length of each curtain was thirty cubits , and four cubits the breadth of each curtain : the eleven curtains had one measure .
and he coupled five curtains by themselves , and six curtains by themselves .
and he made fifty clasps of brass to couple the tent together , that it might be one .

and he made the boards for the tabernacle , of acacia wood , standing up .
ten cubits was the length of a board , and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board .
each board had two tenons , joined one to another : thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle .
and he made the boards for the tabernacle : twenty boards for the south side southward ;
and for the second side of the tabernacle , on the north side , he made twenty boards ,
and their forty sockets of silver ; two sockets under one board , and two sockets under another board .
and for the hinder part of the tabernacle westward he made six boards .
and two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the hinder part .
and there were eight boards , and their sockets of silver , sixteen sockets ; under every board two sockets .
and he made bars of acacia wood ; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle ,
and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle , and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the hinder part westward .
and he made the middle bar to pass through in the midst of the boards from the one end to the other .
and he overlaid the boards with gold , and made their rings of gold for places for the bars , and overlaid the bars with gold .
and the five pillars of it with their hooks : and he overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold ; and their five sockets were of brass .
and he overlaid it with pure gold within and without , and made a crown of gold to it round about .
and he made staves of acacia wood , and overlaid them with gold .
and he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark , to bear the ark .
and he made a mercy-seat of pure gold : two cubits and a half was the length thereof , and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof .
and he made two cherubim of gold ; of beaten work made he them , at the two ends of the mercy-seat ;
and he overlaid it with pure gold , and made thereto a crown of gold round about .
and he made unto it a border of a handbreadth round about , and made a golden crown to the border thereof round about .
and he cast for it four rings of gold , and put the rings in the four corners that were on the four feet thereof .
close by the border were the rings , the places for the staves to bear the table .
and he made the staves of acacia wood , and overlaid them with gold , to bear the table .
and in the candlestick were four cups made like almond-blossoms , the knops thereof , and the flowers thereof ;
their knops and their branches were of one piece with it : the whole of it was one beaten work of pure gold .
and he made the lamps thereof , seven , and the snuffers thereof , and the snuffdishes thereof , of pure gold .
of a talent of pure gold made he it , and all the vessels thereof .
and he made the staves of acacia wood , and overlaid them with gold .

and he made for the altar a grating of network of brass , under the ledge round it beneath , reaching halfway up .
and he cast four rings for the four ends of the grating of brass , to be places for the staves .
and he made the staves of acacia wood , and overlaid them with brass .
and he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar , wherewith to bear it ; he made it hollow with planks .
and he made the court : for the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen , a hundred cubits ;
their pillars were twenty , and their sockets twenty , of brass ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver .
and for the east side eastward fifty cubits .
the hangings for the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits ; their pillars three , and their sockets three ;

and all the pins of the tabernacle , and of the court round about , were of brass .
and bezalel the son of uri , the son of hur , of the tribe of judah , made all that jehovah commanded moses .
and of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars , and overlaid their capitals , and made fillets for them .
and the brass of the offering was seventy talents , and two thousand and four hundred shekels .
and he made the ephod of gold , blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen .
they made shoulder-pieces for it , joined together ; at the two ends was it joined together .
and he put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod , to be stones of memorial for the children of israel ; as jehovah commanded moses .
it was foursquare ; they made the breastplate double : a span was the length thereof , and a span the breadth thereof , being double .
and they set in it four rows of stones . a row of sardius , topaz , and carbuncle was the first row ;
and the second row , an emerald , a sapphire , and a diamond ;
and the third row , a jacinth , an agate , and an amethyst ;
and the fourth row , a beryl , an onyx , and a jasper : they were inclosed in inclosings of gold in their settings .

and they made two settings of gold , and two gold rings , and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate .
and they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate .
and he made the robe of the ephod of woven work , all of blue ;
and they made upon the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and twined linen .
and they made bells of pure gold , and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the skirts of the robe round about , between the pomegranates ;
a bell and a pomegranate , a bell and a pomegranate , upon the skirts of the robe round about , to minister in ; as jehovah commanded moses .
and they made the coats of fine linen of woven work for aaron , and for his sons ,
and the mitre of fine linen , and the goodly head-tires of fine linen , and the linen breeches of fine twined linen ,
and the girdle of fine twined linen , and blue , and purple , and scarlet , the work of the embroiderer ; as jehovah commanded moses .

and the golden altar , and the anointing oil , and the sweet incense , and the screen for the door of the tent ;
the brazen altar , and its grating of brass , its staves , and all its vessels , the laver and its base ;
according to all that jehovah commanded moses , so the children of israel did all the work .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
on the first day of the first month shalt thou rear up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting .
and thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony , and thou shalt screen the ark with the veil .
and thou shalt set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony , and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle .
and thou shalt set the altar of burnt-offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting .
and thou shalt set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar , and shalt put water therein .
and thou shalt set up the court round about , and hang up the screen of the gate of the court .
and thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt-offering , and all its vessels , and sanctify the altar : and the altar shall be most holy .
and thou shalt anoint the laver and its base , and sanctify it .
and thou shalt bring aaron and his sons unto the door of the tent of meeting , and shalt wash them with water .
and thou shalt bring his sons , and put coats upon them ;
thus did moses : according to all that jehovah commanded him , so did he .
and it came to pass in the first month in the second year , on the first day of the month , that the tabernacle was reared up .
and he spread the tent over the tabernacle , and put the covering of the tent above upon it ; as jehovah commanded moses .
and he took and put the testimony into the ark , and set the staves on the ark , and put the mercy-seat above upon the ark :
and he put the table in the tent of meeting , upon the side of the tabernacle northward , without the veil .
and he set the bread in order upon it before jehovah ; as jehovah commanded moses .
and he put the candlestick in the tent of meeting , over against the table , on the side of the tabernacle southward .
and he lighted the lamps before jehovah ; as jehovah commanded moses .
and he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil :
and he burnt thereon incense of sweet spices ; as jehovah commanded moses .
and he put the screen of the door to the tabernacle .
and he set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar , and put water therein , wherewith to wash .
and moses and aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat ;
when they went into the tent of meeting , and when they came near unto the altar , they washed ; as jehovah commanded moses .
then the cloud covered the tent of meeting , and the glory of jehovah filled the tabernacle .
and moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting , because the cloud abode thereon , and the glory of jehovah filled the tabernacle .
and when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle , the children of israel went onward , throughout all their journeys :
but if the cloud was not taken up , then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up .
in the fifth day of the month , which was the fifth year of king jehoiachin ’ s captivity ,
and out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures . and this was their appearance : they had the likeness of a man ;
and every one had four faces , and every one of them had four wings .
and they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides ; and they four had their faces and their wings thus :
their wings were joined one to another ; they turned not when they went ; they went every one straight forward .
and their faces and their wings were separate above ; two wings of every one were joined one to another , and two covered their bodies .
and they went every one straight forward : whither the spirit was to go , they went ; they turned not when they went .
and the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning .
now as i beheld the living creatures , behold , one wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures , for each of the four faces thereof .
when they went , they went in their four directions : they turned not when they went .
as for their rims , they were high and dreadful ; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about .
and there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads : when they stood , they let down their wings .
and he said unto me , son of man , stand upon thy feet , and i will speak with thee .
and the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me , and set me upon my feet ; and i heard him that spake unto me .
and the children are impudent and stiffhearted : i do send thee unto them ; and thou shalt say unto them , thus saith the lord jehovah .
and thou shalt speak my words unto them , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear ; for they are most rebellious .
and when i looked , behold , a hand was put forth unto me ; and , lo , a roll of a book was therein ;
and he spread it before me : and it was written within and without ; and there were written therein lamentations , and mourning , and woe .
and he said unto me , son of man , eat that which thou findest ; eat this roll , and go , speak unto the house of israel .
so i opened my mouth , and he caused me to eat the roll .
and he said unto me , son of man , go , get thee unto the house of israel , and speak with my words unto them .
for thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language , but to the house of israel ;
behold , i have made thy face hard against their faces , and thy forehead hard against their foreheads .
as an adamant harder than flint have i made thy forehead : fear them not , neither be dismayed at their looks , though they are a rebellious house .
moreover he said unto me , son of man , all my words that i shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart , and hear with thine ears .
and it came to pass at the end of seven days , that the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
thou also , son of man , take thee a tile , and lay it before thee , and portray upon it a city , even jerusalem :
and thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of jerusalem , with thine arm uncovered ; and thou shalt prophesy against it .
and thy food which thou shalt eat shall be by weight , twenty shekels a day : from time to time shalt thou eat it .
and thou shalt drink water by measure , the sixth part of a hin : from time to time shalt thou drink .
and thou shalt eat it as barley cakes , and thou shalt bake it in their sight with dung that cometh out of man .
and jehovah said , even thus shall the children of israel eat their bread unclean , among the nations whither i will drive them .
then he said unto me , see , i have given thee cow ’ s dung for man ’ s dung , and thou shalt prepare thy bread thereon .
that they may want bread and water , and be dismayed one with another , and pine away in their iniquity .
and thou shalt take thereof a few in number , and bind them in thy skirts .
thus saith the lord jehovah : this is jerusalem ; i have set her in the midst of the nations , and countries are round about her .
and i will do in thee that which i have not done , and whereunto i will not do any more the like , because of all thine abominations .
moreover i will make thee a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee , in the sight of all that pass by .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , set thy face toward the mountains of israel , and prophesy unto them ,
and your altars shall become desolate , and your sun-images shall be broken ; and i will cast down your slain men before your idols .
and i will lay the dead bodies of the children of israel before their idols ; and i will scatter your bones round about your altars .
and the slain shall fall in the midst of you , and ye shall know that i am jehovah .
yet will i leave a remnant , in that ye shall have some that escape the sword among the nations , when ye shall be scattered through the countries .
and they shall know that i am jehovah : i have not said in vain that i would do this evil unto them .
moreover the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
thus saith the lord jehovah : an evil , an only evil ; behold , it cometh .
an end is come , the end is come ; it awaketh against thee ; behold , it cometh .
behold , the day , behold , it cometh : thy doom is gone forth ; the rod hath blossomed , pride hath budded .
the time is come , the day draweth near : let not the buyer rejoice , nor the seller mourn ; for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof .
they have blown the trumpet , and have made all ready ; but none goeth to the battle ; for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof .
all hands shall be feeble , and all knees shall be weak as water .
they shall also gird themselves with sackcloth , and horror shall cover them ; and shame shall be upon all faces , and baldness upon all their heads .
my face will i turn also from them , and they shall profane my secret place ; and robbers shall enter into it , and profane it .
make the chain ; for the land is full of bloody crimes , and the city is full of violence .
destruction cometh ; and they shall seek peace , and there shall be none .
and , behold , the glory of the god of israel was there , according to the appearance that i saw in the plain .
and he brought me to the door of the court ; and when i looked , behold , a hole in the wall .
then said he unto me , son of man , dig now in the wall : and when i had digged in the wall , behold , a door .
and he said unto me , go in , and see the wicked abominations that they do here .
he said also unto me , thou shalt again see yet other great abominations which they do .
then said he unto me , hast thou seen this , o son of man ? thou shalt again see yet greater abominations than these .
and as for me also , mine eye shall not spare , neither will i have pity , but i will bring their way upon their head .
now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house , when the man went in ; and the cloud filled the inner court .
and the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court , as the voice of god almighty when he speaketh .
and there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man ’ s hand under their wings .
and as for their appearance , they four had one likeness , as if a wheel had been within a wheel .
as for the wheels , they were called in my hearing the whirling wheels .
and the cherubim mounted up : this is the living creature that i saw by the river chebar .
when they stood , these stood ; and when they mounted up , these mounted up with them : for the spirit of the living creature was in them .
and the glory of jehovah went forth from over the threshold of the house , and stood over the cherubim .
this is the living creature that i saw under the god of israel by the river chebar ; and i knew that they were cherubim .
every one had four faces , and every one four wings ; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings .
and he said unto me , son of man , these are the men that devise iniquity , and that give wicked counsel in this city ;
that say , the time is not near to build houses : this city is the caldron , and we are the flesh .
therefore prophesy against them , prophesy , o son of man .
ye have multiplied your slain in this city , and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain .
ye have feared the sword ; and i will bring the sword upon you , saith the lord jehovah .
and i will bring you forth out of the midst thereof , and deliver you into the hands of strangers , and will execute judgments among you .
ye shall fall by the sword ; i will judge you in the border of israel ; and ye shall know that i am jehovah .
this city shall not be your caldron , neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof ; i will judge you in the border of israel ;
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
and they shall come thither , and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence .
then did the cherubim lift up their wings , and the wheels were beside them ; and the glory of the god of israel was over them above .
and the glory of jehovah went up from the midst of the city , and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city .
then i spake unto them of the captivity all the things that jehovah had showed me .
the word of jehovah also came unto me , saying ,
dig thou through the wall in their sight , and carry out thereby .
and in the morning came the word of jehovah unto me , saying ,
son of man , hath not the house of israel , the rebellious house , said unto thee , what doest thou ?
say thou unto them , thus saith the lord jehovah : this burden concerneth the prince in jerusalem , and all the house of israel among whom they are .
say , i am your sign : like as i have done , so shall it be done unto them ; they shall go into exile , into captivity .
and they shall know that i am jehovah , when i shall disperse them among the nations , and scatter them through the countries .
moreover the word of jehovah came to me , saying ,
son of man , eat thy bread with quaking , and drink thy water with trembling and with fearfulness ;
and the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste , and the land shall be a desolation ; and ye shall know that i am jehovah .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , what is this proverb that ye have in the land of israel , saying , the days are prolonged , and every vision faileth ?
for there shall be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of israel .
again the word of jehovah came to me , saying ,
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
thus saith the lord jehovah , woe unto the foolish prophets , that follow their own spirit , and have seen nothing !
o israel , thy prophets have been like foxes in the waste places .
lo , when the wall is fallen , shall it not be said unto you , where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it ?
then came certain of the elders of israel unto me , and sat before me .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
that i may take the house of israel in their own heart , because they are all estranged from me through their idols .
and they shall bear their iniquity : the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him that seeketh unto him ;
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
or if i send a pestilence into that land , and pour out my wrath upon it in blood , to cut off from it man and beast ;
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , what is the vine-tree more than any tree , the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest ?
shall wood be taken thereof to make any work ? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon ?
and i will make the land desolate , because they have committed a trespass , saith the lord jehovah .
again the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , cause jerusalem to know her abominations ;
then washed i thee with water ; yea , i thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee , and i anointed thee with oil .
i clothed thee also with broidered work , and shod thee with sealskin , and i girded thee about with fine linen , and covered thee with silk .
and i decked thee with ornaments , and i put bracelets upon thy hands , and a chain on thy neck .
and i put a ring upon thy nose , and ear-rings in thine ears , and a beautiful crown upon thy head .
and thou tookest thy broidered garments , and coveredst them , and didst set mine oil and mine incense before them .
that thou hast slain my children , and delivered them up , in causing them to pass through the fire unto them ?
and it is come to pass after all thy wickedness ( woe , woe unto thee ! saith the lord jehovah ) ,
that thou hast built unto thee a vaulted place , and hast made thee a lofty place in every street .
thou hast also committed fornication with the egyptians , thy neighbors , great of flesh ; and hast multiplied thy whoredom , to provoke me to anger .
thou hast moreover multiplied thy whoredom unto the land of traffic , unto chaldea ; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith .
how weak is thy heart , saith the lord jehovah , seeing thou doest all these things , the work of an impudent harlot ;
a wife that committeth adultery ! that taketh strangers instead of her husband !
wherefore , o harlot , hear the word of jehovah :
and i will judge thee , as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged ; and i will bring upon thee the blood of wrath and jealousy .
they shall also bring up a company against thee , and they shall stone thee with stones , and thrust thee through with their swords .
behold , every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee , saying , as is the mother , so is her daughter .
and they were haughty , and committed abomination before me : therefore i took them away as i saw good .
that thou mayest bear thine own shame , and mayest be ashamed because of all that thou hast done , in that thou art a comfort unto them .
for thy sister sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride ,
thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations , saith jehovah .
for thus saith the lord jehovah : i will also deal with thee as thou hast done , who hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant .
nevertheless i will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth , and i will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant .
and i will establish my covenant with thee ; and thou shalt know that i am jehovah ;
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , put forth a riddle , and speak a parable unto the house of israel ;
he cropped off the topmost of the young twigs thereof , and carried it unto a land of traffic ; he set it in a city of merchants .
moreover the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
that the kingdom might be base , that it might not lift itself up , but that by keeping his covenant it might stand .
the word of jehovah came unto me again , saying ,
as i live , saith the lord jehovah , ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in israel .
but if a man be just , and do that which is lawful and right ,
hath walked in my statutes , and hath kept mine ordinances , to deal truly ; he is just , he shall surely live , saith the lord jehovah .
if he beget a son that is a robber , a shedder of blood , and that doeth any one of these things ,
and that doeth not any of those duties , but even hath eaten upon the mountains , and defiled his neighbor ’ s wife ,
none of his transgressions that he hath committed shall be remembered against him : in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live .
have i any pleasure in the death of the wicked ? saith the lord jehovah ; and not rather that he should return from his way , and live ?
when the righteous man turneth away from his righteousness , and committeth iniquity , and dieth therein ; in his iniquity that he hath done shall he die .
because he considereth , and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
for i have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth , saith the lord jehovah : wherefore turn yourselves , and live .
moreover , take thou up a lamentation for the princes of israel ,
and say , what was thy mother ? a lioness : she couched among lions , in the midst of the young lions she nourished her whelps .
and she brought up one of her whelps : he became a young lion , and he learned to catch the prey ; he devoured men .
the nations also heard of him ; he was taken in their pit ; and they brought him with hooks unto the land of egypt .
now when she saw that she had waited , and her hope was lost , then she took another of her whelps , and made him a young lion .
and he went up and down among the lions ; he became a young lion , and he learned to catch the prey ; he devoured men .
then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces ; and they spread their net over him ; he was taken in their pit .
thy mother was like a vine , in thy blood , planted by the waters : it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters .
and now it is planted in the wilderness , in a dry and thirsty land .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
wilt thou judge them , son of man , wilt thou judge them ? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers ;
so i caused them to go forth out of the land of egypt , and brought them into the wilderness .
and i gave them my statutes , and showed them mine ordinances , which if a man do , he shall live in them .
moreover also i gave them my sabbaths , to be a sign between me and them , that they might know that i am jehovah that sanctifieth them .
because they rejected mine ordinances , and walked not in my statutes , and profaned my sabbaths : for their heart went after their idols .
nevertheless mine eye spared them , and i destroyed them not , neither did i make a full end of them in the wilderness .
i am jehovah your god : walk in my statutes , and keep mine ordinances , and do them ;
and hallow my sabbaths ; and they shall be a sign between me and you , that ye may know that i am jehovah your god .
moreover i sware unto them in the wilderness , that i would scatter them among the nations , and disperse them through the countries ;
because they had not executed mine ordinances , but had rejected my statutes , and had profaned my sabbaths , and their eyes were after their fathers ’ idols .
moreover also i gave them statutes that were not good , and ordinances wherein they should not live ;
then i said unto them , what meaneth the high place whereunto ye go ? so the name thereof is called bamah unto this day .
and i will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples , and there will i enter into judgment with you face to face .
and i will cause you to pass under the rod , and i will bring you into the bond of the covenant ;
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
and all flesh shall see that i , jehovah , have kindled it ; it shall not be quenched .
then said i , ah lord jehovah ! they say of me , is he not a speaker of parables ?
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , set thy face toward jerusalem , and drop thy word toward the sanctuaries , and prophesy against the land of israel ;
and all flesh shall know that i , jehovah , have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath ; it shall not return any more .
sigh therefore , thou son of man ; with the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness shalt thou sigh before their eyes .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , prophesy , and say , thus saith jehovah : say , a sword , a sword , it is sharpened , and also furbished ;
for there is a trial ; and what if even the rod that contemneth shall be no more ? saith the lord jehovah .
gather thee together , go to the right , set thyself in array , go to the left , whithersoever thy face is set .
i will also smite my hands together , and i will cause my wrath to rest : i , jehovah , have spoken it .
the word of jehovah came unto me again , saying ,
thou shalt appoint a way for the sword to come to rabbah of the children of ammon , and to judah in jerusalem the fortified .
and thou , o deadly wounded wicked one , the prince of israel , whose day is come , in the time of the iniquity of the end ,
cause it to return into its sheath . in the place where thou wast created , in the land of thy birth , will i judge thee .
moreover the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
and thou , son of man , wilt thou judge , wilt thou judge the bloody city ? then cause her to know all her abominations .
those that are near , and those that are far from thee , shall mock thee , thou infamous one and full of tumult .
behold , the princes of israel , every one according to his power , have been in thee to shed blood .
thou hast despised my holy things , and hast profaned my sabbaths .
slanderous men have been in thee to shed blood ; and in thee they have eaten upon the mountains : in the midst of thee they have committed lewdness .
in thee have they uncovered their fathers ’ nakedness ; in thee have they humbled her that was unclean in her impurity .
and i will scatter thee among the nations , and disperse thee through the countries ; and i will consume thy filthiness out of thee .
and thou shalt be profaned in thyself , in the sight of the nations ; and thou shalt know that i am jehovah .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
therefore thus saith the lord jehovah : because ye are all become dross , therefore , behold , i will gather you into the midst of jerusalem .
yea , i will gather you , and blow upon you with the fire of my wrath , and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , say unto her , thou art a land that is not cleansed , nor rained upon in the day of indignation .
her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey , to shed blood , and to destroy souls , that they may get dishonest gain .
the people of the land have used oppression , and exercised robbery ; yea , they have vexed the poor and needy , and have oppressed the sojourner wrongfully .
the word of jehovah came again unto me , saying ,
son of man , there were two women , the daughters of one mother :
and oholah played the harlot when she was mine ; and she doted on her lovers , on the assyrians her neighbors ,
who were clothed with blue , governors and rulers , all of them desirable young men , horsemen riding upon horses .
wherefore i delivered her into the hand of her lovers , into the hand of the assyrians , upon whom she doted .
she doted upon the assyrians , governors and rulers , her neighbors , clothed most gorgeously , horsemen riding upon horses , all of them desirable young men .
and i saw that she was defiled ; they both took one way .
and she increased her whoredoms ; for she saw men portrayed upon the wall , the images of the chaldeans portrayed with vermilion ,
and as soon as she saw them she doted upon them , and sent messengers unto them into chaldea .
so she uncovered her whoredoms , and uncovered her nakedness : then my soul was alienated from her , like as my soul was alienated from her sister .
yet she multiplied her whoredoms , remembering the days of her youth , wherein she had played the harlot in the land of egypt .
and she doted upon their paramours , whose flesh is as the flesh of asses , and whose issue is like the issue of horses .
thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth , in the handling of thy bosom by the egyptians for the breasts of thy youth .
they shall also strip thee of thy clothes , and take away thy fair jewels .
these things shall be done unto thee , for that thou hast played the harlot after the nations , and because thou art polluted with their idols .
thou hast walked in the way of thy sister ; therefore will i give her cup into thy hand .
thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow , with the cup of astonishment and desolation , with the cup of thy sister samaria .
therefore thus saith the lord jehovah : because thou hast forgotten me , and cast me behind thy back , therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms .
jehovah said moreover unto me : son of man , wilt thou judge oholah and oholibah ? then declare unto them their abominations .
moreover this they have done unto me : they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day , and have profaned my sabbaths .
and sit upon a stately bed , with a table prepared before it , whereupon thou didst set mine incense and mine oil .
then said i of her that was old in adulteries , now will they play the harlot with her , and she with them .
and they went in unto her , as they go in unto a harlot : so went they in unto oholah and unto oholibah , the lewd women .
for thus saith the lord jehovah : i will bring up a company against them , and will give them to be tossed to and fro and robbed .
thus will i cause lewdness to cease out of the land , that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness .
and they shall recompense your lewdness upon you , and ye shall bear the sins of your idols ; and ye shall know that i am the lord jehovah .
again , in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , write thee the name of the day , even of this selfsame day : the king of babylon drew close unto jerusalem this selfsame day .
gather the pieces thereof into it , even every good piece , the thigh , and the shoulder ; fill it with the choice bones .
that it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance , i have set her blood upon the bare rock , that it should not be covered .
therefore thus saith the lord jehovah : woe to the bloody city ! i also will make the pile great .
heap on the wood , make the fire hot , boil well the flesh , and make thick the broth , and let the bones be burned .
she hath wearied herself with toil ; yet her great rust goeth not forth out of her ; her rust goeth not forth by fire .
also the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
so i spake unto the people in the morning ; and at even my wife died ; and i did in the morning as i was commanded .
and the people said unto me , wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us , that thou doest so ?
then i said unto them , the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
and ye shall do as i have done : ye shall not cover your lips , nor eat the bread of men .
that in that day he that escapeth shall come unto thee , to cause thee to hear it with thine ears ?
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , set thy face toward the children of ammon , and prophesy against them :
and i will make rabbah a stable for camels , and the children of ammon a couching-place for flocks : and ye shall know that i am jehovah .
thus saith the lord jehovah : because that moab and seir do say , behold , the house of judah is like unto all the nations ;
and i will execute judgments upon moab ; and they shall know that i am jehovah .
thus saith the lord jehovah : because the philistines have dealt by revenge , and have taken vengeance with despite of soul to destroy with perpetual enmity ;
and i will execute great vengeance upon them with wrathful rebukes ; and they shall know that i am jehovah , when i shall lay my vengeance upon them .
and it came to pass in the eleventh year , in the first day of the month , that the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
and her daughters that are in the field shall be slain with the sword : and they shall know that i am jehovah .
and he shall set his battering engines against thy walls , and with his axes he shall break down thy towers .
and i will cause the noise of thy songs to cease ; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard .
now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall ; yea , the isles that are in the sea shall be dismayed at thy departure .
the word of jehovah came again unto me , saying ,
and thou , son of man , take up a lamentation over tyre ;
thy borders are in the heart of the seas ; thy builders have perfected thy beauty .
they have made all thy planks of fir-trees from senir ; they have taken a cedar from lebanon to make a mast for thee .
of the oaks of bashan have they made thine oars ; they have made thy benches of ivory inlaid in boxwood , from the isles of kittim .
the inhabitants of sidon and arvad were thy rowers : thy wise men , o tyre , were in thee , they were thy pilots .
persia and lud and put were in thine army , thy men of war : they hanged the shield and helmet in thee ; they set forth thy comeliness .
javan , tubal , and meshech , they were thy traffickers ; they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass for thy merchandise .
they of the house of togarmah traded for thy wares with horses and war-horses and mules .
the men of dedan were thy traffickers ; many isles were the mart of thy hand : they brought thee in exchange horns of ivory and ebony .
vedan and javan traded with yarn for thy wares : bright iron , cassia , and calamus , were among thy merchandise .
dedan was thy trafficker in precious cloths for riding .
haran and canneh and eden , the traffickers of sheba , asshur and chilmad , were thy traffickers .
the ships of tarshish were thy caravans for thy merchandise : and thou wast replenished , and made very glorious in the heart of the seas .
thy rowers have brought thee into great waters : the east wind hath broken thee in the heart of the seas .
at the sound of the cry of thy pilots the suburbs shall shake .
and they shall make themselves bald for thee , and gird them with sackcloth , and they shall weep for thee in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning .
all the inhabitants of the isles are astonished at thee , and their kings are horribly afraid ; they are troubled in their countenance .
the merchants among the peoples hiss at thee ; thou art become a terror , and thou shalt nevermore have any being .
the word of jehovah came again unto me , saying ,
behold , thou art wiser than daniel ; there is no secret that is hidden from thee ;
by thy wisdom and by thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches , and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures ;
by thy great wisdom and by thy traffic hast thou increased thy riches , and thy heart is lifted up because of thy riches ; —
therefore thus saith the lord jehovah : because thou hast set thy heart as the heart of god ,
they shall bring thee down to the pit ; and thou shalt die the death of them that are slain , in the heart of the seas .
thou shalt die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers : for i have spoken it , saith the lord jehovah .
moreover the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created , till unrighteousness was found in thee .
all they that know thee among the peoples shall be astonished at thee : thou art become a terror , and thou shalt nevermore have any being .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , set thy face toward sidon , and prophesy against it ,
in the tenth year , in the tenth month , in the twelfth day of the month , the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , set thy face against pharaoh king of egypt , and prophesy against him , and against all egypt ;
and all the inhabitants of egypt shall know that i am jehovah , because they have been a staff of reed to the house of israel .
therefore thus saith the lord jehovah : behold , i will bring a sword upon thee , and will cut off from thee man and beast .
no foot of man shall pass through it , nor foot of beast shall pass through it , neither shall it be inhabited forty years .
for thus saith the lord jehovah : at the end of forty years will i gather the egyptians from the peoples whither they were scattered ;
i have given him the land of egypt as his recompense for which he served , because they wrought for me , saith the lord jehovah .
the word of jehovah came again unto me , saying ,
son of man , prophesy , and say , thus saith the lord jehovah : wail ye , alas for the day !
for the day is near , even the day of jehovah is near ; it shall be a day of clouds , a time of the nations .
and they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate ; and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted .
and they shall know that i am jehovah , when i have set a fire in egypt , and all her helpers are destroyed .
thus saith the lord jehovah : i will also make the multitude of egypt to cease , by the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon .
and i will make pathros desolate , and will set a fire in zoan , and will execute judgments upon no .
and i will pour my wrath upon sin , the stronghold of egypt ; and i will cut off the multitude of no .
the young men of aven and of pi-beseth shall fall by the sword ; and these cities shall go into captivity .
thus will i execute judgments upon egypt ; and they shall know that i am jehovah .
and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations , and will disperse them through the countries .
and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations , and disperse them through the countries ; and they shall know that i am jehovah .
son of man , say unto pharaoh king of egypt , and to his multitude : whom art thou like in thy greatness ?
thus was it fair in its greatness , in the length of its branches ; for its root was by many waters .
i made it fair by the multitude of its branches , so that all the trees of eden , that were in the garden of god , envied it .
upon his ruin all the birds of the heavens shall dwell , and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches ;
and i will lay thy flesh upon the mountains , and fill the valleys with thy height .
i will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest , even to the mountains ; and the watercourses shall be full of thee .
all the bright lights of heaven will i make dark over thee , and set darkness upon thy land , saith the lord jehovah .
i will also vex the hearts of many peoples , when i shall bring thy destruction among the nations , into the countries which thou hast not known .
for thus saith the lord jehovah : the sword of the king of babylon shall come upon thee .
then will i make their waters clear , and cause their rivers to run like oil , saith the lord jehovah .
it came to pass also in the twelfth year , in the fifteenth day of the month , that the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
whom dost thou pass in beauty ? go down , and be thou laid with the uncircumcised .
they shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword : she is delivered to the sword ; draw her away and all her multitudes .
asshur is there and all her company ; her graves are round about her ; all of them slain , fallen by the sword ;
but thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised , and shalt lie with them that are slain by the sword .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
if , when he seeth the sword come upon the land , he blow the trumpet , and warn the people ;
again , when i say unto the wicked , thou shalt surely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is lawful and right ;
none of his sins that he hath committed shall be remembered against him : he hath done that which is lawful and right ; he shall surely live .
yet the children of thy people say , the way of the lord is not equal : but as for them , their way is not equal .
when the righteous turneth from his righteousness , and committeth iniquity , he shall even die therein .
and when the wicked turneth from his wickedness , and doeth that which is lawful and right , he shall live thereby .
yet ye say , the way of the lord is not equal . o house of israel , i will judge you every one after his ways .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
ye stand upon your sword , ye work abomination , and ye defile every one his neighbor ’ s wife : and shall ye possess the land ?
and when this cometh to pass ( behold , it cometh ) , then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
ye eat the fat , and ye clothe you with the wool , ye kill the fatlings ; but ye feed not the sheep .
and they were scattered , because there was no shepherd ; and they became food to all the beasts of the field , and were scattered .
therefore , ye shepherds , hear the word of jehovah :
therefore , ye shepherds , hear the word of jehovah :
for thus saith the lord jehovah : behold , i myself , even i , will search for my sheep , and will seek them out .
i myself will be the shepherd of my sheep , and i will cause them to lie down , saith the lord jehovah .
and as for you , o my flock , thus saith the lord jehovah : behold , i judge between sheep and sheep , the rams and the he-goats .
and as for my sheep , they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet , and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet .
therefore thus saith the lord jehovah unto them : behold , i , even i , will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep .
because ye thrust with side and with shoulder , and push all the diseased with your horns , till ye have scattered them abroad ;
therefore will i save my flock , and they shall no more be a prey ; and i will judge between sheep and sheep .
and i , jehovah , will be their god , and my servant david prince among them ; i , jehovah , have spoken it .
and ye my sheep , the sheep of my pasture , are men , and i am your god , saith the lord jehovah .
moreover the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , set thy face against mount seir , and prophesy against it ,
i will lay thy cities waste , and thou shalt be desolate ; and thou shalt know that i am jehovah .
thus will i make mount seir an astonishment and a desolation ; and i will cut off from it him that passeth through and him that returneth .
i will make thee a perpetual desolation , and thy cities shall not be inhabited ; and ye shall know that i am jehovah .
because thou hast said , these two nations and these two countries shall be mine , and we will possess it ; whereas jehovah was there :
and ye have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth , and have multiplied your words against me : i have heard it .
thus saith the lord jehovah : when the whole earth rejoiceth , i will make thee desolate .
and thou , son of man , prophesy unto the mountains of israel , and say , ye mountains of israel , hear the word of jehovah .
thus saith the lord jehovah : because the enemy hath said against you , aha ! and , the ancient high places are ours in possession ;
therefore thus saith the lord jehovah : i have sworn , saying , surely the nations that are round about you , they shall bear their shame .
for , behold , i am for you , and i will turn unto you , and ye shall be tilled and sown ;
thus saith the lord jehovah : because they say unto you , thou land art a devourer of men , and hast been a bereaver of thy nation ;
therefore thou shalt devour men no more , neither bereave thy nation any more , saith the lord jehovah ;
moreover the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
wherefore i poured out my wrath upon them for the blood which they had poured out upon the land , and because they had defiled it with their idols ;
and i scattered them among the nations , and they were dispersed through the countries : according to their way and according to their doings i judged them .
but i had regard for my holy name , which the house of israel had profaned among the nations , whither they went .
for i will take you from among the nations , and gather you out of all the countries , and will bring you into your own land .
and i will put my spirit within you , and cause you to walk in my statutes , and ye shall keep mine ordinances , and do them .
and ye shall dwell in the land that i gave to your fathers ; and ye shall be my people , and i will be your god .
and i will save you from all your uncleannesses : and i will call for the grain , and will multiply it , and lay no famine upon you .
and the land that was desolate shall be tilled , whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all that passed by .
and he said unto me , son of man , can these bones live ? and i answered , o lord jehovah , thou knowest .
again he said unto me , prophesy over these bones , and say unto them , o ye dry bones , hear the word of jehovah .
thus saith the lord jehovah unto these bones : behold , i will cause breath to enter into you , and ye shall live .
the word of jehovah came again unto me , saying ,
and join them for thee one to another into one stick , that they may become one in thy hand .
and when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee , saying , wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these ?
and the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes .
my tabernacle also shall be with them ; and i will be their god , and they shall be my people .
and the nations shall know that i am jehovah that sanctifieth israel , when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
and say , thus saith the lord jehovah : behold , i am against thee , o gog , prince of rosh , meshech , and tubal :
persia , cush , and put with them , all of them with shield and helmet ;
gomer , and all his hordes ; the house of togarmah in the uttermost parts of the north , and all his hordes ; even many peoples with thee .
be thou prepared , yea , prepare thyself , thou , and all thy companies that are assembled unto thee , and be thou a guard unto them .
and i will call for a sword against him unto all my mountains , saith the lord jehovah : every man ’ s sword shall be against his brother .
and i will smite thy bow out of thy left hand , and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand .
thou shalt fall upon the open field ; for i have spoken it , saith the lord jehovah .
and i will send a fire on magog , and on them that dwell securely in the isles ; and they shall know that i am jehovah .
behold , it cometh , and it shall be done , saith the lord jehovah ; this is the day whereof i have spoken .
and seven months shall the house of israel be burying them , that they may cleanse the land .
and hamonah shall also be the name of a city . thus shall they cleanse the land .
and ye shall eat fat till ye be full , and drink blood till ye be drunken , of my sacrifice which i have sacrificed for you .
and ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots , with mighty men , and with all men of war , saith the lord jehovah .
so the house of israel shall know that i am jehovah their god , from that day and forward .
according to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions did i unto them ; and i hid my face from them .
neither will i hide my face any more from them ; for i have poured out my spirit upon the house of israel , saith the lord jehovah .
he measured also the porch of the gate toward the house , one reed .
and he measured the breadth of the opening of the gate , ten cubits ; and the length of the gate , thirteen cubits ;
he made also posts , threescore cubits ; and the court reached unto the posts , round about the gate .
and from the forefront of the gate at the entrance unto the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits .
and the pavement was by the side of the gates , answerable unto the length of the gates , even the lower pavement .
and the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north , he measured the length thereof and the breadth thereof .
and there was a gate to the inner court toward the south : and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits .
then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate : and he measured the south gate according to these measures ;
and there were arches round about , five and twenty cubits long , and five cubits broad .
and the arches thereof were toward the outer court ; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof : and the ascent to it had eight steps .
and he brought me into the inner court toward the east : and he measured the gate according to these measures ;
and he brought me to the north gate : and he measured it according to these measures ;
and a chamber with the door thereof was by the posts at the gates ; there they washed the burnt-offering .
four tables were on this side , and four tables on that side , by the side of the gate ; eight tables , whereupon they slew the sacrifices .
and the hooks , a handbreadth long , were fastened within round about : and upon the tables was the flesh of the oblation .
and he said unto me , this chamber , whose prospect is toward the south , is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the house ;
and he measured the court , a hundred cubits long , and a hundred cubits broad , foursquare ; and the altar was before the house .
then he measured the wall of the house , six cubits ; and the breadth of every side-chamber , four cubits , round about the house on every side .
i saw also that the house had a raised basement round about : the foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed of six great cubits .
and between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side .
so he measured the house , a hundred cubits long ; and the separate place , and the building , with the walls thereof , a hundred cubits long ;
also the breadth of the face of the house , and of the separate place toward the east , a hundred cubits .
to the space above the door , even unto the inner house , and without , and by all the wall round about within and without , by measure .
and it was made with cherubim and palm-trees ; and a palm-tree was between cherub and cherub , and every cherub had two faces ;
from the ground unto above the door were cherubim and palm-trees made ; thus was the wall of the temple .
as for the temple , the door-posts were squared ; and as for the face of the sanctuary , the appearance thereof was as the appearance of the temple .
and the temple and the sanctuary had two doors .
and the doors had two leaves apiece , two turning leaves : two leaves for the one door , and two leaves for the other .
before the length of a hundred cubits was the north door , and the breadth was fifty cubits .
and before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits ’ breadth inward , a way of one cubit ; and their doors were toward the north .
now the upper chambers were shorter ; for the galleries took away from these , more than from the lower and the middlemost , in the building .
and the wall that was without by the side of the chambers , toward the outer court before the chambers , the length thereof was fifty cubits .
for the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits : and , lo , before the temple were a hundred cubits .
and from under these chambers was the entry on the east side , as one goeth into them from the outer court .
in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east , before the separate place , and before the building , there were chambers .
he measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds , with the measuring reed round about .
he measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about .
he measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed .
he turned about to the west side , and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed .
afterward he brought me to the gate , even the gate that looketh toward the east .
and the glory of jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east .
and the spirit took me up , and brought me into the inner court ; and , behold , the glory of jehovah filled the house .
and i heard one speaking unto me out of the house ; and a man stood by me .
and the upper altar shall be four cubits ; and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns .
and the altar hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve broad , square in the four sides thereof .
thou shalt also take the bullock of the sin-offering , and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house , without the sanctuary .
when thou hast made an end of cleansing it , thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish , and a ram out of the flock without blemish .
and thou shalt bring them near before jehovah , and the priests shall cast salt upon them , and they shall offer them up for a burnt-offering unto jehovah .
seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it ; so shall they consecrate it .
then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary , which looketh toward the east ; and it was shut .
and ye have not kept the charge of my holy things ; but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves .
but the levites that went far from me , when israel went astray , that went astray from me after their idols , they shall bear their iniquity .
yet will i make them keepers of the charge of the house , for all the service thereof , and for all that shall be done therein .
they shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister unto me , and they shall keep my charge .
they shall have linen tires upon their heads , and shall have linen breeches upon their loins ; they shall not gird themselves with anything that causeth sweat .
neither shall they shave their heads , nor suffer their locks to grow long ; they shall only cut off the hair of their heads .
neither shall any of the priests drink wine , when they enter into the inner court .
and they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common , and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean .
and after he is cleansed , they shall reckon unto him seven days .
and they shall have an inheritance : i am their inheritance ; and ye shall give them no possession in israel ; i am their possession .
they shall eat the meal-offering , and the sin-offering , and the trespass-offering ; and every devoted thing in israel shall be theirs .
the priests shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself , or is torn , whether it be bird or beast .
ye shall have just balances , and a just ephah , and a just bath .
and the shekel shall be twenty gerahs ; twenty shekels , five and twenty shekels , fifteen shekels , shall be your maneh .
all the people of the land shall give unto this oblation for the prince in israel .
and upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin-offering .
and he shall prepare a meal-offering , an ephah for a bullock , and an ephah for a ram , and a hin of oil to an ephah .
and the people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before jehovah on the sabbaths and on the new moons .
and the burnt-offering that the prince shall offer unto jehovah shall be on the sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish ;
and the prince , when they go in , shall go in in the midst of them ; and when they go forth , they shall go forth together .
and thou shalt prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering unto jehovah daily : morning by morning shalt thou prepare it .
thus shall they prepare the lamb , and the meal-offering , and the oil , morning by morning , for a continual burnt-offering .
in the four corners of the court there were courts inclosed , forty cubits long and thirty broad : these four in the corners were of one measure .
and there was a wall round about in them , round about the four , and boiling-places were made under the walls round about .
then said he unto me , these are the boiling-houses , where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people .
now when i had returned , behold , upon the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
but the miry places thereof , and the marshes thereof , shall not be healed ; they shall be given up to salt .
hamath , berothah , sibraim , which is between the border of damascus and the border of hamath ; hazer-hatticon , which is by the border of hauran .
and the west side shall be the great sea , from the south border as far as over against the entrance of hamath . this is the west side .
so shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of israel .
and it shall come to pass , that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth , there shall ye give him his inheritance , saith the lord jehovah .
and by the border of dan , from the east side unto the west side , asher , one portion .
and by the border of asher , from the east side even unto the west side , naphtali , one portion .
and by the border of naphtali , from the east side unto the west side , manasseh , one portion .
and by the border of manasseh , from the east side unto the west side , ephraim , one portion .
and by the border of ephraim , from the east side even unto the west side , reuben , one portion .
and by the border of reuben , from the east side unto the west side , judah , one portion .
the oblation that ye shall offer unto jehovah shall be five and twenty thousand reeds in length , and ten thousand in breadth .
and it shall be unto them an oblation from the oblation of the land , a thing most holy , by the border of the levites .
and they shall sell none of it , nor exchange it , nor shall the first-fruits of the land be alienated ; for it is holy unto jehovah .
and they that labor in the city , out of all the tribes of israel , shall till it .
all the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand : ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare , with the possession of the city .
and as for the rest of the tribes : from the east side unto the west side , benjamin , one portion .
and by the border of benjamin , from the east side unto the west side , simeon , one portion .
and by the border of simeon , from the east side unto the west side , issachar , one portion .
and by the border of issachar , from the east side unto the west side , zebulun , one portion .
and by the border of zebulun , from the east side unto the west side , gad , one portion .
this is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of israel for inheritance , and these are their several portions , saith the lord jehovah .
and these are the egresses of the city : on the north side four thousand and five hundred reeds by measure ;
it shall be eighteen thousand reeds round about : and the name of the city from that day shall be , jehovah is there .
even those did cyrus king of persia bring forth by the hand of mithredath the treasurer , and numbered them unto sheshbazzar , the prince of judah .
and this is the number of them : thirty platters of gold , a thousand platters of silver , nine and twenty knives ,
thirty bowls of gold , silver bowls of a second sort four hundred and ten , and other vessels a thousand .

all the nethinim , and the children of solomon ’ s servants , were three hundred ninety and two .
the children of delaiah , the children of tobiah , the children of nekoda , six hundred fifty and two .
these sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy , but they were not found : therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood .
and the governor said unto them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , till there stood up a priest with urim and with thummim .
the whole assembly together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore ,
besides their men-servants and their maid-servants , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven : and they had two hundred singing men and singing women .
their horses were seven hundred thirty and six ; their mules , two hundred forty and five ;
their camels , four hundred thirty and five ; their asses , six thousand seven hundred and twenty .
and when the seventh month was come , and the children of israel were in the cities , the people gathered themselves together as one man to jerusalem .
from the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt-offerings unto jehovah : but the foundation of the temple of jehovah was not yet laid .
now when the adversaries of judah and benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple unto jehovah , the god of israel ;
then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of judah , and troubled them in building ,
and hired counsellors against them , to frustrate their purpose , all the days of cyrus king of persia , even until the reign of darius king of persia .
and in the reign of ahasuerus , in the beginning of his reign , wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of judah and jerusalem .
rehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against jerusalem to artaxerxes the king in this sort :
this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto artaxerxes the king : thy servants the men beyond the river , and so forth .
we certify the king that , if this city be builded , and the walls finished , by this means thou shalt have no portion beyond the river .
the letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me .
make ye now a decree to cause these men to cease , and that this city be not builded , until a decree shall be made by me .
and take heed that ye be not slack herein : why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings ?
then ceased the work of the house of god which is at jerusalem ; and it ceased until the second year of the reign of darius king of persia .
then we told them after this manner , what the names of the men were that were making this building .
they sent a letter unto him , wherein was written thus : unto darius the king , all peace .
then asked we those elders , and said unto them thus , who gave you a decree to build this house , and to finish this wall ?
we asked them their names also , to certify thee , that we might write the names of the men that were at the head of them .
but in the first year of cyrus king of babylon , cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of god .
then darius the king made a decree , and search was made in the house of the archives , where the treasures were laid up in babylon .
and there was found at achmetha , in the palace that is in the province of media , a roll , and therein was thus written for a record :
with three courses of great stones , and a course of new timber : and let the expenses be given out of the king ’ s house .
now therefore , tattenai , governor beyond the river , shethar-bozenai , and your companions the apharsachites , who are beyond the river , be ye far from thence :
that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savor unto the god of heaven , and pray for the life of the king , and of his sons .
then tattenai , the governor beyond the river , shethar-bozenai , and their companions , because that darius the king had sent , did accordingly with all diligence .
and this house was finished on the third day of the month adar , which was in the sixth year of the reign of darius the king .
and the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month .
now after these things , in the reign of artaxerxes king of persia , ezra the son of seraiah , the son of azariah , the son of hilkiah ,
the son of shallum , the son of zadok , the son of ahitub ,
the son of amariah , the son of azariah , the son of meraioth ,
the son of zerahiah , the son of uzzi , the son of bukki ,
the son of abishua , the son of phinehas , the son of eleazar , the son of aaron the chief priest—
and he came to jerusalem in the fifth month , which was in the seventh year of the king .
for ezra had set his heart to seek the law of jehovah , and to do it , and to teach in israel statutes and ordinances .
artaxerxes , king of kings , unto ezra the priest , the scribe of the law of the god of heaven , perfect and so forth .
and to carry the silver and gold , which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the god of israel , whose habitation is in jerusalem ,
and the vessels that are given thee for the service of the house of thy god , deliver thou before the god of jerusalem .
of the sons of phinehas , gershom . of the sons of ithamar , daniel . of the sons of david , hattush .
of the sons of shecaniah , of the sons of parosh , zechariah ; and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males a hundred and fifty .
of the sons of pahath-moab , eliehoenai the son of zerahiah ; and with him two hundred males .
of the sons of shecaniah , the son of jahaziel ; and with him three hundred males .
and of the sons of adin , ebed the son of jonathan ; and with him fifty males .
and of the sons of elam , jeshaiah the son of athaliah ; and with him seventy males .

and of the sons of bigvai , uthai and zabbud ; and with them seventy males .
and hashabiah , and with him jeshaiah of the sons of merari , his brethren and their sons , twenty ;
so we fasted and besought our god for this : and he was entreated of us .
then i set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests , even sherebiah , hashabiah , and ten of their brethren with them ,
i weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver , and silver vessels a hundred talents ; of gold a hundred talents ;
and twenty bowls of gold , of a thousand darics ; and two vessels of fine bright brass , precious as gold .
and we came to jerusalem , and abode there three days .
the whole by number and by weight : and all the weight was written at that time .
and now , o our god , what shall we say after this ? for we have forsaken thy commandments ,
arise ; for the matter belongeth unto thee , and we are with thee : be of good courage , and do it .
and they made proclamation throughout judah and jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity , that they should gather themselves together unto jerusalem ;
and ezra the priest stood up , and said unto them , ye have trespassed , and have married foreign women , to increase the guilt of israel .
then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice , as thou hast said concerning us , so must we do .
only jonathan the son of asahel and jahzeiah the son of tikvah stood up against this matter : and meshullam and shabbethai the levite helped them .
and they made an end with all the men that had married foreign women by the first day of the first month .
and they gave their hand that they would put away their wives ; and being guilty , they offered a ram of the flock for their guilt .
and of the sons of immer : hanani and zebadiah .
and of the sons of harim : maaseiah , and elijah , and shemaiah , and jehiel , and uzziah .

and of israel : of the sons of parosh : ramiah , and izziah , and malchijah , and mijamin , and eleazar , and malchijah , and benaiah .
and of the sons of elam : mattaniah , zechariah , and jehiel , and abdi , and jeremoth , and elijah .

all these had taken foreign wives ; and some of them had wives by whom they had children .
and all the brethren that are with me , unto the churches of galatia :
grace to you and peace from god the father , and our lord jesus christ ,
who gave himself for our sins , that he might deliver us out of this present evil world , according to the will of our god and father :
to whom be the glory for ever and ever . amen .
i marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of christ unto a different gospel ;
which is not another gospel : only there are some that trouble you , and would pervert the gospel of christ .
but though we , or an angel from heaven , should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you , let him be anathema .
for i make known to you , brethren , as touching the gospel which was preached by me , that it is not after man .
for neither did i receive it from man , nor was i taught it , but it came to me through revelation of jesus christ .
and i advanced in the jews ’ religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen , being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers .
but when it was the good pleasure of god , who separated me , even from my mother ’ s womb , and called me through his grace ,
to reveal his son in me , that i might preach him among the gentiles ; straightway i conferred not with flesh and blood :
neither went i up to jerusalem to them that were apostles before me : but i went away into arabia ; and again i returned unto damascus .
then after three years i went up to jerusalem to visit cephas , and tarried with him fifteen days .
but other of the apostles saw i none , save james the lord ’ s brother .
now touching the things which i write unto you , behold , before god , i lie not .
then i came into the regions of syria and cilicia .
and i was still unknown by face unto the churches of judaea which were in christ :
but they only heard say , he that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havoc ;
and they glorified god in me .
then after the space of fourteen years i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas , taking titus also with me .
but not even titus who was with me , being a greek , was compelled to be circumcised :
to whom we gave place in the way of subjection , no , not for an hour ; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you .
but contrariwise , when they saw that i had been intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision , even as peter with the gospel of the circumcision
( for he that wrought for peter unto the apostleship of the circumcision wrought for me also unto the gentiles ) ;
only they would that we should remember the poor ; which very thing i was also zealous to do .
but when cephas came to antioch , i resisted him to the face , because he stood condemned .
and the rest of the jews dissembled likewise with him ; insomuch that even barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation .
we being jews by nature , and not sinners of the gentiles ,
but if , while we sought to be justified in christ , we ourselves also were found sinners , is christ a minister of sin ? god forbid .
for if i build up again those things which i destroyed , i prove myself a transgressor .
for i through the law died unto the law , that i might live unto god .
i do not make void the grace of god : for if righteousness is through the law , then christ died for nought .
o foolish galatians , who did bewitch you , before whose eyes jesus christ was openly set forth crucified ?
this only would i learn from you , received ye the spirit by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
are ye so foolish ? having begun in the spirit , are ye now perfected in the flesh ?
did ye suffer so many things in vain ? if it be indeed in vain .
even as abraham believed god , and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness .
know therefore that they that are of faith , the same are sons of abraham .
so then they that are of faith are blessed with the faithful abraham .
now that no man is justified by the law before god , is evident : for , the righteous shall live by faith ;
and the law is not of faith ; but , he that doeth them shall live in them .
that upon the gentiles might come the blessing of abraham in christ jesus ; that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith .
for if the inheritance is of the law , it is no more of promise : but god hath granted it to abraham by promise .
now a mediator is not a mediator of one ; but god is one .
but the scripture shut up all things under sin , that the promise by faith in jesus christ might be given to them that believe .
but before faith came , we were kept in ward under the law , shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed .
so that the law is become our tutor to bring us unto christ , that we might be justified by faith .
but now that faith is come , we are no longer under a tutor .
for ye are all sons of god , through faith , in christ jesus .
for as many of you as were baptized into christ did put on christ .
and if ye are christ ’ s , then are ye abraham ’ s seed , heirs according to promise .
but i say that so long as the heir is a child , he differeth nothing from a bondservant though he is lord of all ;
but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed of the father .
so we also , when we were children , were held in bondage under the rudiments of the world :
but when the fulness of the time came , god sent forth his son , born of a woman , born under the law ,
that he might redeem them that were under the law , that we might receive the adoption of sons .
and because ye are sons , god sent forth the spirit of his son into our hearts , crying , abba , father .
so that thou art no longer a bondservant , but a son ; and if a son , then an heir through god .
howbeit at that time , not knowing god , ye were in bondage to them that by nature are no gods :
ye observe days , and months , and seasons , and years .
i am afraid of you , lest by any means i have bestowed labor upon you in vain .
i beseech you , brethren , become as i am , for i also am become as ye are . ye did me no wrong :
but ye know that because of an infirmity of the flesh i preached the gospel unto you the first time :
so then am i become your enemy , by telling you the truth ?
they zealously seek you in no good way ; nay , they desire to shut you out , that ye may seek them .
but it is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times , and not only when i am present with you .
my little children , of whom i am again in travail until christ be formed in you—
but i could wish to be present with you now , and to change my tone ; for i am perplexed about you .
tell me , ye that desire to be under the law , do ye not hear the law ?
for it is written , that abraham had two sons , one by the handmaid , and one by the freewoman .
howbeit the son by the handmaid is born after the flesh ; but the son by the freewoman is born through promise .
which things contain an allegory : for these women are two covenants ; one from mount sinai , bearing children unto bondage , which is hagar .
now this hagar is mount sinai in arabia and answereth to the jerusalem that now is : for she is in bondage with her children .
but the jerusalem that is above is free , which is our mother .
for it is written ,
now we , brethren , as isaac was , are children of promise .
but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit , so also it is now .
howbeit what saith the scripture ? cast out the handmaid and her son : for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman .
wherefore , brethren , we are not children of a handmaid , but of the freewoman .
for freedom did christ set us free : stand fast therefore , and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage .
behold , i paul say unto you , that , if ye receive circumcision , christ will profit you nothing .
yea , i testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision , that he is a debtor to do the whole law .
ye are severed from christ , ye who would be justified by the law ; ye are fallen away from grace .
for we through the spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness .
for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth anything , nor uncircumcision ; but faith working through love .
ye were running well ; who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth ?
this persuasion came not of him that calleth you .
a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump .
but i , brethren , if i still preach circumcision , why am i still persecuted ? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away .
i would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision .
for the whole law is fulfilled in one word , even in this : thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself .
but if ye bite and devour one another , take heed that ye be not consumed one of another .
but i say , walk by the spirit , and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh .
but if ye are led by the spirit , ye are not under the law .
now the works of the flesh are manifest , which are these : fornication , uncleanness , lasciviousness ,
idolatry , sorcery , enmities , strife , jealousies , wraths , factions , divisions , parties ,
but the fruit of the spirit is love , joy , peace , longsuffering , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
meekness , self-control ; against such there is no law .
and they that are of christ jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof .
if we live by the spirit , by the spirit let us also walk .
let us not become vainglorious , provoking one another , envying one another .
bear ye one another ’ s burdens , and so fulfil the law of christ .
for if a man thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing , he deceiveth himself .
but let each man prove his own work , and then shall he have his glorying in regard of himself alone , and not of his neighbor .
for each man shall bear his own burden .
but let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things .
be not deceived ; god is not mocked : for whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap .
for he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption ; but he that soweth unto the spirit shall of the spirit reap eternal life .
and let us not be weary in well-doing : for in due season we shall reap , if we faint not .
see with how large letters i write unto you with mine own hand .
for not even they who receive circumcision do themselves keep the law ; but they desire to have you circumcised , that they may glory in your flesh .
for neither is circumcision anything , nor uncircumcision , but a new creature .
and as many as shall walk by this rule , peace be upon them , and mercy , and upon the israel of god .
henceforth let no man trouble me ; for i bear branded on my body the marks of jesus .
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit , brethren . amen .
in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth .
and god said , let there be light : and there was light .
and god saw the light , that it was good : and god divided the light from the darkness .
and god called the light day , and the darkness he called night . and there was evening and there was morning , one day .
and god said , let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters , and let it divide the waters from the waters .
and god made the firmament , and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament : and it was so .
and god called the firmament heaven . and there was evening and there was morning , a second day .
and god said , let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place , and let the dry land appear : and it was so .
and god called the dry land earth ; and the gathering together of the waters called he seas : and god saw that it was good .
and there was evening and there was morning , a third day .
and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth : and it was so .
and god set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth ,
and to rule over the day and over the night , and to divide the light from the darkness : and god saw that it was good .
and there was evening and there was morning , a fourth day .
and god said , let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures , and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven .
and god blessed them , saying , be fruitful , and multiply , and fill the waters in the seas , and let birds multiply on the earth .
and there was evening and there was morning , a fifth day .
and god created man in his own image , in the image of god created he him ; male and female created he them .
and the heavens and the earth were finished , and all the host of them .
and on the seventh day god finished his work which he had made ; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made .
and god blessed the seventh day , and hallowed it ; because that in it he rested from all his work which god had created and made .
these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that jehovah god made earth and heaven .
but there went up a mist from the earth , and watered the whole face of the ground .
and jehovah god formed man of the dust of the ground , and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living soul .
and jehovah god planted a garden eastward , in eden ; and there he put the man whom he had formed .
and a river went out of eden to water the garden ; and from thence it was parted , and became four heads .
the name of the first is pishon : that is it which compasseth the whole land of havilah , where there is gold ;
and the gold of that land is good : there is bdellium and the onyx stone .
and the name of the second river is gihon : the same is it that compasseth the whole land of cush .
and the name of the third river is hiddekel : that is it which goeth in front of assyria . and the fourth river is the euphrates .
and jehovah god took the man , and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it .
and jehovah god commanded the man , saying , of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat :
and jehovah god said , it is not good that the man should be alone ; i will make him a help meet for him .
and the rib , which jehovah god had taken from the man , made he a woman , and brought her unto the man .
therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh .
and they were both naked , the man and his wife , and were not ashamed .
and the woman said unto the serpent , of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat :
and the serpent said unto the woman , ye shall not surely die :
and the eyes of them both were opened , and they knew that they were naked ; and they sewed fig-leaves together , and made themselves aprons .
and jehovah god called unto the man , and said unto him , where art thou ?
and he said , i heard thy voice in the garden , and i was afraid , because i was naked ; and i hid myself .
and he said , who told thee that thou wast naked ? hast thou eaten of the tree , whereof i commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat ?
and the man said , the woman whom thou gavest to be with me , she gave me of the tree , and i did eat .
and jehovah god said unto the woman , what is this thou hast done ? and the woman said , the serpent beguiled me , and i did eat .
thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee ; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field ;
and the man called his wife ’ s name eve ; because she was the mother of all living .
and jehovah god made for adam and for his wife coats of skins , and clothed them .
therefore jehovah god sent him forth from the garden of eden , to till the ground from whence he was taken .
and the man knew eve his wife ; and she conceived , and bare cain , and said , i have gotten a man with the help of jehovah .
and again she bare his brother abel . and abel was a keeper of sheep , but cain was a tiller of the ground .
and in process of time it came to pass , that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto jehovah .
and abel , he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof . and jehovah had respect unto abel and to his offering :
but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect . and cain was very wroth , and his countenance fell .
and jehovah said unto cain , why art thou wroth ? and why is thy countenance fallen ?
and jehovah said unto cain , where is abel thy brother ? and he said , i know not : am i my brother ’ s keeper ?
and he said , what hast thou done ? the voice of thy brother ’ s blood crieth unto me from the ground .
and now cursed art thou from the ground , which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother ’ s blood from thy hand ;
when thou tillest the ground , it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength ; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth .
and cain said unto jehovah , my punishment is greater than i can bear .
and cain went out from the presence of jehovah , and dwelt in the land of nod , on the east of eden .
and unto enoch was born irad : and irad begat mehujael ; and mehujael begat methushael ; and methushael begat lamech .
and lamech took unto him two wives : the name of the one was adah , and the name of the other zillah .
and adah bare jabal : he was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle .
and his brother ’ s name was jubal : he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe .
and zillah , she also bare tubal-cain , the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron : and the sister of tubal-cain was naamah .
and lamech said unto his wives :
if cain shall be avenged sevenfold ,
this is the book of the generations of adam . in the day that god created man , in the likeness of god made he him ;
male and female created he them , and blessed them , and called their name adam , in the day when they were created .
and adam lived a hundred and thirty years , and begat a son in his own likeness , after his image ; and called his name seth :
and the days of adam after he begat seth were eight hundred years : and he begat sons and daughters .
and all the days that adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years : and he died .
and seth lived a hundred and five years , and begat enosh :
and seth lived after he begat enosh eight hundred and seven years , and begat sons and daughters :
and all the days of seth were nine hundred and twelve years : and he died .
and enosh lived ninety years , and begat kenan .
and enosh lived after he begat kenan eight hundred and fifteen years , and begat sons and daughters :
and all the days of enosh were nine hundred and five years : and he died .
and kenan lived seventy years , and begat mahalalel :
and kenan lived after he begat mahalalel eight hundred and forty years , and begat sons and daughters :
and all the days of kenan were nine hundred and ten years : and he died .
and mahalalel lived sixty and five years , and begat jared :
and mahalalel lived after he begat jared eight hundred and thirty years , and begat sons and daughters :
and all the days of mahalalel were eight hundred ninety and five years : and he died .
and jared lived a hundred sixty and two years , and begat enoch :
and jared lived after he begat enoch eight hundred years , and begat sons and daughters :
and all the days of jared were nine hundred sixty and two years : and he died .
and enoch lived sixty and five years , and begat methuselah :
and enoch walked with god after he begat methuselah three hundred years , and begat sons and daughters :
and all the days of enoch were three hundred sixty and five years :
and enoch walked with god : and he was not ; for god took him .
and methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years , and begat lamech :
and methuselah lived after he begat lamech seven hundred eighty and two years , and begat sons and daughters :
and all the days of methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years : and he died .
and lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years , and begat a son :
and lamech lived after he begat noah five hundred ninety and five years , and begat sons and daughters :
and all the days of lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years : and he died .
and noah was five hundred years old : and noah begat shem , ham , and japheth .
and it came to pass , when men began to multiply on the face of the ground , and daughters were born unto them ,
that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair ; and they took them wives of all that they chose .
and jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually .
and it repented jehovah that he had made man on the earth , and it grieved him at his heart .
but noah found favor in the eyes of jehovah .
these are the generations of noah . noah was a righteous man , and perfect in his generations : noah walked with god .
and noah begat three sons , shem , ham , and japheth .
and the earth was corrupt before god , and the earth was filled with violence .
and god saw the earth , and , behold , it was corrupt ; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth .
make thee an ark of gopher wood ; rooms shalt thou make in the ark , and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch .
thus did noah ; according to all that god commanded him , so did he .
and jehovah said unto noah , come thou and all thy house into the ark ; for thee have i seen righteous before me in this generation .
of the birds also of the heavens , seven and seven , male and female , to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth .
and noah did according unto all that jehovah commanded him .
and noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth .
of clean beasts , and of beasts that are not clean , and of birds , and of everything that creepeth upon the ground ,
there went in two and two unto noah into the ark , male and female , as god commanded noah .
and it came to pass after the seven days , that the waters of the flood were upon the earth .
and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights .
and they went in unto noah into the ark , two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life .
and they that went in , went in male and female of all flesh , as god commanded him : and jehovah shut him in .
and the flood was forty days upon the earth ; and the waters increased , and bare up the ark , and it was lifted up above the earth .
and the waters prevailed , and increased greatly upon the earth ; and the ark went upon the face of the waters .
and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth ; and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered .
fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail ; and the mountains were covered .
all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life , of all that was on the dry land , died .
and the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days .
the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped , and the rain from heaven was restrained ;
and the waters returned from off the earth continually : and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased .
and the ark rested in the seventh month , on the seventeenth day of the month , upon the mountains of ararat .
and it came to pass at the end of forty days , that noah opened the window of the ark which he had made :
and he sent forth a raven , and it went forth to and fro , until the waters were dried up from off the earth .
and he sent forth a dove from him , to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground ;
and he stayed yet other seven days ; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark ;
and he stayed yet other seven days , and sent forth the dove ; and she returned not again unto him any more .
and in the second month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , was the earth dry .
and god spake unto noah , saying ,
go forth from the ark , thou , and thy wife , and thy sons , and thy sons ’ wives with thee .
and noah went forth , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ’ wives with him :
every beast , every creeping thing , and every bird , whatsoever moveth upon the earth , after their families , went forth out of the ark .
and noah builded an altar unto jehovah , and took of every clean beast , and of every clean bird , and offered burnt-offerings on the altar .
while the earth remaineth , seedtime and harvest , and cold and heat , and summer and winter , and day and night shall not cease .
and god blessed noah and his sons , and said unto them , be fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the earth .
every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you ; as the green herb have i given you all .
but flesh with the life thereof , which is the blood thereof , shall ye not eat .
whoso sheddeth man ’ s blood , by man shall his blood be shed : for in the image of god made he man .
and you , be ye fruitful , and multiply ; bring forth abundantly in the earth , and multiply therein .
and god spake unto noah , and to his sons with him , saying ,
and i , behold , i establish my covenant with you , and with your seed after you ;
i do set my bow in the cloud , and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth .
and it shall come to pass , when i bring a cloud over the earth , that the bow shall be seen in the cloud ,
and god said unto noah , this is the token of the covenant which i have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth .
and the sons of noah , that went forth from the ark , were shem , and ham , and japheth : and ham is the father of canaan .
these three were the sons of noah : and of these was the whole earth overspread .
and noah began to be a husbandman , and planted a vineyard :
and he drank of the wine , and was drunken ; and he was uncovered within his tent .
and ham , the father of canaan , saw the nakedness of his father , and told his two brethren without .
and noah awoke from his wine , and knew what his youngest son had done unto him .
and noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years .
and all the days of noah were nine hundred and fifty years : and he died .
the sons of japheth : gomer , and magog , and madai , and javan , and tubal , and meshech , and tiras .
and the sons of gomer : ashkenaz , and riphath , and togarmah .
and the sons of javan : elishah , and tarshish , kittim , and dodanim .
of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands , every one after his tongue , after their families , in their nations .
and the sons of ham : cush , and mizraim , and put , and canaan .
and cush begat nimrod : he began to be a mighty one in the earth .
he was a mighty hunter before jehovah : wherefore it is said , like nimrod a mighty hunter before jehovah .
and the beginning of his kingdom was babel , and erech , and accad , and calneh , in the land of shinar .
out of that land he went forth into assyria , and builded nineveh , and rehoboth-ir , and calah ,
and resen between nineveh and calah ( the same is the great city ) .
and mizraim begat ludim , and anamim , and lehabim , and naphtuhim ,
and pathrusim , and casluhim ( whence went forth the philistines ) , and caphtorim .
and canaan begat sidon his first-born , and heth ,
and the jebusite , and the amorite , and the girgashite ,
and the hivite , and the arkite , and the sinite ,
and the arvadite , and the zemarite , and the hamathite : and afterward were the families of the canaanite spread abroad .
these are the sons of ham , after their families , after their tongues , in their lands , in their nations .
and unto shem , the father of all the children of eber , the elder brother of japheth , to him also were children born .
the sons of shem : elam , and asshur , and arpachshad , and lud , and aram .
and the sons of aram : uz , and hul , and gether , and mash .
and arpachshad begat shelah ; and shelah begat eber .
and joktan begat almodad , and sheleph , and hazarmaveth , and jerah ,
and hadoram , and uzal , and diklah ,
and obal , and abimael , and sheba ,
and ophir , and havilah , and jobab : all these were the sons of joktan .
and their dwelling was from mesha , as thou goest toward sephar , the mountain of the east .
these are the sons of shem , after their families , after their tongues , in their lands , after their nations .
and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech .
and it came to pass , as they journeyed east , that they found a plain in the land of shinar ; and they dwelt there .
and jehovah came down to see the city and the tower , which the children of men builded .
come , let us go down , and there confound their language , that they may not understand one another ’ s speech .
so jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth : and they left off building the city .
these are the generations of shem . shem was a hundred years old , and begat arpachshad two years after the flood :
and shem lived after he begat arpachshad five hundred years , and begat sons and daughters .
and arpachshad lived five and thirty years , and begat shelah :
and arpachshad lived after he begat shelah four hundred and three years , and begat sons and daughters .
and shelah lived thirty years , and begat eber :
and shelah lived after he begat eber four hundred and three years , and begat sons and daughters .
and eber lived four and thirty years , and begat peleg :
and eber lived after he begat peleg four hundred and thirty years , and begat sons and daughters .
and peleg lived thirty years , and begat reu :
and peleg lived after he begat reu two hundred and nine years , and begat sons and daughters .
and reu lived two and thirty years , and begat serug :
and reu lived after he begat serug two hundred and seven years , and begat sons and daughters .
and serug lived thirty years , and begat nahor :
and serug lived after he begat nahor two hundred years , and begat sons and daughters .
and nahor lived nine and twenty years , and begat terah :
and nahor lived after he begat terah a hundred and nineteen years , and begat sons and daughters .
and terah lived seventy years , and begat abram , nahor , and haran .
now these are the generations of terah . terah begat abram , nahor , and haran ; and haran begat lot .
and haran died before his father terah in the land of his nativity , in ur of the chaldees .
and sarai was barren ; she had no child .
and the days of terah were two hundred and five years : and terah died in haran .
and i will make of thee a great nation , and i will bless thee , and make thy name great ; and be thou a blessing :
and abram passed through the land unto the place of shechem , unto the oak of moreh . and the canaanite was then in the land .
and abram journeyed , going on still toward the south .
and there was a famine in the land : and abram went down into egypt to sojourn there ; for the famine was sore in the land .
and it came to pass , that , when abram was come into egypt , the egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair .
and the princes of pharaoh saw her , and praised her to pharaoh : and the woman was taken into pharaoh ’ s house .
and jehovah plagued pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of sarai , abram ’ s wife .
and pharaoh called abram , and said , what is this that thou hast done unto me ? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife ?
and pharaoh gave men charge concerning him : and they brought him on the way , and his wife , and all that he had .
and abram went up out of egypt , he , and his wife , and all that he had , and lot with him , into the south .
and abram was very rich in cattle , in silver , and in gold .
and he went on his journeys from the south even to beth-el , unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning , between beth-el and ai ,
unto the place of the altar , which he had made there at the first : and there abram called on the name of jehovah .
and lot also , who went with abram , had flocks , and herds , and tents .
and the land was not able to bear them , that they might dwell together : for their substance was great , so that they could not dwell together .
so lot chose him all the plain of the jordan ; and lot journeyed east : and they separated themselves the one from the other .
abram dwelt in the land of canaan , and lot dwelt in the cities of the plain , and moved his tent as far as sodom .
now the men of sodom were wicked and sinners against jehovah exceedingly .
for all the land which thou seest , to thee will i give it , and to thy seed for ever .
arise , walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it ; for unto thee will i give it .
and abram moved his tent , and came and dwelt by the oaks of mamre , which are in hebron , and built there an altar unto jehovah .
and it came to pass in the days of amraphel king of shinar , arioch king of ellasar , chedorlaomer king of elam , and tidal king of goiim ,
all these joined together in the vale of siddim ( the same is the salt sea ) .
twelve years they served chedorlaomer , and in the thirteenth year they rebelled .
and the horites in their mount seir , unto el-paran , which is by the wilderness .
against chedorlaomer king of elam , and tidal king of goiim , and amraphel king of shinar , and arioch king of ellasar ; four kings against the five .
and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah , and all their victuals , and went their way .
and they took lot , abram ’ s brother ’ s son , who dwelt in sodom , and his goods , and departed .
and he brought back all the goods , and also brought back his brother lot , and his goods , and the women also , and the people .
and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine : and he was priest of god most high .
and he blessed him , and said , blessed be abram of god most high , possessor of heaven and earth :
and blessed be god most high , who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand . and he gave him a tenth of all .
and the king of sodom said unto abram , give me the persons , and take the goods to thyself .
and abram said to the king of sodom , i have lifted up my hand unto jehovah , god most high , possessor of heaven and earth ,
that i will not take a thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine , lest thou shouldest say , i have made abram rich :
and abram said , behold , to me thou hast given no seed : and , lo , one born in my house is mine heir .
and he believed in jehovah ; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness .
and he said unto him , i am jehovah that brought thee out of ur of the chaldees , to give thee this land to inherit it .
and he said , o lord jehovah , whereby shall i know that i shall inherit it ?
and he took him all these , and divided them in the midst , and laid each half over against the other : but the birds divided he not .
and the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses , and abram drove them away .
and when the sun was going down , a deep sleep fell upon abram ; and , lo , a horror of great darkness fell upon him .
and also that nation , whom they shall serve , will i judge : and afterward shall they come out with great substance .
but thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace ; thou shalt be buried in a good old age .
and in the fourth generation they shall come hither again : for the iniquity of the amorite is not yet full .
the kenite , and the kenizzite , and the kadmonite ,
and the hittite , and the perizzite , and the rephaim ,
and the amorite , and the canaanite , and the girgashite , and the jebusite .
now sarai , abram ’ s wife , bare him no children : and she had a handmaid , an egyptian , whose name was hagar .
and he went in unto hagar , and she conceived : and when she saw that she had conceived , her mistress was despised in her eyes .
and the angel of jehovah found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain in the way to shur .
and the angel of jehovah said unto her , return to thy mistress , and submit thyself under her hands .
and the angel of jehovah said unto her , i will greatly multiply thy seed , that it shall not be numbered for multitude .
wherefore the well was called beer-lahai-roi ; behold , it is between kadesh and bered .
and hagar bare abram a son : and abram called the name of his son , whom hagar bare , ishmael .
and abram was fourscore and six years old , when hagar bare ishmael to abram .
and i will make my covenant between me and thee , and will multiply thee exceedingly .
and abram fell on his face : and god talked with him , saying ,
as for me , behold , my covenant is with thee , and thou shalt be the father of a multitude of nations .
neither shall thy name any more be called abram , but thy name shall be abraham ; for the father of a multitude of nations have i made thee .
and i will make thee exceeding fruitful , and i will make nations of thee , and kings shall come out of thee .
and god said unto abraham , and as for thee , thou shalt keep my covenant , thou , and thy seed after thee throughout their generations .
this is my covenant , which ye shall keep , between me and you and thy seed after thee : every male among you shall be circumcised .
and ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin ; and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt me and you .
and god said unto abraham , as for sarai thy wife , thou shalt not call her name sarai , but sarah shall her name be .
and abraham said unto god , oh that ishmael might live before thee !
but my covenant will i establish with isaac , whom sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year .
and he left off talking with him , and god went up from abraham .
and abraham was ninety years old and nine , when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin .
and ishmael his son was thirteen years old , when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin .
in the selfsame day was abraham circumcised , and ishmael his son .
and all the men of his house , those born in the house , and those bought with money of a foreigner , were circumcised with him .
and jehovah appeared unto him by the oaks of mamre , as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day ;
and said , my lord , if now i have found favor in thy sight , pass not away , i pray thee , from thy servant :
let now a little water be fetched , and wash your feet , and rest yourselves under the tree :
and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah , and said , make ready quickly three measures of fine meal , knead it , and make cakes .
and abraham ran unto the herd , and fetched a calf tender and good , and gave it unto the servant ; and he hasted to dress it .
and they said unto him , where is sarah thy wife ? and he said , behold , in the tent .
now abraham and sarah were old , and well stricken in age ; it had ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women .
and sarah laughed within herself , saying , after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure , my lord being old also ?
and jehovah said unto abraham , wherefore did sarah laugh , saying , shall i of a surety bear a child , who am old ?
is anything too hard for jehovah ? at the set time i will return unto thee , when the season cometh round , and sarah shall have a son .
then sarah denied , saying , i laughed not ; for she was afraid . and he said , nay ; but thou didst laugh .
and the men rose up from thence , and looked toward sodom : and abraham went with them to bring them on the way .
and jehovah said , shall i hide from abraham that which i do ;
seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation , and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him ?
and jehovah said , because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great , and because their sin is very grievous ;
and the men turned from thence , and went toward sodom : but abraham stood yet before jehovah .
and abraham drew near , and said , wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked ?
peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city : wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein ?
and jehovah said , if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city , then i will spare all the place for their sake .
and abraham answered and said , behold now , i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord , who am but dust and ashes :
and jehovah went his way , as soon as he had left off communing with abraham : and abraham returned unto his place .
and lot went out unto them to the door , and shut the door after him .
and he said , i pray you , my brethren , do not so wickedly .
but the men put forth their hand , and brought lot into the house to them , and shut to the door .
for we will destroy this place , because the cry of them is waxed great before jehovah ; and jehovah hath sent us to destroy it .
and lot said unto them , oh , not so , my lord :
and he said unto him , see , i have accepted thee concerning this thing also , that i will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken .
haste thee , escape thither ; for i can not do anything till thou be come thither . therefore the name of the city was called zoar .
the sun was risen upon the earth when lot came unto zoar .
then jehovah rained upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and fire from jehovah out of heaven ;
and he overthrew those cities , and all the plain , and all the inhabitants of the cities , and that which grew upon the ground .
but his wife looked back from behind him , and she became a pillar of salt .
and abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before jehovah :
come , let us make our father drink wine , and we will lie with him , that we may preserve seed of our father .
thus were both the daughters of lot with child by their father .
and the first-born bare a son , and called his name moab : the same is the father of the moabites unto this day .
and the younger , she also bare a son , and called his name ben-ammi : the same is the father of the children of ammon unto this day .
and abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the south , and dwelt between kadesh and shur ; and he sojourned in gerar .
and abraham said of sarah his wife , she is my sister : and abimelech king of gerar sent , and took sarah .
now abimelech had not come near her : and he said , lord , wilt thou slay even a righteous nation ?
and abimelech rose early in the morning , and called all his servants , and told all these things in their ears : and the men were sore afraid .
and abimelech said unto abraham , what sawest thou , that thou hast done this thing ?
and moreover she is indeed my sister , the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she became my wife :
and abimelech took sheep and oxen , and men-servants and women-servants , and gave them unto abraham , and restored him sarah his wife .
and abimelech said , behold , my land is before thee : dwell where it pleaseth thee .
and abraham prayed unto god : and god healed abimelech , and his wife , and his maid-servants ; and they bare children .
for jehovah had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of abimelech , because of sarah , abraham ’ s wife .
and jehovah visited sarah as he had said , and jehovah did unto sarah as he had spoken .
and sarah conceived , and bare abraham a son in his old age , at the set time of which god had spoken to him .
and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him , whom sarah bare to him , isaac .
and abraham circumcised his son isaac when he was eight days old , as god had commanded him .
and abraham was a hundred years old , when his son isaac was born unto him .
and sarah said , god hath made me to laugh ; every one that heareth will laugh with me .
and she said , who would have said unto abraham , that sarah should give children suck ? for i have borne him a son in his old age .
and the child grew , and was weaned : and abraham made a great feast on the day that isaac was weaned .
and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian , whom she had borne unto abraham , mocking .
and the thing was very grievous in abraham ’ s sight on account of his son .
and also of the son of the handmaid will i make a nation , because he is thy seed .
and the water in the bottle was spent , and she cast the child under one of the shrubs .
arise , lift up the lad , and hold him in thy hand ; for i will make him a great nation .
and god was with the lad , and he grew ; and he dwelt in the wilderness , and became , as he grew up , an archer .
and he dwelt in the wilderness of paran : and his mother took him a wife out of the land of egypt .
and abraham said , i will swear .
and abraham reproved abimelech because of the well of water , which abimelech ’ s servants had violently taken away .
and abimelech said , i know not who hath done this thing : neither didst thou tell me , neither yet heard i of it , but to-day .
and abraham took sheep and oxen , and gave them unto abimelech ; and they two made a covenant .
and abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves .
and abimelech said unto abraham , what mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves ?
wherefore he called that place beer-sheba ; because there they sware both of them .
and abraham planted a tamarisk tree in beer-sheba , and called there on the name of jehovah , the everlasting god .
and abraham sojourned in the land of the philistines many days .
and it came to pass after these things , that god did prove abraham , and said unto him , abraham ; and he said , here am i .
on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes , and saw the place afar off .
and abraham said , god will provide himself the lamb for a burnt-offering , my son : so they went both of them together .
and abraham stretched forth his hand , and took the knife to slay his son .
and the angel of jehovah called unto him out of heaven , and said , abraham , abraham : and he said , here am i .
and abraham called the name of that place jehovah-jireh : as it is said to this day , in the mount of jehovah it shall be provided .
and the angel of jehovah called unto abraham a second time out of heaven ,
and said , by myself have i sworn , saith jehovah , because thou hast done this thing , and hast not withheld thy son , thine only son ,
and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed ; because thou hast obeyed my voice .
so abraham returned unto his young men , and they rose up and went together to beer-sheba ; and abraham dwelt at beer-sheba .
uz his first-born , and buz his brother , and kemuel the father of aram ,
and chesed , and hazo , and pildash , and jidlaph , and bethuel .
and bethuel begat rebekah : these eight did milcah bear to nahor , abraham ’ s brother .
and his concubine , whose name was reumah , she also bare tebah , and gaham , and tahash , and maacah .
and the life of sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years : these were the years of the life of sarah .
and abraham rose up from before his dead , and spake unto the children of heth , saying ,
and the children of heth answered abraham , saying unto him ,
and abraham rose up , and bowed himself to the people of the land , even to the children of heth .
and abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land .
and ephron answered abraham , saying unto him ,
unto abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of heth , before all that went in at the gate of his city .
and the field , and the cave that is therein , were made sure unto abraham for a possession of a burying-place by the children of heth .
and abraham was old , and well stricken in age : and jehovah had blessed abraham in all things .
but thou shalt go unto my country , and to my kindred , and take a wife for my son isaac .
and abraham said unto him , beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again .
and the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master , and sware to him concerning this matter .
behold , i am standing by the fountain of water ; and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water :
and the servant ran to meet her , and said , give me to drink , i pray thee , a little water from thy pitcher .
and she said , drink , my lord : and she hasted , and let down her pitcher upon her hand , and gave him drink .
and when she had done giving him drink , she said , i will draw for thy camels also , until they have done drinking .
and she hasted , and emptied her pitcher into the trough , and ran again unto the well to draw , and drew for all his camels .
and the man looked stedfastly on her , holding his peace , to know whether jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not .
and said , whose daughter art thou ? tell me , i pray thee . is there room in thy father ’ s house for us to lodge in ?
and she said unto him , i am the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah , whom she bare unto nahor .
she said moreover unto him , we have both straw and provender enough , and room to lodge in .
and the man bowed his head , and worshipped jehovah .
and the damsel ran , and told her mother ’ s house according to these words .
and rebekah had a brother , and his name was laban : and laban ran out unto the man , unto the fountain .
and he said , come in , thou blessed of jehovah ; wherefore standest thou without ? for i have prepared the house , and room for the camels .
and he said , i am abraham ’ s servant .
and sarah my master ’ s wife bare a son to my master when she was old : and unto him hath he given all that he hath .
but thou shalt go unto my father ’ s house , and to my kindred , and take a wife for my son .
and i said unto my master , peradventure the woman will not follow me .
then laban and bethuel answered and said , the thing proceedeth from jehovah : we can not speak unto thee bad or good .
and it came to pass , that , when abraham ’ s servant heard their words , he bowed himself down to the earth unto jehovah .
and her brother and her mother said , let the damsel abide with us a few days , at the least ten ; after that she shall go .
and he said unto them , hinder me not , seeing jehovah hath prospered my way ; send me away that i may go to my master .
and they said , we will call the damsel , and inquire at her mouth .
and they called rebekah , and said unto her , wilt thou go with this man ? and she said , i will go .
and they sent away rebekah their sister , and her nurse , and abraham ’ s servant , and his men .
and isaac came from the way of beer-lahai-roi ; for he dwelt in the land of the south .
and rebekah lifted up her eyes , and when she saw isaac , she alighted from the camel .
and the servant told isaac all the things that he had done .
and abraham took another wife , and her name was keturah .
and she bare him zimran , and jokshan , and medan , and midian , and ishbak , and shuah .
and jokshan begat sheba , and dedan . and the sons of dedan were asshurim , and letushim , and leummim .
and the sons of midian : ephah , and epher , and hanoch , and abida , and eldaah . all these were the children of keturah .
and abraham gave all that he had unto isaac .
and these are the days of the years of abraham ’ s life which he lived , a hundred threescore and fifteen years .
the field which abraham purchased of the children of heth : there was abraham buried , and sarah his wife .
and it came to pass after the death of abraham , that god blessed isaac his son : and isaac dwelt by beer-lahai-roi .
now these are the generations of ishmael , abraham ’ s son , whom hagar the egyptian , sarah ’ s handmaid , bare unto abraham :
and mishma , and dumah , and massa ,
hadad , and tema , jetur , naphish , and kedemah :
these are the sons of ishmael , and these are their names , by their villages , and by their encampments ; twelve princes according to their nations .
and they dwelt from havilah unto shur that is before egypt , as thou goest toward assyria : he abode over against all his brethren .
and these are the generations of isaac , abraham ’ s son : abraham begat isaac :
and isaac entreated jehovah for his wife , because she was barren : and jehovah was entreated of him , and rebekah his wife conceived .
and the children struggled together within her ; and she said , if it be so , wherefore do i live ? and she went to inquire of jehovah .
and jehovah said unto her ,
and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled , behold , there were twins in her womb .
and the first came forth red , all over like a hairy garment ; and they called his name esau .
and the boys grew : and esau was a skilful hunter , a man of the field ; and jacob was a quiet man , dwelling in tents .
now isaac loved esau , because he did eat of his venison : and rebekah loved jacob .
and jacob boiled pottage : and esau came in from the field , and he was faint :
and jacob said , sell me first thy birthright .
and esau said , behold , i am about to die : and what profit shall the birthright do to me ?
and jacob said , swear to me first ; and he sware unto him : and he sold his birthright unto jacob .
and jehovah appeared unto him , and said , go not down into egypt ; dwell in the land which i shall tell thee of :
because that abraham obeyed my voice , and kept my charge , my commandments , my statutes , and my laws .
and isaac dwelt in gerar :
and abimelech charged all the people , saying , he that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death .
and isaac sowed in that land , and found in the same year a hundredfold : and jehovah blessed him .
and the man waxed great , and grew more and more until he became very great :
and he had possessions of flocks , and possessions of herds , and a great household : and the philistines envied him .
now all the wells which his father ’ s servants had digged in the days of abraham his father , the philistines had stopped , and filled with earth .
and abimelech said unto isaac , go from us ; for thou art much mightier than we .
and isaac departed thence , and encamped in the valley of gerar , and dwelt there .
and isaac ’ s servants digged in the valley , and found there a well of springing water .
and they digged another well , and they strove for that also : and he called the name of it sitnah .
and he went up from thence to beer-sheba .
then abimelech went to him from gerar , and ahuzzath his friend , and phicol the captain of his host .
and isaac said unto them , wherefore are ye come unto me , seeing ye hate me , and have sent me away from you ?
and he made them a feast , and they did eat and drink .
and they rose up betimes in the morning , and sware one to another : and isaac sent them away , and they departed from him in peace .
and he called it shibah : therefore the name of the city is beer-sheba unto this day .
and when esau was forty years old he took to wife judith the daughter of beeri the hittite , and basemath the daughter of elon the hittite :
and they were a grief of mind unto isaac and to rebekah .
and he said , behold now , i am old , i know not the day of my death .
now therefore take , i pray thee , thy weapons , thy quiver and thy bow , and go out to the field , and take me venison ;
and rebekah heard when isaac spake to esau his son . and esau went to the field to hunt for venison , and to bring it .
and rebekah spake unto jacob her son , saying , behold , i heard thy father speak unto esau thy brother , saying ,
bring me venison , and make me savory food , that i may eat , and bless thee before jehovah before my death .
now therefore , my son , obey my voice according to that which i command thee .
and thou shalt bring it to thy father , that he may eat , so that he may bless thee before his death .
and jacob said to rebekah his mother , behold , esau my brother is a hairy man , and i am a smooth man .
and his mother said unto him , upon me be thy curse , my son ; only obey my voice , and go fetch me them .
and he went , and fetched , and brought them to his mother : and his mother made savory food , such as his father loved .
and rebekah took the goodly garments of esau her elder son , which were with her in the house , and put them upon jacob her younger son ;
and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands , and upon the smooth of his neck :
and she gave the savory food and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son jacob .
and he came unto his father , and said , my father : and he said , here am i ; who art thou , my son ?
and he discerned him not , because his hands were hairy , as his brother esau ’ s hands : so he blessed him .
and he said , art thou my very son esau ? and he said , i am .
and his father isaac said unto him , come near now , and kiss me , my son .
and he came near , and kissed him : and he smelled the smell of his raiment , and blessed him , and said ,
and god give thee of the dew of heaven ,
let peoples serve thee ,
and isaac his father said unto him , who art thou ? and he said , i am thy son , thy first-born , esau .
and he said , thy brother came with guile , and hath taken away thy blessing .
and isaac his father answered and said unto him ,
and by thy sword shalt thou live , and thou shalt serve thy brother ;
now therefore , my son , obey my voice ; and arise , flee thou to laban my brother to haran ;
and tarry with him a few days , until thy brother ’ s fury turn away ;
and isaac called jacob , and blessed him , and charged him , and said unto him , thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan .
and god almighty bless thee , and make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , that thou mayest be a company of peoples ;
and that jacob obeyed his father and his mother , and was gone to paddan-aram :
and esau saw that the daughters of canaan pleased not isaac his father ;
and jacob went out from beer-sheba , and went toward haran .
and jacob awaked out of his sleep , and he said , surely jehovah is in this place ; and i knew it not .
and he called the name of that place beth-el : but the name of the city was luz at the first .
so that i come again to my father ’ s house in peace , and jehovah will be my god ,
then jacob went on his journey , and came to the land of the children of the east .
and jacob said unto them , my brethren , whence are ye ? and they said , of haran are we .
and he said unto them , know ye laban the son of nahor ? and they said , we know him .
while he was yet speaking with them , rachel came with her father ’ s sheep ; for she kept them .
and jacob kissed rachel , and lifted up his voice , and wept .
and jacob told rachel that he was her father ’ s brother , and that he was rebekah ’ s son : and she ran and told her father .
and laban said to him , surely thou art my bone and my flesh . and he abode with him the space of a month .
and laban said unto jacob , because thou art my brother , shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought ? tell me , what shall thy wages be ?
and laban had two daughters : the name of the elder was leah , and the name of the younger was rachel .
and leah ’ s eyes were tender ; but rachel was beautiful and well-favored .
and jacob loved rachel ; and he said , i will serve thee seven years for rachel thy younger daughter .
and laban said , it is better that i give her to thee , than that i should give her to another man : abide with me .
and jacob served seven years for rachel ; and they seemed unto him but a few days , for the love he had to her .
and jacob said unto laban , give me my wife , for my days are fulfilled , that i may go in unto her .
and laban gathered together all the men of the place , and made a feast .
and it came to pass in the evening , that he took leah his daughter , and brought her to him ; and he went in unto her .
and laban gave zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter leah for a handmaid .
and laban said , it is not so done in our place , to give the younger before the first-born .
fulfil the week of this one , and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years .
and jacob did so , and fulfilled her week : and he gave him rachel his daughter to wife .
and laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid .
and he went in also unto rachel , and he loved also rachel more than leah , and served with him yet seven other years .
and jehovah saw that leah was hated , and he opened her womb : but rachel was barren .
and she gave him bilhah her handmaid to wife : and jacob went in unto her .
and bilhah conceived , and bare jacob a son .
and rachel said , god hath judged me , and hath also heard my voice , and hath given me a son : therefore called she his name dan .
and bilhah rachel ’ s handmaid conceived again , and bare jacob a second son .
and rachel said , with mighty wrestlings have i wrestled with my sister , and have prevailed : and she called his name naphtali .
when leah saw that she had left off bearing , she took zilpah her handmaid , and gave her to jacob to wife .
and zilpah leah ’ s handmaid bare jacob a son .
and leah said , fortunate ! and she called his name gad .
and zilpah leah ’ s handmaid bare jacob a second son .
and leah said , happy am i ! for the daughters will call me happy : and she called his name asher .
and god hearkened unto leah , and she conceived , and bare jacob a fifth son .
and leah said , god hath given me my hire , because i gave my handmaid to my husband : and she called his name issachar .
and leah conceived again , and bare a sixth son to jacob .
and afterwards she bare a daughter , and called her name dinah .
and god remembered rachel , and god hearkened to her , and opened her womb .
and she conceived , and bare a son : and said , god hath taken away my reproach :
and she called his name joseph , saying , jehovah add to me another son .
give me my wives and my children for whom i have served thee , and let me go : for thou knowest my service wherewith i have served thee .
and he said , appoint me thy wages , and i will give it .
and he said unto him , thou knowest how i have served thee , and how thy cattle have fared with me .
and laban said , behold , i would it might be according to thy word .
and he set three days ’ journey betwixt himself and jacob : and jacob fed the rest of laban ’ s flocks .
and the flocks conceived before the rods , and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked , speckled , and spotted .
but when the flock were feeble , he put them not in : so the feebler were laban ’ s , and the stronger jacob ’ s .
and the man increased exceedingly , and had large flocks , and maid-servants and men-servants , and camels and asses .
and jacob beheld the countenance of laban , and , behold , it was not toward him as beforetime .
and jehovah said unto jacob , return unto the land of thy fathers , and to thy kindred ; and i will be with thee .
and jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field unto his flock ,
and ye know that with all my power i have served your father .
and your father hath deceived me , and changed my wages ten times ; but god suffered him not to hurt me .
thus god hath taken away the cattle of your father , and given them to me .
and the angel of god said unto me in the dream , jacob : and i said , here am i .
and rachel and leah answered and said unto him , is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father ’ s house ?
are we not accounted by him as foreigners ? for he hath sold us , and hath also quite devoured our money .
then jacob rose up , and set his sons and his wives upon the camels ;
now laban was gone to shear his sheep : and rachel stole the teraphim that were her father ’ s .
and jacob stole away unawares to laban the syrian , in that he told him not that he fled .
so he fled with all that he had ; and he rose up , and passed over the river , and set his face toward the mountain of gilead .
and it was told laban on the third day that jacob was fled .
and he took his brethren with him , and pursued after him seven days ’ journey ; and he overtook him in the mountain of gilead .
and laban came up with jacob . now jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain : and laban with his brethren encamped in the mountain of gilead .
and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters ? now hast thou done foolishly .
and now , though thou wouldest needs be gone , because thou sore longedst after thy father ’ s house , yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods ?
and jacob answered and said to laban , because i was afraid : for i said , lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force .
thus i was ; in the day the drought consumed me , and the frost by night ; and my sleep fled from mine eyes .
and now come , let us make a covenant , i and thou ; and let it be for a witness between me and thee .
and jacob took a stone , and set it up for a pillar .
and jacob said unto his brethren , gather stones ; and they took stones , and made a heap : and they did eat there by the heap .
and laban called it jegar-saha-dutha : but jacob called it galeed .
and laban said , this heap is witness between me and thee this day . therefore was the name of it called galeed :
and mizpah , for he said , jehovah watch between me and thee , when we are absent one from another .
and laban said to jacob , behold this heap , and behold the pillar , which i have set betwixt me and thee .
and jacob went on his way , and the angels of god met him .
and jacob said when he saw them , this is god ’ s host : and he called the name of that place mahanaim .
and jacob sent messengers before him to esau his brother unto the land of seir , the field of edom .
and he said , if esau come to the one company , and smite it , then the company which is left shall escape .
and thou saidst , i will surely do thee good , and make thy seed as the sand of the sea , which can not be numbered for multitude .
and he lodged there that night , and took of that which he had with him a present for esau his brother :
two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats , two hundred ewes and twenty rams ,
thirty milch camels and their colts , forty cows and ten bulls , twenty she-asses and ten foals .
so the present passed over before him : and he himself lodged that night in the company .
and he took them , and sent them over the stream , and sent over that which he had .
and jacob was left alone ; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day .
and he said , let me go , for the day breaketh . and he said , i will not let thee go , except thou bless me .
and he said unto him , what is thy name ? and he said , jacob .
and he said , thy name shall be called no more jacob , but israel : for thou hast striven with god and with men , and hast prevailed .
and jacob called the name of the place peniel : for , said he , i have seen god face to face , and my life is preserved .
and the sun rose upon him as he passed over penuel , and he limped upon his thigh .
and he put the handmaids and their children foremost , and leah and her children after , and rachel and joseph hindermost .
and he himself passed over before them , and bowed himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
and esau ran to meet him , and embraced him , and fell on his neck , and kissed him : and they wept .
then the handmaids came near , they and their children , and they bowed themselves .
and leah also and her children came near , and bowed themselves : and after came joseph near and rachel , and they bowed themselves .
and he said , what meanest thou by all this company which i met ? and he said , to find favor in the sight of my lord .
and esau said , i have enough , my brother ; let that which thou hast be thine .
and he said , let us take our journey , and let us go , and i will go before thee .
so esau returned that day on his way unto seir .
and jacob journeyed to succoth , and built him a house , and made booths for his cattle : therefore the name of the place is called succoth .
and he erected there an altar , and called it el-elohe-israel .
and dinah the daughter of leah , whom she bare unto jacob , went out to see the daughters of the land .
and his soul clave unto dinah the daughter of jacob , and he loved the damsel , and spake kindly unto the damsel .
and shechem spake unto his father hamor , saying , get me this damsel to wife .
and hamor the father of shechem went out unto jacob to commune with him .
and hamor communed with them , saying , the soul of my son shechem longeth for your daughter : i pray you , give her unto him to wife .
and make ye marriages with us ; give your daughters unto us , and take our daughters unto you .
and ye shall dwell with us : and the land shall be before you ; dwell and trade ye therein , and get you possessions therein .
and shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren , let me find favor in your eyes , and what ye shall say unto me i will give .
ask me never so much dowry and gift , and i will give according as ye shall say unto me : but give me the damsel to wife .
and the sons of jacob answered shechem and hamor his father with guile , and spake , because he had defiled dinah their sister ,
and said unto them , we can not do this thing , to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised ; for that were a reproach unto us .
only on this condition will we consent unto you : if ye will be as we are , that every male of you be circumcised ;
but if ye will not hearken unto us , to be circumcised ; then will we take our daughter , and we will be gone .
and their words pleased hamor , and shechem hamor ’ s son .
and hamor and shechem his son came unto the gate of their city , and communed with the men of their city , saying ,
shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours ? only let us consent unto them , and they will dwell with us .
and they slew hamor and shechem his son with the edge of the sword , and took dinah out of shechem ’ s house , and went forth .
the sons of jacob came upon the slain , and plundered the city , because they had defiled their sister .
they took their flocks and their herds and their asses , and that which was in the city , and that which was in the field ;
and all their wealth , and all their little ones and their wives , took they captive and made a prey , even all that was in the house .
and they said , should he deal with our sister as with a harlot ?
and they journeyed : and a terror of god was upon the cities that were round about them , and they did not pursue after the sons of jacob .
so jacob came to luz , which is in the land of canaan ( the same is beth-el ) , he and all the people that were with him .
and deborah rebekah ’ s nurse died , and she was buried below beth-el under the oak : and the name of it was called allon-bacuth .
and god appeared unto jacob again , when he came from paddan-aram , and blessed him .
and the land which i gave unto abraham and isaac , to thee i will give it , and to thy seed after thee will i give the land .
and god went up from him in the place where he spake with him .
and jacob called the name of the place where god spake with him , beth-el .
and they journeyed from beth-el ; and there was still some distance to come to ephrath : and rachel travailed , and she had hard labor .
and rachel died , and was buried in the way to ephrath ( the same is beth-lehem ) .
and jacob set up a pillar upon her grave : the same is the pillar of rachel ’ s grave unto this day .
and israel journeyed , and spread his tent beyond the tower of eder .
the sons of leah : reuben , jacob ’ s first-born , and simeon , and levi , and judah , and issachar , and zebulun ;
the sons of rachel : joseph and benjamin ;
and the sons of bilhah , rachel ’ s handmaid : dan and naphtali ;
and the sons of zilpah , leah ’ s handmaid : gad and asher : these are the sons of jacob , that were born to him in paddan-aram .
and jacob came unto isaac his father to mamre , to kiriath-arba ( the same is hebron ) , where abraham and isaac sojourned .
and the days of isaac were a hundred and fourscore years .
now these are the generations of esau ( the same is edom ) .
and basemath ishmael ’ s daughter , sister of nebaioth .
and adah bare to esau eliphaz ; and basemath bare reuel ;
and oholibamah bare jeush , and jalam , and korah : these are the sons of esau , that were born unto him in the land of canaan .
for their substance was too great for them to dwell together ; and the land of their sojournings could not bear them because of their cattle .
and esau dwelt in mount seir : esau is edom .
and these are the generations of esau the father of the edomites in mount seir :
these are the names of esau ’ s sons : eliphaz the son of adah the wife of esau , reuel the son of basemath the wife of esau .
and the sons of eliphaz were teman , omar , zepho , and gatam , and kenaz .
and timna was concubine to eliphaz esau ’ s son ; and she bare to eliphaz amalek : these are the sons of adah , esau ’ s wife .
and these are the sons of reuel : nahath , and zerah , shammah , and mizzah : these were the sons of basemath , esau ’ s wife .
chief korah , chief gatam , chief amalek : these are the chiefs that came of eliphaz in the land of edom ; these are the sons of adah .
these are the sons of esau , and these are their chiefs : the same is edom .
these are the sons of seir the horite , the inhabitants of the land : lotan and shobal and zibeon and anah ,
and dishon and ezer and dishan : these are the chiefs that came of the horites , the children of seir in the land of edom .
and the children of lotan were hori and heman ; and lotan ’ s sister was timna .
and these are the children of shobal : alvan and manahath and ebal , shepho and onam .
and these are the children of anah : dishon and oholibamah the daughter of anah .
and these are the children of dishon : hemdan and eshban and ithran and cheran .
these are the children of ezer : bilhan and zaavan and akan .
these are the children of dishan : uz and aran .
these are the chiefs that came of the horites : chief lotan , chief shobal , chief zibeon , chief anah ,
chief dishon , chief ezer , chief dishan : these are the chiefs that came of the horites , according to their chiefs in the land of seir .
and these are the kings that reigned in the land of edom , before there reigned any king over the children of israel .
and bela the son of beor reigned in edom ; and the name of his city was dinhabah .
and bela died , and jobab the son of zerah of bozrah reigned in his stead .
and jobab died , and husham of the land of the temanites reigned in his stead .
and hadad died , and samlah of masrekah reigned in his stead .
and samlah died , and shaul of rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead .
and shaul died , and baal-hanan the son of achbor reigned in his stead .
chief oholibamah , chief elah , chief pinon ,
chief kenaz , chief teman , chief mibzar ,
and jacob dwelt in the land of his father ’ s sojournings , in the land of canaan .
now israel loved joseph more than all his children , because he was the son of his old age : and he made him a coat of many colors .
and his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren ; and they hated him , and could not speak peaceably unto him .
and joseph dreamed a dream , and he told it to his brethren : and they hated him yet the more .
and he said unto them , hear , i pray you , this dream which i have dreamed :
and his brethren envied him ; but his father kept the saying in mind .
and his brethren went to feed their father ’ s flock in shechem .
and a certain man found him , and , behold , he was wandering in the field : and the man asked him , saying , what seekest thou ?
and he said , i am seeking my brethren : tell me , i pray thee , where they are feeding the flock .
and they saw him afar off , and before he came near unto them , they conspired against him to slay him .
and they said one to another , behold , this dreamer cometh .
and reuben heard it , and delivered him out of their hand , and said , let us not take his life .
and they took him , and cast him into the pit : and the pit was empty , there was no water in it .
and judah said unto his brethren , what profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood ?
and reuben returned unto the pit ; and , behold , joseph was not in the pit ; and he rent his clothes .
and he returned unto his brethren , and said , the child is not ; and i , whither shall i go ?
and they took joseph ’ s coat , and killed a he-goat , and dipped the coat in the blood ;
and jacob rent his garments , and put sackcloth upon his loins , and mourned for his son many days .
and the midianites sold him into egypt unto potiphar , an officer of pharaoh ’ s , the captain of the guard .
and it came to pass at that time , that judah went down from his brethren , and turned in to a certain adullamite , whose name was hirah .
and judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite whose name was shua ; and he took her , and went in unto her .
and she conceived , and bare a son ; and he called his name er .
and she conceived again , and bare a son ; and she called his name onan .
and she yet again bare a son , and called his name shelah : and he was at chezib , when she bare him .
and judah took a wife for er his first-born , and her name was tamar .
and er , judah ’ s first-born , was wicked in the sight of jehovah ; and jehovah slew him .
and the thing which he did was evil in the sight of jehovah : and he slew him also .
and it was told tamar , saying , behold , thy father-in-law goeth up to timnah to shear his sheep .
when judah saw her , he thought her to be a harlot ; for she had covered her face .
and she arose , and went away , and put off her veil from her , and put on the garments of her widowhood .
and it came to pass in the time of her travail , that , behold , twins were in her womb .
and afterward came out his brother , that had the scarlet thread upon his hand : and his name was called zerah .
and jehovah was with joseph , and he was a prosperous man ; and he was in the house of his master the egyptian .
and his master saw that jehovah was with him , and that jehovah made all that he did to prosper in his hand .
and it came to pass after these things , that his master ’ s wife cast her eyes upon joseph ; and she said , lie with me .
and it came to pass , when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand , and was fled forth ,
and she laid up his garment by her , until his master came home .
and it came to pass , as i lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment by me , and fled out .
but jehovah was with joseph , and showed kindness unto him , and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison .
and it came to pass after these things , that the butler of the king of egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of egypt .
and pharaoh was wroth against his two officers , against the chief of the butlers , and against the chief of the bakers .
and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard , into the prison , the place where joseph was bound .
and the captain of the guard charged joseph with them , and he ministered unto them : and they continued a season in ward .
and joseph came in unto them in the morning , and saw them , and , behold , they were sad .
and he asked pharaoh ’ s officers that were with him in ward in his master ’ s house , saying , wherefore look ye so sad to-day ?
and the chief butler told his dream to joseph , and said to him , in my dream , behold , a vine was before me ;
and joseph said unto him , this is the interpretation of it : the three branches are three days ;
for indeed i was stolen away out of the land of the hebrews : and here also have i done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon .
and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for pharaoh ; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head .
and joseph answered and said , this is the interpretation thereof : the three baskets are three days ;
and he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again ; and he gave the cup into pharaoh ’ s hand :
but he hanged the chief baker : as joseph had interpreted to them .
yet did not the chief butler remember joseph , but forgat him .
and it came to pass at the end of two full years , that pharaoh dreamed : and , behold , he stood by the river .
and , behold , there came up out of the river seven kine , well-favored and fat-fleshed ; and they fed in the reed-grass .
and the ill-favored and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven well-favored and fat kine . so pharaoh awoke .
and he slept and dreamed a second time : and , behold , seven ears of grain came up upon one stalk , rank and good .
and , behold , seven ears , thin and blasted with the east wind , sprung up after them .
and the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears . and pharaoh awoke , and , behold , it was a dream .
then spake the chief butler unto pharaoh , saying , i do remember my faults this day :
pharaoh was wroth with his servants , and put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guard , me and the chief baker :
and we dreamed a dream in one night , i and he ; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream .
and it came to pass , as he interpreted to us , so it was ; me he restored unto mine office , and him he hanged .
and joseph answered pharaoh , saying , it is not in me : god will give pharaoh an answer of peace .
and pharaoh spake unto joseph , in my dream , behold , i stood upon the brink of the river :
and , behold , there came up out of the river seven kine , fat-fleshed and well-favored ; and they fed in the reed-grass :
and the lean and ill-favored kine did eat up the first seven fat kine :
and i saw in my dream , and , behold , seven ears came up upon one stalk , full and good :
and , behold , seven ears , withered , thin , and blasted with the east wind , sprung up after them :
and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears : and i told it unto the magicians ; but there was none that could declare it to me .
and joseph said unto pharaoh , the dream of pharaoh is one : what god is about to do he hath declared unto pharaoh .
the seven good kine are seven years ; and the seven good ears are seven years : the dream is one .
that is the thing which i spake unto pharaoh : what god is about to do he hath showed unto pharaoh .
behold , there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt :
and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which followeth ; for it shall be very grievous .
and for that the dream was doubled unto pharaoh , it is because the thing is established by god , and god will shortly bring it to pass .
now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise , and set him over the land of egypt .
and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh , and in the eyes of all his servants .
and pharaoh said unto his servants , can we find such a one as this , a man in whom the spirit of god is ?
and pharaoh said unto joseph , forasmuch as god hath showed thee all this , there is none so discreet and wise as thou :
thou shalt be over my house , and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled : only in the throne will i be greater than thou .
and pharaoh said unto joseph , see , i have set thee over all the land of egypt .
and pharaoh said unto joseph , i am pharaoh , and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of egypt .
and in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls .
and joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea , very much , until he left off numbering ; for it was without number .
and unto joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came , whom asenath , the daughter of potiphera priest of on , bare unto him .
and the name of the second called he ephraim : for god hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction .
and the seven years of plenty , that was in the land of egypt , came to an end .
and all countries came into egypt to joseph to buy grain , because the famine was sore in all the earth .
now jacob saw that there was grain in egypt , and jacob said unto his sons , why do ye look one upon another ?
and joseph ’ s ten brethren went down to buy grain from egypt .
but benjamin , joseph ’ s brother , jacob sent not with his brethren ; for he said , lest peradventure harm befall him .
and the sons of israel came to buy among those that came : for the famine was in the land of canaan .
and joseph knew his brethren , but they knew not him .
and they said unto him , nay , my lord , but to buy food are thy servants come .
we are all one man ’ s sons ; we are true men , thy servants are no spies .
and he said unto them , nay , but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come .
and joseph said unto them , that is it that i spake unto you , saying , ye are spies :
hereby ye shall be proved : by the life of pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence , except your youngest brother come hither .
and he put them all together into ward three days .
and joseph said unto them the third day , this do , and live ; for i fear god :
if ye be true men , let one of your brethren be bound in your prison-house ; but go ye , carry grain for the famine of your houses :
and bring your youngest brother unto me ; so shall your words be verified , and ye shall not die . and they did so .
and they knew not that joseph understood them ; for there was an interpreter between them .
and they laded their asses with their grain , and departed thence .
and they came unto jacob their father unto the land of canaan , and told him all that had befallen them , saying ,
the man , the lord of the land , spake roughly with us , and took us for spies of the country .
and we said unto him , we are true men ; we are no spies :
we are twelve brethren , sons of our father ; one is not , and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of canaan .
and the famine was sore in the land .
if thou wilt send our brother with us , we will go down and buy thee food :
and israel said , wherefore dealt ye so ill with me , as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother ?
for except we had lingered , surely we had now returned a second time .
take also your brother , and arise , go again unto the man :
and the man did as joseph bade ; and the man brought the men to joseph ’ s house .
and they came near to the steward of joseph ’ s house , and they spake unto him at the door of the house ,
and said , oh , my lord , we came indeed down at the first time to buy food :
and other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food : we know not who put our money in our sacks .
and the man brought the men into joseph ’ s house , and gave them water , and they washed their feet ; and he gave their asses provender .
and they made ready the present against joseph ’ s coming at noon : for they heard that they should eat bread there .
and when joseph came home , they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house , and bowed down themselves to him to the earth .
and he asked them of their welfare , and said , is your father well , the old man of whom ye spake ? is he yet alive ?
and they said , thy servant our father is well , he is yet alive . and they bowed the head , and made obeisance .
and he washed his face , and came out ; and he refrained himself , and said , set on bread .
and they sat before him , the first-born according to his birthright , and the youngest according to his youth : and the men marvelled one with another .
as soon as the morning was light , the men were sent away , they and their asses .
is not this that in which my lord drinketh , and whereby he indeed divineth ? ye have done evil in so doing .
and he overtook them , and he spake unto them these words .
and they said unto him , wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these ? far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing .
with whomsoever of thy servants it be found , let him die , and we also will be my lord ’ s bondmen .
then they hasted , and took down every man his sack to the ground , and opened every man his sack .
and he searched , and began at the eldest , and left off at the youngest : and the cup was found in benjamin ’ s sack .
then they rent their clothes , and laded every man his ass , and returned to the city .
and judah and his brethren came to joseph ’ s house ; and he was yet there : and they fell before him on the ground .
and joseph said unto them , what deed is this that ye have done ? know ye not that such a man as i can indeed divine ?
my lord asked his servants , saying , have ye a father , or a brother ?
and thou saidst unto thy servants , bring him down unto me , that i may set mine eyes upon him .
and we said unto my lord , the lad can not leave his father : for if he should leave his father , his father would die .
and thou saidst unto thy servants , except your youngest brother come down with you , ye shall see my face no more .
and it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father , we told him the words of my lord .
and our father said , go again , buy us a little food .
and thy servant my father said unto us , ye know that my wife bare me two sons :
and the one went out from me , and i said , surely he is torn in pieces ; and i have not seen him since :
and if ye take this one also from me , and harm befall him , ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to sheol .
for how shall i go up to my father , if the lad be not with me ? lest i see the evil that shall come on my father .
and he wept aloud : and the egyptians heard , and the house of pharaoh heard .
and now be not grieved , nor angry with yourselves , that ye sold me hither : for god did send me before you to preserve life .
for these two years hath the famine been in the land : and there are yet five years , in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest .
and god sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth , and to save you alive by a great deliverance .
and , behold , your eyes see , and the eyes of my brother benjamin , that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you .
and he fell upon his brother benjamin ’ s neck , and wept ; and benjamin wept upon his neck .
and he kissed all his brethren , and wept upon them : and after that his brethren talked with him .
and pharaoh said unto joseph , say unto thy brethren , this do ye : lade your beasts , and go , get you unto the land of canaan ;
also regard not your stuff ; for the good of all the land of egypt is yours .
and the sons of israel did so : and joseph gave them wagons , according to the commandment of pharaoh , and gave them provision for the way .
to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment ; but to benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver , and five changes of raiment .
so he sent his brethren away , and they departed : and he said unto them , see that ye fall not out by the way .
and they went up out of egypt , and came into the land of canaan unto jacob their father .
and israel said , it is enough ; joseph my son is yet alive : i will go and see him before i die .
and israel took his journey with all that he had , and came to beer-sheba , and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father isaac .
and god spake unto israel in the visions of the night , and said , jacob , jacob . and he said , here am i .
i will go down with thee into egypt ; and i will also surely bring thee up again : and joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes .
and these are the names of the children of israel , who came into egypt , jacob and his sons : reuben , jacob ’ s first-born .
and the sons of reuben : hanoch , and pallu , and hezron , and carmi .
and the sons of simeon : jemuel , and jamin , and ohad , and jachin , and zohar , and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman .
and the sons of levi : gershon , kohath , and merari .
and the sons of issachar : tola , and puvah , and iob , and shimron .
and the sons of zebulun : sered , and elon , and jahleel .
and the sons of gad : ziphion , and haggi , shuni , and ezbon , eri , and arodi , and areli .
these are the sons of zilpah , whom laban gave to leah his daughter ; and these she bare unto jacob , even sixteen souls .
the sons of rachel jacob ’ s wife : joseph and benjamin .
and unto joseph in the land of egypt were born manasseh and ephraim , whom asenath , the daughter of poti-phera priest of on , bare unto him .
these are the sons of rachel , who were born to jacob : all the souls were fourteen .
and the sons of dan : hushim .
and the sons of naphtali : jahzeel , and guni , and jezer , and shillem .
these are the sons of bilhah , whom laban gave unto rachel his daughter , and these she bare unto jacob : all the souls were seven .
and he sent judah before him unto joseph , to show the way before him unto goshen ; and they came into the land of goshen .
and israel said unto joseph , now let me die , since i have seen thy face , that thou art yet alive .
and it shall come to pass , when pharaoh shall call you , and shall say , what is your occupation ?
and from among his brethren he took five men , and presented them unto pharaoh .
and pharaoh said unto his brethren , what is your occupation ? and they said unto pharaoh , thy servants are shepherds , both we , and our fathers .
and pharaoh spake unto joseph , saying , thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee :
and joseph brought in jacob his father , and set him before pharaoh : and jacob blessed pharaoh .
and pharaoh said unto jacob , how many are the days of the years of thy life ?
and jacob blessed pharaoh , and went out from the presence of pharaoh .
and joseph nourished his father , and his brethren , and all his father ’ s household , with bread , according to their families .
and joseph said , give your cattle ; and i will give you for your cattle , if money fail .
and as for the people , he removed them to the cities from one end of the border of egypt even to the other end thereof .
and they said , thou hast saved our lives : let us find favor in the sight of my lord , and we will be pharaoh ’ s servants .
and israel dwelt in the land of egypt , in the land of goshen ; and they gat them possessions therein , and were fruitful , and multiplied exceedingly .
and he said , swear unto me : and he sware unto him . and israel bowed himself upon the bed ’ s head .
and one told jacob , and said , behold , thy son joseph cometh unto thee : and israel strengthened himself , and sat upon the bed .
and jacob said unto joseph , god almighty appeared unto me at luz in the land of canaan , and blessed me ,
and thy issue , that thou begettest after them , shall be thine ; they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance .
and israel beheld joseph ’ s sons , and said , who are these ?
and israel said unto joseph , i had not thought to see thy face : and , lo , god hath let me see thy seed also .
and joseph brought them out from between his knees ; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth .
and joseph said unto his father , not so , my father ; for this is the first-born ; put thy right hand upon his head .
and israel said unto joseph , behold , i die : but god will be with you , and bring you again unto the land of your fathers .
moreover i have given to thee one portion above thy brethren , which i took out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow .
and jacob called unto his sons , and said : gather yourselves together , that i may tell you that which shall befall you in the latter days .
assemble yourselves , and hear , ye sons of jacob ;
reuben , thou art my first-born , my might , and the beginning of my strength ;
boiling over as water , thou shalt not have the pre-eminence ;
simeon and levi are brethren ;
o my soul , come not thou into their council ;
cursed be their anger , for it was fierce ;
judah , thee shall thy brethren praise :
judah is a lion ’ s whelp ;
the sceptre shall not depart from judah ,
binding his foal unto the vine ,
his eyes shall be red with wine ,
zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea ;
issachar is a strong ass ,
and he saw a resting-place that it was good ,
dan shall judge his people ,
dan shall be a serpent in the way ,
i have waited for thy salvation , o jehovah .
gad , a troop shall press upon him ;
out of asher his bread shall be fat ,
naphtali is a hind let loose :
joseph is a fruitful bough ,
the archers have sorely grieved him ,
but his bow abode in strength ,
even by the god of thy father , who shall help thee ,
the blessings of thy father
benjamin is a wolf that raveneth :
there they buried abraham and sarah his wife ; there they buried isaac and rebekah his wife ; and there i buried leah—
the field and the cave that is therein , which was purchased from the children of heth .
and joseph fell upon his father ’ s face , and wept upon him , and kissed him .
and joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father : and the physicians embalmed israel .
and forty days were fulfilled for him ; for so are fulfilled the days of embalming : and the egyptians wept for him three-score and ten days .
and pharaoh said , go up , and bury thy father , according as he made thee swear .
and there went up with him both chariots and horsemen : and it was a very great company .
and his sons did unto him according as he commanded them :
and they sent a message unto joseph , saying , thy father did command before he died , saying ,
and his brethren also went and fell down before his face ; and they said , behold , we are thy servants .
and joseph said unto them , fear not : for am i in the place of god ?
now therefore fear ye not : i will nourish you , and your little ones . and he comforted them , and spake kindly unto them .
and joseph dwelt in egypt , he , and his father ’ s house : and joseph lived a hundred and ten years .
and joseph saw ephraim ’ s children of the third generation : the children also of machir the son of manasseh were born upon joseph ’ s knees .
and joseph took an oath of the children of israel , saying , god will surely visit you , and ye shall carry up my bones from hence .
so joseph died , being a hundred and ten years old : and they embalmed him , and he was put in a coffin in egypt .
the burden which habakkuk the prophet did see .
o jehovah , how long shall i cry , and thou wilt not hear ? i cry out unto thee of violence , and thou wilt not save .
why dost thou show me iniquity , and look upon perverseness ? for destruction and violence are before me ; and there is strife , and contention riseth up .
therefore the law is slacked , and justice doth never go forth ; for the wicked doth compass about the righteous ; therefore justice goeth forth perverted .
they are terrible and dreadful ; their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves .
they come all of them for violence ; the set of their faces is forwards ; and they gather captives as the sand .
yea , he scoffeth at kings , and princes are a derision unto him ; he derideth every stronghold ; for he heapeth up dust , and taketh it .
then shall he sweep by as a wind , and shall pass over , and be guilty , even he whose might is his god .
and makest men as the fishes of the sea , as the creeping things , that have no ruler over them ?
therefore he sacrificeth unto his net , and burneth incense unto his drag ; because by them his portion is fat , and his food plenteous .
shall he therefore empty his net , and spare not to slay the nations continually ?
and jehovah answered me , and said , write the vision , and make it plain upon tablets , that he may run that readeth it .
behold , his soul is puffed up , it is not upright in him ; but the righteous shall live by his faith .
shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee , and awake that shall vex thee , and thou shalt be for booty unto them ?
thou hast devised shame to thy house , by cutting off many peoples , and hast sinned against thy soul .
for the stone shall cry out of the wall , and the beam out of the timber shall answer it .
woe to him that buildeth a town with blood , and establisheth a city by iniquity !
behold , is it not of jehovah of hosts that the peoples labor for the fire , and the nations weary themselves for vanity ?
for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of jehovah , as the waters cover the sea .
woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink , to thee that addest thy venom , and makest him drunken also , that thou mayest look on their nakedness !
but jehovah is in his holy temple : let all the earth keep silence before him .
a prayer of habakkuk the prophet , set to shigionoth .
o jehovah , i have heard the report of thee , and am afraid :
god came from teman ,
and his brightness was as the light ;
before him went the pestilence ,
he stood , and measured the earth ;
i saw the tents of cushan in affliction ;
was jehovah displeased with the rivers ?
thy bow was made quite bare ;
the mountains saw thee , and were afraid ;
the sun and moon stood still in their habitation ,
thou didst march through the land in indignation ;
thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people ,
thou didst pierce with his own staves the head of his warriors :
thou didst tread the sea with thy horses ,
i heard , and my body trembled ,
for though the fig-tree shall not flourish ,
yet i will rejoice in jehovah ,
jehovah , the lord , is my strength ;
then came the word of jehovah by haggai the prophet , saying ,
is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your ceiled houses , while this house lieth waste ?
now therefore thus saith jehovah of hosts : consider your ways .
thus saith jehovah of hosts : consider your ways .
therefore for your sake the heavens withhold the dew , and the earth withholdeth its fruit .
then spake haggai jehovah ’ s messenger in jehovah ’ s message unto the people , saying , i am with you , saith jehovah .
in the four and twentieth day of the month , in the sixth month , in the second year of darius the king .
in the seventh month , in the one and twentieth day of the month , came the word of jehovah by haggai the prophet , saying ,
according to the word that i covenanted with you when ye came out of egypt , and my spirit abode among you : fear ye not .
the silver is mine , and the gold is mine , saith jehovah of hosts .
in the four and twentieth day of the ninth month , in the second year of darius , came the word of jehovah by haggai the prophet , saying ,
thus saith jehovah of hosts : ask now the priests concerning the law , saying ,
and now , i pray you , consider from this day and backward , before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of jehovah .
i smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your hands ; yet ye turned not to me , saith jehovah .
and the word of jehovah came the second time unto haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month , saying ,
speak to zerubbabel , governor of judah , saying , i will shake the heavens and the earth ;
god , having of old time spoken unto the fathers in the prophets by divers portions and in divers manners ,
hath at the end of these days spoken unto us in his son , whom he appointed heir of all things , through whom also he made the worlds ;
having become by so much better than the angels , as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they .
for unto which of the angels said he at any time ,
and when he again bringeth in the firstborn into the world he saith , and let all the angels of god worship him .
and of the angels he saith ,
but of the son he saith ,
thou hast loved righteousness , and hated iniquity ;
they shall perish ; but thou continuest :
and as a mantle shalt thou roll them up ,
but of which of the angels hath he said at any time ,
are they not all ministering spirits , sent forth to do service for the sake of them that shall inherit salvation ?
therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things that were heard , lest haply we drift away from them .
for if the word spoken through angels proved stedfast , and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward ;
for not unto angels did he subject the world to come , whereof we speak .
but one hath somewhere testified , saying ,
thou madest him a little lower than the angels ;
thou didst put all things in subjection under his feet .
for both he that sanctifieth and they that are sanctified are all of one : for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren ,
and again , i will put my trust in him . and again , behold , i and the children whom god hath given me .
and might deliver all them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage .
for verily not to angels doth he give help , but he giveth help to the seed of abraham .
for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted , he is able to succor them that are tempted .
wherefore , holy brethren , partakers of a heavenly calling , consider the apostle and high priest of our confession , even jesus ;
who was faithful to him that appointed him , as also was moses in all his house .
for he hath been counted worthy of more glory than moses , by so much as he that built the house hath more honor than the house .
for every house is builded by some one ; but he that built all things is god .
and moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant , for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken ;
wherefore , even as the holy spirit saith ,
harden not your hearts , as in the provocation ,
where your fathers tried me by proving me ,
wherefore i was displeased with this generation ,
as i sware in my wrath ,
take heed , brethren , lest haply there shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief , in falling away from the living god :
but exhort one another day by day , so long as it is called to-day ; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin :
for we are become partakers of christ , if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end :
while it is said ,
for who , when they heard , did provoke ? nay , did not all they that came out of egypt by moses ?
and with whom was he displeased forty years ? was it not with them that sinned , whose bodies fell in the wilderness ?
and to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest , but to them that were disobedient ?
and we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief .
for we who have believed do enter into that rest ; even as he hath said ,
for he hath said somewhere of the seventh day on this wise , and god rested on the seventh day from all his works ;
and in this place again ,
seeing therefore it remaineth that some should enter thereinto , and they to whom the good tidings were before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience ,
he again defineth a certain day , to-day , saying in david so long a time afterward ( even as hath been said before ) ,
for if joshua had given them rest , he would not have spoken afterward of another day .
there remaineth therefore a sabbath rest for the people of god .
for he that is entered into his rest hath himself also rested from his works , as god did from his .
let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest , that no man fall after the same example of disobedience .
having then a great high priest , who hath passed through the heavens , jesus the son of god , let us hold fast our confession .
who can bear gently with the ignorant and erring , for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity ;
and by reason thereof is bound , as for the people , so also for himself , to offer for sins .
and no man taketh the honor unto himself , but when he is called of god , even as was aaron .
so christ also glorified not himself to be made a high priest , but he that spake unto him ,
as he saith also in another place ,
though he was a son , yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered ;
and having been made perfect , he became unto all them that obey him the author of eternal salvation ;
named of god a high priest after the order of melchizedek .
of whom we have many things to say , and hard of interpretation , seeing ye are become dull of hearing .
for every one that partaketh of milk is without experience of the word of righteousness ; for he is a babe .
but solid food is for fullgrown men , even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil .
of the teaching of baptisms , and of laying on of hands , and of resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment .
and this will we do , if god permit .
for as touching those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift , and were made partakers of the holy spirit ,
and tasted the good word of god , and the powers of the age to come ,
but if it beareth thorns and thistles , it is rejected and nigh unto a curse ; whose end is to be burned .
but , beloved , we are persuaded better things of you , and things that accompany salvation , though we thus speak :
and we desire that each one of you may show the same diligence unto the fulness of hope even to the end :
that ye be not sluggish , but imitators of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises .
for when god made promise to abraham , since he could swear by none greater , he sware by himself ,
saying , surely blessing i will bless thee , and multiplying i will multiply thee .
and thus , having patiently endured , he obtained the promise .
for men swear by the greater : and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation .
wherein god , being minded to show more abundantly unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel , interposed with an oath ;
which we have as an anchor of the soul , a hope both sure and stedfast and entering into that which is within the veil ;
whither as a forerunner jesus entered for us , having become a high priest for ever after the order of melchizedek .
for this melchizedek , king of salem , priest of god most high , who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him ,
now consider how great this man was , unto whom abraham , the patriarch , gave a tenth out of the chief spoils .
but he whose genealogy is not counted from them hath taken tithes of abraham , and hath blessed him that hath the promises .
but without any dispute the less is blessed of the better .
and here men that die receive tithes ; but there one , of whom it is witnessed that he liveth .
and , so to say , through abraham even levi , who receiveth tithes , hath paid tithes ;
for he was yet in the loins of his father , when melchizedek met him .
for the priesthood being changed , there is made of necessity a change also of the law .
for he of whom these things are said belongeth to another tribe , from which no man hath given attendance at the altar .
for it is evident that our lord hath sprung out of judah ; as to which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priests .
and what we say is yet more abundantly evident , if after the likeness of melchizedek there ariseth another priest ,
who hath been made , not after the law of a carnal commandment , but after the power of an endless life :
for it is witnessed of him ,
for there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness
( for the law made nothing perfect ) , and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope , through which we draw nigh unto god .
and inasmuch as it is not without the taking of an oath
( for they indeed have been made priests without an oath ; but he with an oath by him that saith of him ,
by so much also hath jesus become the surety of a better covenant .
and they indeed have been made priests many in number , because that by death they are hindered from continuing :
but he , because he abideth for ever , hath his priesthood unchangeable .
wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that draw near unto god through him , seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them .
for such a high priest became us , holy , guileless , undefiled , separated from sinners , and made higher than the heavens ;
a minister of the sanctuary , and of the true tabernacle , which the lord pitched , not man .
for every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices : wherefore it is necessary that this high priest also have somewhat to offer .
now if he were on earth , he would not be a priest at all , seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law ;
for if that first covenant had been faultless , then would no place have been sought for a second .
for finding fault with them , he saith ,
not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers
for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel
and they shall not teach every man his fellow-citizen ,
for i will be merciful to their iniquities ,
now even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service , and its sanctuary , a sanctuary of this world .
for there was a tabernacle prepared , the first , wherein were the candlestick , and the table , and the showbread ; which is called the holy place .
and after the second veil , the tabernacle which is called the holy of holies ;
and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat ; of which things we can not now speak severally .
now these things having been thus prepared , the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle , accomplishing the services ;
the holy spirit this signifying , that the way into the holy place hath not yet been made manifest , while the first tabernacle is yet standing ;
being only ( with meats and drinks and divers washings ) carnal ordinances , imposed until a time of reformation .
for if the blood of goats and bulls , and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling them that have been defiled , sanctify unto the cleanness of the flesh :
for where a testament is , there must of necessity be the death of him that made it .
for a testament is of force where there hath been death : for it doth never avail while he that made it liveth .
wherefore even the first covenant hath not been dedicated without blood .
saying , this is the blood of the covenant which god commanded to you-ward .
moreover the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry he sprinkled in like manner with the blood .
and according to the law , i may almost say , all things are cleansed with blood , and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission .
it was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest entereth into the holy place year by year with blood not his own ;
and inasmuch as it is appointed unto men once to die , and after this cometh judgment ;
else would they not have ceased to be offered ? because the worshippers , having been once cleansed , would have had no more consciousness of sins .
but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance made of sins year by year .
for it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins .
wherefore when he cometh into the world , he saith ,
in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hadst no pleasure :
then said i , lo , i am come ( in the roll of the book it is written of me )
then hath he said , lo , i am come to do thy will . he taketh away the first , that he may establish the second .
by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all .
and every priest indeed standeth day by day ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices , the which can never take away sins :
but he , when he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever , sat down on the right hand of god ;
henceforth expecting till his enemies be made the footstool of his feet .
for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified .
and the holy spirit also beareth witness to us ; for after he hath said ,
this is the covenant that i will make with them
and their sins and their iniquities will i remember no more .
now where remission of these is , there is no more offering for sin .
having therefore , brethren , boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of jesus ,
by the way which he dedicated for us , a new and living way , through the veil , that is to say , his flesh ;
and having a great priest over the house of god ;
let us hold fast the confession of our hope that it waver not ; for he is faithful that promised :
and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works ;
for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth , there remaineth no more a sacrifice for sins ,
but a certain fearful expectation of judgment , and a fierceness of fire which shall devour the adversaries .
a man that hath set at nought moses ’ law dieth without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses :
for we know him that said , vengeance belongeth unto me , i will recompense . and again , the lord shall judge his people .
it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god .
but call to remembrance the former days , in which , after ye were enlightened , ye endured a great conflict of sufferings ;
partly , being made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions ; and partly , becoming partakers with them that were so used .
cast not away therefore your boldness , which hath great recompense of reward .
for ye have need of patience , that , having done the will of god , ye may receive the promise .
for yet a very little while ,
but my righteous one shall live by faith :
but we are not of them that shrink back unto perdition ; but of them that have faith unto the saving of the soul .
now faith is assurance of things hoped for , a conviction of things not seen .
for therein the elders had witness borne to them .
for he looked for the city which hath the foundations , whose builder and maker is god .
by faith even sarah herself received power to conceive seed when she was past age , since she counted him faithful who had promised :
for they that say such things make it manifest that they are seeking after a country of their own .
and if indeed they had been mindful of that country from which they went out , they would have had opportunity to return .
by faith abraham , being tried , offered up isaac : yea , he that had gladly received the promises was offering up his only begotten son ;
even he to whom it was said , in isaac shall thy seed be called :
accounting that god is able to raise up , even from the dead ; from whence he did also in a figure receive him back .
by faith isaac blessed jacob and esau , even concerning things to come .
by faith jacob , when he was dying , blessed each of the sons of joseph ; and worshipped , leaning upon the top of his staff .
by faith joseph , when his end was nigh , made mention of the departure of the children of israel ; and gave commandment concerning his bones .
by faith moses , when he was grown up , refused to be called the son of pharaoh ’ s daughter ;
choosing rather to share ill treatment with the people of god , than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season ;
accounting the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures of egypt : for he looked unto the recompense of reward .
by faith he forsook egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king : for he endured , as seeing him who is invisible .
by faith he kept the passover , and the sprinkling of the blood , that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them .
by faith they passed through the red sea as by dry land : which the egyptians assaying to do were swallowed up .
by faith the walls of jericho fell down , after they had been compassed about for seven days .
by faith rahab the harlot perished not with them that were disobedient , having received the spies with peace .
who through faith subdued kingdoms , wrought righteousness , obtained promises , stopped the mouths of lions ,
women received their dead by a resurrection : and others were tortured , not accepting their deliverance ; that they might obtain a better resurrection :
and others had trial of mockings and scourgings , yea , moreover of bonds and imprisonment :
( of whom the world was not worthy ) , wandering in deserts and mountains and caves , and the holes of the earth .
and these all , having had witness borne to them through their faith , received not the promise ,
god having provided some better thing concerning us , that apart from us they should not be made perfect .
for consider him that hath endured such gainsaying of sinners against himself , that ye wax not weary , fainting in your souls .
ye have not yet resisted unto blood , striving against sin :
and ye have forgotten the exhortation which reasoneth with you as with sons ,
for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth ,
it is for chastening that ye endure ; god dealeth with you as with sons ; for what son is there whom his father chasteneth not ?
but if ye are without chastening , whereof all have been made partakers , then are ye bastards , and not sons .
for they indeed for a few days chastened us as seemed good to them ; but he for our profit , that we may be partakers of his holiness .
wherefore lift up the hands that hang down , and the palsied knees ;
and make straight paths for your feet , that that which is lame be not turned out of the way , but rather be healed .
follow after peace with all men , and the sanctification without which no man shall see the lord :
lest there be any fornicator , or profane person , as esau , who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright .
for ye are not come unto a mount that might be touched , and that burned with fire , and unto blackness , and darkness , and tempest ,
and the sound of a trumpet , and the voice of words ; which voice they that heard entreated that no word more should be spoken unto them ;
for they could not endure that which was enjoined , if even a beast touch the mountain , it shall be stoned ;
and so fearful was the appearance , that moses said , i exceedingly fear and quake :
but ye are come unto mount zion , and unto the city of the living god , the heavenly jerusalem , and to innumerable hosts of angels ,
and to jesus the mediator of a new covenant , and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better than that of abel .
wherefore , receiving a kingdom that can not be shaken , let us have grace , whereby we may offer service well-pleasing to god with reverence and awe :
for our god is a consuming fire .
let love of the brethren continue .
forget not to show love unto strangers : for thereby some have entertained angels unawares .
remember them that are in bonds , as bound with them ; them that are ill-treated , as being yourselves also in the body .
let marriage be had in honor among all , and let the bed be undefiled : for fornicators and adulterers god will judge .
so that with good courage we say ,
jesus christ is the same yesterday and to-day , yea and for ever .
we have an altar , whereof they have no right to eat that serve the tabernacle .
for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin , are burned without the camp .
wherefore jesus also , that he might sanctify the people through his own blood , suffered without the gate .
let us therefore go forth unto him without the camp , bearing his reproach .
for we have not here an abiding city , but we seek after the city which is to come .
through him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to god continually , that is , the fruit of lips which make confession to his name .
but to do good and to communicate forget not : for with such sacrifices god is well pleased .
pray for us : for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience , desiring to live honorably in all things .
and i exhort you the more exceedingly to do this , that i may be restored to you the sooner .
but i exhort you , brethren , bear with the word of exhortation : for i have written unto you in few words .
know ye that our brother timothy hath been set at liberty ; with whom , if he come shortly , i will see you .
salute all them that have the rule over you , and all the saints . they of italy salute you .
grace be with you all . amen .
so he went and took gomer the daughter of diblaim ; and she conceived , and bare him a son .
and it shall come to pass at that day , that i will break the bow of israel in the valley of jezreel .
now when she had weaned lo-ruhamah , she conceived , and bare a son .
and jehovah said , call his name lo-ammi ; for ye are not my people , and i will not be your god .
say ye unto your brethren , ammi ; and to your sisters , ruhamah .
yea , upon her children will i have no mercy ; for they are children of whoredom ;
therefore , behold , i will hedge up thy way with thorns , and i will build a wall against her , that she shall not find her paths .
and now will i uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers , and none shall deliver her out of my hand .
i will also cause all her mirth to cease , her feasts , her new moons , and her sabbaths , and all her solemn assemblies .
therefore , behold , i will allure her , and bring her into the wilderness , and speak comfortably unto her .
and it shall be at that day , saith jehovah , that thou shalt call me ishi , and shalt call me no more baali .
for i will take away the names of the baalim out of her mouth , and they shall no more be mentioned by their name .
i will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness ; and thou shalt know jehovah .
and it shall come to pass in that day , i will answer , saith jehovah , i will answer the heavens , and they shall answer the earth ;
and the earth shall answer the grain , and the new wine , and the oil ; and they shall answer jezreel .
so i bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver , and a homer of barley , and a half-homer of barley ;
for the children of israel shall abide many days without king , and without prince , and without sacrifice , and without pillar , and without ephod or teraphim :
there is nought but swearing and breaking faith , and killing , and stealing , and committing adultery ; they break out , and blood toucheth blood .
yet let no man strive , neither let any man reprove ; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest .
and thou shalt stumble in the day , and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night ; and i will destroy thy mother .
as they were multiplied , so they sinned against me : i will change their glory into shame .
they feed on the sin of my people , and set their heart on their iniquity .
and it shall be , like people , like priest ; and i will punish them for their ways , and will requite them their doings .
whoredom and wine and new wine take away the understanding .
for israel hath behaved himself stubbornly , like a stubborn heifer : now will jehovah feed them as a lamb in a large place .
ephraim is joined to idols ; let him alone .
their drink is become sour ; they play the harlot continually ; her rulers dearly love shame .
the wind hath wrapped her up in its wings ; and they shall be put to shame because of their sacrifices .
and the revolters are gone deep in making slaughter ; but i am a rebuker of them all .
i know ephraim , and israel is not hid from me ; for now , o ephraim , thou hast played the harlot , israel is defiled .
their doings will not suffer them to turn unto their god ; for the spirit of whoredom is within them , and they know not jehovah .
and the pride of israel doth testify to his face : therefore israel and ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity ; judah also shall stumble with them .
they shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek jehovah ; but they shall not find him : he hath withdrawn himself from them .
they have dealt treacherously against jehovah ; for they have borne strange children : now shall the new moon devour them with their fields .
blow ye the cornet in gibeah , and the trumpet in ramah : sound an alarm at beth-aven ; behind thee , o benjamin .
ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke : among the tribes of israel have i made known that which shall surely be .
the princes of judah are like them that remove the landmark : i will pour out my wrath upon them like water .
ephraim is oppressed , he is crushed in judgment ; because he was content to walk after man ’ s command .
therefore am i unto ephraim as a moth , and to the house of judah as rottenness .
i will go and return to my place , till they acknowledge their offence , and seek my face : in their affliction they will seek me earnestly .
after two days will he revive us : on the third day he will raise us up , and we shall live before him .
for i desire goodness , and not sacrifice ; and the knowledge of god more than burnt-offerings .
but they like adam have transgressed the covenant : there have they dealt treacherously against me .
gilead is a city of them that work iniquity ; it is stained with blood .
and as troops of robbers wait for a man , so the company of priests murder in the way toward shechem ; yea , they have committed lewdness .
in the house of israel i have seen a horrible thing : there whoredom is found in ephraim , israel is defiled .
also , o judah , there is a harvest appointed for thee , when i bring back the captivity of my people .
and they consider not in their hearts that i remember all their wickedness : now have their own doings beset them about ; they are before my face .
they make the king glad with their wickedness , and the princes with their lies .
on the day of our king the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine ; he stretched out his hand with scoffers .
they are all hot as an oven , and devour their judges ; all their kings are fallen : there is none among them that calleth unto me .
ephraim , he mixeth himself among the peoples ; ephraim is a cake not turned .
strangers have devoured his strength , and he knoweth it not : yea , gray hairs are here and there upon him , and he knoweth it not .
and the pride of israel doth testify to his face : yet they have not returned unto jehovah their god , nor sought him , for all this .
and ephraim is like a silly dove , without understanding : they call unto egypt , they go to assyria .
though i have taught and strengthened their arms , yet do they devise mischief against me .
they shall cry unto me , my god , we israel know thee .
israel hath cast off that which is good : the enemy shall pursue him .
he hath cast off thy calf , o samaria ; mine anger is kindled against them : how long will it be ere they attain to innocency ?
for from israel is even this ; the workman made it , and it is no god ; yea , the calf of samaria shall be broken in pieces .
israel is swallowed up : now are they among the nations as a vessel wherein none delighteth .
for they are gone up to assyria , like a wild ass alone by himself : ephraim hath hired lovers .
because ephraim hath multiplied altars for sinning , altars have been unto him for sinning .
i wrote for him the ten thousand things of my law ; but they are counted as a strange thing .
the threshing-floor and the winepress shall not feed them , and the new wine shall fail her .
they shall not dwell in jehovah ’ s land ; but ephraim shall return to egypt , and they shall eat unclean food in assyria .
what will ye do in the day of solemn assembly , and in the day of the feast of jehovah ?
they have deeply corrupted themselves , as in the days of gibeah : he will remember their iniquity , he will visit their sins .
as for ephraim , their glory shall fly away like a bird : there shall be no birth , and none with child , and no conception .
ephraim , like as i have seen tyre , is planted in a pleasant place : but ephraim shall bring out his children to the slayer .
give them , o jehovah—what wilt thou give ? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts .
my god will cast them away , because they did not hearken unto him ; and they shall be wanderers among the nations .
their heart is divided ; now shall they be found guilty : he will smite their altars , he will destroy their pillars .
surely now shall they say , we have no king ; for we fear not jehovah ; and the king , what can he do for us ?
they speak vain words , swearing falsely in making covenants : therefore judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field .
it also shall be carried unto assyria for a present to king jareb : ephraim shall receive shame , and israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel .
as for samaria , her king is cut off , as foam upon the water .
o israel , thou hast sinned from the days of gibeah : there they stood ; the battle against the children of iniquity doth not overtake them in gibeah .
when it is my desire , i will chastise them ; and the peoples shall be gathered against them , when they are bound to their two transgressions .
so shall beth-el do unto you because of your great wickedness : at daybreak shall the king of israel be utterly cut off .
when israel was a child , then i loved him , and called my son out of egypt .
the more the prophets called them , the more they went from them : they sacrificed unto the baalim , and burned incense to graven images .
yet i taught ephraim to walk ; i took them on my arms ; but they knew not that i healed them .
they shall not return into the land of egypt ; but the assyrian shall be their king , because they refused to return to me .
and the sword shall fall upon their cities , and shall consume their bars , and devour them , because of their own counsels .
and my people are bent on backsliding from me : though they call them to him that is on high , none at all will exalt him .
they shall walk after jehovah , who will roar like a lion ; for he will roar , and the children shall come trembling from the west .
ephraim compasseth me about with falsehood , and the house of israel with deceit ; but judah yet ruleth with god , and is faithful with the holy one .
jehovah hath also a controversy with judah , and will punish jacob according to his ways ; according to his doings will he recompense him .
in the womb he took his brother by the heel ; and in his manhood he had power with god :
even jehovah , the god of hosts ; jehovah is his memorial name .
therefore turn thou to thy god : keep kindness and justice , and wait for thy god continually .
he is a trafficker , the balances of deceit are in his hand : he loveth to oppress .
i have also spoken unto the prophets , and i have multiplied visions ; and by the ministry of the prophets have i used similitudes .
is gilead iniquity ? they are altogether false ; in gilgal they sacrifice bullocks ; yea , their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the field .
and jacob fled into the field of aram , and israel served for a wife , and for a wife he kept sheep .
and by a prophet jehovah brought israel up out of egypt , and by a prophet was he preserved .
ephraim hath provoked to anger most bitterly : therefore shall his blood be left upon him , and his reproach shall his lord return unto him .
when ephraim spake , there was trembling ; he exalted himself in israel ; but when he offended in baal , he died .
yet i am jehovah thy god from the land of egypt ; and thou shalt know no god but me , and besides me there is no saviour .
i did know thee in the wilderness , in the land of great drought .
according to their pasture , so were they filled ; they were filled , and their heart was exalted : therefore have they forgotten me .
therefore am i unto them as a lion ; as a leopard will i watch by the way ;
it is thy destruction , o israel , that thou art against me , against thy help .
i have given thee a king in mine anger , and have taken him away in my wrath .
the iniquity of ephraim is bound up ; his sin is laid up in store .
o israel , return unto jehovah thy god ; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity .
i will heal their backsliding , i will love them freely ; for mine anger is turned away from him .
i will be as the dew unto israel ; he shall blossom as the lily , and cast forth his roots as lebanon .
his branches shall spread , and his beauty shall be as the olive-tree , and his smell as lebanon .
the ox knoweth his owner , and the ass his master ’ s crib ; but israel doth not know , my people doth not consider .
why will ye be still stricken , that ye revolt more and more ? the whole head is sick , and the whole heart faint .
and the daughter of zion is left as a booth in a vineyard , as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers , as a besieged city .
except jehovah of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant , we should have been as sodom , we should have been like unto gomorrah .
hear the word of jehovah , ye rulers of sodom ; give ear unto the law of our god , ye people of gomorrah .
when ye come to appear before me , who hath required this at your hand , to trample my courts ?
your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth ; they are a trouble unto me ; i am weary of bearing them .
wash you , make you clean ; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes ; cease to do evil ;
learn to do well ; seek justice , relieve the oppressed , judge the fatherless , plead for the widow .
if ye be willing and obedient , ye shall eat the good of the land :
but if ye refuse and rebel , ye shall be devoured with the sword ; for the mouth of jehovah hath spoken it .
how is the faithful city become a harlot ! she that was full of justice ! righteousness lodged in her , but now murderers .
thy silver is become dross , thy wine mixed with water .
and i will turn my hand upon thee , and thoroughly purge away thy dross , and will take away all thy tin ;
zion shall be redeemed with justice , and her converts with righteousness .
but the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together , and they that forsake jehovah shall be consumed .
for they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired , and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen .
for ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth , and as a garden that hath no water .
and the strong shall be as tow , and his work as a spark ; and they shall both burn together , and none shall quench them .
the word that isaiah the son of amoz saw concerning judah and jerusalem .
o house of jacob , come ye , and let us walk in the light of jehovah .
their land also is full of idols ; they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fingers have made .
and the mean man is bowed down , and the great man is brought low : therefore forgive them not .
enter into the rock , and hide thee in the dust , from before the terror of jehovah , and from the glory of his majesty .
the lofty looks of man shall be brought low , and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down , and jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day .
and upon all the cedars of lebanon , that are high and lifted up , and upon all the oaks of bashan ,
and upon all the high mountains , and upon all the hills that are lifted up ,
and upon every lofty tower , and upon every fortified wall ,
and upon all the ships of tarshish , and upon all pleasant imagery .
and the loftiness of man shall be bowed down , and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low ; and jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day .
and the idols shall utterly pass away .
cease ye from man , whose breath is in his nostrils ; for wherein is he to be accounted of ?
the mighty man , and the man of war ; the judge , and the prophet , and the diviner , and the elder ;
the captain of fifty , and the honorable man , and the counsellor , and the expert artificer , and the skilful enchanter .
and i will give children to be their princes , and babes shall rule over them .
for jerusalem is ruined , and judah is fallen ; because their tongue and their doings are against jehovah , to provoke the eyes of his glory .
say ye of the righteous , that it shall be well with him ; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings .
woe unto the wicked ! it shall be ill with him ; for what his hands have done shall be done unto him .
jehovah standeth up to contend , and standeth to judge the peoples .
what mean ye that ye crush my people , and grind the face of the poor ? saith the lord , jehovah of hosts .
therefore the lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of zion , and jehovah will lay bare their secret parts .
in that day the lord will take away the beauty of their anklets , and the cauls , and the crescents ;
the pendants , and the bracelets , and the mufflers ;
the headtires , and the ankle chains , and the sashes , and the perfume-boxes , and the amulets ;
the rings , and the nose-jewels ;
the festival robes , and the mantles , and the shawls , and the satchels ;
the hand-mirrors , and the fine linen , and the turbans , and the veils .
thy men shall fall by the sword , and thy mighty in the war .
and her gates shall lament and mourn ; and she shall be desolate and sit upon the ground .
and there shall be a pavilion for a shade in the day-time from the heat , and for a refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain .
let me sing for my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard . my wellbeloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill :
and now , o inhabitants of jerusalem and men of judah , judge , i pray you , betwixt me and my vineyard .
in mine ears saith jehovah of hosts , of a truth many houses shall be desolate , even great and fair , without inhabitant .
for ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath , and a homer of seed shall yield but an ephah .
woe unto them that rise up early in the morning , that they may follow strong drink ; that tarry late into the night , till wine inflame them !
therefore my people are gone into captivity for lack of knowledge ; and their honorable men are famished , and their multitude are parched with thirst .
and the mean man is bowed down , and the great man is humbled , and the eyes of the lofty are humbled :
but jehovah of hosts is exalted in justice , and god the holy one is sanctified in righteousness .
then shall the lambs feed as in their pasture , and the waste places of the fat ones shall wanderers eat .
woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of falsehood , and sin as it were with a cart rope ;
woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes , and prudent in their own sight !
woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine , and men of strength to mingle strong drink ;
that justify the wicked for a bribe , and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him !
whose arrows are sharp , and all their bows bent ; their horses ’ hoofs shall be accounted as flint , and their wheels as a whirlwind :
in the year that king uzziah died i saw the lord sitting upon a throne , high and lifted up ; and his train filled the temple .
and one cried unto another , and said , holy , holy , holy , is jehovah of hosts : the whole earth is full of his glory .
and the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him that cried , and the house was filled with smoke .
then flew one of the seraphim unto me , having a live coal in his hand , which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar :
and he said , go , and tell this people , hear ye indeed , but understand not ; and see ye indeed , but perceive not .
and jehovah have removed men far away , and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land .
because syria , ephraim , and the son of remaliah , have purposed evil against thee , saying ,
thus saith the lord jehovah , it shall not stand , neither shall it come to pass .
and jehovah spake again unto ahaz , saying ,
ask thee a sign of jehovah thy god ; ask it either in the depth , or in the height above .
but ahaz said , i will not ask , neither will i tempt jehovah .
therefore the lord himself will give you a sign : behold , a virgin shall conceive , and bear a son , and shall call his name immanuel .
butter and honey shall he eat , when he knoweth to refuse the evil , and choose the good .
for before the child shall know to refuse the evil , and choose the good , the land whose two kings thou abhorrest shall be forsaken .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that a man shall keep alive a young cow , and two sheep ;
with arrows and with bow shall one come thither , because all the land shall be briers and thorns .
and jehovah said unto me , take thee a great tablet , and write upon it with the pen of a man , for maher-shalal-hash-baz ;
and i will take unto me faithful witnesses to record , uriah the priest , and zechariah the son of jeberechiah .
and i went unto the prophetess ; and she conceived , and bare a son . then said jehovah unto me , call his name maher-shalal-hash-baz .
and jehovah spake unto me yet again , saying ,
forasmuch as this people have refused the waters of shiloah that go softly , and rejoice in rezin and remaliah ’ s son ;
take counsel together , and it shall be brought to nought ; speak the word , and it shall not stand : for god is with us .
for jehovah spake thus to me with a strong hand , and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people , saying ,
say ye not , a conspiracy , concerning all whereof this people shall say , a conspiracy ; neither fear ye their fear , nor be in dread thereof .
jehovah of hosts , him shall ye sanctify ; and let him be your fear , and let him be your dread .
and many shall stumble thereon , and fall , and be broken , and be snared , and be taken .
bind thou up the testimony , seal the law among my disciples .
and i will wait for jehovah , that hideth his face from the house of jacob , and i will look for him .
behold , i and the children whom jehovah hath given me are for signs and for wonders in israel from jehovah of hosts , who dwelleth in mount zion .
to the law and to the testimony ! if they speak not according to this word , surely there is no morning for them .
for the yoke of his burden , and the staff of his shoulder , the rod of his oppressor , thou hast broken as in the day of midian .
for all the armor of the armed man in the tumult , and the garments rolled in blood , shall be for burning , for fuel of fire .
the lord sent a word into jacob , and it hath lighted upon israel .
and all the people shall know , even ephraim and the inhabitant of samaria , that say in pride and in stoutness of heart ,
the bricks are fallen , but we will build with hewn stone ; the sycomores are cut down , but we will put cedars in their place .
therefore jehovah will set up on high against him the adversaries of rezin , and will stir up his enemies ,
yet the people have not turned unto him that smote them , neither have they sought jehovah of hosts .
therefore jehovah will cut off from israel head and tail , palm-branch and rush , in one day .
the elder and the honorable man , he is the head ; and the prophet that teacheth lies , he is the tail .
for they that lead this people cause them to err ; and they that are led of them are destroyed .
through the wrath of jehovah of hosts is the land burnt up ; and the people are as the fuel of fire : no man spareth his brother .
woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees , and to the writers that write perverseness ;
ho assyrian , the rod of mine anger , the staff in whose hand is mine indignation !
for he saith , are not my princes all of them kings ?
is not calno as carchemish ? is not hamath as arpad ? is not samaria as damascus ?
as my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols , whose graven images did excel them of jerusalem and of samaria ;
shall i not , as i have done unto samaria and her idols , so do to jerusalem and her idols ?
and the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few , so that a child may write them .
a remnant shall return , even the remnant of jacob , unto the mighty god .
for a full end , and that determined , will the lord , jehovah of hosts , make in the midst of all the earth .
for yet a very little while , and the indignation against thee shall be accomplished , and mine anger shall be directed to his destruction .
he is come to aiath , he is passed through migron ; at michmash he layeth up his baggage ;
they are gone over the pass ; they have taken up their lodging at geba ; ramah trembleth ; gibeah of saul is fled .
cry aloud with thy voice , o daughter of gallim ! hearken , o laishah ! o thou poor anathoth !
madmenah is a fugitive ; the inhabitants of gebim flee for safety .
this very day shall he halt at nob : he shaketh his hand at the mount of the daughter of zion , the hill of jerusalem .
and he will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron , and lebanon shall fall by a mighty one .
and there shall come forth a shoot out of the stock of jesse , and a branch out of his roots shall bear fruit .
and righteousness shall be the girdle of his waist , and faithfulness the girdle of his loins .
and the cow and the bear shall feed ; their young ones shall lie down together ; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox .
and the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp , and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder ’ s den .
therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation .
sing unto jehovah ; for he hath done excellent things : let this be known in all the earth .
cry aloud and shout , thou inhabitant of zion ; for great in the midst of thee is the holy one of israel .
the burden of babylon , which isaiah the son of amoz did see .
i have commanded my consecrated ones , yea , i have called my mighty men for mine anger , even my proudly exulting ones .
they come from a far country , from the uttermost part of heaven , even jehovah , and the weapons of his indignation , to destroy the whole land .
wail ye ; for the day of jehovah is at hand ; as destruction from the almighty shall it come .
therefore shall all hands be feeble , and every heart of man shall melt :
i will make a man more rare than fine gold , even a man than the pure gold of ophir .
every one that is found shall be thrust through ; and every one that is taken shall fall by the sword .
their infants also shall be dashed in pieces before their eyes ; their houses shall be rifled , and their wives ravished .
behold , i will stir up the medes against them , who shall not regard silver , and as for gold , they shall not delight in it .
and babylon , the glory of kingdoms , the beauty of the chaldeans ’ pride , shall be as when god overthrew sodom and gomorrah .
that thou shalt take up this parable against the king of babylon , and say , how hath the oppressor ceased ! the golden city ceased !
jehovah hath broken the staff of the wicked , the sceptre of the rulers ;
that smote the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke , that ruled the nations in anger , with a persecution that none restrained .
the whole earth is at rest , and is quiet : they break forth into singing .
yea , the fir-trees rejoice at thee , and the cedars of lebanon , saying , since thou art laid low , no hewer is come up against us .
all they shall answer and say unto thee , art thou also become weak as we ? art thou become like unto us ?
thy pomp is brought down to sheol , and the noise of thy viols : the worm is spread under thee , and worms cover thee .
i will ascend above the heights of the clouds ; i will make myself like the most high .
yet thou shalt be brought down to sheol , to the uttermost parts of the pit .
that made the world as a wilderness , and overthrew the cities thereof ; that let not loose his prisoners to their home ?
all the kings of the nations , all of them , sleep in glory , every one in his own house .
this is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth ; and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations .
for jehovah of hosts hath purposed , and who shall annul it ? and his hand is stretched out , and who shall turn it back ?
in the year that king ahaz died was this burden .
what then shall one answer the messengers of the nation ? that jehovah hath founded zion , and in her shall the afflicted of his people take refuge .
the burden of moab .
in their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth ; on their housetops , and in their broad places , every one waileth , weeping abundantly .
for the waters of nimrim shall be desolate ; for the grass is withered away , the tender grass faileth , there is no green thing .
therefore the abundance they have gotten , and that which they have laid up , shall they carry away over the brook of the willows .
for the cry is gone round about the borders of moab ; the wailing thereof unto eglaim , and the wailing thereof unto beer-elim .
send ye the lambs for the ruler of the land from selah to the wilderness , unto the mount of the daughter of zion .
for it shall be that , as wandering birds , as a scattered nest , so shall the daughters of moab be at the fords of the arnon .
give counsel , execute justice ; make thy shade as the night in the midst of the noonday ; hide the outcasts ; betray not the fugitive .
therefore shall moab wail for moab , every one shall wail : for the raisin-cakes of kir-hareseth shall ye mourn , utterly stricken .
wherefore my heart soundeth like a harp for moab , and mine inward parts for kir-heres .
this is the word that jehovah spake concerning moab in time past .
the burden of damascus .
the cities of aroer are forsaken ; they shall be for flocks , which shall lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the glory of jacob shall be made thin , and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean .
in that day shall men look unto their maker , and their eyes shall have respect to the holy one of israel .
ah , the land of the rustling of wings , which is beyond the rivers of ethiopia ;
the burden of egypt .
and the waters shall fail from the sea , and the river shall be wasted and become dry .
and the rivers shall become foul ; the streams of egypt shall be diminished and dried up ; the reeds and flags shall wither away .
and the fishers shall lament , and all they that cast angle into the nile shall mourn , and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish .
moreover they that work in combed flax , and they that weave white cloth , shall be confounded .
and the pillars of egypt shall be broken in pieces ; all they that work for hire shall be grieved in soul .
where then are thy wise men ? and let them tell thee now ; and let them know what jehovah of hosts hath purposed concerning egypt .
neither shall there be for egypt any work , which head or tail , palm-branch or rush , may do .
in that day shall there be an altar to jehovah in the midst of the land of egypt , and a pillar at the border thereof to jehovah .
and jehovah will smite egypt , smiting and healing ; and they shall return unto jehovah , and he will be entreated of them , and will heal them .
in that day shall israel be the third with egypt and with assyria , a blessing in the midst of the earth ;
for that jehovah of hosts hath blessed them , saying , blessed be egypt my people , and assyria the work of my hands , and israel mine inheritance .
in the year that tartan came unto ashdod , when sargon the king of assyria sent him , and he fought against ashdod and took it ;
and jehovah said , like as my servant isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder concerning egypt and concerning ethiopia ;
and they shall be dismayed and confounded , because of ethiopia their expectation , and of egypt their glory .
the burden of the wilderness of the sea .
my heart fluttereth , horror hath affrighted me ; the twilight that i desired hath been turned into trembling unto me .
they prepare the table , they set the watch , they eat , they drink : rise up , ye princes , anoint the shield .
for thus hath the lord said unto me , go , set a watchman ; let him declare what he seeth :
and when he seeth a troop , horsemen in pairs , a troop of asses , a troop of camels , he shall hearken diligently with much heed .
and he cried as a lion : o lord , i stand continually upon the watch-tower in the day-time , and am set in my ward whole nights ;
the burden of dumah .
the watchman said , the morning cometh , and also the night : if ye will inquire , inquire ye : turn ye , come .
the burden upon arabia .
unto him that was thirsty they brought water ; the inhabitants of the land of tema did meet the fugitives with their bread .
for they fled away from the swords , from the drawn sword , and from the bent bow , and from the grievousness of war .
for thus hath the lord said unto me , within a year , according to the years of a hireling , all the glory of kedar shall fail ;
the burden of the valley of vision .
all thy rulers fled away together , they were bound by the archers ; all that were found of thee were bound together ; they fled afar off .
therefore said i , look away from me , i will weep bitterly ; labor not to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people .
and elam bare the quiver , with chariots of men and horsemen ; and kir uncovered the shield .
and it came to pass , that thy choicest valleys were full of chariots , and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate .
and he took away the covering of judah ; and thou didst look in that day to the armor in the house of the forest .
and ye saw the breaches of the city of david , that they were many ; and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool ;
and ye numbered the houses of jerusalem , and ye brake down the houses to fortify the wall ;
and in that day did the lord , jehovah of hosts , call to weeping , and to mourning , and to baldness , and to girding with sackcloth :
and jehovah of hosts revealed himself in mine ears , surely this iniquity shall not be forgiven you till ye die , saith the lord , jehovah of hosts .
thus saith the lord , jehovah of hosts , go , get thee unto this treasurer , even unto shebna , who is over the house , and say ,
behold , jehovah , like a strong man , will hurl thee away violently ; yea , he will wrap thee up closely .
and i will thrust thee from thine office ; and from thy station shalt thou be pulled down .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that i will call my servant eliakim the son of hilkiah :
and i will fasten him as a nail in a sure place ; and he shall be for a throne of glory to his father ’ s house .
the burden of tyre .
be still , ye inhabitants of the coast , thou whom the merchants of sidon , that pass over the sea , have replenished .
and on great waters the seed of the shihor , the harvest of the nile , was her revenue ; and she was the mart of nations .
when the report cometh to egypt , they shall be sorely pained at the report of tyre .
pass ye over to tarshish ; wail , ye inhabitants of the coast .
is this your joyous city , whose antiquity is of ancient days , whose feet carried her afar off to sojourn ?
who hath purposed this against tyre , the bestower of crowns , whose merchants are princes , whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth ?
jehovah of hosts hath purposed it , to stain the pride of all glory , to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth .
pass through thy land as the nile , o daughter of tarshish ; there is no restraint any more .
he hath stretched out his hand over the sea , he hath shaken the kingdoms : jehovah hath given commandment concerning canaan , to destroy the strongholds thereof .
howl , ye ships of tarshish ; for your stronghold is laid waste .
take a harp , go about the city , thou harlot that hast been forgotten ; make sweet melody , sing many songs , that thou mayest be remembered .
behold , jehovah maketh the earth empty , and maketh it waste , and turneth it upside down , and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof .
the earth shall be utterly emptied , and utterly laid waste ; for jehovah hath spoken this word .
the earth mourneth and fadeth away , the world languisheth and fadeth away , the lofty people of the earth do languish .
the earth also is polluted under the inhabitants thereof ; because they have transgressed the laws , violated the statutes , broken the everlasting covenant .
the new wine mourneth , the vine languisheth , all the merry-hearted do sigh .
the mirth of tabrets ceaseth , the noise of them that rejoice endeth , the joy of the harp ceaseth .
they shall not drink wine with a song ; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it .
the waste city is broken down ; every house is shut up , that no man may come in .
there is a crying in the streets because of the wine ; all joy is darkened , the mirth of the land is gone .
in the city is left desolation , and the gate is smitten with destruction .
these shall lift up their voice , they shall shout ; for the majesty of jehovah they cry aloud from the sea .
wherefore glorify ye jehovah in the east , even the name of jehovah , the god of israel , in the isles of the sea .
from the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs : glory to the righteous .
fear , and the pit , and the snare , are upon thee , o inhabitant of the earth .
the earth is utterly broken , the earth is rent asunder , the earth is shaken violently .
therefore shall a strong people glorify thee ; a city of terrible nations shall fear thee .
and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering that covereth all peoples , and the veil that is spread over all nations .
and the high fortress of thy walls hath he brought down , laid low , and brought to the ground , even to the dust .
in that day shall this song be sung in the land of judah : we have a strong city ; salvation will he appoint for walls and bulwarks .
open ye the gates , that the righteous nation which keepeth faith may enter in .
thou wilt keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on thee ; because he trusteth in thee .
trust ye in jehovah for ever ; for in jehovah , even jehovah , is an everlasting rock .
the foot shall tread it down ; even the feet of the poor , and the steps of the needy .
the way of the just is uprightness : thou that art upright dost direct the path of the just .
jehovah , thou wilt ordain peace for us ; for thou hast also wrought all our works for us .
o jehovah our god , other lords besides thee have had dominion over us ; but by thee only will we make mention of thy name .
thou hast increased the nation , o jehovah , thou hast increased the nation ; thou art glorified ; thou hast enlarged all the borders of the land .
jehovah , in trouble have they visited thee ; they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them .
in that day : a vineyard of wine , sing ye unto it .
i jehovah am its keeper ; i will water it every moment : lest any hurt it , i will keep it night and day .
wrath is not in me : would that the briers and thorns were against me in battle ! i would march upon them , i would burn them together .
or else let him take hold of my strength , that he may make peace with me ; yea , let him make peace with me .
in days to come shall jacob take root ; israel shall blossom and bud ; and they shall fill the face of the world with fruit .
hath he smitten them as he smote those that smote them ? or are they slain according to the slaughter of them that were slain by them ?
the crown of pride of the drunkards of ephraim shall be trodden under foot :
in that day will jehovah of hosts become a crown of glory , and a diadem of beauty , unto the residue of his people ;
and a spirit of justice to him that sitteth in judgment , and strength to them that turn back the battle at the gate .
for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness , so that there is no place clean .
whom will he teach knowledge ? and whom will he make to understand the message ? them that are weaned from the milk , and drawn from the breasts ?
for it is precept upon precept , precept upon precept ; line upon line , line upon line ; here a little , there a little .
nay , but by men of strange lips and with another tongue will he speak to this people ;
wherefore hear the word of jehovah , ye scoffers , that rule this people that is in jerusalem :
for the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it ; and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it .
give ye ear , and hear my voice ; hearken , and hear my speech .
doth he that ploweth to sow plow continually ? doth he continually open and harrow his ground ?
for his god doth instruct him aright , and doth teach him .
this also cometh forth from jehovah of hosts , who is wonderful in counsel , and excellent in wisdom .
ho ariel , ariel , the city where david encamped ! add ye year to year ; let the feasts come round :
then will i distress ariel , and there shall be mourning and lamentation ; and she shall be unto me as ariel .
and i will encamp against thee round about , and will lay siege against thee with posted troops , and i will raise siege works against thee .
tarry ye and wonder ; take your pleasure and be blind : they are drunken , but not with wine ; they stagger , but not with strong drink .
and the book is delivered to him that is not learned , saying , read this , i pray thee ; and he saith , i am not learned .
is it not yet a very little while , and lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest ?
and in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book , and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness .
the meek also shall increase their joy in jehovah , and the poor among men shall rejoice in the holy one of israel .
for the terrible one is brought to nought , and the scoffer ceaseth , and all they that watch for iniquity are cut off ;
therefore thus saith jehovah , who redeemed abraham , concerning the house of jacob : jacob shall not now be ashamed , neither shall his face now wax pale .
they also that err in spirit shall come to understanding , and they that murmur shall receive instruction .
therefore shall the strength of pharaoh be your shame , and the refuge in the shadow of egypt your confusion .
for their princes are at zoan , and their ambassadors are come to hanes .
the burden of the beasts of the south .
for egypt helpeth in vain , and to no purpose : therefore have i called her rahab that sitteth still .
for it is a rebellious people , lying children , children that will not hear the law of jehovah ;
that say to the seers , see not ; and to the prophets , prophesy not unto us right things , speak unto us smooth things , prophesy deceits ,
get you out of the way , turn aside out of the path , cause the holy one of israel to cease from before us .
wherefore thus saith the holy one of israel , because ye despise this word , and trust in oppression and perverseness , and rely thereon ;
therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall , swelling out in a high wall , whose breaking cometh suddenly in an instant .
the oxen likewise and the young asses that till the ground shall eat savory provender , which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork .
for through the voice of jehovah shall the assyrian be dismayed ; with his rod will he smite him .
as birds hovering , so will jehovah of hosts protect jerusalem ; he will protect and deliver it , he will pass over and preserve it .
turn ye unto him from whom ye have deeply revolted , o children of israel .
behold , a king shall reign in righteousness , and princes shall rule in justice .
and the eyes of them that see shall not be dim , and the ears of them that hear shall hearken .
and the heart of the rash shall understand knowledge , and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly .
the fool shall be no more called noble , nor the churl said to be bountiful .
and the instruments of the churl are evil : he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the meek with lying words , even when the needy speaketh right .
but the noble deviseth noble things ; and in noble things shall he continue .
rise up , ye women that are at ease , and hear my voice ; ye careless daughters , give ear unto my speech .
for days beyond a year shall ye be troubled , ye careless women ; for the vintage shall fail , the ingathering shall not come .
they shall smite upon the breasts for the pleasant fields , for the fruitful vine .
upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers ; yea , upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city .
until the spirit be poured upon us from on high , and the wilderness become a fruitful field , and the fruitful field be esteemed as a forest .
then justice shall dwell in the wilderness ; and righteousness shall abide in the fruitful field .
and the work of righteousness shall be peace ; and the effect of righteousness , quietness and confidence for ever .
and my people shall abide in a peaceable habitation , and in safe dwellings , and in quiet resting-places .
but it shall hail in the downfall of the forest ; and the city shall be utterly laid low .
blessed are ye that sow beside all waters , that send forth the feet of the ox and the ass .
o jehovah , be gracious unto us ; we have waited for thee : be thou our arm every morning , our salvation also in the time of trouble .
at the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled ; at the lifting up of thyself the nations are scattered .
and your spoil shall be gathered as the caterpillar gathereth : as locusts leap shall men leap upon it .
jehovah is exalted ; for he dwelleth on high : he hath filled zion with justice and righteousness .
and there shall be stability in thy times , abundance of salvation , wisdom , and knowledge : the fear of jehovah is thy treasure .
behold , their valiant ones cry without ; the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly .
the highways lie waste , the wayfaring man ceaseth : the enemy hath broken the covenant , he hath despised the cities , he regardeth not man .
the land mourneth and languisheth ; lebanon is confounded and withereth away ; sharon is like a desert ; and bashan and carmel shake off their leaves .
now will i arise , saith jehovah ; now will i lift up myself ; now will i be exalted .
ye shall conceive chaff , ye shall bring forth stubble : your breath is a fire that shall devour you .
and the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime , as thorns cut down , that are burned in the fire .
hear , ye that are far off , what i have done ; and , ye that are near , acknowledge my might .
he shall dwell on high ; his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks ; his bread shall be given him ; his waters shall be sure .
thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty : they shall behold a land that reacheth afar .
thy heart shall muse on the terror : where is he that counted , where is he that weighed the tribute ? where is he that counted the towers ?
thou shalt not see the fierce people , a people of a deep speech that thou canst not comprehend , of a strange tongue that thou canst not understand .
for jehovah is our judge , jehovah is our lawgiver , jehovah is our king ; he will save us .
and the inhabitant shall not say , i am sick : the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity .
for jehovah hath indignation against all the nations , and wrath against all their host : he hath utterly destroyed them , he hath delivered them to the slaughter .
their slain also shall be cast out , and the stench of their dead bodies shall come up ; and the mountains shall be melted with their blood .
for my sword hath drunk its fill in heaven : behold , it shall come down upon edom , and upon the people of my curse , to judgment .
for jehovah hath a day of vengeance , a year of recompense for the cause of zion .
and the streams of edom shall be turned into pitch , and the dust thereof into brimstone , and the land thereof shall become burning pitch .
they shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom , but none shall be there ; and all its princes shall be nothing .
the wilderness and the dry land shall be glad ; and the desert shall rejoice , and blossom as the rose .
strengthen ye the weak hands , and confirm the feeble knees .
then the eyes of the blind shall be opened , and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped .
no lion shall be there , nor shall any ravenous beast go up thereon ; they shall not be found there ; but the redeemed shall walk there :
i say , thy counsel and strength for the war are but vain words : now on whom dost thou trust , that thou hast rebelled against me ?
and am i now come up without jehovah against this land to destroy it ? jehovah said unto me , go up against this land , and destroy it .
thus saith the king , let not hezekiah deceive you ; for he will not be able to deliver you :
until i come and take you away to a land like your own land , a land of grain and new wine , a land of bread and vineyards .
where are the gods of hamath and arpad ? where are the gods of sepharvaim ? and have they delivered samaria out of my hand ?
but they held their peace , and answered him not a word ; for the king ’ s commandment was , saying , answer him not .
so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah .
so rabshakeh returned , and found the king of assyria warring against libnah ; for he had heard that he was departed from lachish .
behold , thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done to all lands , by destroying them utterly : and shalt thou be delivered ?
where is the king of hamath , and the king of arpad , and the king of the city of sepharvaim , of hena , and ivvah ?
and hezekiah prayed unto jehovah , saying ,
of a truth , jehovah , the kings of assyria have laid waste all the countries , and their land ,
i have digged and drunk water , and with the sole of my feet will i dry up all the rivers of egypt .
but i know thy sitting down , and thy going out , and thy coming in , and thy raging against me .
and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall again take root downward , and bear fruit upward .
for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant , and out of mount zion they that shall escape . the zeal of jehovah of hosts will perform this .
by the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and he shall not come unto this city , saith jehovah .
for i will defend this city to save it , for mine own sake , and for my servant david ’ s sake .
so sennacherib king of assyria departed , and went and returned , and dwelt at nineveh .
then hezekiah turned his face to the wall , and prayed unto jehovah ,
then came the word of jehovah to isaiah , saying ,
and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria ; and i will defend this city .
and this shall be the sign unto thee from jehovah , that jehovah will do this thing that he hath spoken :
the writing of hezekiah king of judah , when he had been sick , and was recovered of his sickness .
i said , in the noontide of my days i shall go into the gates of sheol :
i said , i shall not see jehovah , even jehovah in the land of the living :
my dwelling is removed , and is carried away from me as a shepherd ’ s tent :
i quieted myself until morning ; as a lion , so he breaketh all my bones :
like a swallow or a crane , so did i chatter ;
what shall i say ? he hath both spoken unto me , and himself hath done it :
o lord , by these things men live ;
behold , it was for my peace that i had great bitterness :
for sheol can not praise thee , death can not celebrate thee :
the living , the living , he shall praise thee , as i do this day :
jehovah is ready to save me :
now isaiah had said , let them take a cake of figs , and lay it for a plaster upon the boil , and he shall recover .
hezekiah also had said , what is the sign that i shall go up to the house of jehovah ?
then said isaiah to hezekiah , hear the word of jehovah of hosts :
comfort ye , comfort ye my people , saith your god .
the voice of one that crieth , prepare ye in the wilderness the way of jehovah ; make level in the desert a highway for our god .
and the glory of jehovah shall be revealed , and all flesh shall see it together ; for the mouth of jehovah hath spoken it .
the grass withereth , the flower fadeth , because the breath of jehovah bloweth upon it ; surely the people is grass .
the grass withereth , the flower fadeth ; but the word of our god shall stand forever .
who hath directed the spirit of jehovah , or being his counsellor hath taught him ?
and lebanon is not sufficient to burn , nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt-offering .
all the nations are as nothing before him ; they are accounted by him as less than nothing , and vanity .
to whom then will ye liken god ? or what likeness will ye compare unto him ?
the image , a workman hath cast it , and the goldsmith overlayeth it with gold , and casteth for it silver chains .
that bringeth princes to nothing ; that maketh the judges of the earth as vanity .
to whom then will ye liken me , that i should be equal to him ? saith the holy one .
he giveth power to the faint ; and to him that hath no might he increaseth strength .
even the youths shall faint and be weary , and the young men shall utterly fall :
he pursueth them , and passeth on safely , even by a way that he had not gone with his feet .
who hath wrought and done it , calling the generations from the beginning ? i , jehovah , the first , and with the last , i am he .
the isles have seen , and fear ; the ends of the earth tremble ; they draw near , and come .
they help every one his neighbor ; and every one saith to his brother , be of good courage .
but thou , israel , my servant , jacob whom i have chosen , the seed of abraham my friend ,
for i , jehovah thy god , will hold thy right hand , saying unto thee , fear not ; i will help thee .
produce your cause , saith jehovah ; bring forth your strong reasons , saith the king of jacob .
behold , ye are of nothing , and your work is of nought ; an abomination is he that chooseth you .
i am the first that saith unto zion , behold , behold them ; and i will give to jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings .
behold , all of them , their works are vanity and nought ; their molten images are wind and confusion .
he will not cry , nor lift up his voice , nor cause it to be heard in the street .
a bruised reed will he not break , and a dimly burning wick will he not quench : he will bring forth justice in truth .
he will not fail nor be discouraged , till he have set justice in the earth ; and the isles shall wait for his law .
to open the blind eyes , to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon , and them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house .
i am jehovah , that is my name ; and my glory will i not give to another , neither my praise unto graven images .
behold , the former things are come to pass , and new things do i declare ; before they spring forth i tell you of them .
let them give glory unto jehovah , and declare his praise in the islands .
i will lay waste mountains and hills , and dry up all their herbs ; and i will make the rivers islands , and will dry up the pools .
hear , ye deaf ; and look , ye blind , that ye may see .
thou seest many things , but thou observest not ; his ears are open , but he heareth not .
it pleased jehovah , for his righteousness ’ sake , to magnify the law , and make it honorable .
who is there among you that will give ear to this ? that will hearken and hear for the time to come ?
fear not ; for i am with thee : i will bring thy seed from the east , and gather thee from the west ;
every one that is called by my name , and whom i have created for my glory , whom i have formed , yea , whom i have made .
bring forth the blind people that have eyes , and the deaf that have ears .
i , even i , am jehovah ; and besides me there is no saviour .
i am jehovah , your holy one , the creator of israel , your king .
thus saith jehovah , who maketh a way in the sea , and a path in the mighty waters ;
remember ye not the former things , neither consider the things of old .
the people which i formed for myself , that they might set forth my praise .
yet thou hast not called upon me , o jacob ; but thou hast been weary of me , o israel .
i , even i , am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake ; and i will not remember thy sins .
put me in remembrance ; let us plead together : set thou forth thy cause , that thou mayest be justified .
thy first father sinned , and thy teachers have transgressed against me .
therefore i will profane the princes of the sanctuary ; and i will make jacob a curse , and israel a reviling .
yet now hear , o jacob my servant , and israel , who i have chosen :
and they shall spring up among the grass , as willows by the watercourses .
who hath fashioned a god , or molten an image that is profitable for nothing ?
that frustrateth the signs of the liars , and maketh diviners mad ; that turneth wise men backward , and maketh their knowledge foolish ;
that saith to the deep , be dry , and i will dry up thy rivers ;
i am jehovah , and there is none else ; besides me there is no god . i will gird thee , though thou hast not known me ;
i form the light , and create darkness ; i make peace , and create evil ; i am jehovah , that doeth all these things .
woe unto him that saith unto a father , what begettest thou ? or to a woman , with what travailest thou ?
verily thou art a god that hidest thyself , o god of israel , the saviour .
they shall be put to shame , yea , confounded , all of them ; they shall go into confusion together that are makers of idols .
but israel shall be saved by jehovah with an everlasting salvation : ye shall not be put to shame nor confounded world without end .
look unto me , and be ye saved , all the ends of the earth ; for i am god , and there is none else .
in jehovah shall all the seed of israel be justified , and shall glory .
they stoop , they bow down together ; they could not deliver the burden , but themselves are gone into captivity .
to whom will ye liken me , and make me equal , and compare me , that we may be like ?
remember this , and show yourselves men ; bring it again to mind , o ye transgressors .
remember the former things of old : for i am god , and there is none else ; i am god , and there is none like me ;
hearken unto me , ye stout-hearted , that are far from righteousness :
take the millstones , and grind meal ; remove thy veil , strip off the train , uncover the leg , pass through the rivers .
thy nakedness shall be uncovered , yea , thy shame shall be seen : i will take vengeance , and will spare no man .
our redeemer , jehovah of hosts is his name , the holy one of israel .
sit thou silent , and get thee into darkness , o daughter of the chaldeans ; for thou shalt no more be called the mistress of kingdoms .
( for they call themselves of the holy city , and stay themselves upon the god of israel ; jehovah of hosts is his name ) :
because i knew that thou art obstinate , and thy neck is an iron sinew , and thy brow brass ;
for my name ’ s sake will i defer mine anger , and for my praise will i refrain for thee , that i cut thee not off .
behold , i have refined thee , but not as silver ; i have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction .
hearken unto me , o jacob , and israel my called : i am he ; i am the first , i also am the last .
i , even i , have spoken ; yea , i have called him ; i have brought him , and he shall make his way prosperous .
oh that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments ! then had thy peace been as a river , and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea :
there is no peace , saith jehovah , to the wicked .
and he said unto me , thou art my servant ; israel , in whom i will be glorified .
and i will make all my mountains a way , and my highways shall be exalted .
lo , these shall come from far ; and , lo , these from the north and from the west ; and these from the land of sinim .
but zion said , jehovah hath forsaken me , and the lord hath forgotten me .
behold , i have graven thee upon the palms of my hands ; thy walls are continually before me .
thy children make haste ; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth from thee .
the children of thy bereavement shall yet say in thine ears , the place is too strait for me ; give place to me that i may dwell .
shall the prey be taken from the mighty , or the lawful captives be delivered ?
i clothe the heavens with blackness , and i make sackcloth their covering .
the lord jehovah hath opened mine ear , and i was not rebellious , neither turned away backward .
i gave my back to the smiters , and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair ; i hid not my face from shame and spitting .
the captive exile shall speedily be loosed ; and he shall not die and go down into the pit , neither shall his bread fail .
for i am jehovah thy god , who stirreth up the sea , so that the waves thereof roar : jehovah of hosts is his name .
these two things are befallen thee , who shall bemoan thee ? desolation and destruction , and the famine and the sword ; how shall i comfort thee ?
therefore hear now this , thou afflicted , and drunken , but not with wine :
for thus saith jehovah , ye were sold for nought ; and ye shall be redeemed without money .
for thus saith the lord jehovah , my people went down at the first into egypt to sojourn there : and the assyrian hath oppressed them without cause .
therefore my people shall know my name : therefore they shall know in that day that i am he that doth speak ; behold , it is i .
break forth into joy , sing together , ye waste places of jerusalem ; for jehovah hath comforted his people , he hath redeemed jerusalem .
jehovah hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our god .
behold , my servant shall deal wisely , he shall be exalted and lifted up , and shall be very high .
like as many were astonished at thee ( his visage was so marred more than any man , and his form more than the sons of men ) ,
who hath believed our message ? and to whom hath the arm of jehovah been revealed ?
surely he hath borne our griefs , and carried our sorrows ; yet we did esteem him stricken , smitten of god , and afflicted .
all we like sheep have gone astray ; we have turned every one to his own way ; and jehovah hath laid on him the iniquity of us all .
enlarge the place of thy tent , and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations ; spare not : lengthen thy cords , and strengthen thy stakes .
for jehovah hath called thee as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit , even a wife of youth , when she is cast off , saith thy god .
for a small moment have i forsaken thee ; but with great mercies will i gather thee .
in overflowing wrath i hid my face from thee for a moment ; but with everlasting lovingkindness will i have mercy on thee , saith jehovah thy redeemer .
o thou afflicted , tossed with tempest , and not comforted , behold , i will set thy stones in fair colors , and lay thy foundations with sapphires .
and i will make thy pinnacles of rubies , and thy gates of carbuncles , and all thy border of precious stones .
and all thy children shall be taught of jehovah ; and great shall be the peace of thy children .
behold , they may gather together , but not by me : whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall because of thee .
behold , i have given him for a witness to the peoples , a leader and commander to the peoples .
seek ye jehovah while he may be found ; call ye upon him while he is near :
for my thoughts are not your thoughts , neither are your ways my ways , saith jehovah .
for as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are my ways higher than your ways , and my thoughts than your thoughts .
thus saith jehovah , keep ye justice , and do righteousness ; for my salvation is near to come , and my righteousness to be revealed .
for thus saith jehovah of the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths , and choose the things that please me , and hold fast my covenant :
the lord jehovah , who gathereth the outcasts of israel , saith , yet will i gather others to him , besides his own that are gathered .
all ye beasts of the field , come to devour , yea , all ye beasts in the forest .
he entereth into peace ; they rest in their beds , each one that walketh in his uprightness .
but draw near hither , ye sons of the sorceress , the seed of the adulterer and the harlot .
ye that inflame yourselves among the oaks , under every green tree ; that slay the children in the valleys , under the clefts of the rocks ?
upon a high and lofty mountain hast thou set thy bed ; thither also wentest thou up to offer sacrifice .
i will declare thy righteousness ; and as for thy works , they shall not profit thee .
and he will say , cast ye up , cast ye up , prepare the way , take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people .
i have seen his ways , and will heal him : i will lead him also , and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners .
but the wicked are like the troubled sea ; for it can not rest , and its waters cast up mire and dirt .
there is no peace , saith my god , to the wicked .
then shalt thou call , and jehovah will answer ; thou shalt cry , and he will say , here i am .
behold , jehovah ’ s hand is not shortened , that it can not save ; neither his ear heavy , that it can not hear :
but your iniquities have separated between you and your god , and your sins have hid his face from you , so that he will not hear .
for your hands are defiled with blood , and your fingers with iniquity ; your lips have spoken lies , your tongue muttereth wickedness .
none sueth in righteousness , and none pleadeth in truth : they trust in vanity , and speak lies ; they conceive mischief , and bring forth iniquity .
their feet run to evil , and they make haste to shed innocent blood : their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity ; desolation and destruction are in their paths .
transgressing and denying jehovah , and turning away from following our god , speaking oppression and revolt , conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood .
and justice is turned away backward , and righteousness standeth afar off ; for truth is fallen in the street , and uprightness can not enter .
yea , truth is lacking ; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey .
according to their deeds , accordingly he will repay , wrath to his adversaries , recompense to his enemies ; to the islands he will repay recompense .
and a redeemer will come to zion , and unto them that turn from transgression in jacob , saith jehovah .
arise , shine ; for thy light is come , and the glory of jehovah is risen upon thee .
and nations shall come to thy light , and kings to the brightness of thy rising .
who are these that fly as a cloud , and as the doves to their windows ?
for that nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish ; yea , those nations shall be utterly wasted .
whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated , so that no man passed through thee , i will make thee an eternal excellency , a joy of many generations .
violence shall no more be heard in thy land , desolation nor destruction within thy borders ; but thou shalt call thy walls salvation , and thy gates praise .
the little one shall become a thousand , and the small one a strong nation ; i , jehovah , will hasten it in its time .
to proclaim the year of jehovah ’ s favor , and the day of vengeance of our god ; to comfort all that mourn ;
and they shall build the old wastes , they shall raise up the former desolations , and they shall repair the waste cities , the desolations of many generations .
and strangers shall stand and feed your flocks , and foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vine-dressers .
thou shalt also be a crown of beauty in the hand of jehovah , and a royal diadem in the hand of thy god .
and give him no rest , till he establish , and till he make jerusalem a praise in the earth .
but they that have garnered it shall eat it , and praise jehovah ; and they that have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary .
and they shall call them the holy people , the redeemed of jehovah : and thou shalt be called sought out , a city not forsaken .
wherefore art thou red in thine apparel , and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winevat ?
for the day of vengeance was in my heart , and the year of my redeemed is come .
and i trod down the peoples in mine anger , and made them drunk in my wrath , and i poured out their lifeblood on the earth .
for he said , surely , they are my people , children that will not deal falsely : so he was their saviour .
but they rebelled , and grieved his holy spirit : therefore he was turned to be their enemy , and himself fought against them .
that caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of moses ? that divided the waters before them , to make himself an everlasting name ?
that led them through the depths , as a horse in the wilderness , so that they stumbled not ?
thy holy people possessed it but a little while : our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary .
we are become as they over whom thou never barest rule , as they that were not called by thy name .
oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens , that thou wouldest come down , that the mountains might quake at thy presence ,
when thou didst terrible things which we looked not for , thou camest down , the mountains quaked at thy presence .
be not wroth very sore , o jehovah , neither remember iniquity for ever : behold , look , we beseech thee , we are all thy people .
thy holy cities are become a wilderness , zion is become a wilderness , jerusalem a desolation .
our holy and our beautiful house , where our fathers praised thee , is burned with fire ; and all our pleasant places are laid waste .
wilt thou refrain thyself for these things , o jehovah ? wilt thou hold thy peace , and afflict us very sore ?
i have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people , that walk in a way that is not good , after their own thoughts ;
a people that provoke me to my face continually , sacrificing in gardens , and burning incense upon bricks ;
that sit among the graves , and lodge in the secret places ; that eat swine ’ s flesh , and broth of abominable things is in their vessels ;
behold , it is written before me : i will not keep silence , but will recompense , yea , i will recompense into their bosom ,
but ye that forsake jehovah , that forget my holy mountain , that prepare a table for fortune , and that fill up mingled wine unto destiny ;
behold , my servants shall sing for joy of heart , but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart , and shall wail for vexation of spirit .
for , behold , i create new heavens and a new earth ; and the former things shall not be remembered , nor come into mind .
but be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which i create ; for , behold , i create jerusalem a rejoicing , and her people a joy .
and they shall build houses , and inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and eat the fruit of them .
they shall not labor in vain , nor bring forth for calamity ; for they are the seed of the blessed of jehovah , and their offspring with them .
and it shall come to pass that , before they call , i will answer ; and while they are yet speaking , i will hear .
a voice of tumult from the city , a voice from the temple , a voice of jehovah that rendereth recompense to his enemies .
before she travailed , she brought forth ; before her pain came , she was delivered of a man-child .
rejoice ye with jerusalem , and be glad for her , all ye that love her : rejoice for joy with her , all ye that mourn over her ;
that ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations ; that ye may milk out , and be delighted with the abundance of her glory .
as one whom his mother comforteth , so will i comfort you ; and ye shall be comforted in jerusalem .
for by fire will jehovah execute judgment , and by his sword , upon all flesh ; and the slain of jehovah shall be many .
and of them also will i take for priests and for levites , saith jehovah .
james , a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ , to the twelve tribes which are of the dispersion , greeting .
count it all joy , my brethren , when ye fall into manifold temptations ;
knowing that the proving of your faith worketh patience .
and let patience have its perfect work , that ye may be perfect and entire , lacking in nothing .
but if any of you lacketh wisdom , let him ask of god , who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given him .
but let him ask in faith , nothing doubting : for he that doubteth is like the surge of the sea driven by the wind and tossed .
for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the lord ;
a doubleminded man , unstable in all his ways .
but let the brother of low degree glory in his high estate :
and the rich , in that he is made low : because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away .
but each man is tempted , when he is drawn away by his own lust , and enticed .
then the lust , when it hath conceived , beareth sin : and the sin , when it is fullgrown , bringeth forth death .
be not deceived , my beloved brethren .
of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth , that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures .
ye know this , my beloved brethren . but let every man be swift to hear , slow to speak , slow to wrath :
for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god .
wherefore putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness , receive with meekness the implanted word , which is able to save your souls .
but be ye doers of the word , and not hearers only , deluding your own selves .
for if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror :
for he beholdeth himself , and goeth away , and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was .
if any man thinketh himself to be religious , while he bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his heart , this man ’ s religion is vain .
my brethren , hold not the faith of our lord jesus christ , the lord of glory , with respect of persons .
for if there come into your synagogue a man with a gold ring , in fine clothing , and there come in also a poor man in vile clothing ;
do ye not make distinctions among yourselves , and become judges with evil thoughts ?
but ye have dishonored the poor man . do not the rich oppress you , and themselves drag you before the judgment-seats ?
do not they blaspheme the honorable name by which ye are called ?
howbeit if ye fulfil the royal law , according to the scripture , thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself , ye do well :
but if ye have respect of persons , ye commit sin , being convicted by the law as transgressors .
for whosoever shall keep the whole law , and yet stumble in one point , he is become guilty of all .
so speak ye , and so do , as men that are to be judged by a law of liberty .
for judgment is without mercy to him that hath showed no mercy : mercy glorieth against judgment .
what doth it profit , my brethren , if a man say he hath faith , but have not works ? can that faith save him ?
if a brother or sister be naked and in lack of daily food ,
even so faith , if it have not works , is dead in itself .
thou believest that god is one ; thou doest well : the demons also believe , and shudder .
but wilt thou know , o vain man , that faith apart from works is barren ?
was not abraham our father justified by works , in that he offered up isaac his son upon the altar ?
thou seest that faith wrought with his works , and by works was faith made perfect ;
ye see that by works a man is justified , and not only by faith .
and in like manner was not also rahab the harlot justified by works , in that she received the messengers , and sent them out another way ?
for as the body apart from the spirit is dead , even so faith apart from works is dead .
be not many of you teachers , my brethren , knowing that we shall receive heavier judgment .
for in many things we all stumble . if any stumbleth not in word , the same is a perfect man , able to bridle the whole body also .
now if we put the horses ’ bridles into their mouths that they may obey us , we turn about their whole body also .
so the tongue also is a little member , and boasteth great things . behold , how much wood is kindled by how small a fire !
for every kind of beasts and birds , of creeping things and things in the sea , is tamed , and hath been tamed by mankind :
but the tongue can no man tame ; it is a restless evil , it is full of deadly poison .
therewith bless we the lord and father ; and therewith curse we men , who are made after the likeness of god :
out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing . my brethren , these things ought not so to be .
doth the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet water and bitter ?
can a fig tree , my brethren , yield olives , or a vine figs ? neither can salt water yield sweet .
who is wise and understanding among you ? let him show by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom .
but if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart , glory not and lie not against the truth .
this wisdom is not a wisdom that cometh down from above , but is earthly , sensual , devilish .
for where jealousy and faction are , there is confusion and every vile deed .
and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace .
whence come wars and whence come fightings among you ? come they not hence , even of your pleasures that war in your members ?
ye ask , and receive not , because ye ask amiss , that ye may spend it in your pleasures .
or think ye that the scripture speaketh in vain ? doth the spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying ?
but he giveth more grace . wherefore the scripture saith , god resisteth the proud , but giveth grace to the humble .
be subject therefore unto god ; but resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
draw nigh to god , and he will draw nigh to you . cleanse your hands , ye sinners ; and purify your hearts , ye doubleminded .
be afflicted , and mourn , and weep : let your laughter be turned to mourning , and your joy to heaviness .
humble yourselves in the sight of the lord , and he shall exalt you .
one only is the lawgiver and judge , even he who is able to save and to destroy : but who art thou that judgest thy neighbor ?
come now , ye that say , to-day or to-morrow we will go into this city , and spend a year there , and trade , and get gain :
for that ye ought to say , if the lord will , we shall both live , and do this or that .
but now ye glory in your vauntings : all such glorying is evil .
to him therefore that knoweth to do good , and doeth it not , to him it is sin .
come now , ye rich , weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you .
your riches are corrupted , and your garments are moth-eaten .
ye have lived delicately on the earth , and taken your pleasure ; ye have nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter .
ye have condemned , ye have killed the righteous one ; he doth not resist you .
be ye also patient ; establish your hearts : for the coming of the lord is at hand .
murmur not , brethren , one against another , that ye be not judged : behold , the judge standeth before the doors .
take , brethren , for an example of suffering and of patience , the prophets who spake in the name of the lord .
is any among you suffering ? let him pray . is any cheerful ? let him sing praise .
and he prayed again ; and the heaven gave rain , and the earth brought forth her fruit .
my brethren , if any among you err from the truth , and one convert him ;
peter , an apostle of jesus christ , to the elect who are sojourners of the dispersion in pontus , galatia , cappadocia , asia , and bithynia ,
unto an inheritance incorruptible , and undefiled , and that fadeth not away , reserved in heaven for you ,
who by the power of god are guarded through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
wherein ye greatly rejoice , though now for a little while , if need be , ye have been put to grief in manifold trials ,
receiving the end of your faith , even the salvation of your souls .
concerning which salvation the prophets sought and searched diligently , who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you :
as children of obedience , not fashioning yourselves according to your former lusts in the time of your ignorance :
but like as he who called you is holy , be ye yourselves also holy in all manner of living ;
because it is written , ye shall be holy ; for i am holy .
knowing that ye were redeemed , not with corruptible things , with silver or gold , from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers ;
but with precious blood , as of a lamb without blemish and without spot , even the blood of christ :
who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world , but was manifested at the end of the times for your sake ,
seeing ye have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth unto unfeigned love of the brethren , love one another from the heart fervently :
having been begotten again , not of corruptible seed , but of incorruptible , through the word of god , which liveth and abideth .
but the word of the lord abideth for ever .
putting away therefore all wickedness , and all guile , and hypocrisies , and envies , and all evil speakings ,
as newborn babes , long for the spiritual milk which is without guile , that ye may grow thereby unto salvation ;
if ye have tasted that the lord is gracious :
unto whom coming , a living stone , rejected indeed of men , but with god elect , precious ,
because it is contained in scripture ,
for you therefore that believe is the preciousness : but for such as disbelieve ,
who in time past were no people , but now are the people of god : who had not obtained mercy , but now have obtained mercy .
beloved , i beseech you as sojourners and pilgrims , to abstain from fleshly lusts , which war against the soul ;
be subject to every ordinance of man for the lord ’ s sake : whether to the king , as supreme ;
or unto governors , as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to them that do well .
for so is the will of god , that by well-doing ye should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men :
as free , and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness , but as bondservants of god .
honor all men . love the brotherhood . fear god . honor the king .
servants , be in subjection to your masters with all fear ; not only to the good and gentle , but also to the froward .
for this is acceptable , if for conscience toward god a man endureth griefs , suffering wrongfully .
for hereunto were ye called : because christ also suffered for you , leaving you an example , that ye should follow his steps :
who did no sin , neither was guile found in his mouth :
who , when he was reviled , reviled not again ; when he suffered , threatened not ; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously :
for ye were going astray like sheep ; but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls .
beholding your chaste behavior coupled with fear .
whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of braiding the hair , and of wearing jewels of gold , or of putting on apparel ;
for after this manner aforetime the holy women also , who hoped in god , adorned themselves , being in subjection to their own husbands :
as sarah obeyed abraham , calling him lord : whose children ye now are , if ye do well , and are not put in fear by any terror .
finally , be ye all likeminded , compassionate , loving as brethren , tenderhearted , humbleminded :
not rendering evil for evil , or reviling for reviling ; but contrariwise blessing ; for hereunto were ye called , that ye should inherit a blessing .
and let him turn away from evil , and do good ;
for the eyes of the lord are upon the righteous ,
and who is he that will harm you , if ye be zealous of that which is good ?
but even if ye should suffer for righteousness ’ sake , blessed are ye : and fear not their fear , neither be troubled ;
having a good conscience ; that , wherein ye are spoken against , they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in christ .
for it is better , if the will of god should so will , that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing .
in which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison ,
who is on the right hand of god , having gone into heaven ; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him .
that ye no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh to the lusts of men , but to the will of god .
wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them into the same excess of riot , speaking evil of you :
who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead .
but the end of all things is at hand : be ye therefore of sound mind , and be sober unto prayer :
above all things being fervent in your love among yourselves ; for love covereth a multitude of sins :
using hospitality one to another without murmuring :
according as each hath received a gift , ministering it among yourselves , as good stewards of the manifold grace of god ;
beloved , think it not strange concerning the fiery trial among you , which cometh upon you to prove you , as though a strange thing happened unto you :
but insomuch as ye are partakers of christ ’ s sufferings , rejoice ; that at the revelation of his glory also ye may rejoice with exceeding joy .
if ye are reproached for the name of christ , blessed are ye ; because the spirit of glory and the spirit of god resteth upon you .
for let none of you suffer as a murderer , or a thief , or an evil-doer , or as a meddler in other men ’ s matters :
but if a man suffer as a christian , let him not be ashamed ; but let him glorify god in this name .
and if the righteous is scarcely saved , where shall the ungodly and sinner appear ?
wherefore let them also that suffer according to the will of god commit their souls in well-doing unto a faithful creator .
neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you , but making yourselves ensamples to the flock .
and when the chief shepherd shall be manifested , ye shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away .
humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god , that he may exalt you in due time ;
casting all your anxiety upon him , because he careth for you .
be sober , be watchful : your adversary the devil , as a roaring lion , walketh about , seeking whom he may devour :
whom withstand stedfast in your faith , knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your brethren who are in the world .
to him be the dominion for ever and ever . amen .
she that is in babylon , elect together with you , saluteth you ; and so doth mark my son .
salute one another with a kiss of love .
grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord ;
yea , and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence , in your faith supply virtue ; and in your virtue knowledge ;
and in your knowledge self-control ; and in your self-control patience ; and in your patience godliness ;
and in your godliness brotherly kindness ; and in your brotherly kindness love .
for if these things are yours and abound , they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful unto the knowledge of our lord jesus christ .
for he that lacketh these things is blind , seeing only what is near , having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins .
wherefore , brethren , give the more diligence to make your calling and election sure : for if ye do these things , ye shall never stumble :
for thus shall be richly supplied unto you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ .
and i think it right , as long as i am in this tabernacle , to stir you up by putting you in remembrance ;
knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle cometh swiftly , even as our lord jesus christ signified unto me .
yea , i will give diligence that at every time ye may be able after my decease to call these things to remembrance .
and this voice we ourselves heard borne out of heaven , when we were with him in the holy mount .
knowing this first , that no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation .
for no prophecy ever came by the will of man : but men spake from god , being moved by the holy spirit .
and many shall follow their lascivious doings ; by reason of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken of .
and in covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you : whose sentence now from of old lingereth not , and their destruction slumbereth not .
and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow , having made them an example unto those that should live ungodly ;
and delivered righteous lot , sore distressed by the lascivious life of the wicked
( for that righteous man dwelling among them , in seeing and hearing , vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their lawless deeds ) :
the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation , and to keep the unrighteous under punishment unto the day of judgment ;
but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement , and despise dominion . daring , self-willed , they tremble not to rail at dignities :
whereas angels , though greater in might and power , bring not a railing judgment against them before the lord .
having eyes full of adultery , and that can not cease from sin ; enticing unstedfast souls ; having a heart exercised in covetousness ; children of cursing ;
forsaking the right way , they went astray , having followed the way of balaam the son of beor , who loved the hire of wrong-doing ;
but he was rebuked for his own transgression : a dumb ass spake with man ’ s voice and stayed the madness of the prophet .
these are springs without water , and mists driven by a storm ; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved .
promising them liberty , while they themselves are bondservants of corruption ; for of whom a man is overcome , of the same is he also brought into bondage .
that ye should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets , and the commandment of the lord and saviour through your apostles :
knowing this first , that in the last days mockers shall come with mockery , walking after their own lusts ,
by which means the world that then was , being overflowed with water , perished :
but forget not this one thing , beloved , that one day is with the lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
seeing that these things are thus all to be dissolved , what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy living and godliness ,
but , according to his promise , we look for new heavens and a new earth , wherein dwelleth righteousness .
wherefore , beloved , seeing that ye look for these things , give diligence that ye may be found in peace , without spot and blameless in his sight .
ye therefore , beloved , knowing these things beforehand , beware lest , being carried away with the error of the wicked , ye fall from your own stedfastness .
but grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord and saviour jesus christ . to him be the glory both now and for ever . amen .
and these things we write , that our joy may be made full .
and this is the message which we have heard from him and announce unto you , that god is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness , we lie , and do not the truth :
if we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
if we confess our sins , he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins , and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness .
if we say that we have not sinned , we make him a liar , and his word is not in us .
and he is the propitiation for our sins ; and not for ours only , but also for the whole world .
and hereby we know that we know him , if we keep his commandments .
he that saith , i know him , and keepeth not his commandments , is a liar , and the truth is not in him ;
but whoso keepeth his word , in him verily hath the love of god been perfected . hereby we know that we are in him :
he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked .
he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother , is in the darkness even until now .
he that loveth his brother abideth in the light , and there is no occasion of stumbling in him .
i write unto you , my little children , because your sins are forgiven you for his name ’ s sake .
and the world passeth away , and the lust thereof : but he that doeth the will of god abideth for ever .
and ye have an anointing from the holy one , and ye know all things .
i have not written unto you because ye know not the truth , but because ye know it , and because no lie is of the truth .
who is the liar but he that denieth that jesus is the christ ? this is the antichrist , even he that denieth the father and the son .
whosoever denieth the son , the same hath not the father : he that confesseth the son hath the father also .
and this is the promise which he promised us , even the life eternal .
these things have i written unto you concerning them that would lead you astray .
if ye know that he is righteous , ye know that every one also that doeth righteousness is begotten of him .
and every one that hath this hope set on him purifieth himself , even as he is pure .
every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness ; and sin is lawlessness .
and ye know that he was manifested to take away sins ; and in him is no sin .
whosoever abideth in him sinneth not : whosoever sinneth hath not seen him , neither knoweth him .
my little children , let no man lead you astray : he that doeth righteousness is righteous , even as he is righteous :
whosoever is begotten of god doeth no sin , because his seed abideth in him : and he can not sin , because he is begotten of god .
for this is the message which ye heard from the beginning , that we should love one another :
marvel not , brethren , if the world hateth you .
we know that we have passed out of death into life , because we love the brethren . he that loveth not abideth in death .
whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer : and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him .
hereby know we love , because he laid down his life for us : and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
my little children , let us not love in word , neither with the tongue ; but in deed and truth .
hereby shall we know that we are of the truth , and shall assure our heart before him :
because if our heart condemn us , god is greater than our heart , and knoweth all things .
beloved , if our heart condemn us not , we have boldness toward god ;
and whatsoever we ask we receive of him , because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight .
beloved , believe not every spirit , but prove the spirits , whether they are of god ; because many false prophets are gone out into the world .
hereby know ye the spirit of god : every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god :
ye are of god , my little children , and have overcome them : because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world .
they are of the world : therefore speak they as of the world , and the world heareth them .
beloved , let us love one another : for love is of god ; and every one that loveth is begotten of god , and knoweth god .
he that loveth not knoweth not god ; for god is love .
herein was the love of god manifested in us , that god hath sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him .
herein is love , not that we loved god , but that he loved us , and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins .
beloved , if god so loved us , we also ought to love one another .
no man hath beheld god at any time : if we love one another , god abideth in us , and his love is perfected in us :
hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us , because he hath given us of his spirit .
and we have beheld and bear witness that the father hath sent the son to be the saviour of the world .
whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god , god abideth in him , and he in god .
there is no fear in love : but perfect love casteth out fear , because fear hath punishment ; and he that feareth is not made perfect in love .
we love , because he first loved us .
and this commandment have we from him , that he who loveth god love his brother also .
whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is begotten of god : and whosoever loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him .
hereby we know that we love the children of god , when we love god and do his commandments .
for this is the love of god , that we keep his commandments : and his commandments are not grievous .
for whatsoever is begotten of god overcometh the world : and this is the victory that hath overcome the world , even our faith .
and who is he that overcometh the world , but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god ?
this is he that came by water and blood , even jesus christ ; not with the water only , but with the water and with the blood .
and it is the spirit that beareth witness , because the spirit is the truth .
for there are three who bear witness , the spirit , and the water , and the blood : and the three agree in one .
and the witness is this , that god gave unto us eternal life , and this life is in his son .
he that hath the son hath the life ; he that hath not the son of god hath not the life .
and this is the boldness which we have toward him , that , if we ask anything according to his will , he heareth us :
and if we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask , we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him .
all unrighteousness is sin : and there is a sin not unto death .
we know that whosoever is begotten of god sinneth not ; but he that was begotten of god keepeth himself , and the evil one toucheth him not .
we know that we are of god , and the whole world lieth in the evil one .
my little children , guard yourselves from idols .
the elder unto the elect lady and her children , whom i love in truth ; and not i only , but also all they that know the truth ;
for the truth ’ s sake which abideth in us , and it shall be with us for ever :
i rejoice greatly that i have found certain of thy children walking in truth , even as we received commandment from the father .
look to yourselves , that ye lose not the things which we have wrought , but that ye receive a full reward .
if any one cometh unto you , and bringeth not this teaching , receive him not into your house , and give him no greeting :
for he that giveth him greeting partaketh in his evil works .
the children of thine elect sister salute thee .
the elder unto gaius the beloved , whom i love in truth .
beloved , i pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health , even as thy soul prospereth .
for i rejoiced greatly , when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth , even as thou walkest in truth .
greater joy have i none than this , to hear of my children walking in the truth .
beloved , thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal ;
who bare witness to thy love before the church : whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of god :
because that for the sake of the name they went forth , taking nothing of the gentiles .
we therefore ought to welcome such , that we may be fellow-workers for the truth .
i wrote somewhat unto the church : but diotrephes , who loveth to have the preeminence among them , receiveth us not .
demetrius hath the witness of all men , and of the truth itself : yea , we also bear witness ; and thou knowest that our witness is true .
i had many things to write unto thee , but i am unwilling to write them to thee with ink and pen :
the words of jeremiah the son of hilkiah , of the priests that were in anathoth in the land of benjamin :
to whom the word of jehovah came in the days of josiah the son of amon , king of judah , in the thirteenth year of his reign .
now the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
then said i , ah , lord jehovah ! behold , i know not how to speak ; for i am a child .
be not afraid because of them ; for i am with thee to deliver thee , saith jehovah .
then jehovah put forth his hand , and touched my mouth ; and jehovah said unto me , behold , i have put my words in thy mouth :
moreover the word of jehovah came unto me , saying , jeremiah , what seest thou ? and i said , i see a rod of an almond-tree .
then said jehovah unto me , thou hast well seen : for i watch over my word to perform it .
then jehovah said unto me , out of the north evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land .
and they shall fight against thee ; but they shall not prevail against thee : for i am with thee , saith jehovah , to deliver thee .
and the word of jehovah came to me , saying ,
israel was holiness unto jehovah , the first-fruits of his increase : all that devour him shall be held guilty ; evil shall come upon them , saith jehovah .
hear ye the word of jehovah , o house of jacob , and all the families of the house of israel :
wherefore i will yet contend with you , saith jehovah , and with your children ’ s children will i contend .
hath a nation changed its gods , which yet are no gods ? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit .
be astonished , o ye heavens , at this , and be horribly afraid , be ye very desolate , saith jehovah .
is israel a servant ? is he a home-born slave ? why is he become a prey ?
the young lions have roared upon him , and yelled ; and they have made his land waste : his cities are burned up , without inhabitant .
the children also of memphis and tahpanhes have broken the crown of thy head .
hast thou not procured this unto thyself , in that thou hast forsaken jehovah thy god , when he led thee by the way ?
yet i had planted thee a noble vine , wholly a right seed : how then art thou turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine unto me ?
for though thou wash thee with lye , and take thee much soap , yet thine iniquity is marked before me , saith the lord jehovah .
wherefore will ye contend with me ? ye all have transgressed against me , saith jehovah .
in vain have i smitten your children ; they received no correction : your own sword hath devoured your prophets , like a destroying lion .
can a virgin forget her ornaments , or a bride her attire ? yet my people have forgotten me days without number .
how trimmest thou thy way to seek love ! therefore even the wicked women hast thou taught thy ways .
why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way ? thou shalt be ashamed of egypt also , as thou wast ashamed of assyria .
therefore the showers have been withholden , and there hath been no latter rain ; yet thou hadst a harlot ’ s forehead , thou refusedst to be ashamed .
wilt thou not from this time cry unto me , my father , thou art the guide of my youth ?
and i said after she had done all these things , she will return unto me ; but she returned not : and her treacherous sister judah saw it .
and it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom , that the land was polluted , and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks .
and yet for all this her treacherous sister judah hath not returned unto me with her whole heart , but feignedly , saith jehovah .
and jehovah said unto me , backsliding israel hath showed herself more righteous than treacherous judah .
and i will give you shepherds according to my heart , who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding .
surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband , so have ye dealt treacherously with me , o house of israel , saith jehovah .
return , ye backsliding children , i will heal your backslidings .
but the shameful thing hath devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth , their flocks and their herds , their sons and their daughters .
for thus saith jehovah to the men of judah and to jerusalem , break up your fallow ground , and sow not among thorns .
set up a standard toward zion : flee for safety , stay not ; for i will bring evil from the north , and a great destruction .
for this gird you with sackcloth , lament and wail ; for the fierce anger of jehovah is not turned back from us .
a full wind from these shall come for me : now will i also utter judgments against them .
o jerusalem , wash thy heart from wickedness , that thou mayest be saved . how long shall thine evil thoughts lodge within thee ?
for a voice declareth from dan , and publisheth evil from the hills of ephraim .
as keepers of a field are they against her round about , because she hath been rebellious against me , saith jehovah .
thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee ; this is thy wickedness ; for it is bitter , for it reacheth unto thy heart .
destruction upon destruction is cried ; for the whole land is laid waste : suddenly are my tents destroyed , and my curtains in a moment .
how long shall i see the standard , and hear the sound of the trumpet ?
i beheld the earth , and , lo , it was waste and void ; and the heavens , and they had no light .
i beheld the mountains , and , lo , they trembled , and all the hills moved to and fro .
i beheld , and , lo , there was no man , and all the birds of the heavens were fled .
for thus saith jehovah , the whole land shall be a desolation ; yet will i not make a full end .
and though they say , as jehovah liveth ; surely they swear falsely .
then i said , surely these are poor ; they are foolish ; for they know not the way of jehovah , nor the law of their god :
they were as fed horses roaming at large ; every one neighed after his neighbor ’ s wife .
shall i not visit for these things ? saith jehovah ; and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
go ye up upon her walls , and destroy ; but make not a full end : take away her branches ; for they are not jehovah ’ s .
for the house of israel and the house of judah have dealt very treacherously against me , saith jehovah .
they have denied jehovah , and said , it is not he ; neither shall evil come upon us ; neither shall we see sword nor famine :
and the prophets shall become wind , and the word is not in them : thus shall it be done unto them .
their quiver is an open sepulchre , they are all mighty men .
but even in those days , saith jehovah , i will not make a full end with you .
declare ye this in the house of jacob , and publish it in judah , saying ,
hear now this , o foolish people , and without understanding ; that have eyes , and see not ; that have ears , and hear not :
but this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart ; they are revolted and gone .
your iniquities have turned away these things , and your sins have withholden good from you .
for among my people are found wicked men : they watch , as fowlers lie in wait ; they set a trap , they catch men .
as a cage is full of birds , so are their houses full of deceit : therefore they are become great , and waxed rich .
shall i not visit for these things ? saith jehovah ; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
a wonderful and horrible thing is come to pass in the land :
the comely and delicate one , the daughter of zion , will i cut off .
shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her ; they shall pitch their tents against her round about ; they shall feed every one in his place .
arise , and let us go up by night , and let us destroy her palaces .
be thou instructed , o jerusalem , lest my soul be alienated from thee ; lest i make thee a desolation , a land not inhabited .
thus saith jehovah of hosts , they shall thoroughly glean the remnant of israel as a vine : turn again thy hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets .
they have healed also the hurt of my people slightly , saying , peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
and i set watchmen over you , saying , hearken to the sound of the trumpet ; but they said , we will not hearken .
therefore hear , ye nations , and know , o congregation , what is among them .
thus saith jehovah , behold , a people cometh from the north country ; and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth .
we have heard the report thereof ; our hands wax feeble : anguish hath taken hold of us , and pangs as of a woman in travail .
go not forth into the field , nor walk by the way ; for the sword of the enemy , and terror , are on every side .
i have made thee a trier and a fortress among my people ; that thou mayest know and try their way .
they are all grievous revolters , going about with slanders ; they are brass and iron : they all of them deal corruptly .
the bellows blow fiercely ; the lead is consumed of the fire : in vain do they go on refining ; for the wicked are not plucked away .
refuse silver shall men call them , because jehovah hath rejected them .
the word that came to jeremiah from jehovah , saying ,
thus saith jehovah of hosts , the god of israel , amend your ways and your doings , and i will cause you to dwell in this place .
trust ye not in lying words , saying , the temple of jehovah , the temple of jehovah , the temple of jehovah , are these .
for if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings ; if ye thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor ;
then will i cause you to dwell in this place , in the land that i gave to your fathers , from of old even for evermore .
behold , ye trust in lying words , that can not profit .
and i will cast you out of my sight , as i have cast out all your brethren , even the whole seed of ephraim .
therefore pray not thou for this people , neither lift up cry nor prayer for them , neither make intercession to me ; for i will not hear thee .
seest thou not what they do in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem ?
do they provoke me to anger ? saith jehovah ; do they not provoke themselves , to the confusion of their own faces ?
thus saith jehovah of hosts , the god of israel : add your burnt-offerings unto your sacrifices , and eat ye flesh .
for i spake not unto your fathers , nor commanded them in the day that i brought them out of the land of egypt , concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices :
yet they hearkened not unto me , nor inclined their ear , but made their neck stiff : they did worse than their fathers .
moreover thou shalt say unto them , thus saith jehovah : shall men fall , and not rise up again ? shall one turn away , and not return ?
why then is this people of jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding ? they hold fast deceit , they refuse to return .
and they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
we looked for peace , but no good came ; and for a time of healing , and , behold , dismay !
for , behold , i will send serpents , adders , among you , which will not be charmed ; and they shall bite you , saith jehovah .
oh that i could comfort myself against sorrow ! my heart is faint within me .
the harvest is past , the summer is ended , and we are not saved .
for the hurt of the daughter of my people am i hurt : i mourn ; dismay hath taken hold on me .
is there no balm in gilead ? is there no physician there ? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered ?
thy habitation is in the midst of deceit ; through deceit they refuse to know me , saith jehovah .
shall i not visit them for these things ? saith jehovah ; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
and i will make jerusalem heaps , a dwelling-place of jackals ; and i will make the cities of judah a desolation , without inhabitant .
and jehovah saith , because they have forsaken my law which i set before them , and have not obeyed my voice , neither walked therein ,
but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart , and after the baalim , which their fathers taught them ;
behold , the days come , saith jehovah , that i will punish all them that are circumcised in their uncircumcision :
hear ye the word which jehovah speaketh unto you , o house of israel :
thus saith jehovah , learn not the way of the nations , and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven ; for the nations are dismayed at them .
they deck it with silver and with gold ; they fasten it with nails and with hammers , that it move not .
there is none like unto thee , o jehovah ; thou art great , and thy name is great in might .
but they are together brutish and foolish : the instruction of idols ! it is but a stock .
he hath made the earth by his power , he hath established the world by his wisdom , and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens .
they are vanity , a work of delusion : in the time of their visitation they shall perish .
gather up thy wares out of the land , o thou that abidest in the siege .
woe is me because of my hurt ! my wound is grievous : but i said , truly this is my grief , and i must bear it .
for the shepherds are become brutish , and have not inquired of jehovah : therefore they have not prospered , and all their flocks are scattered .
o jehovah , i know that the way of man is not in himself ; it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps .
o jehovah , correct me , but in measure ; not in thine anger , lest thou bring me to nothing .
the word that came to jeremiah from jehovah , saying ,
hear ye the words of this covenant , and speak unto the men of judah , and to the inhabitants of jerusalem ;
and say thou unto them , thus saith jehovah , the god of israel : cursed be the man that heareth not the words of this covenant ,
and jehovah said unto me , a conspiracy is found among the men of judah , and among the inhabitants of jerusalem .
and jehovah gave me knowledge of it , and i knew it : then thou showedst me their doings .
and there shall be no remnant unto them : for i will bring evil upon the men of anathoth , even the year of their visitation .
i have forsaken my house , i have cast off my heritage ; i have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies .
my heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest : she hath uttered her voice against me ; therefore i have hated her .
many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard , they have trodden my portion under foot , they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness .
they have made it a desolation ; it mourneth unto me , being desolate ; the whole land is made desolate , because no man layeth it to heart .
but if they will not hear , then will i pluck up that nation , plucking up and destroying it , saith jehovah .
thus saith jehovah unto me , go , and buy thee a linen girdle , and put it upon thy loins , and put it not in water .
so i bought a girdle according to the word of jehovah , and put it upon my loins .
and the word of jehovah came unto me the second time , saying ,
so i went , and hid it by the euphrates , as jehovah commanded me .
then the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
thus saith jehovah , after this manner will i mar the pride of judah , and the great pride of jerusalem .
hear ye , and give ear ; be not proud ; for jehovah hath spoken .
say thou unto the king and to the queen-mother , humble yourselves , sit down ; for your headtires are come down , even the crown of your glory .
lift up your eyes , and behold them that come from the north : where is the flock that was given thee , thy beautiful flock ?
can the ethiopian change his skin , or the leopard his spots ? then may ye also do good , that are accustomed to do evil .
therefore will i scatter them , as the stubble that passeth away , by the wind of the wilderness .
this is thy lot , the portion measured unto thee from me , saith jehovah ; because thou hast forgotten me , and trusted in falsehood .
therefore will i also uncover thy skirts upon thy face , and thy shame shall appear .
the word of jehovah that came to jeremiah concerning the drought .
judah mourneth , and the gates thereof languish , they sit in black upon the ground ; and the cry of jerusalem is gone up .
because of the ground which is cracked , for that no rain hath been in the land , the plowmen are put to shame , they cover their heads .
yea , the hind also in the field calveth , and forsaketh her young , because there is no grass .
and the wild asses stand on the bare heights , they pant for air like jackals ; their eyes fail , because there is no herbage .
and jehovah said unto me , pray not for this people for their good .
we acknowledge , o jehovah , our wickedness , and the iniquity of our fathers ; for we have sinned against thee .
do not abhor us , for thy name ’ s sake ; do not disgrace the throne of thy glory : remember , break not thy covenant with us .
for who will have pity upon thee , o jerusalem ? or who will bemoan thee ? or who will turn aside to ask of thy welfare ?
can one break iron , even iron from the north , and brass ?
thy substance and thy treasures will i give for a spoil without price , and that for all thy sins , even in all thy borders .
and i will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked , and i will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible .
the word of jehovah came also unto me , saying ,
thou shalt not take thee a wife , neither shalt thou have sons or daughters , in this place .
and thou shalt not go into the house of feasting to sit with them , to eat and to drink .
for mine eyes are upon all their ways ; they are not hid from my face , neither is their iniquity concealed from mine eyes .
shall a man make unto himself gods , which yet are no gods ?
whilst their children remember their altars and their asherim by the green trees upon the high hills .
thus saith jehovah : cursed is the man that trusteth in man , and maketh flesh his arm , and whose heart departeth from jehovah .
blessed is the man that trusteth in jehovah , and whose trust jehovah is .
the heart is deceitful above all things , and it is exceedingly corrupt : who can know it ?
a glorious throne , set on high from the beginning , is the place of our sanctuary .
heal me , o jehovah , and i shall be healed ; save me , and i shall be saved : for thou art my praise .
behold , they say unto me , where is the word of jehovah ? let it come now .
be not a terror unto me : thou art my refuge in the day of evil .
thus saith jehovah , take heed to yourselves , and bear no burden on the sabbath day , nor bring it in by the gates of jerusalem ;
but they hearkened not , neither inclined their ear , but made their neck stiff , that they might not hear , and might not receive instruction .
the word which came to jeremiah from jehovah , saying ,
arise , and go down to the potter ’ s house , and there i will cause thee to hear my words .
then i went down to the potter ’ s house , and , behold , he was making a work on the wheels .
then the word of jehovah came to me , saying ,
at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdom , to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it ;
if that nation , concerning which i have spoken , turn from their evil , i will repent of the evil that i thought to do unto them .
and at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdom , to build and to plant it ;
therefore thus saith jehovah : ask ye now among the nations , who hath heard such things ; the virgin of israel hath done a very horrible thing .
shall the snow of lebanon fail from the rock of the field ? or shall the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up ?
to make their land an astonishment , and a perpetual hissing ; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished , and shake his head .
give heed to me , o jehovah , and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me .
and i will make this city an astonishment , and a hissing ; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof .
then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee ,
thus will i do unto this place , saith jehovah , and to the inhabitants thereof , even making this city as topheth :
now pashhur , the son of immer the priest , who was chief officer in the house of jehovah , heard jeremiah prophesying these things .
then pashhur smote jeremiah the prophet , and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of benjamin , which was in the house of jehovah .
sing unto jehovah , praise ye jehovah ; for he hath delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evil-doers .
cursed be the day wherein i was born : let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed .
cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father , saying , a man-child is born unto thee ; making him very glad .
because he slew me not from the womb ; and so my mother would have been my grave , and her womb always great .
wherefore came i forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow , that my days should be consumed with shame ?
then said jeremiah unto them , thus shall ye say to zedekiah :
and i myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm , even in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation .
and i will smite the inhabitants of this city , both man and beast : they shall die of a great pestilence .
and unto this people thou shalt say , thus saith jehovah : behold , i set before you the way of life and the way of death .
and touching the house of the king of judah , hear ye the word of jehovah :
thus said jehovah : go down to the house of the king of judah , and speak there this word ,
but if ye will not hear these words , i swear by myself , saith jehovah , that this house shall become a desolation .
and i will prepare destroyers against thee , every one with his weapons ; and they shall cut down thy choice cedars , and cast them into the fire .
and many nations shall pass by this city , and they shall say every man to his neighbor , wherefore hath jehovah done thus unto this great city ?
then they shall answer , because they forsook the covenant of jehovah their god , and worshipped other gods , and served them .
but in the place whither they have led him captive , there shall he die , and he shall see this land no more .
he judged the cause of the poor and needy ; then it was well . was not this to know me ? saith jehovah .
he shall be buried with the burial of an ass , drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of jerusalem .
go up to lebanon , and cry ; and lift up thy voice in bashan , and cry from abarim ; for all thy lovers are destroyed .
the wind shall feed all thy shepherds , and thy lovers shall go into captivity : surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness .
and i will cast thee out , and thy mother that bare thee , into another country , where ye were not born ; and there shall ye die .
but to the land whereunto their soul longeth to return , thither shall they not return .
o earth , earth , earth , hear the word of jehovah .
woe unto the shepherds that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture ! saith jehovah .
in his days judah shall be saved , and israel shall dwell safely ; and this is his name whereby he shall be called : jehovah our righteousness .
for both prophet and priest are profane ; yea , in my house have i found their wickedness , saith jehovah .
and i have seen folly in the prophets of samaria ; they prophesied by baal , and caused my people israel to err .
for who hath stood in the council of jehovah , that he should perceive and hear his word ? who hath marked my word , and heard it ?
i sent not these prophets , yet they ran : i spake not unto them , yet they prophesied .
am i a god at hand , saith jehovah , and not a god afar off ?
can any hide himself in secret places so that i shall not see him ? saith jehovah . do not i fill heaven and earth ? saith jehovah .
i have heard what the prophets have said , that prophesy lies in my name , saying , i have dreamed , i have dreamed .
how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies , even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart ?
is not my word like fire ? saith jehovah ; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces ?
therefore , behold , i am against the prophets , saith jehovah , that steal my words every one from his neighbor .
behold , i am against the prophets , saith jehovah , that use their tongues , and say , he saith .
thus shall ye say every one to his neighbor , and every one to his brother , what hath jehovah answered ? and , what hath jehovah spoken ?
thus shalt thou say to the prophet , what hath jehovah answered thee ? and , what hath jehovah spoken ?
and i will bring an everlasting reproach upon you , and a perpetual shame , which shall not be forgotten .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
which jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of judah , and to all the inhabitants of jerusalem , saying :
yet ye have not hearkened unto me , saith jehovah ; that ye may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt .
therefore thus saith jehovah of hosts : because ye have not heard my words ,
and this whole land shall be a desolation , and an astonishment ; and these nations shall serve the king of babylon seventy years .
and they shall drink , and reel to and fro , and be mad , because of the sword that i will send among them .
then took i the cup at jehovah ’ s hand , and made all the nations to drink , unto whom jehovah had sent me :
pharaoh king of egypt , and his servants , and his princes , and all his people ;
edom , and moab , and the children of ammon ;
and all the kings of tyre , and all the kings of sidon , and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea ;
dedan , and tema , and buz , and all that have the corners of their hair cut off ;
and all the kings of arabia , and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the wilderness ;
and all the kings of zimri , and all the kings of elam , and all the kings of the medes ;
and the shepherds shall have no way to flee , nor the principal of the flock to escape .
a voice of the cry of the shepherds , and the wailing of the principal of the flock ! for jehovah layeth waste their pasture .
and the peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of jehovah .
in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah , king of judah , came this word from jehovah , saying ,
then will i make this house like shiloh , and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth .
and the priests and the prophets and all the people heard jeremiah speaking these words in the house of jehovah .
but as for me , behold , i am in your hand : do with me as is good and right in your eyes .
then rose up certain of the elders of the land , and spake to all the assembly of the people , saying ,
and jehoiakim the king sent men into egypt , namely , elnathan the son of achbor , and certain men with him , into egypt ;
in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah , king of judah , came this word unto jeremiah from jehovah , saying ,
thus saith jehovah to me : make thee bonds and bars , and put them upon thy neck ;
and give them a charge unto their masters , saying , thus saith jehovah of hosts , the god of israel , thus shall ye say unto your masters :
for they prophesy a lie unto you , to remove you far from your land , and that i should drive you out , and ye should perish .
hearken not unto them ; serve the king of babylon , and live : wherefore should this city become a desolation ?
thus speaketh jehovah of hosts , the god of israel , saying , i have broken the yoke of the king of babylon .
nevertheless hear thou now this word that i speak in thine ears , and in the ears of all the people :
then hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet jeremiah ’ s neck , and brake it .
then the word of jehovah came unto jeremiah , after that hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet jeremiah , saying ,
so hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month .
thus saith jehovah of hosts , the god of israel , unto all the captivity , whom i have caused to be carried away captive from jerusalem unto babylon :
build ye houses , and dwell in them ; and plant gardens , and eat the fruit of them .
for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name : i have not sent them , saith jehovah .
and ye shall call upon me , and ye shall go and pray unto me , and i will hearken unto you .
and ye shall seek me , and find me , when ye shall search for me with all your heart .
because ye have said , jehovah hath raised us up prophets in babylon ;
hear ye therefore the word of jehovah , all ye of the captivity , whom i have sent away from jerusalem to babylon .
and concerning shemaiah the nehelamite thou shalt speak , saying ,
now therefore , why hast thou not rebuked jeremiah of anathoth , who maketh himself a prophet to you ,
and zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of jeremiah the prophet .
then came the word of jehovah unto jeremiah , saying ,
the word that came to jeremiah from jehovah , saying ,
thus speaketh jehovah , the god of israel , saying , write thee all the words that i have spoken unto thee in a book .
and these are the words that jehovah spake concerning israel and concerning judah .
for thus saith jehovah : we have heard a voice of trembling , of fear , and not of peace .
but they shall serve jehovah their god , and david their king , whom i will raise up unto them .
for thus saith jehovah , thy hurt is incurable , and thy wound grievous .
there is none to plead thy cause , that thou mayest be bound up : thou hast no healing medicines .
their children also shall be as aforetime , and their congregation shall be established before me ; and i will punish all that oppress them .
and ye shall be my people , and i will be your god .
behold , the tempest of jehovah , even his wrath , is gone forth , a sweeping tempest : it shall burst upon the head of the wicked .
at that time , saith jehovah , will i be the god of all the families of israel , and they shall be my people .
thus saith jehovah , the people that were left of the sword found favor in the wilderness ; even israel , when i went to cause him to rest .
jehovah appeared of old unto me , saying , yea , i have loved thee with an everlasting love : therefore with lovingkindness have i drawn thee .
again shalt thou plant vineyards upon the mountains of samaria ; the planters shall plant , and shall enjoy the fruit thereof .
for jehovah hath ransomed jacob , and redeemed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he .
and i will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness , and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness , saith jehovah .
and there is hope for thy latter end , saith jehovah ; and thy children shall come again to their own border .
and judah and all the cities thereof shall dwell therein together , the husbandmen , and they that go about with flocks .
for i have satiated the weary soul , and every sorrowful soul have i replenished .
upon this i awaked , and beheld ; and my sleep was sweet unto me .
in those days they shall say no more , the fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children ’ s teeth are set on edge .
but every one shall die for his own iniquity : every man that eateth the sour grapes , his teeth shall be set on edge .
behold , the days come , saith jehovah , that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel , and with the house of judah :
if these ordinances depart from before me , saith jehovah , then the seed of israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever .
behold , the days come , saith jehovah , that the city shall be built to jehovah from the tower of hananel unto the gate of the corner .
and the measuring line shall go out further straight onward unto the hill gareb , and shall turn about unto goah .
the word that came to jeremiah from jehovah in the tenth year of zedekiah king of judah , which was the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar .
and jeremiah said , the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
and i bought the field that was in anathoth of hanamel mine uncle ’ s son , and weighed him the money , even seventeen shekels of silver .
and i subscribed the deed , and sealed it , and called witnesses , and weighed him the money in the balances .
so i took the deed of the purchase , both that which was sealed , according to the law and custom , and that which was open :
and i charged baruch before them , saying ,
for thus saith jehovah of hosts , the god of israel : houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land .
now after i had delivered the deed of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah , i prayed unto jehovah , saying ,
and gavest them this land , which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them , a land flowing with milk and honey ;
then came the word of jehovah unto jeremiah , saying ,
behold , i am jehovah , the god of all flesh : is there anything too hard for me ?
but they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name , to defile it .
and they shall be my people , and i will be their god :
moreover the word of jehovah came unto jeremiah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard , saying ,
thus saith jehovah that doeth it , jehovah that formeth it to establish it ; jehovah is his name :
call unto me , and i will answer thee , and will show thee great things , and difficult , which thou knowest not .
behold , i will bring it health and cure , and i will cure them ; and i will reveal unto them abundance of peace and truth .
and i will cause the captivity of judah and the captivity of israel to return , and will build them , as at the first .
in those days shall judah be saved , and jerusalem shall dwell safely ; and this is the name whereby she shall be called : jehovah our righteousness .
for thus saith jehovah : david shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of israel ;
neither shall the priests the levites want a man before me to offer burnt-offerings , and to burn meal-offerings , and to do sacrifice continually .
and the word of jehovah came unto jeremiah , saying ,
and the word of jehovah came to jeremiah , saying ,
thus saith jehovah : if my covenant of day and night stand not , if i have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth ;
yet hear the word of jehovah , o zedekiah king of judah : thus saith jehovah concerning thee , thou shalt not die by the sword ;
then jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto zedekiah king of judah in jerusalem ,
therefore the word of jehovah came to jeremiah from jehovah , saying ,
the word which came unto jeremiah from jehovah in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah , king of judah , saying ,
and i set before the sons of the house of the rechabites bowls full of wine , and cups ; and i said unto them , drink ye wine .
nor to build houses for us to dwell in ; neither have we vineyard , nor field , nor seed :
but we have dwelt in tents , and have obeyed , and done according to all that jonadab our father commanded us .
then came the word of jehovah unto jeremiah , saying ,
therefore thus saith jehovah of hosts , the god of israel : jonadab the son of rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever .
and jeremiah commanded baruch , saying , i am shut up ; i can not go into the house of jehovah :
and when micaiah the son of gemariah , the son of shaphan , had heard out of the book all the words of jehovah ,
then micaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard , when baruch read the book in the ears of the people .
and they said unto him , sit down now , and read it in our ears . so baruch read it in their ears .
and they asked baruch , saying , tell us now , how didst thou write all these words at his mouth ?
then baruch answered them , he pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth , and i wrote them with ink in the book .
then said the princes unto baruch , go , hide thee , thou and jeremiah ; and let no man know where ye are .
now the king was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth month : and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him .
and they were not afraid , nor rent their garments , neither the king , nor any of his servants that heard all these words .
moreover elnathan and delaiah and gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll ; but he would not hear them .
take thee again another roll , and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll , which jehoiakim the king of judah hath burned .
now jeremiah came in and went out among the people ; for they had not put him into prison .
then came the word of jehovah unto the prophet jeremiah , saying ,
and the chaldeans shall come again , and fight against this city ; and they shall take it , and burn it with fire .
thus saith jehovah , deceive not yourselves , saying , the chaldeans shall surely depart from us ; for they shall not depart .
and it came to pass that , when the army of the chaldeans was broken up from jerusalem for fear of pharaoh ’ s army ,
then jeremiah went forth out of jerusalem to go into the land of benjamin , to receive his portion there , in the midst of the people .
when jeremiah was come into the dungeon-house , and into the cells , and jeremiah had remained there many days ;
where now are your prophets that prophesied unto you , saying , the king of babylon shall not come against you , nor against this land ?
thus saith jehovah , this city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of babylon , and he shall take it .
and zedekiah the king said , behold , he is in your hand ; for the king is not he that can do anything against you .
ebed-melech went forth out of the king ’ s house , and spake to the king , saying ,
and ebed-melech the ethiopian said unto jeremiah , put now these rags and worn-out garments under thine armholes under the cords . and jeremiah did so .
so they drew up jeremiah with the cords , and took him up out of the dungeon : and jeremiah remained in the court of the guard .
but if thou refuse to go forth , this is the word that jehovah hath showed me :
then said zedekiah unto jeremiah , let no man know of these words , and thou shalt not die .
so jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day that jerusalem was taken .
in the eleventh year of zedekiah , in the fourth month , the ninth day of the month , a breach was made in the city ) ,
then the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah in riblah before his eyes : also the king of babylon slew all the nobles of judah .
moreover he put out zedekiah ’ s eyes , and bound him in fetters , to carry him to babylon .
and the chaldeans burned the king ’ s house , and the houses of the people , with fire , and brake down the walls of jerusalem .
now nebuchadrezzar king of babylon gave charge concerning jeremiah to nebuzaradan the captain of the guard , saying ,
take him , and look well to him , and do him no harm ; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee .
so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent , and nebushazban , rab-saris , and nergal-sharezer , rab-mag , and all the chief officers of the king of babylon ;
now the word of jehovah came unto jeremiah , while he was shut up in the court of the guard , saying ,
but i will deliver thee in that day , saith jehovah ; and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid .
and the captain of the guard took jeremiah , and said unto him , jehovah thy god pronounced this evil upon this place ;
then went jeremiah unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah , and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land .
moreover johanan the son of kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields , came to gedaliah to mizpah ,
but gedaliah the son of ahikam said unto johanan the son of kareah , thou shalt not do this thing ; for thou speakest falsely of ishmael .
and it came to pass the second day after he had slain gedaliah , and no man knew it ,
then they took all the men , and went to fight with ishmael the son of nethaniah , and found him by the great waters that are in gibeon .
so all the people that ishmael had carried away captive from mizpah turned about and came back , and went unto johanan the son of kareah .
but ishmael the son of nethaniah escaped from johanan with eight men , and went to the children of ammon .
and they departed , and dwelt in geruth chimham , which is by beth-lehem , to go to enter into egypt ,
that jehovah thy god may show us the way wherein we should walk , and the thing that we should do .
and it came to pass after ten days , that the word of jehovah came unto jeremiah .
and said unto them , thus saith jehovah , the god of israel , unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him :
and i will grant you mercy , that he may have mercy upon you , and cause you to return to your own land .
but if ye say , we will not dwell in this land ; so that ye obey not the voice of jehovah your god ,
jehovah hath spoken concerning you , o remnant of judah , go ye not into egypt : know certainly that i have testified unto you this day .
and they came into the land of egypt ; for they obeyed not the voice of jehovah : and they came unto tahpanhes .
then came the word of jehovah unto jeremiah in tahpanhes , saying ,
but they hearkened not , nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness , to burn no incense unto other gods .
as for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of jehovah , we will not hearken unto thee .
moreover jeremiah said unto all the people , and to all the women , hear the word of jehovah , all judah that are in the land of egypt :
thus saith jehovah , the god of israel , unto thee , o baruch :
the word of jehovah which came to jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations .
prepare ye the buckler and shield , and draw near to battle .
harness the horses , and get up , ye horsemen , and stand forth with your helmets ; furbish the spears , put on the coats of mail .
let not the swift flee away , nor the mighty man escape ; in the north by the river euphrates have they stumbled and fallen .
who is this that riseth up like the nile , whose waters toss themselves like the rivers ?
go up into gilead , and take balm , o virgin daughter of egypt : in vain dost thou use many medicines ; there is no healing for thee .
the word that jehovah spake to jeremiah the prophet , how that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon should come and smite the land of egypt .
why are thy strong ones swept away ? they stood not , because jehovah did drive them .
they cried there , pharaoh king of egypt is but a noise ; he hath let the appointed time pass by .
egypt is a very fair heifer ; but destruction out of the north is come , it is come .
the sound thereof shall go like the serpent ; for they shall march with an army , and come against her with axes , as hewers of wood .
they shall cut down her forest , saith jehovah , though it can not be searched ; because they are more than the locusts , and are innumerable .
the daughter of egypt shall be put to shame ; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north .
the word of jehovah that came to jeremiah the prophet concerning the philistines , before that pharaoh smote gaza .
baldness is come upon gaza ; ashkelon is brought to nought , the remnant of their valley : how long wilt thou cut thyself ?
o thou sword of jehovah , how long will it be ere thou be quiet ? put up thyself into thy scabbard ; rest , and be still .
how canst thou be quiet , seeing jehovah hath given thee a charge ? against ashkelon , and against the sea-shore , there hath he appointed it .
the sound of a cry from horonaim , desolation and great destruction !
moab is destroyed ; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard .
flee , save your lives , and be like the heath in the wilderness .
give wings unto moab , that she may fly and get her away : and her cities shall become a desolation , without any to dwell therein .
cursed be he that doeth the work of jehovah negligently ; and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood .
and moab shall be ashamed of chemosh , as the house of israel was ashamed of beth-el their confidence .
how say ye , we are mighty men , and valiant men for the war ?
the calamity of moab is near to come , and his affliction hasteth fast .
o inhabitant of aroer , stand by the way , and watch : ask him that fleeth , and her that escapeth ; say , what hath been done ?
moab is put to shame ; for it is broken down : wail and cry ; tell ye it by the arnon , that moab is laid waste .
and judgment is come upon the plain country , upon holon , and upon jahzah , and upon mephaath ,
and upon dibon , and upon nebo , and upon beth-diblathaim ,
and upon kiriathaim , and upon beth-gamul , and upon beth-meon ,
and upon kerioth , and upon bozrah , and upon all the cities of the land of moab , far or near .
the horn of moab is cut off , and his arm is broken , saith jehovah .
make ye him drunken ; for he magnified himself against jehovah : and moab shall wallow in his vomit , and he also shall be in derision .
for was not israel a derision unto thee ? was he found among thieves ? for as often as thou speakest of him , thou waggest the head .
i know his wrath , saith jehovah , that it is nought ; his boastings have wrought nothing .
therefore will i wail for moab ; yea , i will cry out for all moab : for the men of kir-heres shall they mourn .
moreover i will cause to cease in moab , saith jehovah , him that offereth in the high place , and him that burneth incense to his gods .
for every head is bald , and every beard clipped : upon all the hands are cuttings , and upon the loins sackcloth .
for thus saith jehovah : behold , he shall fly as an eagle , and shall spread out his wings against moab .
and moab shall be destroyed from being a people , because he hath magnified himself against jehovah .
fear , and the pit , and the snare , are upon thee , o inhabitant of moab , saith jehovah .
woe unto thee , o moab ! the people of chemosh is undone ; for thy sons are taken away captive , and thy daughters into captivity .
yet will i bring back the captivity of moab in the latter days , saith jehovah . thus far is the judgment of moab .
wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys , thy flowing valley , o backsliding daughter ? that trusted in her treasures , saying , who shall come unto me ?
but afterward i will bring back the captivity of the children of ammon , saith jehovah .
of edom . thus saith jehovah of hosts : is wisdom no more in teman ? is counsel perished from the prudent ? is their wisdom vanished ?
if grape-gatherers came to thee , would they not leave some gleaning grapes ? if thieves by night , would they not destroy till they had enough ?
leave thy fatherless children , i will preserve them alive ; and let thy widows trust in me .
for , behold , i have made thee small among the nations , and despised among men .
and edom shall become an astonishment : every one that passeth by it shall be astonished , and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof .
the earth trembleth at the noise of their fall ; there is a cry , the noise whereof is heard in the red sea .
how is the city of praise not forsaken , the city of my joy ?
therefore her young men shall fall in her streets , and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day , saith jehovah of hosts .
and i will kindle a fire in the wall of damascus , and it shall devour the palaces of ben-hadad .
of kedar , and of the kingdoms of hazor , which nebuchadrezzar king of babylon smote .
and hazor shall be a dwelling-place of jackals , a desolation for ever : no man shall dwell there , neither shall any son of man sojourn therein .
the word of jehovah that came to jeremiah the prophet concerning elam , in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah , saying ,
thus saith jehovah of hosts : behold , i will break the bow of elam , the chief of their might .
and i will set my throne in elam , and will destroy from thence king and princes , saith jehovah .
but it shall come to pass in the latter days , that i will bring back the captivity of elam , saith jehovah .
the word that jehovah spake concerning babylon , concerning the land of the chaldeans , by jeremiah the prophet .
they shall inquire concerning zion with their faces thitherward , saying , come ye , and join yourselves to jehovah in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten .
flee out of the midst of babylon , and go forth out of the land of the chaldeans , and be as the he-goats before the flocks .
and chaldea shall be a prey : all that prey upon her shall be satisfied , saith jehovah .
a sound of battle is in the land , and of great destruction .
how is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken ! how is babylon become a desolation among the nations !
come against her from the utmost border ; open her store-houses ; cast her up as heaps , and destroy her utterly ; let nothing of her be left .
slay all her bullocks ; let them go down to the slaughter : woe unto them ! for their day is come , the time of their visitation .
therefore shall her young men fall in her streets , and all her men of war shall be brought to silence in that day , saith jehovah .
a sword is upon the chaldeans , saith jehovah , and upon the inhabitants of babylon , and upon her princes , and upon her wise men .
a sword is upon the boasters , and they shall become fools ; a sword is upon her mighty men , and they shall be dismayed .
a drought is upon her waters , and they shall be dried up ; for it is a land of graven images , and they are mad over idols .
behold , a people cometh from the north ; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth .
at the noise of the taking of babylon the earth trembleth , and the cry is heard among the nations .
thus saith jehovah : behold , i will raise up against babylon , and against them that dwell in leb-kamai , a destroying wind .
and they shall fall down slain in the land of the chaldeans , and thrust through in her streets .
babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed : wail for her ; take balm for her pain , if so be she may be healed .
jehovah hath brought forth our righteousness : come , and let us declare in zion the work of jehovah our god .
o thou that dwellest upon many waters , abundant in treasures , thine end is come , the measure of thy covetousness .
he hath made the earth by his power , he hath established the world by his wisdom , and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens .
they are vanity , a work of delusion : in the time of their visitation they shall perish .
thou art my battle-axe and weapons of war : and with thee will i break in pieces the nations ; and with thee will i destroy kingdoms ;
and with thee will i break in pieces the horse and his rider ;
and i will render unto babylon and to all the inhabitants of chaldea all their evil that they have done in zion in your sight , saith jehovah .
and they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner , nor a stone for foundations ; but thou shalt be desolate for ever , saith jehovah .
prepare against her the nations , the kings of the medes , the governors thereof , and all the deputies thereof , and all the land of their dominion .
one post shall run to meet another , and one messenger to meet another , to show the king of babylon that his city is taken on every quarter :
and the passages are seized , and the reeds they have burned with fire , and the men of war are affrighted .
and babylon shall become heaps , a dwelling-place for jackals , an astonishment , and a hissing , without inhabitant .
they shall roar together like young lions ; they shall growl as lions ’ whelps .
i will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter , like rams with he-goats .
how is sheshach taken ! and the praise of the whole earth seized ! how is babylon become a desolation among the nations !
the sea is come up upon babylon ; she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof .
my people , go ye out of the midst of her , and save yourselves every man from the fierce anger of jehovah .
as babylon hath caused the slain of israel to fall , so at babylon shall fall the slain of all the land .
ye that have escaped the sword , go ye , stand not still ; remember jehovah from afar , and let jerusalem come into your mind .
we are confounded , because we have heard reproach ; confusion hath covered our faces : for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of jehovah ’ s house .
the sound of a cry from babylon , and of great destruction from the land of the chaldeans !
and jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon babylon , even all these words that are written concerning babylon .
and jeremiah said to seraiah , when thou comest to babylon , then see that thou read all these words ,
and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah , according to all that jehoiakim had done .
for through the anger of jehovah did it come to pass in jerusalem and judah , until he had cast them out from his presence .
so the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king zedekiah .
but the army of the chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
then they took the king , and carried him up unto the king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath ; and he gave judgment upon him .
and the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah before his eyes : he slew also all the princes of judah in riblah .
and all the army of the chaldeans , that were with the captain of the guard , brake down all the walls of jerusalem round about .
but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen .
and there were ninety and six pomegranates on the sides ; all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network round about .
and the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest , and zephaniah the second priest , and the three keepers of the threshold :
and nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of babylon to riblah .
this is the people whom nebuchadrezzar carried away captive : in the seventh year three thousand jews and three and twenty ;
in the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons ;
and he spake kindly to him , and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in babylon ,
and changed his prison garments . and jehoiachin did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life :
and there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters .
now it came to pass on the day when the sons of god came to present themselves before jehovah , that satan also came among them .
then satan answered jehovah , and said , doth job fear god for nought ?
but put forth thy hand now , and touch all that he hath , and he will renounce thee to thy face .
and it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother ’ s house ,
that there came a messenger unto job , and said , the oxen were plowing , and the asses feeding beside them ;
then job arose , and rent his robe , and shaved his head , and fell down upon the ground , and worshipped ;
in all this job sinned not , nor charged god foolishly .
and satan answered jehovah , and said , skin for skin , yea , all that a man hath will he give for his life .
but put forth thy hand now , and touch his bone and his flesh , and he will renounce thee to thy face .
and jehovah said unto satan , behold , he is in thy hand ; only spare his life .
so satan went forth from the presence of jehovah , and smote job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown .
and he took him a potsherd to scrape himself therewith ; and he sat among the ashes .
then said his wife unto him , dost thou still hold fast thine integrity ? renounce god , and die .
after this opened job his mouth , and cursed his day .
and job answered and said :
let the day perish wherein i was born ,
let that day be darkness ;
let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own ;
as for that night , let thick darkness seize upon it :
lo , let that night be barren ;
let them curse it that curse the day ,
let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark :
because it shut not up the doors of my mother ’ s womb ,
why died i not from the womb ?
why did the knees receive me ?
for now should i have lain down and been quiet ;
with kings and counsellors of the earth ,
or with princes that had gold ,
or as a hidden untimely birth i had not been ,
there the wicked cease from troubling ;
there the prisoners are at ease together ;
the small and the great are there :
wherefore is light given to him that is in misery ,
who long for death , but it cometh not ,
why is light given to a man whose way is hid ,
for my sighing cometh before i eat ,
for the thing which i fear cometh upon me ,
i am not at ease , neither am i quiet , neither have i rest ;
then answered eliphaz the temanite , and said ,
if one assay to commune with thee , wilt thou be grieved ?
behold , thou hast instructed many ,
thy words have upholden him that was falling ,
but now it is come unto thee , and thou faintest ;
is not thy fear of god thy confidence ,
remember , i pray thee , who ever perished , being innocent ?
according as i have seen , they that plow iniquity ,
by the breath of god they perish ,
the roaring of the lion , and the voice of the fierce lion ,
the old lion perisheth for lack of prey ,
now a thing was secretly brought to me ,
in thoughts from the visions of the night ,
fear came upon me , and trembling ,
then a spirit passed before my face ;
it stood still , but i could not discern the appearance thereof ;
shall mortal man be more just than god ?
behold , he putteth no trust in his servants ;
how much more them that dwell in houses of clay ,
betwixt morning and evening they are destroyed :
is not their tent-cord plucked up within them ?
call now ; is there any that will answer thee ?
for vexation killeth the foolish man ,
i have seen the foolish taking root :
his children are far from safety ,
whose harvest the hungry eateth up ,
for affliction cometh not forth from the dust ,
but man is born unto trouble ,
but as for me , i would seek unto god ,
who doeth great things and unsearchable ,
who giveth rain upon the earth ,
so that he setteth up on high those that are low ,
he frustrateth the devices of the crafty ,
he taketh the wise in their own craftiness ;
they meet with darkness in the day-time ,
but he saveth from the sword of their mouth ,
so the poor hath hope ,
behold , happy is the man whom god correcteth :
for he maketh sore , and bindeth up ;
he will deliver thee in six troubles ;
in famine he will redeem thee from death ;
thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue ;
at destruction and dearth thou shalt laugh ;
for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field ;
and thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace ;
thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great ,
thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age ,
lo this , we have searched it , so it is ;
then job answered and said ,
oh that my vexation were but weighed ,
for now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas :
for the arrows of the almighty are within me ,
doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass ?
can that which hath no savor be eaten without salt ?
my soul refuseth to touch them ;
oh that i might have my request ;
even that it would please god to crush me ;
and be it still my consolation ,
what is my strength , that i should wait ?
is my strength the strength of stones ?
is it not that i have no help in me ,
to him that is ready to faint kindness should be showed from his friend ;
my brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook ,
which are black by reason of the ice ,
what time they wax warm , they vanish ;
the caravans that travel by the way of them turn aside ;
the caravans of tema looked ,
they were put to shame because they had hoped ;
for now ye are nothing ;
did i say , give unto me ?
or , deliver me from the adversary ’ s hand ?
teach me , and i will hold my peace ;
how forcible are words of uprightness !
do ye think to reprove words ,
yea , ye would cast lots upon the fatherless ,
now therefore be pleased to look upon me ;
return , i pray you , let there be no injustice ;
is there injustice on my tongue ?
is there not a warfare to man upon earth ?
as a servant that earnestly desireth the shadow ,
so am i made to possess months of misery ,
when i lie down , i say ,
my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust ;
my days are swifter than a weaver ’ s shuttle ,
oh remember that my life is a breath :
the eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more ;
as the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away ,
he shall return no more to his house ,
therefore i will not refrain my mouth ;
am i a sea , or a sea-monster ,
when i say , my bed shall comfort me ,
then thou scarest me with dreams ,
so that my soul chooseth strangling ,
i loathe my life ; i would not live alway :
what is man , that thou shouldest magnify him ,
and that thou shouldest visit him every morning ,
how long wilt thou not look away from me ,
if i have sinned , what do i unto thee , o thou watcher of men ?
and why dost thou not pardon my transgression , and take away mine iniquity ?
then answered bildad the shuhite , and said ,
how long wilt thou speak these things ?
doth god pervert justice ?
if thy children have sinned against him ,
if thou wouldest seek diligently unto god ,
if thou wert pure and upright :
and though thy beginning was small ,
for inquire , i pray thee , of the former age ,
( for we are but of yesterday , and know nothing ,
shall not they teach thee , and tell thee ,
can the rush grow up without mire ?
whilst it is yet in its greenness , and not cut down ,
so are the paths of all that forget god ;
whose confidence shall break in sunder ,
he shall lean upon his house , but it shall not stand :
he is green before the sun ,
his roots are wrapped about the stone-heap ,
if he be destroyed from his place ,
behold , this is the joy of his way ;
behold , god will not cast away a perfect man ,
he will yet fill thy mouth with laughter ,
they that hate thee shall be clothed with shame ;
then job answered and said ,
of a truth i know that it is so :
if he be pleased to contend with him ,
he is wise in heart , and mighty in strength :
him that removeth the mountains , and they know it not ,
that shaketh the earth out of its place ,
that commandeth the sun , and it riseth not ,
that alone stretcheth out the heavens ,
that maketh the bear , orion , and the pleiades ,
that doeth great things past finding out ,
lo , he goeth by me , and i see him not :
behold , he seizeth the prey , who can hinder him ?
god will not withdraw his anger ;
how much less shall i answer him ,
whom , though i were righteous , yet would i not answer ;
if i had called , and he had answered me ,
for he breaketh me with a tempest ,
he will not suffer me to take my breath ,
if we speak of strength , lo , he is mighty !
though i be righteous , mine own mouth shall condemn me :
i am perfect ; i regard not myself ;
it is all one ; therefore i say ,
if the scourge slay suddenly ,
the earth is given into the hand of the wicked ;
now my days are swifter than a post :
they are passed away as the swift ships ;
if i say , i will forget my complaint ,
i am afraid of all my sorrows ,
i shall be condemned ;
if i wash myself with snow water ,
yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch ,
for he is not a man , as i am , that i should answer him ,
there is no umpire betwixt us ,
let him take his rod away from me ,
then would i speak , and not fear him ;
my soul is weary of my life ;
i will say unto god , do not condemn me ;
is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress ,
hast thou eyes of flesh ?
are thy days as the days of man ,
that thou inquirest after mine iniquity ,
although thou knowest that i am not wicked ,
thy hands have framed me and fashioned me
remember , i beseech thee , that thou hast fashioned me as clay ;
hast thou not poured me out as milk ,
thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh ,
thou hast granted me life and lovingkindness ;
yet these things thou didst hide in thy heart ;
if i sin , then thou markest me ,
if i be wicked , woe unto me ;
and if my head exalt itself , thou huntest me as a lion ;
thou renewest thy witnesses against me ,
wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb ?
i should have been as though i had not been ;
are not my days few ? cease then ,
before i go whence i shall not return ,
the land dark as midnight ,
then answered zophar the naamathite , and said ,
should not the multitude of words be answered ?
should thy boastings make men hold their peace ?
for thou sayest , my doctrine is pure ,
but oh that god would speak ,
and that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom !
canst thou by searching find out god ?
it is high as heaven ; what canst thou do ?
the measure thereof is longer than the earth ,
if he pass through , and shut up ,
for he knoweth false men :
but vain man is void of understanding ,
if thou set thy heart aright ,
if iniquity be in thy hand , put it far away ,
surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot ;
for thou shalt forget thy misery ;
and thy life shall be clearer than the noonday ;
and thou shalt be secure , because there is hope ;
also thou shalt lie down , and none shall make thee afraid ;
but the eyes of the wicked shall fail ,
then job answered and said ,
no doubt but ye are the people ,
but i have understanding as well as you ;
i am as one that is a laughing-stock to his neighbor ,
in the thought of him that is at ease there is contempt for misfortune ;
the tents of robbers prosper ,
but ask now the beasts , and they shall teach thee ;
or speak to the earth , and it shall teach thee ;
who knoweth not in all these ,
in whose hand is the soul of every living thing ,
doth not the ear try words ,
with aged men is wisdom ,
with god is wisdom and might ;
behold , he breaketh down , and it can not be built again ;
behold , he withholdeth the waters , and they dry up ;
with him is strength and wisdom ;
he leadeth counsellors away stripped ,
he looseth the bond of kings ,
he leadeth priests away stripped ,
he removeth the speech of the trusty ,
he poureth contempt upon princes ,
he uncovereth deep things out of darkness ,
he increaseth the nations , and he destroyeth them :
he taketh away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth ,
they grope in the dark without light ;
lo , mine eye hath seen all this ,
what ye know , the same do i know also :
surely i would speak to the almighty ,
but ye are forgers of lies ;
oh that ye would altogether hold your peace !
hear now my reasoning ,
will ye speak unrighteously for god ,
will ye show partiality to him ?
is it good that he should search you out ?
he will surely reprove you ,
shall not his majesty make you afraid ,
your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes ,
hold your peace , let me alone , that i may speak ;
wherefore should i take my flesh in my teeth ,
behold , he will slay me ; i have no hope :
this also shall be my salvation ,
hear diligently my speech ,
behold now , i have set my cause in order ;
who is he that will contend with me ?
only do not two things unto me ;
withdraw thy hand far from me ;
then call thou , and i will answer ;
how many are mine iniquities and sins ?
wherefore hidest thou thy face ,
wilt thou harass a driven leaf ?
for thou writest bitter things against me ,
thou puttest my feet also in the stocks ,
though i am like a rotten thing that consumeth ,
man , that is born of a woman ,
he cometh forth like a flower , and is cut down :
and dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one ,
who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean ? not one .
seeing his days are determined ,
look away from him , that he may rest ,
for there is hope of a tree ,
though the root thereof wax old in the earth ,
yet through the scent of water it will bud ,
but man dieth , and is laid low :
as the waters fail from the sea ,
so man lieth down and riseth not :
oh that thou wouldest hide me in sheol ,
if a man die , shall he live again ?
thou wouldest call , and i would answer thee :
but now thou numberest my steps :
my transgression is sealed up in a bag ,
but the mountain falling cometh to nought ;
the waters wear the stones ;
thou prevailest for ever against him , and he passeth ;
his sons come to honor , and he knoweth it not ;
but his flesh upon him hath pain ,
then answered eliphaz the temanite , and said ,
should a wise man make answer with vain knowledge ,
should he reason with unprofitable talk ,
yea , thou doest away with fear ,
for thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth ,
thine own mouth condemneth thee , and not i ;
art thou the first man that was born ?
hast thou heard the secret counsel of god ?
what knowest thou , that we know not ?
with us are both the grayheaded and the very aged men ,
are the consolations of god too small for thee ,
why doth thy heart carry thee away ?
that against god thou turnest thy spirit ,
what is man , that he should be clean ?
behold , he putteth no trust in his holy ones ;
how much less one that is abominable and corrupt ,
i will show thee , hear thou me ;
( which wise men have told
unto whom alone the land was given ,
the wicked man travaileth with pain all his days ,
a sound of terrors is in his ears ;
he believeth not that he shall return out of darkness ,
he wandereth abroad for bread , saying , where is it ?
distress and anguish make him afraid ;
because he hath stretched out his hand against god ,
he runneth upon him with a stiff neck ,
because he hath covered his face with his fatness ,
and he hath dwelt in desolate cities ,
he shall not be rich , neither shall his substance continue ,
he shall not depart out of darkness ;
let him not trust in vanity , deceiving himself ;
it shall be accomplished before his time ,
he shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine ,
for the company of the godless shall be barren ,
they conceive mischief , and bring forth iniquity ,
then job answered and said ,
i have heard many such things :
shall vain words have an end ?
i also could speak as ye do ;
but i would strengthen you with my mouth ,
though i speak , my grief is not assuaged ;
but now he hath made me weary :
and thou hast laid fast hold on me , which is a witness against me :
he hath torn me in his wrath , and persecuted me ;
they have gaped upon me with their mouth ;
god delivereth me to the ungodly ,
i was at ease , and he brake me asunder ;
his archers compass me round about ;
he breaketh me with breach upon breach ;
i have sewed sackcloth upon my skin ,
my face is red with weeping ,
although there is no violence in my hands ,
o earth , cover not thou my blood ,
even now , behold , my witness is in heaven ,
my friends scoff at me :
that he would maintain the right of a man with god ,
for when a few years are come ,
my spirit is consumed , my days are extinct ,
surely there are mockers with me ,
give now a pledge , be surety for me with thyself ;
for thou hast hid their heart from understanding :
he that denounceth his friends for a prey ,
but he hath made me a byword of the people ;
mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow ,
upright men shall be astonished at this ,
yet shall the righteous hold on his way ,
but as for you all , come on now again ;
my days are past , my purposes are broken off ,
they change the night into day :
if i look for sheol as my house ;
if i have said to corruption , thou art my father ;
where then is my hope ?
it shall go down to the bars of sheol ,
then answered bildad the shuhite , and said ,
how long will ye hunt for words ?
wherefore are we counted as beasts ,
thou that tearest thyself in thine anger ,
yea , the light of the wicked shall be put out ,
the light shall be dark in his tent ,
the steps of his strength shall be straitened ,
for he is cast into a net by his own feet ,
a gin shall take him by the heel ,
a noose is hid for him in the ground ,
terrors shall make him afraid on every side ,
his strength shall be hunger-bitten ,
the members of his body shall be devoured ,
he shall be rooted out of his tent wherein he trusteth ;
there shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his :
his roots shall be dried up beneath ,
his remembrance shall perish from the earth ,
he shall be driven from light into darkness ,
he shall have neither son nor son ’ s son among his people ,
they that come after shall be astonished at his day ,
surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous ,
then job answered and said ,
how long will ye vex my soul ,
these ten times have ye reproached me :
and be it indeed that i have erred ,
if indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me ,
know now that god hath subverted me in my cause ,
behold , i cry out of wrong , but i am not heard :
he hath walled up my way that i can not pass ,
he hath stripped me of my glory ,
he hath broken me down on every side , and i am gone ;
he hath also kindled his wrath against me ,
his troops come on together ,
he hath put my brethren far from me ,
my kinsfolk have failed ,
they that dwell in my house , and my maids , count me for a stranger :
i call unto my servant , and he giveth me no answer ,
my breath is strange to my wife ,
even young children despise me ;
all my familiar friends abhor me ,
my bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh ,
have pity upon me , have pity upon me , o ye my friends ;
why do ye persecute me as god ,
oh that my words were now written !
that with an iron pen and lead
but as for me i know that my redeemer liveth ,
and after my skin , even this body , is destroyed ,
whom i , even i , shall see , on my side ,
if ye say , how we will persecute him !
be ye afraid of the sword :
then answered zophar the naamathite , and said ,
therefore do my thoughts give answer to me ,
i have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame ;
knowest thou not this of old time ,
that the triumphing of the wicked is short ,
though his height mount up to the heavens ,
yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung :
he shall fly away as a dream , and shall not be found :
the eye which saw him shall see him no more ;
his children shall seek the favor of the poor ,
his bones are full of his youth ,
though wickedness be sweet in his mouth ,
though he spare it , and will not let it go ,
yet his food in his bowels is turned ,
he hath swallowed down riches , and he shall vomit them up again ;
he shall suck the poison of asps :
he shall not look upon the rivers ,
that which he labored for shall he restore , and shall not swallow it down ;
for he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor ;
because he knew no quietness within him ,
there was nothing left that he devoured not ;
in the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits :
when he is about to fill his belly , god will cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him ,
he shall flee from the iron weapon ,
he draweth it forth , and it cometh out of his body ;
all darkness is laid up for his treasures :
the heavens shall reveal his iniquity ,
the increase of his house shall depart ;
this is the portion of a wicked man from god ,
then job answered and said ,
hear diligently my speech ;
suffer me , and i also will speak ;
as for me , is my complaint to man ?
mark me , and be astonished ,
even when i remember i am troubled ,
wherefore do the wicked live ,
their seed is established with them in their sight ,
their houses are safe from fear ,
their bull gendereth , and faileth not ;
they send forth their little ones like a flock ,
they sing to the timbrel and harp ,
they spend their days in prosperity ,
and they say unto god , depart from us ;
what is the almighty , that we should serve him ?
lo , their prosperity is not in their hand :
how oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out ?
that they are as stubble before the wind ,
ye say , god layeth up his iniquity for his children .
let his own eyes see his destruction ,
for what careth he for his house after him ,
shall any teach god knowledge ,
one dieth in his full strength ,
his pails are full of milk ,
and another dieth in bitterness of soul ,
they lie down alike in the dust ,
behold , i know your thoughts ,
for ye say , where is the house of the prince ?
have ye not asked wayfaring men ?
that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity ?
who shall declare his way to his face ?
yet shall he be borne to the grave ,
the clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him ,
how then comfort ye me in vain ,
then answered eliphaz the temanite , and said ,
can a man be profitable unto god ?
is it any pleasure to the almighty , that thou art righteous ?
is it for thy fear of him that he reproveth thee ,
is not thy wickedness great ?
for thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought ,
thou hast not given water to the weary to drink ,
but as for the mighty man , he had the earth ;
thou hast sent widows away empty ,
therefore snares are round about thee ,
or darkness , so that thou canst not see ,
is not god in the height of heaven ?
and thou sayest , what doth god know ?
thick clouds are a covering to him , so that he seeth not ;
wilt thou keep the old way
who were snatched away before their time ,
who said unto god , depart from us ;
yet he filled their houses with good things :
the righteous see it , and are glad ;
saying , surely they that did rise up against us are cut off ,
acquaint now thyself with him , and be at peace :
receive , i pray thee , the law from his mouth ,
if thou return to the almighty , thou shalt be built up ,
and lay thou thy treasure in the dust ,
and the almighty will be thy treasure ,
for then shalt thou delight thyself in the almighty ,
thou shalt make thy prayer unto him , and he will hear thee ;
thou shalt also decree a thing , and it shall be established unto thee ;
when they cast thee down , thou shalt say , there is lifting up ;
he will deliver even him that is not innocent :
then job answered and said ,
even to-day is my complaint rebellious :
oh that i knew where i might find him !
i would set my cause in order before him ,
i would know the words which he would answer me ,
would he contend with me in the greatness of his power ?
there the upright might reason with him ;
behold , i go forward , but he is not there ;
on the left hand , when he doth work , but i can not behold him ;
but he knoweth the way that i take ;
my foot hath held fast to his steps ;
i have not gone back from the commandment of his lips ;
but he is in one mind , and who can turn him ?
for he performeth that which is appointed for me :
therefore am i terrified at his presence ;
for god hath made my heart faint ,
because i was not cut off before the darkness ,
why are times not laid up by the almighty ?
there are that remove the landmarks ;
they drive away the ass of the fatherless ;
they turn the needy out of the way :
behold , as wild asses in the desert
they cut their provender in the field ;
they lie all night naked without clothing ,
they are wet with the showers of the mountains ,
there are that pluck the fatherless from the breast ,
so that they go about naked without clothing ,
they make oil within the walls of these men ;
from out of the populous city men groan ,
these are of them that rebel against the light ;
the murderer riseth with the light ;
the eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight ,
in the dark they dig through houses :
for the morning is to all of them as thick darkness ;
swiftly they pass away upon the face of the waters ;
drought and heat consume the snow waters :
the womb shall forget him ;
he devoureth the barren that beareth not ,
yet god preserveth the mighty by his power :
god giveth them to be in security , and they rest thereon ;
they are exalted ; yet a little while , and they are gone ;
and if it be not so now , who will prove me a liar ,
then answered bildad the shuhite , and said ,
dominion and fear are with him ;
is there any number of his armies ?
how then can man be just with god ?
behold , even the moon hath no brightness ,
how much less man , that is a worm !
then job answered and said ,
how hast thou helped him that is without power !
how hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom ,
to whom hast thou uttered words ?
they that are deceased tremble
sheol is naked before god ,
he stretcheth out the north over empty space ,
he bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds ;
he incloseth the face of his throne ,
he hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters ,
the pillars of heaven tremble
he stirreth up the sea with his power ,
by his spirit the heavens are garnished ;
lo , these are but the outskirts of his ways :
and job again took up his parable , and said ,
as god liveth , who hath taken away my right ,
( for my life is yet whole in me ,
surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness ,
far be it from me that i should justify you :
my righteousness i hold fast , and will not let it go :
let mine enemy be as the wicked ,
for what is the hope of the godless , though he get him gain ,
will god hear his cry ,
will he delight himself in the almighty ,
i will teach you concerning the hand of god ;
behold , all ye yourselves have seen it ;
this is the portion of a wicked man with god ,
if his children be multiplied , it is for the sword ;
those that remain of him shall be buried in death ,
though he heap up silver as the dust ,
he may prepare it , but the just shall put it on ,
he buildeth his house as the moth ,
he lieth down rich , but he shall not be gathered to his fathers ;
terrors overtake him like waters ;
the east wind carrieth him away , and he departeth ;
for god shall hurl at him , and not spare :
men shall clap their hands at him ,
surely there is a mine for silver ,
iron is taken out of the earth ,
man setteth an end to darkness ,
he breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn ;
as for the earth , out of it cometh bread ;
the stones thereof are the place of sapphires ,
that path no bird of prey knoweth ,
the proud beasts have not trodden it ,
he putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock ;
he cutteth out channels among the rocks ;
he bindeth the streams that they trickle not ;
but where shall wisdom be found ?
man knoweth not the price thereof ;
the deep saith , it is not in me ;
it can not be gotten for gold ,
it can not be valued with the gold of ophir ,
gold and glass can not equal it ,
no mention shall be made of coral or of crystal :
the topaz of ethiopia shall not equal it ,
whence then cometh wisdom ?
seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living ,
destruction and death say ,
god understandeth the way thereof ,
for he looketh to the ends of the earth ,
to make a weight for the wind :
when he made a decree for the rain ,
then did he see it , and declare it ;
and unto man he said ,
and job again took up his parable , and said ,
oh that i were as in the months of old ,
when his lamp shined upon my head ,
as i was in the ripeness of my days ,
when the almighty was yet with me ,
when my steps were washed with butter ,
when i went forth to the gate unto the city ,
the young men saw me and hid themselves ,
the princes refrained from talking ,
the voice of the nobles was hushed ,
for when the ear heard me , then it blessed me ;
because i delivered the poor that cried ,
the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me ;
i put on righteousness , and it clothed me :
i was eyes to the blind ,
i was a father to the needy :
and i brake the jaws of the unrighteous ,
then i said , i shall die in my nest ,
my root is spread out to the waters ,
my glory is fresh in me ,
unto me men gave ear , and waited ,
after my words they spake not again ;
and they waited for me as for the rain ;
i smiled on them , when they had no confidence ;
i chose out their way , and sat as chief ,
but now they that are younger than i have me in derision ,
yea , the strength of their hands , whereto should it profit me ?
they are gaunt with want and famine ;
they pluck salt-wort by the bushes ;
they are driven forth from the midst of men ;
so that they dwell in frightful valleys ,
among the bushes they bray ;
they are children of fools , yea , children of base men ;
and now i am become their song ,
they abhor me , they stand aloof from me ,
for he hath loosed his cord , and afflicted me ;
upon my right hand rise the rabble ;
they mar my path ,
as through a wide breach they come :
terrors are turned upon me ;
and now my soul is poured out within me ;
in the night season my bones are pierced in me ,
by god ’ s great force is my garment disfigured ;
he hath cast me into the mire ,
i cry unto thee , and thou dost not answer me :
thou art turned to be cruel to me ;
thou liftest me up to the wind , thou causest me to ride upon it ;
for i know that thou wilt bring me to death ,
howbeit doth not one stretch out the hand in his fall ?
did not i weep for him that was in trouble ?
when i looked for good , then evil came ;
my heart is troubled , and resteth not ;
i go mourning without the sun :
i am a brother to jackals ,
my skin is black , and falleth from me ,
therefore is my harp turned to mourning ,
i made a covenant with mine eyes ;
for what is the portion from god above ,
is it not calamity to the unrighteous ,
doth not he see my ways ,
if i have walked with falsehood ,
( let me be weighed in an even balance ,
if my step hath turned out of the way ,
then let me sow , and let another eat ;
if my heart hath been enticed unto a woman ,
then let my wife grind unto another ,
for that were a heinous crime ;
for it is a fire that consumeth unto destruction ,
if i have despised the cause of my man-servant or of my maid-servant ,
what then shall i do when god riseth up ?
did not he that made me in the womb make him ?
if i have withheld the poor from their desire ,
or have eaten my morsel alone ,
( nay , from my youth he grew up with me as with a father ,
if i have seen any perish for want of clothing ,
if his loins have not blessed me ,
if i have lifted up my hand against the fatherless ,
then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade ,
for calamity from god is a terror to me ,
if i have made gold my hope ,
if i have rejoiced because my wealth was great ,
if i have beheld the sun when it shined ,
and my heart hath been secretly enticed ,
this also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges ;
if i have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me ,
( yea , i have not suffered my mouth to sin
if the men of my tent have not said ,
( the sojourner hath not lodged in the street ;
if like adam i have covered my transgressions ,
because i feared the great multitude ,
oh that i had one to hear me !
surely i would carry it upon my shoulder ;
i would declare unto him the number of my steps ;
if my land crieth out against me ,
if i have eaten the fruits thereof without money ,
let thistles grow instead of wheat ,
so these three men ceased to answer job , because he was righteous in his own eyes .
also against his three friends was his wrath kindled , because they had found no answer , and yet had condemned job .
now elihu had waited to speak unto job , because they were elder than he .
and when elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men , his wrath was kindled .
and elihu the son of barachel the buzite answered and said ,
i said , days should speak ,
but there is a spirit in man ,
it is not the great that are wise ,
therefore i said , hearken to me ;
behold , i waited for your words ,
yea , i attended unto you ,
beware lest ye say , we have found wisdom ;
for he hath not directed his words against me ;
they are amazed , they answer no more :
and shall i wait , because they speak not ,
i also will answer my part ,
for i am full of words ;
behold , my breast is as wine which hath no vent ;
i will speak , that i may be refreshed ;
let me not , i pray you , respect any man ’ s person ;
for i know not to give flattering titles ;
howbeit , job , i pray thee , hear my speech ,
behold now , i have opened my mouth ;
my words shall utter the uprightness of my heart ;
the spirit of god hath made me ,
if thou canst , answer thou me ;
behold , i am toward god even as thou art :
behold , my terror shall not make thee afraid ,
surely thou hast spoken in my hearing ,
i am clean , without transgression ;
behold , he findeth occasions against me ,
he putteth my feet in the stocks ,
behold , i will answer thee , in this thou art not just ;
why dost thou strive against him ,
for god speaketh once ,
in a dream , in a vision of the night ,
then he openeth the ears of men ,
that he may withdraw man from his purpose ,
he keepeth back his soul from the pit ,
he is chastened also with pain upon his bed ,
so that his life abhorreth bread ,
his flesh is consumed away , that it can not be seen ;
yea , his soul draweth near unto the pit ,
if there be with him an angel ,
then god is gracious unto him , and saith ,
his flesh shall be fresher than a child ’ s ;
he prayeth unto god , and he is favorable unto him ,
he singeth before men , and saith ,
he hath redeemed my soul from going into the pit ,
lo , all these things doth god work ,
to bring back his soul from the pit ,
mark well , o job , hearken unto me :
if thou hast anything to say , answer me :
if not , hearken thou unto me :
moreover elihu answered and said ,
hear my words , ye wise men ;
for the ear trieth words ,
let us choose for us that which is right :
for job hath said , i am righteous ,
notwithstanding my right i am accounted a liar ;
what man is like job ,
who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity ,
for he hath said , it profiteth a man nothing
therefore hearken unto me , ye men of understanding :
for the work of a man will he render unto him ,
yea , of a surety , god will not do wickedly ,
who gave him a charge over the earth ?
if he set his heart upon himself ,
all flesh shall perish together ,
if now thou hast understanding , hear this :
shall even one that hateth justice govern ?
him that saith to a king , thou art vile ,
that respecteth not the persons of princes ,
in a moment they die , even at midnight ;
for his eyes are upon the ways of a man ,
there is no darkness , nor thick gloom ,
for he needeth not further to consider a man ,
he breaketh in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out ,
therefore he taketh knowledge of their works ;
he striketh them as wicked men
because they turned aside from following him ,
so that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him ,
when he giveth quietness , who then can condemn ?
that the godless man reign not ,
for hath any said unto god ,
that which i see not teach thou me :
shall his recompense be as thou wilt , that thou refusest it ?
men of understanding will say unto me ,
job speaketh without knowledge ,
would that job were tried unto the end ,
for he addeth rebellion unto his sin ;
moreover elihu answered and said ,
thinkest thou this to be thy right ,
that thou sayest , what advantage will it be unto thee ?
i will answer thee ,
look unto the heavens , and see ;
if thou hast sinned , what effectest thou against him ?
if thou be righteous , what givest thou him ?
thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art ;
by reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out ;
but none saith , where is god my maker ,
who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth ,
there they cry , but none giveth answer ,
surely god will not hear an empty cry ,
how much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not ,
but now , because he hath not visited in his anger ,
therefore doth job open his mouth in vanity ;
elihu also proceeded , and said ,
suffer me a little , and i will show thee ;
i will fetch my knowledge from afar ,
for truly my words are not false :
behold , god is mighty , and despiseth not any :
he preserveth not the life of the wicked ,
he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous :
and if they be bound in fetters ,
then he showeth them their work ,
he openeth also their ear to instruction ,
if they hearken and serve him ,
but if they hearken not , they shall perish by the sword ,
but they that are godless in heart lay up anger :
they die in youth ,
he delivereth the afflicted by their affliction ,
yea , he would have allured thee out of distress
but thou art full of the judgment of the wicked :
for let not wrath stir thee up against chastisements ;
will thy cry avail , that thou be not in distress ,
desire not the night ,
take heed , regard not iniquity :
behold , god doeth loftily in his power :
who hath enjoined him his way ?
remember that thou magnify his work ,
all men have looked thereon ;
behold , god is great , and we know him not ;
for he draweth up the drops of water ,
which the skies pour down
yea , can any understand the spreadings of the clouds ,
behold , he spreadeth his light around him ;
for by these he judgeth the peoples ;
he covereth his hands with the lightning ,
the noise thereof telleth concerning him ,
yea , at this my heart trembleth ,
hear , oh , hear the noise of his voice ,
he sendeth it forth under the whole heaven ,
after it a voice roareth ;
god thundereth marvellously with his voice ;
for he saith to the snow , fall thou on the earth ;
he sealeth up the hand of every man ,
then the beasts go into coverts ,
out of the chamber of the south cometh the storm ,
by the breath of god ice is given ;
yea , he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture ;
and it is turned round about by his guidance ,
whether it be for correction , or for his land ,
hearken unto this , o job :
dost thou know how god layeth his charge upon them ,
dost thou know the balancings of the clouds ,
how thy garments are warm ,
canst thou with him spread out the sky ,
teach us what we shall say unto him ;
shall it be told him that i would speak ?
and now men see not the light which is bright in the skies ;
out of the north cometh golden splendor :
touching the almighty , we can not find him out :
men do therefore fear him :
then jehovah answered job out of the whirlwind , and said ,
who is this that darkeneth counsel
gird up now thy loins like a man ;
where wast thou when i laid the foundations of the earth ?
who determined the measures thereof , if thou knowest ?
whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened ?
when the morning stars sang together ,
or who shut up the sea with doors ,
when i made clouds the garment thereof ,
and marked out for it my bound ,
and said , hitherto shalt thou come , but no further ;
hast thou commanded the morning since thy days began ,
that it might take hold of the ends of the earth ,
it is changed as clay under the seal ;
and from the wicked their light is withholden ,
hast thou entered into the springs of the sea ?
have the gates of death been revealed unto thee ?
hast thou comprehended the earth in its breadth ?
where is the way to the dwelling of light ?
that thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof ,
doubtless , thou knowest , for thou wast then born ,
hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow ,
which i have reserved against the time of trouble ,
by what way is the light parted ,
who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood ,
to cause it to rain on a land where no man is ;
to satisfy the waste and desolate ground ,
hath the rain a father ?
out of whose womb came the ice ?
the waters hide themselves and become like stone ,
canst thou bind the cluster of the pleiades ,
canst thou lead forth the mazzaroth in their season ?
knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens ?
canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds ,
canst thou send forth lightnings , that they may go ,
who hath put wisdom in the inward parts ?
who can number the clouds by wisdom ?
when the dust runneth into a mass ,
canst thou hunt the prey for the lioness ,
when they couch in their dens ,
who provideth for the raven his prey ,
knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth ?
canst thou number the months that they fulfil ?
they bow themselves , they bring forth their young ,
their young ones become strong , they grow up in the open field ;
who hath sent out the wild ass free ?
whose home i have made the wilderness ,
he scorneth the tumult of the city ,
the range of the mountains is his pasture ,
will the wild-ox be content to serve thee ?
canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow ?
wilt thou trust him , because his strength is great ?
wilt thou confide in him , that he will bring home thy seed ,
the wings of the ostrich wave proudly ;
for she leaveth her eggs on the earth ,
and forgetteth that the foot may crush them ,
she dealeth hardly with her young ones , as if they were not hers :
because god hath deprived her of wisdom ,
what time she lifteth up herself on high ,
hast thou given the horse his might ?
hast thou made him to leap as a locust ?
he paweth in the valley , and rejoiceth in his strength :
he mocketh at fear , and is not dismayed ;
the quiver rattleth against him ,
he swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage ;
as oft as the trumpet soundeth he saith , aha !
is it by thy wisdom that the hawk soareth ,
is it at thy command that the eagle mounteth up ,
on the cliff she dwelleth , and maketh her home ,
from thence she spieth out the prey ;
her young ones also suck up blood :
moreover jehovah answered job , and said ,
shall he that cavilleth contend with the almighty ?
then job answered jehovah , and said ,
behold , i am of small account ; what shall i answer thee ?
once have i spoken , and i will not answer ;
then jehovah answered job out of the whirlwind , and said ,
gird up thy loins now like a man :
wilt thou even annul my judgment ?
or hast thou an arm like god ?
deck thyself now with excellency and dignity ;
pour forth the overflowings of thine anger ;
look on every one that is proud , and bring him low ;
hide them in the dust together ;
then will i also confess of thee
behold now , behemoth , which i made as well as thee ;
lo now , his strength is in his loins ,
he moveth his tail like a cedar :
his bones are as tubes of brass ;
he is the chief of the ways of god :
surely the mountains bring him forth food ,
he lieth under the lotus-trees ,
the lotus-trees cover him with their shade ;
behold , if a river overflow , he trembleth not ;
shall any take him when he is on the watch ,
canst thou draw out leviathan with a fishhook ?
canst thou put a rope into his nose ?
will he make many supplications unto thee ?
will he make a covenant with thee ,
wilt thou play with him as with a bird ?
will the bands of fishermen make traffic of him ?
canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons ,
lay thy hand upon him ;
behold , the hope of him is in vain :
none is so fierce that he dare stir him up ;
who hath first given unto me , that i should repay him ?
i will not keep silence concerning his limbs ,
who can strip off his outer garment ?
who can open the doors of his face ?
his strong scales are his pride ,
one is so near to another ,
they are joined one to another ;
his sneezings flash forth light ,
out of his mouth go burning torches ,
out of his nostrils a smoke goeth ,
his breath kindleth coals ,
in his neck abideth strength ,
the flakes of his flesh are joined together :
his heart is as firm as a stone ;
when he raiseth himself up , the mighty are afraid :
if one lay at him with the sword , it can not avail ;
he counteth iron as straw ,
the arrow can not make him flee :
clubs are counted as stubble :
his underparts are like sharp potsherds :
he maketh the deep to boil like a pot :
he maketh a path to shine after him ;
upon earth there is not his like ,
he beholdeth everything that is high :
then job answered jehovah , and said ,
i know that thou canst do all things ,
who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge ?
hear , i beseech thee , and i will speak ;
i had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear ;
wherefore i abhor myself ,
so eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite went , and did according as jehovah commanded them : and jehovah accepted job .
and jehovah turned the captivity of job , when he prayed for his friends : and jehovah gave job twice as much as he had before .
he had also seven sons and three daughters .
and he called the name of the first , jemimah ; and the name of the second , keziah ; and the name of the third , keren-happuch .
and in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of job : and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren .
and after this job lived a hundred and forty years , and saw his sons , and his sons ’ sons , even four generations .
so job died , being old and full of days .
the word of jehovah that came to joel the son of pethuel .
tell ye your children of it , and let your children tell their children , and their children another generation .
lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth .
the meal-offering and the drink-offering are cut off from the house of jehovah ; the priests , jehovah ’ s ministers , mourn .
the field is laid waste , the land mourneth ; for the grain is destroyed , the new wine is dried up , the oil languisheth .
be confounded , o ye husbandmen , wail , o ye vinedressers , for the wheat and for the barley ; for the harvest of the field is perished .
alas for the day ! for the day of jehovah is at hand , and as destruction from the almighty shall it come .
is not the food cut off before our eyes , yea , joy and gladness from the house of our god ?
the seeds rot under their clods ; the garners are laid desolate , the barns are broken down ; for the grain is withered .
how do the beasts groan ! the herds of cattle are perplexed , because they have no pasture ; yea , the flocks of sheep are made desolate .
yea , the beasts of the field pant unto thee ; for the water brooks are dried up , and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness .
the appearance of them is as the appearance of horses ; and as horsemen , so do they run .
at their presence the peoples are in anguish ; all faces are waxed pale .
neither doth one thrust another ; they march every one in his path ; and they burst through the weapons , and break not off their course .
they leap upon the city ; they run upon the wall ; they climb up into the houses ; they enter in at the windows like a thief .
the earth quaketh before them ; the heavens tremble ; the sun and the moon are darkened , and the stars withdraw their shining .
yet even now , saith jehovah , turn ye unto me with all your heart , and with fasting , and with weeping , and with mourning :
who knoweth whether he will not turn and repent , and leave a blessing behind him , even a meal-offering and a drink-offering unto jehovah your god ?
blow the trumpet in zion , sanctify a fast , call a solemn assembly ;
then was jehovah jealous for his land , and had pity on his people .
fear not , o land , be glad and rejoice ; for jehovah hath done great things .
and the floors shall be full of wheat , and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil .
and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit .
and i will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth : blood , and fire , and pillars of smoke .
the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and terrible day of jehovah cometh .
for , behold , in those days , and in that time , when i shall bring back the captivity of judah and jerusalem ,
and have cast lots for my people , and have given a boy for a harlot , and sold a girl for wine , that they may drink .
forasmuch as ye have taken my silver and my gold , and have carried into your temples my goodly precious things ,
and have sold the children of judah and the children of jerusalem unto the sons of the grecians , that ye may remove them far from their border ;
behold , i will stir them up out of the place whither ye have sold them , and will return your recompense upon your own head ;
proclaim ye this among the nations ; prepare war ; stir up the mighty men ; let all the men of war draw near , let them come up .
beat your plowshares into swords , and your pruning-hooks into spears : let the weak say , i am strong .
haste ye , and come , all ye nations round about , and gather yourselves together : thither cause thy mighty ones to come down , o jehovah .
let the nations bestir themselves , and come up to the valley of jehoshaphat ; for there will i sit to judge all the nations round about .
multitudes , multitudes in the valley of decision ! for the day of jehovah is near in the valley of decision .
the sun and the moon are darkened , and the stars withdraw their shining .
but judah shall abide for ever , and jerusalem from generation to generation .
and i will cleanse their blood , that i have not cleansed : for jehovah dwelleth in zion .
in the beginning was the word , and the word was with god , and the word was god .
the same was in the beginning with god .
all things were made through him ; and without him was not anything made that hath been made .
in him was life ; and the life was the light of men .
and the light shineth in the darkness ; and the darkness apprehended it not .
there came a man , sent from god , whose name was john .
the same came for witness , that he might bear witness of the light , that all might believe through him .
he was not the light , but came that he might bear witness of the light .
there was the true light , even the light which lighteth every man , coming into the world .
he was in the world , and the world was made through him , and the world knew him not .
he came unto his own , and they that were his own received him not .
but as many as received him , to them gave he the right to become children of god , even to them that believe on his name :
who were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of god .
for of his fulness we all received , and grace for grace .
for the law was given through moses ; grace and truth came through jesus christ .
no man hath seen god at any time ; the only begotten son , who is in the bosom of the father , he hath declared him .
and this is the witness of john , when the jews sent unto him from jerusalem priests and levites to ask him , who art thou ?
and he confessed , and denied not ; and he confessed , i am not the christ .
they said therefore unto him , who art thou ? that we may give an answer to them that sent us . what sayest thou of thyself ?
he said , i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness , make straight the way of the lord , as said isaiah the prophet .
and they had been sent from the pharisees .
and they asked him , and said unto him , why then baptizest thou , if thou art not the christ , neither elijah , neither the prophet ?
john answered them , saying , i baptize in water : in the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not ,
even he that cometh after me , the latchet of whose shoe i am not worthy to unloose .
these things were done in bethany beyond the jordan , where john was baptizing .
on the morrow he seeth jesus coming unto him , and saith , behold , the lamb of god , that taketh away the sin of the world !
this is he of whom i said , after me cometh a man who is become before me : for he was before me .
and i knew him not ; but that he should be made manifest to israel , for this cause came i baptizing in water .
and john bare witness , saying , i have beheld the spirit descending as a dove out of heaven ; and it abode upon him .
and i have seen , and have borne witness that this is the son of god .
again on the morrow john was standing , and two of his disciples ;
and he looked upon jesus as he walked , and saith , behold , the lamb of god !
and the two disciples heard him speak , and they followed jesus .
one of the two that heard john speak , and followed him , was andrew , simon peter ’ s brother .
he findeth first his own brother simon , and saith unto him , we have found the messiah ( which is , being interpreted , christ ) .
on the morrow he was minded to go forth into galilee , and he findeth philip : and jesus saith unto him , follow me .
now philip was from bethsaida , of the city of andrew and peter .
and nathanael said unto him , can any good thing come out of nazareth ? philip saith unto him , come and see .
jesus saw nathanael coming to him , and saith of him , behold , an israelite indeed , in whom is no guile !
nathanael answered him , rabbi , thou art the son of god ; thou art king of israel .
and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee ; and the mother of jesus was there :
and jesus also was bidden , and his disciples , to the marriage .
and when the wine failed , the mother of jesus saith unto him , they have no wine .
and jesus saith unto her , woman , what have i to do with thee ? mine hour is not yet come .
his mother saith unto the servants , whatsoever he saith unto you , do it .
now there were six waterpots of stone set there after the jews ’ manner of purifying , containing two or three firkins apiece .
jesus saith unto them , fill the waterpots with water . and they filled them up to the brim .
and he saith unto them , draw out now , and bear unto the ruler of the feast . and they bare it .
this beginning of his signs did jesus in cana of galilee , and manifested his glory ; and his disciples believed on him .
after this he went down to capernaum , he , and his mother , and his brethren , and his disciples ; and there they abode not many days .
and the passover of the jews was at hand , and jesus went up to jerusalem .
and he found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves , and the changers of money sitting :
and to them that sold the doves he said , take these things hence ; make not my father ’ s house a house of merchandise .
his disciples remembered that it was written , zeal for thy house shall eat me up .
the jews therefore answered and said unto him , what sign showest thou unto us , seeing that thou doest these things ?
jesus answered and said unto them , destroy this temple , and in three days i will raise it up .
the jews therefore said , forty and six years was this temple in building , and wilt thou raise it up in three days ?
but he spake of the temple of his body .
now when he was in jerusalem at the passover , during the feast , many believed on his name , beholding his signs which he did .
but jesus did not trust himself unto them , for that he knew all men ,
and because he needed not that any one should bear witness concerning man ; for he himself knew what was in man .
now there was a man of the pharisees , named nicodemus , a ruler of the jews :
that which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the spirit is spirit .
marvel not that i said unto thee , ye must be born anew .
nicodemus answered and said unto him , how can these things be ?
jesus answered and said unto him , art thou the teacher of israel , and understandest not these things ?
if i told you earthly things and ye believe not , how shall ye believe if i tell you heavenly things ?
and no one hath ascended into heaven , but he that descended out of heaven , even the son of man , who is in heaven .
and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the son of man be lifted up ;
that whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life .
for god so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth on him should not perish , but have eternal life .
for god sent not the son into the world to judge the world ; but that the world should be saved through him .
for every one that doeth evil hateth the light , and cometh not to the light , lest his works should be reproved .
but he that doeth the truth cometh to the light , that his works may be made manifest , that they have been wrought in god .
after these things came jesus and his disciples into the land of judaea ; and there he tarried with them , and baptized .
and john also was baptizing in aenon near to salim , because there was much water there : and they came , and were baptized .
for john was not yet cast into prison .
there arose therefore a questioning on the part of john ’ s disciples with a jew about purifying .
john answered and said , a man can receive nothing , except it have been given him from heaven .
ye yourselves bear me witness , that i said , i am not the christ , but , that i am sent before him .
he must increase , but i must decrease .
what he hath seen and heard , of that he beareth witness ; and no man receiveth his witness .
he that hath received his witness hath set his seal to this , that god is true .
for he whom god hath sent speaketh the words of god : for he giveth not the spirit by measure .
the father loveth the son , and hath given all things into his hand .
when therefore the lord knew that the pharisees had heard that jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than john
( although jesus himself baptized not , but his disciples ) ,
he left judaea , and departed again into galilee .
and he must needs pass through samaria .
so he cometh to a city of samaria , called sychar , near to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph :
and jacob ’ s well was there . jesus therefore , being wearied with his journey , sat thus by the well . it was about the sixth hour .
there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water : jesus saith unto her , give me to drink .
for his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food .
the woman saith unto him , sir , thou hast nothing to draw with , and the well is deep : whence then hast thou that living water ?
art thou greater than our father jacob , who gave us the well , and drank thereof himself , and his sons , and his cattle ?
jesus answered and said unto her , every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again :
the woman saith unto him , sir , give me this water , that i thirst not , neither come all the way hither to draw .
jesus saith unto her , go , call thy husband , and come hither .
the woman answered and said unto him , i have no husband . jesus saith unto her , thou saidst well , i have no husband :
for thou hast had five husbands ; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband : this hast thou said truly .
the woman saith unto him , sir , i perceive that thou art a prophet .
our fathers worshipped in this mountain ; and ye say , that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship .
jesus saith unto her , woman , believe me , the hour cometh , when neither in this mountain , nor in jerusalem , shall ye worship the father .
ye worship that which ye know not : we worship that which we know ; for salvation is from the jews .
god is a spirit : and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth .
jesus saith unto her , i that speak unto thee am he .
so the woman left her waterpot , and went away into the city , and saith to the people ,
come , see a man , who told me all things that ever i did : can this be the christ ?
they went out of the city , and were coming to him .
in the mean while the disciples prayed him , saying , rabbi , eat .
but he said unto them , i have meat to eat that ye know not .
the disciples therefore said one to another , hath any man brought him aught to eat ?
jesus saith unto them , my meat is to do the will of him that sent me , and to accomplish his work .
he that reapeth receiveth wages , and gathereth fruit unto life eternal ; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together .
for herein is the saying true , one soweth , and another reapeth .
i sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored : others have labored , and ye are entered into their labor .
so when the samaritans came unto him , they besought him to abide with them : and he abode there two days .
and many more believed because of his word ;
and after the two days he went forth from thence into galilee .
for jesus himself testified , that a prophet hath no honor in his own country .
he came therefore again unto cana of galilee , where he made the water wine . and there was a certain nobleman , whose son was sick at capernaum .
jesus therefore said unto him , except ye see signs and wonders , ye will in no wise believe .
the nobleman saith unto him , sir , come down ere my child die .
jesus saith unto him , go thy way ; thy son liveth . the man believed the word that jesus spake unto him , and he went his way .
and as he was now going down , his servants met him , saying , that his son lived .
so he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend . they said therefore unto him , yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him .
so the father knew that it was at that hour in which jesus said unto him , thy son liveth : and himself believed , and his whole house .
this is again the second sign that jesus did , having come out of judaea into galilee .
after these things there was a feast of the jews ; and jesus went up to jerusalem .
now there is in jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool , which is called in hebrew bethesda , having five porches .
in these lay a multitude of them that were sick , blind , halt , withered .
and a certain man was there , who had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity .
jesus saith unto him , arise , take up thy bed , and walk .
and straightway the man was made whole , and took up his bed and walked .
so the jews said unto him that was cured , it is the sabbath , and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed .
but he answered them , he that made me whole , the same said unto me , take up thy bed , and walk .
they asked him , who is the man that said unto thee , take up thy bed , and walk ?
but he that was healed knew not who it was ; for jesus had conveyed himself away , a multitude being in the place .
the man went away , and told the jews that it was jesus who had made him whole .
and for this cause the jews persecuted jesus , because he did these things on the sabbath .
but jesus answered them , my father worketh even until now , and i work .
for as the father raiseth the dead and giveth them life , even so the son also giveth life to whom he will .
for neither doth the father judge any man , but he hath given all judgment unto the son ;
that all may honor the son , even as they honor the father . he that honoreth not the son honoreth not the father that sent him .
for as the father hath life in himself , even so gave he to the son also to have life in himself :
and he gave him authority to execute judgment , because he is a son of man .
marvel not at this : for the hour cometh , in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice ,
and shall come forth ; they that have done good , unto the resurrection of life ; and they that have done evil , unto the resurrection of judgment .
if i bear witness of myself , my witness is not true .
it is another that beareth witness of me ; and i know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true .
ye have sent unto john , and he hath borne witness unto the truth .
but the witness which i receive is not from man : howbeit i say these things , that ye may be saved .
he was the lamp that burneth and shineth ; and ye were willing to rejoice for a season in his light .
and the father that sent me , he hath borne witness of me . ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his form .
and ye have not his word abiding in you : for whom he sent , him ye believe not .
ye search the scriptures , because ye think that in them ye have eternal life ; and these are they which bear witness of me ;
and ye will not come to me , that ye may have life .
i receive not glory from men .
but i know you , that ye have not the love of god in yourselves .
i am come in my father ’ s name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive .
how can ye believe , who receive glory one of another , and the glory that cometh from the only god ye seek not ?
think not that i will accuse you to the father : there is one that accuseth you , even moses , on whom ye have set your hope .
for if ye believed moses , ye would believe me ; for he wrote of me .
but if ye believe not his writings , how shall ye believe my words ?
after these things jesus went away to the other side of the sea of galilee , which is the sea of tiberias .
and a great multitude followed him , because they beheld the signs which he did on them that were sick .
and jesus went up into the mountain , and there he sat with his disciples .
now the passover , the feast of the jews , was at hand .
and this he said to prove him : for he himself knew what he would do .
philip answered him , two hundred shillings ’ worth of bread is not sufficient for them , that every one may take a little .
one of his disciples , andrew , simon peter ’ s brother , saith unto him ,
there is a lad here , who hath five barley loaves , and two fishes : but what are these among so many ?
jesus said , make the people sit down . now there was much grass in the place . so the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
and when they were filled , he saith unto his disciples , gather up the broken pieces which remain over , that nothing be lost .
so they gathered them up , and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves , which remained over unto them that had eaten .
when therefore the people saw the sign which he did , they said , this is of a truth the prophet that cometh into the world .
jesus therefore perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force , to make him king , withdrew again into the mountain himself alone .
and when evening came , his disciples went down unto the sea ;
and the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew .
but he saith unto them , it is i ; be not afraid .
they were willing therefore to receive him into the boat : and straightway the boat was at the land whither they were going .
( howbeit there came boats from tiberias nigh unto the place where they ate the bread after the lord had given thanks ) :
when the multitude therefore saw that jesus was not there , neither his disciples , they themselves got into the boats , and came to capernaum , seeking jesus .
and when they found him on the other side of the sea , they said unto him , rabbi , when camest thou hither ?
they said therefore unto him , what must we do , that we may work the works of god ?
jesus answered and said unto them , this is the work of god , that ye believe on him whom he hath sent .
they said therefore unto him , what then doest thou for a sign , that we may see , and believe thee ? what workest thou ?
our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness ; as it is written , he gave them bread out of heaven to eat .
for the bread of god is that which cometh down out of heaven , and giveth life unto the world .
they said therefore unto him , lord , evermore give us this bread .
but i said unto you , that ye have seen me , and yet believe not .
all that which the father giveth me shall come unto me ; and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out .
for i am come down from heaven , not to do mine own will , but the will of him that sent me .
the jews therefore murmured concerning him , because he said , i am the bread which came down out of heaven .
jesus answered and said unto them , murmur not among yourselves .
no man can come to me , except the father that sent me draw him : and i will raise him up in the last day .
not that any man hath seen the father , save he that is from god , he hath seen the father .
verily , verily , i say unto you , he that believeth hath eternal life .
i am the bread of life .
your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness , and they died .
this is the bread which cometh down out of heaven , that a man may eat thereof , and not die .
the jews therefore strove one with another , saying , how can this man give us his flesh to eat ?
he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life ; and i will raise him up at the last day .
for my flesh is meat indeed , and my blood is drink indeed .
he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me , and i in him .
as the living father sent me , and i live because of the father ; so he that eateth me , he also shall live because of me .
this is the bread which came down out of heaven : not as the fathers ate , and died ; he that eateth this bread shall live for ever .
these things said he in the synagogue , as he taught in capernaum .
many therefore of his disciples , when they heard this , said , this is a hard saying ; who can hear it ?
but jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this , said unto them , doth this cause you to stumble ?
what then if ye should behold the son of man ascending where he was before ?
it is the spirit that giveth life ; the flesh profiteth nothing : the words that i have spoken unto you are spirit , and are life .
upon this many of his disciples went back , and walked no more with him .
jesus said therefore unto the twelve , would ye also go away ?
simon peter answered him , lord , to whom shall we go ? thou hast the words of eternal life .
and we have believed and know that thou art the holy one of god .
jesus answered them , did not i choose you the twelve , and one of you is a devil ?
now he spake of judas the son of simon iscariot , for he it was that should betray him , being one of the twelve .
and after these things jesus walked in galilee : for he would not walk in judaea , because the jews sought to kill him .
now the feast of the jews , the feast of tabernacles , was at hand .
his brethren therefore said unto him , depart hence , and go into judaea , that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest .
for no man doeth anything in secret , and himself seeketh to be known openly . if thou doest these things , manifest thyself to the world .
for even his brethren did not believe on him .
jesus therefore saith unto them , my time is not yet come ; but your time is always ready .
the world can not hate you ; but me it hateth , because i testify of it , that its works are evil .
go ye up unto the feast : i go not up unto this feast ; because my time is not yet fulfilled .
and having said these things unto them , he abode still in galilee .
but when his brethren were gone up unto the feast , then went he also up , not publicly , but as it were in secret .
the jews therefore sought him at the feast , and said , where is he ?
yet no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews .
but when it was now the midst of the feast jesus went up into the temple , and taught .
the jews therefore marvelled , saying , how knoweth this man letters , having never learned ?
jesus therefore answered them , and said , my teaching is not mine , but his that sent me .
if any man willeth to do his will , he shall know of the teaching , whether it is of god , or whether i speak from myself .
did not moses give you the law , and yet none of you doeth the law ? why seek ye to kill me ?
the multitude answered , thou hast a demon : who seeketh to kill thee ?
jesus answered and said unto them , i did one work , and ye all marvel because thereof .
moses hath given you circumcision ( not that it is of moses , but of the fathers ) ; and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man .
judge not according to appearance , but judge righteous judgment .
some therefore of them of jerusalem said , is not this he whom they seek to kill ?
and lo , he speaketh openly , and they say nothing unto him . can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the christ ?
howbeit we know this man whence he is : but when the christ cometh , no one knoweth whence he is .
i know him ; because i am from him , and he sent me .
they sought therefore to take him : and no man laid his hand on him , because his hour was not yet come .
the pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him ; and the chief priests and the pharisees sent officers to take him .
jesus therefore said , yet a little while am i with you , and i go unto him that sent me .
ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where i am , ye can not come .
what is this word that he said , ye shall seek me , and shall not find me ; and where i am , ye can not come ?
he that believeth on me , as the scripture hath said , from within him shall flow rivers of living water .
some of the multitude therefore , when they heard these words , said , this is of a truth the prophet .
others said , this is the christ . but some said , what , doth the christ come out of galilee ?
hath not the scripture said that the christ cometh of the seed of david , and from bethlehem , the village where david was ?
so there arose a division in the multitude because of him .
and some of them would have taken him ; but no man laid hands on him .
the officers therefore came to the chief priests and pharisees ; and they said unto them , why did ye not bring him ?
the officers answered , never man so spake .
the pharisees therefore answered them , are ye also led astray ?
hath any of the rulers believed on him , or of the pharisees ?
but this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed .
nicodemus saith unto them ( he that came to him before , being one of them ) ,
doth our law judge a man , except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth ?
they answered and said unto him , art thou also of galilee ? search , and see that out of galilee ariseth no prophet .
and they went every man unto his own house :
but jesus went unto the mount of olives .
and early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came unto him ; and he sat down , and taught them .
and the scribes and the pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery ; and having set her in the midst ,
they say unto him , teacher , this woman hath been taken in adultery , in the very act .
now in the law moses commanded us to stone such : what then sayest thou of her ?
and again he stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground .
and jesus lifted up himself , and said unto her , woman , where are they ? did no man condemn thee ?
and she said , no man , lord . and jesus said , neither do i condemn thee : go thy way ; from henceforth sin no more . ]
the pharisees therefore said unto him , thou bearest witness of thyself ; thy witness is not true .
ye judge after the flesh ; i judge no man .
yea and if i judge , my judgment is true ; for i am not alone , but i and the father that sent me .
yea and in your law it is written , that the witness of two men is true .
i am he that beareth witness of myself , and the father that sent me beareth witness of me .
these words spake he in the treasury , as he taught in the temple : and no man took him ; because his hour was not yet come .
the jews therefore said , will he kill himself , that he saith , whither i go , ye can not come ?
and he said unto them , ye are from beneath ; i am from above : ye are of this world ; i am not of this world .
i said therefore unto you , that ye shall die in your sins : for except ye believe that i am he , ye shall die in your sins .
they said therefore unto him , who art thou ? jesus said unto them , even that which i have also spoken unto you from the beginning .
they perceived not that he spake to them of the father .
and he that sent me is with me ; he hath not left me alone ; for i do always the things that are pleasing to him .
as he spake these things , many believed on him .
jesus therefore said to those jews that had believed him , if ye abide in my word , then are ye truly my disciples ;
and ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free .
jesus answered them , verily , verily , i say unto you , every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin .
and the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever : the son abideth for ever .
if therefore the son shall make you free , ye shall be free indeed .
i know that ye are abraham ’ s seed ; yet ye seek to kill me , because my word hath not free course in you .
i speak the things which i have seen with my father : and ye also do the things which ye heard from your father .
but now ye seek to kill me , a man that hath told you the truth , which i heard from god : this did not abraham .
ye do the works of your father . they said unto him , we were not born of fornication ; we have one father , even god .
why do ye not understand my speech ? even because ye can not hear my word .
but because i say the truth , ye believe me not .
which of you convicteth me of sin ? if i say truth , why do ye not believe me ?
he that is of god heareth the words of god : for this cause ye hear them not , because ye are not of god .
the jews answered and said unto him , say we not well that thou art a samaritan , and hast a demon ?
jesus answered , i have not a demon ; but i honor my father , and ye dishonor me .
but i seek not mine own glory : there is one that seeketh and judgeth .
verily , verily , i say unto you , if a man keep my word , he shall never see death .
art thou greater than our father abraham , who died ? and the prophets died : whom makest thou thyself ?
your father abraham rejoiced to see my day ; and he saw it , and was glad .
the jews therefore said unto him , thou art not yet fifty years old , and hast thou seen abraham ?
jesus said unto them , verily , verily , i say unto you , before abraham was born , i am .
they took up stones therefore to cast at him : but jesus hid himself , and went out of the temple .
and as he passed by , he saw a man blind from his birth .
and his disciples asked him , saying , rabbi , who sinned , this man , or his parents , that he should be born blind ?
jesus answered , neither did this man sin , nor his parents : but that the works of god should be made manifest in him .
we must work the works of him that sent me , while it is day : the night cometh , when no man can work .
when i am in the world , i am the light of the world .
when he had thus spoken , he spat on the ground , and made clay of the spittle , and anointed his eyes with the clay ,
the neighbors therefore , and they that saw him aforetime , that he was a beggar , said , is not this he that sat and begged ?
others said , it is he : others said , no , but he is like him . he said , i am he .
they said therefore unto him , how then were thine eyes opened ?
and they said unto him , where is he ? he saith , i know not .
they bring to the pharisees him that aforetime was blind .
now it was the sabbath on the day when jesus made the clay , and opened his eyes .
and asked them , saying , is this your son , who ye say was born blind ? how then doth he now see ?
his parents answered and said , we know that this is our son , and that he was born blind :
therefore said his parents , he is of age ; ask him .
he therefore answered , whether he is a sinner , i know not : one thing i know , that , whereas i was blind , now i see .
they said therefore unto him , what did he to thee ? how opened he thine eyes ?
he answered them , i told you even now , and ye did not hear ; wherefore would ye hear it again ? would ye also become his disciples ?
and they reviled him , and said , thou art his disciple ; but we are disciples of moses .
we know that god hath spoken unto moses : but as for this man , we know not whence he is .
the man answered and said unto them , why , herein is the marvel , that ye know not whence he is , and yet he opened mine eyes .
we know that god heareth not sinners : but if any man be a worshipper of god , and do his will , him he heareth .
since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind .
if this man were not from god , he could do nothing .
they answered and said unto him , thou wast altogether born in sins , and dost thou teach us ? and they cast him out .
jesus heard that they had cast him out ; and finding him , he said , dost thou believe on the son of god ?
he answered and said , and who is he , lord , that i may believe on him ?
jesus said unto him , thou hast both seen him , and he it is that speaketh with thee .
and he said , lord , i believe . and he worshipped him .
and jesus said , for judgment came i into this world , that they that see not may see ; and that they that see may become blind .
those of the pharisees who were with him heard these things , and said unto him , are we also blind ?
jesus said unto them , if ye were blind , ye would have no sin : but now ye say , we see : your sin remaineth .
but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
to him the porter openeth ; and the sheep hear his voice : and he calleth his own sheep by name , and leadeth them out .
when he hath put forth all his own , he goeth before them , and the sheep follow him : for they know his voice .
and a stranger will they not follow , but will flee from him : for they know not the voice of strangers .
this parable spake jesus unto them : but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them .
jesus therefore said unto them again , verily , verily , i say unto you , i am the door of the sheep .
all that came before me are thieves and robbers : but the sheep did not hear them .
i am the good shepherd : the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep .
he fleeth because he is a hireling , and careth not for the sheep .
i am the good shepherd ; and i know mine own , and mine own know me ,
even as the father knoweth me , and i know the father ; and i lay down my life for the sheep .
therefore doth the father love me , because i lay down my life , that i may take it again .
there arose a division again among the jews because of these words .
and many of them said , he hath a demon , and is mad ; why hear ye him ?
others said , these are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon . can a demon open the eyes of the blind ?
and it was the feast of the dedication at jerusalem :
it was winter ; and jesus was walking in the temple in solomon ’ s porch .
but ye believe not , because ye are not of my sheep .
my sheep hear my voice , and i know them , and they follow me :
and i give unto them eternal life ; and they shall never perish , and no one shall snatch them out of my hand .
i and the father are one .
the jews took up stones again to stone him .
jesus answered them , many good works have i showed you from the father ; for which of those works do ye stone me ?
jesus answered them , is it not written in your law , i said , ye are gods ?
if he called them gods , unto whom the word of god came ( and the scripture can not be broken ) ,
say ye of him , whom the father sanctified and sent into the world , thou blasphemest ; because i said , i am the son of god ?
if i do not the works of my father , believe me not .
they sought again to take him : and he went forth out of their hand .
and he went away again beyond the jordan into the place where john was at the first baptizing ; and there he abode .
and many came unto him ; and they said , john indeed did no sign : but all things whatsoever john spake of this man were true .
and many believed on him there .
now a certain man was sick , lazarus of bethany , of the village of mary and her sister martha .
and it was that mary who anointed the lord with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother lazarus was sick .
the sisters therefore sent unto him , saying , lord , behold , he whom thou lovest is sick .
now jesus loved martha , and her sister , and lazarus .
when therefore he heard that he was sick , he abode at that time two days in the place where he was .
then after this he saith to the disciples , let us go into judaea again .
the disciples say unto him , rabbi , the jews were but now seeking to stone thee ; and goest thou thither again ?
but if a man walk in the night , he stumbleth , because the light is not in him .
the disciples therefore said unto him , lord , if he is fallen asleep , he will recover .
now jesus had spoken of his death : but they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep .
then jesus therefore said unto them plainly , lazarus is dead .
and i am glad for your sakes that i was not there , to the intent ye may believe ; nevertheless let us go unto him .
thomas therefore , who is called didymus , said unto his fellow-disciples , let us also go , that we may die with him .
so when jesus came , he found that he had been in the tomb four days already .
now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem , about fifteen furlongs off ;
and many of the jews had come to martha and mary , to console them concerning their brother .
martha therefore , when she heard that jesus was coming , went and met him : but mary still sat in the house .
martha therefore said unto jesus , lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died .
and even now i know that , whatsoever thou shalt ask of god , god will give thee .
jesus saith unto her , thy brother shall rise again .
martha saith unto him , i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day .
jesus said unto her , i am the resurrection , and the life : he that believeth on me , though he die , yet shall he live ;
and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die . believest thou this ?
and when she had said this , she went away , and called mary her sister secretly , saying , the teacher is here , and calleth thee .
and she , when she heard it , arose quickly , and went unto him .
( now jesus was not yet come into the village , but was still in the place where martha met him . )
when jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the jews also weeping who came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled ,
and said , where have ye laid him ? they say unto him , lord , come and see .
the jews therefore said , behold how he loved him !
jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the tomb . now it was a cave , and a stone lay against it .
jesus saith unto her , said i not unto thee , that , if thou believedst , thou shouldest see the glory of god ?
so they took away the stone . and jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , father , i thank thee that thou heardest me .
and when he had thus spoken , he cried with a loud voice , lazarus , come forth .
many therefore of the jews , who came to mary and beheld that which he did , believed on him .
but some of them went away to the pharisees , and told them the things which jesus had done .
the chief priests therefore and the pharisees gathered a council , and said , what do we ? for this man doeth many signs .
if we let him thus alone , all men will believe on him : and the romans will come and take away both our place and our nation .
but a certain one of them , caiaphas , being high priest that year , said unto them , ye know nothing at all ,
nor do ye take account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation perish not .
now this he said not of himself : but being high priest that year , he prophesied that jesus should die for the nation ;
and not for the nation only , but that he might also gather together into one the children of god that are scattered abroad .
so from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death .
now the passover of the jews was at hand : and many went up to jerusalem out of the country before the passover , to purify themselves .
jesus therefore six days before the passover came to bethany , where lazarus was , whom jesus raised from the dead .
so they made him a supper there : and martha served ; but lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him .
but judas iscariot , one of his disciples , that should betray him , saith ,
why was not this ointment sold for three hundred shillings , and given to the poor ?
jesus therefore said , suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying .
for the poor ye have always with you ; but me ye have not always .
but the chief priests took counsel that they might put lazarus also to death ;
because that by reason of him many of the jews went away , and believed on jesus .
on the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast , when they heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem ,
and jesus , having found a young ass , sat thereon ; as it is written ,
fear not , daughter of zion : behold , thy king cometh , sitting on an ass ’ s colt .
the multitude therefore that was with him when he called lazarus out of the tomb , and raised him from the dead , bare witness .
for this cause also the multitude went and met him , for that they heard that he had done this sign .
the pharisees therefore said among themselves , behold how ye prevail nothing ; lo , the world is gone after him .
now there were certain greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast :
these therefore came to philip , who was of bethsaida of galilee , and asked him , saying , sir , we would see jesus .
philip cometh and telleth andrew : andrew cometh , and philip , and they tell jesus .
and jesus answereth them , saying , the hour is come , that the son of man should be glorified .
he that loveth his life loseth it ; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal .
now is my soul troubled ; and what shall i say ? father , save me from this hour . but for this cause came i unto this hour .
father , glorify thy name . there came therefore a voice out of heaven , saying , i have both glorified it , and will glorify it again .
the multitude therefore , that stood by , and heard it , said that it had thundered : others said , an angel hath spoken to him .
jesus answered and said , this voice hath not come for my sake , but for your sakes .
now is the judgment of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out .
and i , if i be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto myself .
but this he said , signifying by what manner of death he should die .
while ye have the light , believe on the light , that ye may become sons of light .
but though he had done so many signs before them , yet they believed not on him :
that the word of isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spake ,
for this cause they could not believe , for that isaiah said again ,
he hath blinded their eyes , and he hardened their heart ;
these things said isaiah , because he saw his glory ; and he spake of him .
for they loved the glory that is of men more than the glory that is of god .
and jesus cried and said , he that believeth on me , believeth not on me , but on him that sent me .
and he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me .
i am come a light into the world , that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness .
and i know that his commandment is life eternal ; the things therefore which i speak , even as the father hath said unto me , so i speak .
and during supper , the devil having already put into the heart of judas iscariot , simon ’ s son , to betray him ,
jesus , knowing that the father had given all things into his hands , and that he came forth from god , and goeth unto god ,
riseth from supper , and layeth aside his garments ; and he took a towel , and girded himself .
then he poureth water into the basin , and began to wash the disciples ’ feet , and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded .
so he cometh to simon peter . he saith unto him , lord , dost thou wash my feet ?
jesus answered and said unto him , what i do thou knowest not now ; but thou shalt understand hereafter .
peter saith unto him , thou shalt never wash my feet . jesus answered him , if i wash thee not , thou hast no part with me .
simon peter saith unto him , lord , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head .
for he knew him that should betray him ; therefore said he , ye are not all clean .
ye call me , teacher , and , lord : and ye say well ; for so i am .
if i then , the lord and the teacher , have washed your feet , ye also ought to wash one another ’ s feet .
for i have given you an example , that ye also should do as i have done to you .
verily , verily , i say unto you , a servant is not greater than his lord ; neither one that is sent greater than he that sent him .
if ye know these things , blessed are ye if ye do them .
from henceforth i tell you before it come to pass , that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe that i am he .
verily , verily , i say unto you , he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me ; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
the disciples looked one on another , doubting of whom he spake .
there was at the table reclining in jesus ’ bosom one of his disciples , whom jesus loved .
simon peter therefore beckoneth to him , and saith unto him , tell us who it is of whom he speaketh .
he leaning back , as he was , on jesus ’ breast saith unto him , lord , who is it ?
and after the sop , then entered satan into him . jesus therefore saith unto him , what thou doest , do quickly .
now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him .
he then having received the sop went out straightway : and it was night .
when therefore he was gone out , jesus saith , now is the son of man glorified , and god is glorified in him ;
and god shall glorify him in himself , and straightway shall he glorify him .
a new commandment i give unto you , that ye love one another ; even as i have loved you , that ye also love one another .
by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples , if ye have love one to another .
peter saith unto him , lord , why can not i follow thee even now ? i will lay down my life for thee .
let not your heart be troubled : believe in god , believe also in me .
and whither i go , ye know the way .
thomas saith unto him , lord , we know not whither thou goest ; how know we the way ?
jesus saith unto him , i am the way , and the truth , and the life : no one cometh unto the father , but by me .
if ye had known me , ye would have known my father also : from henceforth ye know him , and have seen him .
philip saith unto him , lord , show us the father , and it sufficeth us .
believe me that i am in the father , and the father in me : or else believe me for the very works ’ sake .
and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name , that will i do , that the father may be glorified in the son .
if ye shall ask anything in my name , that will i do .
if ye love me , ye will keep my commandments .
and i will pray the father , and he shall give you another comforter , that he may be with you for ever ,
i will not leave you desolate : i come unto you .
yet a little while , and the world beholdeth me no more ; but ye behold me : because i live , ye shall live also .
in that day ye shall know that i am in my father , and ye in me , and i in you .
judas ( not iscariot ) saith unto him , lord , what is come to pass that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us , and not unto the world ?
he that loveth me not keepeth not my words : and the word which ye hear is not mine , but the father ’ s who sent me .
these things have i spoken unto you , while yet abiding with you .
and now i have told you before it come to pass , that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe .
i will no more speak much with you , for the prince of the world cometh : and he hath nothing in me ;
i am the true vine , and my father is the husbandman .
already ye are clean because of the word which i have spoken unto you .
if ye abide in me , and my words abide in you , ask whatsoever ye will , and it shall be done unto you .
herein is my father glorified , that ye bear much fruit ; and so shall ye be my disciples .
even as the father hath loved me , i also have loved you : abide ye in my love .
if ye keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love ; even as i have kept my father ’ s commandments , and abide in his love .
these things have i spoken unto you , that my joy may be in you , and that your joy may be made full .
this is my commandment , that ye love one another , even as i have loved you .
greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends .
ye are my friends , if ye do the things which i command you .
these things i command you , that ye may love one another .
if the world hateth you , ye know that it hath hated me before it hated you .
but all these things will they do unto you for my name ’ s sake , because they know not him that sent me .
if i had not come and spoken unto them , they had not had sin : but now they have no excuse for their sin .
he that hateth me hateth my father also .
but this cometh to pass , that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their law , they hated me without a cause .
and ye also bear witness , because ye have been with me from the beginning .
these things have i spoken unto you , that ye should not be caused to stumble .
they shall put you out of the synagogues : yea , the hour cometh , that whosoever killeth you shall think that he offereth service unto god .
and these things will they do , because they have not known the father , nor me .
but now i go unto him that sent me ; and none of you asketh me , whither goest thou ?
but because i have spoken these things unto you , sorrow hath filled your heart .
and he , when he is come , will convict the world in respect of sin , and of righteousness , and of judgment :
of sin , because they believe not on me ;
of righteousness , because i go to the father , and ye behold me no more ;
of judgment , because the prince of this world hath been judged .
i have yet many things to say unto you , but ye can not bear them now .
he shall glorify me : for he shall take of mine , and shall declare it unto you .
all things whatsoever the father hath are mine : therefore said i , that he taketh of mine , and shall declare it unto you .
a little while , and ye behold me no more ; and again a little while , and ye shall see me .
they said therefore , what is this that he saith , a little while ? we know not what he saith .
and ye therefore now have sorrow : but i will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no one taketh away from you .
hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name : ask , and ye shall receive , that your joy may be made full .
in that day ye shall ask in my name : and i say not unto you , that i will pray the father for you ;
for the father himself loveth you , because ye have loved me , and have believed that i came forth from the father .
i came out from the father , and am come into the world : again , i leave the world , and go unto the father .
his disciples say , lo , now speakest thou plainly , and speakest no dark saying .
now know we that thou knowest all things , and needest not that any man should ask thee : by this we believe that thou camest forth from god .
jesus answered them , do ye now believe ?
even as thou gavest him authority over all flesh , that to all whom thou hast given him , he should give eternal life .
and this is life eternal , that they should know thee the only true god , and him whom thou didst send , even jesus christ .
i glorified thee on the earth , having accomplished the work which thou hast given me to do .
and now , father , glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was .
now they know that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are from thee :
i pray for them : i pray not for the world , but for those whom thou hast given me ; for they are thine :
and all things that are mine are thine , and thine are mine : and i am glorified in them .
but now i come to thee ; and these things i speak in the world , that they may have my joy made full in themselves .
i have given them thy word ; and the world hated them , because they are not of the world , even as i am not of the world .
i pray not that thou shouldest take them from the world , but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil one .
they are not of the world , even as i am not of the world .
sanctify them in the truth : thy word is truth .
as thou didst send me into the world , even so sent i them into the world .
and for their sakes i sanctify myself , that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth .
neither for these only do i pray , but for them also that believe on me through their word ;
and the glory which thou hast given me i have given unto them ; that they may be one , even as we are one ;
o righteous father , the world knew thee not , but i knew thee ; and these knew that thou didst send me ;
now judas also , who betrayed him , knew the place : for jesus oft-times resorted thither with his disciples .
judas then , having received the band of soldiers , and officers from the chief priests and the pharisees , cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons .
jesus therefore , knowing all the things that were coming upon him , went forth , and saith unto them , whom seek ye ?
they answered him , jesus of nazareth . jesus saith unto them , i am he . and judas also , who betrayed him , was standing with them .
when therefore he said unto them , i am he , they went backward , and fell to the ground .
again therefore he asked them , whom seek ye ? and they said , jesus of nazareth .
jesus answered , i told you that i am he ; if therefore ye seek me , let these go their way :
that the word might be fulfilled which he spake , of those whom thou hast given me i lost not one .
jesus therefore said unto peter , put up the sword into the sheath : the cup which the father hath given me , shall i not drink it ?
so the band and the chief captain , and the officers of the jews , seized jesus and bound him ,
and led him to annas first ; for he was father in law to caiaphas , who was high priest that year .
now caiaphas was he that gave counsel to the jews , that it was expedient that one man should die for the people .
the maid therefore that kept the door saith unto peter , art thou also one of this man ’ s disciples ? he saith , i am not .
the high priest therefore asked jesus of his disciples , and of his teaching .
why askest thou me ? ask them that have heard me , what i spake unto them : behold , these know the things which i said .
and when he had said this , one of the officers standing by struck jesus with his hand , saying , answerest thou the high priest so ?
jesus answered him , if i have spoken evil , bear witness of the evil : but if well , why smitest thou me ?
annas therefore sent him bound unto caiaphas the high priest .
peter therefore denied again : and straightway the cock crew .
pilate therefore went out unto them , and saith , what accusation bring ye against this man ?
they answered and said unto him , if this man were not an evil-doer , we should not have delivered him up unto thee .
that the word of jesus might be fulfilled , which he spake , signifying by what manner of death he should die .
pilate therefore entered again into the praetorium , and called jesus , and said unto him , art thou the king of the jews ?
jesus answered , sayest thou this of thyself , or did others tell it thee concerning me ?
pilate answered , am i a jew ? thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee unto me : what hast thou done ?
pilate saith unto him , what is truth ?
they cried out therefore again , saying , not this man , but barabbas . now barabbas was a robber .
then pilate therefore took jesus , and scourged him .
and the soldiers platted a crown of thorns , and put it on his head , and arrayed him in a purple garment ;
and they came unto him , and said , hail , king of the jews ! and they struck him with their hands .
jesus therefore came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment . and pilate saith unto them , behold , the man !
the jews answered him , we have a law , and by that law he ought to die , because he made himself the son of god .
when pilate therefore heard this saying , he was the more afraid ;
and he entered into the praetorium again , and saith unto jesus , whence art thou ? but jesus gave him no answer .
pilate therefore saith unto him , speakest thou not unto me ? knowest thou not that i have power to release thee , and have power to crucify thee ?
now it was the preparation of the passover : it was about the sixth hour . and he saith unto the jews , behold , your king !
then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified .
where they crucified him , and with him two others , on either side one , and jesus in the midst .
and pilate wrote a title also , and put it on the cross . and there was written , jesus of nazareth , the king of the jews .
pilate answered , what i have written i have written .
when jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by whom he loved , he saith unto his mother , woman , behold , thy son !
then saith he to the disciple , behold , thy mother ! and from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home .
after this jesus , knowing that all things are now finished , that the scripture might be accomplished , saith , i thirst .
there was set there a vessel full of vinegar : so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop , and brought it to his mouth .
when jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , it is finished : and he bowed his head , and gave up his spirit .
the soldiers therefore came , and brake the legs of the first , and of the other that was crucified with him :
but when they came to jesus , and saw that he was dead already , they brake not his legs :
howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side , and straightway there came out blood and water .
and he that hath seen hath borne witness , and his witness is true : and he knoweth that he saith true , that ye also may believe .
for these things came to pass , that the scripture might be fulfilled , a bone of him shall not be broken .
and again another scripture saith , they shall look on him whom they pierced .
and there came also nicodemus , he who at the first came to him by night , bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about a hundred pounds .
so they took the body of jesus , and bound it in linen cloths with the spices , as the custom of the jews is to bury .
now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden ; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid .
there then because of the jews ’ preparation ( for the tomb was nigh at hand ) they laid jesus .
peter therefore went forth , and the other disciple , and they went toward the tomb .
and they ran both together : and the other disciple outran peter , and came first to the tomb ;
and stooping and looking in , he seeth the linen cloths lying ; yet entered he not in .
simon peter therefore also cometh , following him , and entered into the tomb ; and he beholdeth the linen cloths lying ,
and the napkin , that was upon his head , not lying with the linen cloths , but rolled up in a place by itself .
then entered in therefore the other disciple also , who came first to the tomb , and he saw , and believed .
for as yet they knew not the scripture , that he must rise again from the dead .
so the disciples went away again unto their own home .
but mary was standing without at the tomb weeping : so , as she wept , she stooped and looked into the tomb ;
and she beholdeth two angels in white sitting , one at the head , and one at the feet , where the body of jesus had lain .
when she had thus said , she turned herself back , and beholdeth jesus standing , and knew not that it was jesus .
jesus saith unto her , mary . she turneth herself , and saith unto him in hebrew , rabboni ; which is to say , teacher .
mary magdalene cometh and telleth the disciples , i have seen the lord ; and that he had said these things unto her .
and when he had said this , he showed unto them his hands and his side . the disciples therefore were glad , when they saw the lord .
jesus therefore said to them again , peace be unto you : as the father hath sent me , even so send i you .
and when he had said this , he breathed on them , and saith unto them , receive ye the holy spirit :
whose soever sins ye forgive , they are forgiven unto them ; whose soever sins ye retain , they are retained .
but thomas , one of the twelve , called didymus , was not with them when jesus came .
thomas answered and said unto him , my lord and my god .
jesus saith unto him , because thou hast seen me , thou hast believed : blessed are they that have not seen , and yet have believed .
many other signs therefore did jesus in the presence of the disciples , which are not written in this book :
after these things jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias ; and he manifested himself on this wise .
but when day was now breaking , jesus stood on the beach : yet the disciples knew not that it was jesus .
jesus therefore saith unto them , children , have ye aught to eat ? they answered him , no .
so when they got out upon the land , they see a fire of coals there , and fish laid thereon , and bread .
jesus saith unto them , bring of the fish which ye have now taken .
jesus cometh , and taketh the bread , and giveth them , and the fish likewise .
this is now the third time that jesus was manifested to the disciples , after that he was risen from the dead .
peter therefore seeing him saith to jesus , lord , and what shall this man do ?
jesus saith unto him , if i will that he tarry till i come , what is that to thee ? follow thou me .
this is the disciple that beareth witness of these things , and wrote these things : and we know that his witness is true .
now the word of jehovah came unto jonah the son of amittai , saying ,
arise , go to nineveh , that great city , and cry against it ; for their wickedness is come up before me .
nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land ; but they could not : for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them .
so they took up jonah , and cast him forth into the sea ; and the sea ceased from its raging .
then the men feared jehovah exceedingly ; and they offered a sacrifice unto jehovah , and made vows .
and jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah ; and jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights .
then jonah prayed unto jehovah his god out of the fish ’ s belly .
for thou didst cast me into the depth , in the heart of the seas ,
and i said , i am cast out from before thine eyes ;
the waters compassed me about , even to the soul ;
i went down to the bottoms of the mountains ;
when my soul fainted within me , i remembered jehovah ;
they that regard lying vanities
but i will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving ;
and jehovah spake unto the fish , and it vomited out jonah upon the dry land .
and the word of jehovah came unto jonah the second time , saying ,
arise , go unto nineveh , that great city , and preach unto it the preaching that i bid thee .
so jonah arose , and went unto nineveh , according to the word of jehovah . now nineveh was an exceeding great city , of three days ’ journey .
who knoweth whether god will not turn and repent , and turn away from his fierce anger , that we perish not ?
but it displeased jonah exceedingly , and he was angry .
therefore now , o jehovah , take , i beseech thee , my life from me ; for it is better for me to die than to live .
and jehovah said , doest thou well to be angry ?
but god prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day , and it smote the gourd , that it withered .
every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon , to you have i given it , as i spake unto moses .
be strong and of good courage ; for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which i sware unto their fathers to give them .
then joshua commanded the officers of the people , saying ,
and to the reubenites , and to the gadites , and to the half-tribe of manasseh , spake joshua , saying ,
remember the word which moses the servant of jehovah commanded you , saying , jehovah your god giveth you rest , and will give you this land .
and they answered joshua , saying , all that thou hast commanded us we will do , and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go .
and it was told the king of jericho , saying , behold , there came men in hither to-night of the children of israel to search out the land .
but she had brought them up to the roof , and hid them with the stalks of flax , which she had laid in order upon the roof .
and before they were laid down , she came up unto them upon the roof ;
then she let them down by a cord through the window : for her house was upon the side of the wall , and she dwelt upon the wall .
and the men said unto her , we will be guiltless of this thine oath which thou hast made us to swear .
but if thou utter this our business , then we shall be guiltless of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear .
and it came to pass after three days , that the officers went through the midst of the camp ;
and joshua said unto the people , sanctify yourselves ; for to-morrow jehovah will do wonders among you .
and joshua said unto the children of israel , come hither , and hear the words of jehovah your god .
behold , the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth passeth over before you into the jordan .
now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of israel , for every tribe a man .
and it came to pass , when all the nation were clean passed over the jordan , that jehovah spake unto joshua , saying ,
take you twelve men out of the people , out of every tribe a man ,
then joshua called the twelve men , whom he had prepared of the children of israel , out of every tribe a man :
that this may be a sign among you , that , when your children ask in time to come , saying , what mean ye by these stones ?
about forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before jehovah unto battle , to the plains of jericho .
on that day jehovah magnified joshua in the sight of all israel ; and they feared him , as they feared moses , all the days of his life .
and jehovah spake unto joshua , saying ,
command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony , that they come up out of the jordan .
joshua therefore commanded the priests , saying , come ye up out of the jordan .
and the people came up out of the jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and encamped in gilgal , on the east border of jericho .
and those twelve stones , which they took out of the jordan , did joshua set up in gilgal .
and he spake unto the children of israel , saying , when your children shall ask their fathers in time to come , saying , what mean these stones ?
then ye shall let your children know , saying , israel came over this jordan on dry land .
that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of jehovah , that it is mighty ; that ye may fear jehovah your god for ever .
at that time jehovah said unto joshua , make thee knives of flint , and circumcise again the children of israel the second time .
and joshua made him knives of flint , and circumcised the children of israel at the hill of the foreskins .
and it came to pass , when they had done circumcising all the nation , that they abode in their places in the camp , till they were whole .
and the children of israel encamped in gilgal ; and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of jericho .
and they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the passover , unleavened cakes and parched grain , in the selfsame day .
now jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of israel : none went out , and none came in .
and jehovah said unto joshua , see , i have given into thy hand jericho , and the king thereof , and the mighty men of valor .
and ye shall compass the city , all the men of war , going about the city once . thus shalt thou do six days .
and they said unto the people , pass on , and compass the city , and let the armed men pass on before the ark of jehovah .
and the armed men went before the priests that blew the trumpets , and the rearward went after the ark , the priests blowing the trumpets as they went .
so he caused the ark of jehovah to compass the city , going about it once : and they came into the camp , and lodged in the camp .
and joshua rose early in the morning , and the priests took up the ark of jehovah .
and the second day they compassed the city once , and returned into the camp : so they did six days .
but all the silver , and gold , and vessels of brass and iron , are holy unto jehovah : they shall come into the treasury of jehovah .
so jehovah was with joshua ; and his fame was in all the land .
so there went up thither of the people about three thousand men : and they fled before the men of ai .
oh , lord , what shall i say , after that israel hath turned their backs before their enemies !
and jehovah said unto joshua , get thee up ; wherefore art thou thus fallen upon thy face ?
so joshua rose up early in the morning , and brought israel near by their tribes ; and the tribe of judah was taken :
and achan answered joshua , and said , of a truth i have sinned against jehovah , the god of israel , and thus and thus have i done :
so joshua sent messengers , and they ran unto the tent ; and , behold , it was hid in his tent , and the silver under it .
and ye shall rise up from the ambush , and take possession of the city : for jehovah your god will deliver it into your hand .
and he took about five thousand men , and set them in ambush between beth-el and ai , on the west side of the city .
and joshua and all israel made as if they were beaten before them , and fled by the way of the wilderness .
and the king of ai they took alive , and brought him to joshua .
and all that fell that day , both of men and women , were twelve thousand , even all the men of ai .
for joshua drew not back his hand , wherewith he stretched out the javelin , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of ai .
only the cattle and the spoil of that city israel took for prey unto themselves , according unto the word of jehovah which he commanded joshua .
so joshua burnt ai , and made it a heap for ever , even a desolation , unto this day .
then joshua built an altar unto jehovah , the god of israel , in mount ebal ,
and he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of moses , which he wrote , in the presence of the children of israel .
and afterward he read all the words of the law , the blessing and the curse , according to all that is written in the book of the law .
that they gathered themselves together , to fight with joshua and with israel , with one accord .
but when the inhabitants of gibeon heard what joshua had done unto jericho and to ai ,
and old and patched shoes upon their feet , and old garments upon them ; and all the bread of their provision was dry and was become mouldy .
and the men of israel said unto the hivites , peradventure ye dwell among us ; and how shall we make a covenant with you ?
and they said unto joshua , we are thy servants . and joshua said unto them , who are ye ? and from whence come ye ?
and the men took of their provision , and asked not counsel at the mouth of jehovah .
and joshua made peace with them , and made a covenant with them , to let them live : and the princes of the congregation sware unto them .
this we will do to them , and let them live ; lest wrath be upon us , because of the oath which we sware unto them .
and now , behold , we are in thy hand : as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us , do .
and so did he unto them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of israel , that they slew them not .
come up unto me , and help me , and let us smite gibeon ; for it hath made peace with joshua and with the children of israel .
so joshua went up from gilgal , he , and all the people of war with him , and all the mighty men of valor .
and jehovah said unto joshua , fear them not : for i have delivered them into thy hands ; there shall not a man of them stand before thee .
joshua therefore came upon them suddenly ; for he went up from gilgal all the night .
then spake joshua to jehovah in the day when jehovah delivered up the amorites before the children of israel ; and he said in the sight of israel ,
and the sun stood still , and the moon stayed ,
and there was no day like that before it or after it , that jehovah hearkened unto the voice of a man : for jehovah fought for israel .
and joshua returned , and all israel with him , unto the camp to gilgal .
and these five kings fled , and hid themselves in the cave at makkedah .
and it was told joshua , saying , the five kings are found , hidden in the cave at makkedah .
and joshua said , roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave , and set men by it to keep them :
that all the people returned to the camp to joshua at makkedah in peace : none moved his tongue against any of the children of israel .
then said joshua , open the mouth of the cave , and bring forth those five kings unto me out of the cave .
and afterward joshua smote them , and put them to death , and hanged them on five trees : and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening .
and joshua passed from makkedah , and all israel with him , unto libnah , and fought against libnah :
and joshua passed from libnah , and all israel with him , unto lachish , and encamped against it , and fought against it :
then horam king of gezer came up to help lachish ; and joshua smote him and his people , until he had left him none remaining .
and joshua passed from lachish , and all israel with him , unto eglon ; and they encamped against it , and fought against it ;
and joshua went up from eglon , and all israel with him , unto hebron ; and they fought against it :
and joshua returned , and all israel with him , to debir , and fought against it :
and joshua smote them from kadesh-barnea even unto gaza , and all the country of goshen , even unto gibeon .
and all these kings and their land did joshua take at one time , because jehovah , the god of israel , fought for israel .
and joshua returned , and all israel with him , unto the camp to gilgal .
and all these kings met together ; and they came and encamped together at the waters of merom , to fight with israel .
so joshua came , and all the people of war with him , against them by the waters of merom suddenly , and fell upon them .
and joshua did unto them as jehovah bade him : he hocked their horses , and burnt their chariots with fire .
but as for the cities that stood on their mounds , israel burned none of them , save hazor only ; that did joshua burn .
as jehovah commanded moses his servant , so did moses command joshua : and so did joshua ; he left nothing undone of all that jehovah commanded moses .
joshua made war a long time with all those kings .
there was not a city that made peace with the children of israel , save the hivites the inhabitants of gibeon : they took all in battle .
and the border of og king of bashan , of the remnant of the rephaim , who dwelt at ashtaroth and at edrei ,
the king of jericho , one ; the king of ai , which is beside beth-el , one ;
the king of jerusalem , one ; the king of hebron , one ;
the king of jarmuth , one ; the king of lachish , one ;
the king of eglon , one ; the king of gezer , one ;
the king of debir , one ; the king of geder , one ;
the king of hormah , one ; the king of arad , one ;
the king of libnah , one ; the king of adullam , one ;
the king of makkedah , one ; the king of beth-el , one ;
the king of tappuah , one ; the king of hepher , one ;
the king of aphek , one ; the king of lassharon , one ;
the king of madon , one ; the king of hazor , one ;
the king of shimron-meron , one ; the king of achshaph , one ;
the king of taanach , one ; the king of megiddo , one ;
the king of kedesh , one ; the king of jokneam in carmel , one ;
the king of dor in the height of dor , one ; the king of goiim in gilgal , one ;
the king of tirzah , one : all the kings thirty and one .
this is the land that yet remaineth : all the regions of the philistines , and all the geshurites ;
on the south ; all the land of the canaanites , and mearah that belongeth to the sidonians , unto aphek , to the border of the amorites ;
and the land of the gebalites , and all lebanon , toward the sunrising , from baal-gad under mount hermon unto the entrance of hamath ;
now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes , and the half-tribe of manasseh .
and all the cities of sihon king of the amorites , who reigned in heshbon , unto the border of the children of ammon ;
and gilead , and the border of the geshurites and maacathites , and all mount hermon , and all bashan unto salecah ;
nevertheless the children of israel drove not out the geshurites , nor the maacathites : but geshur and maacath dwell in the midst of israel unto this day .
and moses gave unto the tribe of the children of reuben according to their families .
heshbon , and all its cities that are in the plain ; dibon , and bamoth-baal , and beth-baal-meon ,
and jahaz , and kedemoth , and mephaath ,
and kiriathaim , and sibmah , and zereth-shahar in the mount of the valley ,
and beth-peor , and the slopes of pisgah , and beth-jeshimoth ,
balaam also the son of beor , the soothsayer , did the children of israel slay with the sword among the rest of their slain .
and moses gave unto the tribe of gad , unto the children of gad , according to their families .
and their border was jazer , and all the cities of gilead , and half the land of the children of ammon , unto aroer that is before rabbah ;
and from heshbon unto ramath-mizpeh , and betonim ; and from mahanaim unto the border of debir ;
this is the inheritance of the children of gad according to their families , the cities and the villages thereof .
and moses gave inheritance unto the half-tribe of manasseh : and it was for the half-tribe of the children of manasseh according to their families .
these are the inheritances which moses distributed in the plains of moab , beyond the jordan at jericho , eastward .
but unto the tribe of levi moses gave no inheritance : jehovah , the god of israel , is their inheritance , as he spake unto them .
by the lot of their inheritance , as jehovah commanded by moses , for the nine tribes , and for the half-tribe .
for moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the jordan : but unto the levites he gave no inheritance among them .
as jehovah commanded moses , so the children of israel did ; and they divided the land .
nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt ; but i wholly followed jehovah my god .
and joshua blessed him ; and he gave hebron unto caleb the son of jephunneh for an inheritance .
therefore hebron became the inheritance of caleb the son of jephunneh the kenizzite unto this day ; because that he wholly followed jehovah , the god of israel .
now the name of hebron beforetime was kiriath-arba ; which arba was the greatest man among the anakim . and the land had rest from war .
and their south border was from the uttermost part of the salt sea , from the bay that looketh southward ;
and caleb drove out thence the three sons of anak : sheshai , and ahiman , and talmai , the children of anak .
and he went up thence against the inhabitants of debir : now the name of debir beforetime was kiriath-sepher .
and caleb said , he that smiteth kiriath-sepher , and taketh it , to him will i give achsah my daughter to wife .
and othniel the son of kenaz , the brother of caleb , took it : and he gave him achsah his daughter to wife .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of judah according to their families .
and the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of judah toward the border of edom in the south were kabzeel , and eder , and jagur ,
and kinah , and dimonah , and adadah ,
and kedesh , and hazor , and ithnan ,
ziph , and telem , and bealoth ,
and hazor-hadattah , and kerioth-hezron ( the same is hazor ) ,
amam , and shema , and moladah ,
and hazar-gaddah , and heshmon , and beth-pelet ,
and hazar-shual , and beer-sheba , and biziothiah ,
baalah , and iim , and ezem ,
and eltolad , and chesil , and hormah ,
and ziklag , and madmannah , and sansannah ,
and lebaoth , and shilhim , and ain , and rimmon : all the cities are twenty and nine , with their villages .
in the lowland , eshtaol , and zorah , and ashnah ,
and zanoah , and en-gannim , tappuah , and enam ,
jarmuth , and adullam , socoh , and azekah ,
and shaaraim , and adithaim , and gederah , and gederothaim ; fourteen cities with their villages .
zenan , and hadashah , and migdal-gad ,
and dilean , and mizpeh , and joktheel ,
lachish , and bozkath , and eglon ,
and cabbon , and lahmam , and chitlish ,
and gederoth , beth-dagon , and naamah , and makkedah ; sixteen cities with their villages .
libnah , and ether , and ashan ,
and iphtah , and ashnah , and nezib ,
and keilah , and achzib , and mareshah ; nine cities with their villages .
ekron , with its towns and its villages ;
from ekron even unto the sea , all that were by the side of ashdod , with their villages .
and in the hill-country , shamir , and jattir , and socoh ,
and dannah , and kiriath-sannah ( the same is debir ) ,
and anab , and eshtemoh , and anim ,
and goshen , and holon , and giloh ; eleven cities with their villages .
arab , and dumah , and eshan ,
and janim , and beth-tappuah , and aphekah ,
and humtah , and kiriath-arba ( the same is hebron ) , and zior ; nine cities with their villages .

and jezreel , and jokdeam , and zanoah ,
kain , gibeah , and timnah ; ten cities with their villages .
halhul , beth-zur , and gedor ,
and maarath , and beth-anoth , and eltekon ; six cities with their villages .
kiriath-baal ( the same is kiriath-jearim ) , and rabbah ; two cities with their villages .
in the wilderness , beth-arabah , middin , and secacah ,
and nibshan , and the city of salt , and en-gedi ; six cities with their villages .
and it went out from beth-el to luz , and passed along unto the border of the archites to ataroth ;
and the children of joseph , manasseh and ephraim , took their inheritance .
and the border of the children of ephraim according to their families was thus : the border of their inheritance eastward was ataroth-addar , unto beth-horon the upper ;
and it went down from janoah to ataroth , and to naarah , and reached unto jericho , and went out at the jordan .
and there fell ten parts to manasseh , besides the land of gilead and bashan , which is beyond the jordan ;
because the daughters of manasseh had an inheritance among his sons . and the land of gilead belonged unto the rest of the sons of manasseh .
the land of tappuah belonged to manasseh ; but tappuah on the border of manasseh belonged to the children of ephraim .
yet the children of manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities ; but the canaanites would dwell in that land .
and there remained among the children of israel seven tribes , which had not yet divided their inheritance .
and joshua cast lots for them in shiloh before jehovah : and there joshua divided the land unto the children of israel according to their divisions .
and it passed along to the side over against the arabah northward , and went down unto the arabah ;
now the cities of the tribe of the children of benjamin according to their families were jericho , and beth-hoglah , and emek-keziz ,
and beth-arabah , and zemaraim , and beth-el ,
and avvim , and parah , and ophrah ,
and chephar-ammoni , and ophni , and geba ; twelve cities with their villages :
gibeon , and ramah , and beeroth ,
and mizpeh , and chephirah , and mozah ,
and rekem , and irpeel , and taralah ,
and they had for their inheritance beer-sheba , or sheba , and moladah ,
and hazar-shual , and balah , and ezem ,
and eltolad , and bethul , and hormah ,
and ziklag , and beth-marcaboth , and hazar-susah ,
and beth-lebaoth , and sharuhen ; thirteen cities with their villages :
ain , rimmon , and ether , and ashan ; four cities with their villages :
and the third lot came up for the children of zebulun according to their families . and the border of their inheritance was unto sarid ;
and their border went up westward , even to maralah , and reached to dabbesheth ; and it reached to the brook that is before jokneam ;
and it turned from sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of chisloth-tabor ; and it went out to daberath , and went up to japhia ;
and from thence it passed along eastward to gath-hepher , to eth-kazin ; and it went out at rimmon which stretcheth unto neah ;
and the border turned about it on the north to hannathon ; and the goings out thereof were at the valley of iphtah-el ;
and kattath , and nahalal , and shimron , and idalah , and bethlehem : twelve cities with their villages .
this is the inheritance of the children of zebulun according to their families , these cities with their villages .
the fourth lot came out for issachar , even for the children of issachar according to their families .
and their border was unto jezreel , and chesulloth , and shunem ,
and hapharaim , and shion , and anaharath ,
and rabbith , and kishion , and ebez ,
and remeth , and engannim , and en-haddah , and beth-pazzez ,
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of issachar according to their families , the cities with their villages .
and the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of asher according to their families .
and their border was helkath , and hali , and beten , and achshaph ,
and allammelech , and amad , and mishal ; and it reached to carmel westward , and to shihor-libnath ;
and ebron , and rehob , and hammon , and kanah , even unto great sidon ;
ummah also , and aphek , and rehob : twenty and two cities with their villages .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of asher according to their families , these cities with their villages .
the sixth lot came out for the children of naphtali , even for the children of naphtali according to their families .
and the fortified cities were ziddim , zer , and hammath , rakkath , and chinnereth ,
and adamah , and ramah , and hazor ,
and kedesh , and edrei , and en-hazor ,
and iron , and migdal-el , horem , and beth-anath , and beth-shemesh ; nineteen cities with their villages .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of naphtali according to their families , the cities with their villages .
the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of dan according to their families .
and the border of their inheritance was zorah , and eshtaol , and ir-shemesh ,
and shaalabbin , and aijalon , and ithlah ,
and elon , and timnah , and ekron ,
and eltekeh , and gibbethon , and baalath ,
and jehud , and bene-berak , and gath-rimmon ,
and me-jarkon , and rakkon , with the border over against joppa .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .
and jehovah spake unto joshua , saying ,
speak to the children of israel , saying , assign you the cities of refuge , whereof i spake unto you by moses ,
that the manslayer that killeth any person unwittingly and unawares may flee thither : and they shall be unto you for a refuge from the avenger of blood .
and the children of israel gave unto the levites out of their inheritance , according to the commandment of jehovah , these cities with their suburbs .
and the children of israel gave by lot unto the levites these cities with their suburbs , as jehovah commanded by moses .
but the fields of the city , and the villages thereof , gave they to caleb the son of jephunneh for his possession .
and unto the children of aaron the priest they gave hebron with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the manslayer , and libnah with its suburbs ,
and jattir with its suburbs , and eshtemoa with its suburbs ,
and holon with its suburbs , and debir with its suburbs ,
and ain with its suburbs , and juttah with its suburbs , and beth-shemesh with its suburbs ; nine cities out of those two tribes .
and out of the tribe of benjamin , gibeon with its suburbs , geba with its suburbs ,
anathoth with its suburbs , and almon with its suburbs ; four cities .
all the cities of the children of aaron , the priests , were thirteen cities with their suburbs .
and they gave them shechem with its suburbs in the hill-country of ephraim , the city of refuge for the manslayer , and gezer with its suburbs ,
and kibzaim with its suburbs , and beth-horon with its suburbs ; four cities .
and out of the tribe of dan , elteke with its suburbs , gibbethon with its suburbs ,

and out of the tribe of gad , ramoth in gilead with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the manslayer , and mahanaim with its suburbs ,
heshbon with its suburbs , jazer with its suburbs ; four cities in all .
all the cities of the levites in the midst of the possession of the children of israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs .
these cities were every one with their suburbs round about them : thus it was with all these cities .
so jehovah gave unto israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers ; and they possessed it , and dwelt therein .
there failed not aught of any good thing which jehovah had spoken unto the house of israel ; all came to pass .
then joshua called the reubenites , and the gadites , and the half-tribe of manasseh ,
ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day , but have kept the charge of the commandment of jehovah your god .
so joshua blessed them , and sent them away ; and they went unto their tents .
then the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half-tribe of manasseh answered , and spake unto the heads of the thousands of israel ,
therefore we said , let us now prepare to build us an altar , not for burnt-offering , nor for sacrifice :
but cleave unto jehovah your god , as ye have done unto this day .
for jehovah hath driven out from before you great nations and strong : but as for you , no man hath stood before you unto this day .
one man of you shall chase a thousand ; for jehovah your god , he it is that fighteth for you , as he spake unto you .
take good heed therefore unto yourselves , that ye love jehovah your god .
and i sent moses and aaron , and i plagued egypt , according to that which i did in the midst thereof : and afterward i brought you out .
but i would not hearken unto balaam ; therefore he blessed you still : so i delivered you out of his hand .
and the people answered and said , far be it from us that we should forsake jehovah , to serve other gods ;
and the people said unto joshua , nay ; but we will serve jehovah .
now therefore put away , said he , the foreign gods which are among you , and incline your heart unto jehovah , the god of israel .
and the people said unto joshua , jehovah our god will we serve , and unto his voice will we hearken .
so joshua made a covenant with the people that day , and set them a statute and an ordinance in shechem .
so joshua sent the people away , every man unto his inheritance .
and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in timnath-serah , which is in the hill-country of ephraim , on the north of the mountain of gaash .
and eleazar the son of aaron died ; and they buried him in the hill of phinehas his son , which was given him in the hill-country of ephraim .
mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied .
yet in like manner these also in their dreamings defile the flesh , and set at nought dominion , and rail at dignities .
but these rail at whatsoever things they know not : and what they understand naturally , like the creatures without reason , in these things are they destroyed .
wild waves of the sea , foaming out their own shame ; wandering stars , for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved for ever .
and to these also enoch , the seventh from adam , prophesied , saying , behold , the lord came with ten thousands of his holy ones ,
these are murmurers , complainers , walking after their lusts ( and their mouth speaketh great swelling words ) , showing respect of persons for the sake of advantage .
but ye , beloved , remember ye the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our lord jesus christ ;
that they said to you , in the last time there shall be mockers , walking after their own ungodly lusts .
these are they who make separations , sensual , having not the spirit .
but ye , beloved , building up yourselves on your most holy faith , praying in the holy spirit ,
keep yourselves in the love of god , looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life .
and on some have mercy , who are in doubt ;
and some save , snatching them out of the fire ; and on some have mercy with fear ; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh .
now unto him that is able to guard you from stumbling , and to set you before the presence of his glory without blemish in exceeding joy ,
and jehovah said , judah shall go up : behold , i have delivered the land into his hand .
and judah went up ; and jehovah delivered the canaanites and the perizzites into their hand : and they smote of them in bezek ten thousand men .
and they found adoni-bezek in bezek ; and they fought against him , and they smote the canaanites and the perizzites .
but adoni-bezek fled ; and they pursued after him , and caught him , and cut off his thumbs and his great toes .
and the children of judah fought against jerusalem , and took it , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and set the city on fire .
and afterward the children of judah went down to fight against the canaanites that dwelt in the hill-country , and in the south , and in the lowland .
and from thence he went against the inhabitants of debir . ( now the name of debir beforetime was kiriath-sepher . )
and caleb said , he that smiteth kiriath-sepher , and taketh it , to him will i give achsah my daughter to wife .
and othniel the son of kenaz , caleb ’ s younger brother , took it : and he gave him achsah his daughter to wife .
also judah took gaza with the border thereof , and ashkelon with the border thereof , and ekron with the border thereof .
and they gave hebron unto caleb , as moses had spoken : and he drove out thence the three sons of anak .
and the children of benjamin did not drive out the jebusites that inhabited jerusalem ; but the jebusites dwell with the children of benjamin in jerusalem unto this day .
and the house of joseph , they also went up against beth-el ; and jehovah was with them .
and the house of joseph sent to spy out beth-el . ( now the name of the city beforetime was luz . )
and it came to pass , when israel was waxed strong , that they put the canaanites to taskwork , and did not utterly drive them out .
and ephraim drove not out the canaanites that dwelt in gezer ; but the canaanites dwelt in gezer among them .
zebulun drove not out the inhabitants of kitron , nor the inhabitants of nahalol ; but the canaanites dwelt among them , and became subject to taskwork .
but the asherites dwelt among the canaanites , the inhabitants of the land ; for they did not drive them out .
and the amorites forced the children of dan into the hill-country ; for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley ;
and the border of the amorites was from the ascent of akrabbim , from the rock , and upward .
and they called the name of that place bochim : and they sacrificed there unto jehovah .
now when joshua had sent the people away , the children of israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land .
and joshua the son of nun , the servant of jehovah , died , being a hundred and ten years old .
and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in timnath-heres , in the hill-country of ephraim , on the north of the mountain of gaash .
and the children of israel did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah , and served the baalim ;
and they forsook jehovah , and served baal and the ashtaroth .
and jehovah raised up judges , who saved them out of the hand of those that despoiled them .
i also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that joshua left when he died ;
that by them i may prove israel , whether they will keep the way of jehovah to walk therein , as their fathers did keep it , or not .
so jehovah left those nations , without driving them out hastily ; neither delivered he them into the hand of joshua .
now these are the nations which jehovah left , to prove israel by them , even as many of israel as had not known all the wars of canaan ;
only that the generations of the children of israel might know , to teach them war , at the least such as beforetime knew nothing thereof :
and the children of israel dwelt among the canaanites , the hittites , and the amorites , and the perizzites , and the hivites , and the jebusites :
and they took their daughters to be their wives , and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods .
and the children of israel did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah , and forgat jehovah their god , and served the baalim and the asheroth .
and the land had rest forty years . and othniel the son of kenaz died .
and he gathered unto him the children of ammon and amalek ; and he went and smote israel , and they possessed the city of palm-trees .
and the children of israel served eglon the king of moab eighteen years .
and ehud made him a sword which had two edges , a cubit in length ; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh .
and he offered the tribute unto eglon king of moab : now eglon was a very fat man .
and when he had made an end of offering the tribute , he sent away the people that bare the tribute .
and ehud put forth his left hand , and took the sword from his right thigh , and thrust it into his body :
then ehud went forth into the porch , and shut the doors of the upper room upon him , and locked them .
and ehud escaped while they tarried , and passed beyond the quarries , and escaped unto seirah .
and they smote of moab at that time about ten thousand men , every lusty man , and every man of valor ; and there escaped not a man .
so moab was subdued that day under the hand of israel . and the land had rest fourscore years .
and after him was shamgar the son of anath , who smote of the philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad : and he also saved israel .
and the children of israel again did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah , when ehud was dead .
and the children of israel cried unto jehovah : for he had nine hundred chariots of iron ; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of israel .
now deborah , a prophetess , the wife of lappidoth , she judged israel at that time .
and she dwelt under the palm-tree of deborah between ramah and beth-el in the hill-country of ephraim : and the children of israel came up to her for judgment .
and barak called zebulun and naphtali together to kedesh ; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet : and deborah went up with him .
and they told sisera that barak the son of abinoam was gone up to mount tabor .
so god subdued on that day jabin the king of canaan before the children of israel .
and the hand of the children of israel prevailed more and more against jabin the king of canaan , until they had destroyed jabin king of canaan .
then sang deborah and barak the son of abinoam on that day , saying ,
for that the leaders took the lead in israel ,
hear , o ye kings ; give ear , o ye princes ;
jehovah , when thou wentest forth out of seir ,
the mountains quaked at the presence of jehovah ,
in the days of shamgar the son of anath ,
the rulers ceased in israel , they ceased ,
they chose new gods ;
my heart is toward the governors of israel ,
tell of it , ye that ride on white asses ,
far from the noise of archers , in the places of drawing water ,
awake , awake , deborah ;
then came down a remnant of the nobles and the people ;
out of ephraim came down they whose root is in amalek ;
and the princes of issachar were with deborah ;
why sattest thou among the sheepfolds ,
gilead abode beyond the jordan :
zebulun was a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death ,
the kings came and fought ;
from heaven fought the stars ,
the river kishon swept them away ,
then did the horsehoofs stamp
curse ye meroz , said the angel of jehovah .
blessed above women shall jael be ,
he asked water , and she gave him milk ;
she put her hand to the tent-pin ,
at her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay ;
through the window she looked forth , and cried ,
her wise ladies answered her ,
have they not found , have they not divided the spoil ?
so let all thine enemies perish , o jehovah :
and the children of israel did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah : and jehovah delivered them into the hand of midian seven years .
and israel was brought very low because of midian ; and the children of israel cried unto jehovah .
and it came to pass , when the children of israel cried unto jehovah because of midian ,
and the angel of jehovah appeared unto him , and said unto him , jehovah is with thee , thou mighty man of valor .
and jehovah looked upon him , and said , go in this thy might , and save israel from the hand of midian : have not i sent thee ?
and jehovah said unto him , surely i will be with thee , and thou shalt smite the midianites as one man .
and he said unto him , if now i have found favor in thy sight , then show me a sign that it is thou that talkest with me .
and jehovah said unto him , peace be unto thee ; fear not : thou shalt not die .
then gideon built an altar there unto jehovah , and called it jehovah-shalom : unto this day it is yet in ophrah of the abiezrites .
therefore on that day he called him jerubbaal , saying , let baal contend against him , because he hath broken down his altar .
then all the midianites and the amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together ; and they passed over , and encamped in the valley of jezreel .
but the spirit of jehovah came upon gideon ; and he blew a trumpet ; and abiezer was gathered together after him .
and gideon said unto god , if thou wilt save israel by my hand , as thou hast spoken ,
and god did so that night : for it was dry upon the fleece only , and there was dew on all the ground .
but if thou fear to go down , go thou with purah thy servant down to the camp :
and they stood every man in his place round about the camp ; and all the host ran ; and they shouted , and put them to flight .
and the men of israel were gathered together out of naphtali , and out of asher , and out of all manasseh , and pursued after midian .
and gideon came to the jordan , and passed over , he , and the three hundred men that were with him , faint , yet pursuing .
and the princes of succoth said , are the hands of zebah and zalmunna now in thy hand , that we should give bread unto thine army ?
and he spake also unto the men of penuel , saying , when i come again in peace , i will break down this tower .
and gideon the son of joash returned from the battle from the ascent of heres .
and he took the elders of the city , and thorns of the wilderness and briers , and with them he taught the men of succoth .
and he brake down the tower of penuel , and slew the men of the city .
and gideon said unto them , i will not rule over you , neither shall my son rule over you : jehovah shall rule over you .
and they answered , we will willingly give them . and they spread a garment , and did cast therein every man the ear-rings of his spoil .
and jerubbaal the son of joash went and dwelt in his own house .
and gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten ; for he had many wives .
and his concubine that was in shechem , she also bare him a son , and he called his name abimelech .
and gideon the son of joash died in a good old age , and was buried in the sepulchre of joash his father , in ophrah of the abiezrites .
and the children of israel remembered not jehovah their god , who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side ;
neither showed they kindness to the house of jerubbaal , who is gideon , according to all the goodness which he had showed unto israel .
and they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of baal-berith , wherewith abimelech hired vain and light fellows , who followed him .
the trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them ; and they said unto the olive-tree , reign thou over us .
and the trees said to the fig-tree , come thou , and reign over us .
but the fig-tree said unto them , should i leave my sweetness , and my good fruit , and go to wave to and fro over the trees ?
and the trees said unto the vine , come thou , and reign over us .
then said all the trees unto the bramble , come thou , and reign over us .
( for my father fought for you , and adventured his life , and delivered you out of the hand of midian :
and jotham ran away , and fled , and went to beer , and dwelt there , for fear of abimelech his brother .
and abimelech was prince over israel three years .
and god sent an evil spirit between abimelech and the men of shechem ; and the men of shechem dealt treacherously with abimelech :
and gaal the son of ebed came with his brethren , and went over to shechem ; and the men of shechem put their trust in him .
and would that this people were under my hand ! then would i remove abimelech . and he said to abimelech , increase thine army , and come out .
and when zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of gaal the son of ebed , his anger was kindled .
now therefore , up by night , thou and the people that are with thee , and lie in wait in the field :
and abimelech rose up , and all the people that were with him , by night , and they laid wait against shechem in four companies .
and gaal went out before the men of shechem , and fought with abimelech .
and abimelech chased him , and he fled before him , and there fell many wounded , even unto the entrance of the gate .
and abimelech dwelt at arumah : and zebul drove out gaal and his brethren , that they should not dwell in shechem .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that the people went out into the field ; and they told abimelech .
and when all the men of the tower of shechem heard thereof , they entered into the stronghold of the house of elberith .
and it was told abimelech that all the men of the tower of shechem were gathered together .
then went abimelech to thebez , and encamped against thebez , and took it .
and abimelech came unto the tower , and fought against it , and drew near unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
and a certain woman cast an upper millstone upon abimelech ’ s head , and brake his skull .
and when the men of israel saw that abimelech was dead , they departed every man unto his place .
thus god requited the wickedness of abimelech , which he did unto his father , in slaying his seventy brethren ;
and all the wickedness of the men of shechem did god requite upon their heads : and upon them came the curse of jotham the son of jerubbaal .
and he judged israel twenty and three years , and died , and was buried in shamir .
and after him arose jair , the gileadite ; and he judged israel twenty and two years .
and jair died , and was buried in kamon .
yet ye have forsaken me , and served other gods : wherefore i will save you no more .
go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen ; let them save you in the time of your distress .
and they put away the foreign gods from among them , and served jehovah ; and his soul was grieved for the misery of israel .
then the children of ammon were gathered together , and encamped in gilead . and the children of israel assembled themselves together , and encamped in mizpah .
now jephthah the gileadite was a mighty man of valor , and he was the son of a harlot : and gilead begat jephthah .
and it came to pass after a while , that the children of ammon made war against israel .
and they said unto jephthah , come and be our chief , that we may fight with the children of ammon .
and the elders of gilead said unto jephthah , jehovah shall be witness between us ; surely according to thy word so will we do .
and jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of ammon ;
and he said unto him , thus saith jephthah : israel took not away the land of moab , nor the land of the children of ammon ;
but when they came up from egypt , and israel went through the wilderness unto the red sea , and came to kadesh ;
but sihon trusted not israel to pass through his border ; but sihon gathered all his people together , and encamped in jahaz , and fought against israel .
and they possessed all the border of the amorites , from the arnon even unto the jabbok , and from the wilderness even unto the jordan .
so now jehovah , the god of israel , hath dispossessed the amorites from before his people israel , and shouldest thou possess them ?
wilt not thou possess that which chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess ? so whomsoever jehovah our god hath dispossessed from before us , them will we possess .
howbeit the king of the children of ammon hearkened not unto the words of jephthah which he sent him .
and jephthah vowed a vow unto jehovah , and said , if thou wilt indeed deliver the children of ammon into my hand ,
so jephthah passed over unto the children of ammon to fight against them ; and jehovah delivered them into his hand .
that the daughters of israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of jephthah the gileadite four days in a year .
and jephthah judged israel six years . then died jephthah the gileadite , and was buried in one of the cities of gilead .
and after him ibzan of beth-lehem judged israel .
and ibzan died , and was buried at beth-lehem .
and after him elon the zebulunite judged israel ; and he judged israel ten years .
and elon the zebulunite died , and was buried in aijalon in the land of zebulun .
and after him abdon the son of hillel the pirathonite judged israel .
and he had forty sons and thirty sons ’ sons , that rode on threescore and ten ass colts : and he judged israel eight years .
and abdon the son of hillel the pirathonite died , and was buried in pirathon in the land of ephraim , in the hill-country of the amalekites .
and the children of israel again did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah ; and jehovah delivered them into the hand of the philistines forty years .
now therefore beware , i pray thee , and drink no wine nor strong drink , and eat not any unclean thing :
and manoah said , now let thy words come to pass : what shall be the ordering of the child , and how shall we do unto him ?
and the angel of jehovah said unto manoah , of all that i said unto the woman let her beware .
and manoah said unto the angel of jehovah , i pray thee , let us detain thee , that we may make ready a kid for thee .
and manoah said unto the angel of jehovah , what is thy name , that , when thy words come to pass , we may do thee honor ?
and the angel of jehovah said unto him , wherefore askest thou after my name , seeing it is wonderful ?
but the angel of jehovah did no more appear to manoah or to his wife . then manoah knew that he was the angel of jehovah .
and manoah said unto his wife , we shall surely die , because we have seen god .
and the woman bare a son , and called his name samson : and the child grew , and jehovah blessed him .
and the spirit of jehovah began to move him in mahaneh-dan , between zorah and eshtaol .
and samson went down to timnah , and saw a woman in timnah of the daughters of the philistines .
and he went down , and talked with the woman , and she pleased samson well .
and his father went down unto the woman : and samson made there a feast ; for so used the young men to do .
and it came to pass , when they saw him , that they brought thirty companions to be with him .
and he said unto them ,
but samson ’ s wife was given to his companion , whom he had used as his friend .
and samson said unto them , this time shall i be blameless in regard of the philistines , when i do them a mischief .
and samson said unto them , if ye do after this manner , surely i will be avenged of you , and after that i will cease .
and he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter : and he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of etam .
then the philistines went up , and encamped in judah , and spread themselves in lehi .
and he found a fresh jawbone of an ass , and put forth his hand , and took it , and smote a thousand men therewith .
and he judged israel in the days of the philistines twenty years .
and samson went to gaza , and saw there a harlot , and went in unto her .
and it came to pass afterward , that he loved a woman in the valley of sorek , whose name was delilah .
and delilah said to samson , tell me , i pray thee , wherein thy great strength lieth , and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee .
then the lords of the philistines brought up to her seven green withes which had not been dried , and she bound him with them .
and it came to pass , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , that his soul was vexed unto death .
howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven .
and there was a man of the hill-country of ephraim , whose name was micah .
in those days there was no king in israel : every man did that which was right in his own eyes .
and there was a young man out of beth-lehem-judah , of the family of judah , who was a levite ; and he sojourned there .
and the levite was content to dwell with the man ; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons .
and micah consecrated the levite , and the young man became his priest , and was in the house of micah .
then said micah , now know i that jehovah will do me good , seeing i have a levite to my priest .
and he said unto them , thus and thus hath micah dealt with me , and he hath hired me , and i am become his priest .
and they said unto him , ask counsel , we pray thee , of god , that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous .
and the priest said unto them , go in peace : before jehovah is your way wherein ye go .
and they came unto their brethren to zorah and eshtaol : and their brethren said unto them , what say ye ?
and there set forth from thence of the family of the danites , out of zorah and out of eshtaol , six hundred men girt with weapons of war .
and they passed thence unto the hill-country of ephraim , and came unto the house of micah .
and the six hundred men girt with their weapons of war , who were of the children of dan , stood by the entrance of the gate .
so they turned and departed , and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods before them .
and the children of dan went their way : and when micah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back unto his house .
so they set them up micah ’ s graven image which he made , all the time that the house of god was in shiloh .
and the man rose up to depart ; but his father-in-law urged him , and he lodged there again .
and he said unto his servant , come and let us draw near to one of these places ; and we will lodge in gibeah , or in ramah .
so they passed on and went their way ; and the sun went down upon them near to gibeah , which belongeth to benjamin .
and the old man said , peace be unto thee ; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me ; only lodge not in the street .
so he brought him into his house , and gave the asses fodder ; and they washed their feet , and did eat and drink .
behold , ye children of israel , all of you , give here your advice and counsel .
but now this is the thing which we will do to gibeah : we will go up against it by lot ;
so all the men of israel were gathered against the city , knit together as one man .
and the tribes of israel sent men through all the tribe of benjamin , saying , what wickedness is this that is come to pass among you ?
and the children of benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto gibeah , to go out to battle against the children of israel .
among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded ; every one could sling stones at a hair-breadth , and not miss .
and the men of israel , besides benjamin , were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword : all these were men of war .
and the children of israel rose up in the morning , and encamped against gibeah .
and the men of israel went out to battle against benjamin ; and the men of israel set the battle in array against them at gibeah .
and the children of benjamin came forth out of gibeah , and destroyed down to the ground of the israelites on that day twenty and two thousand men .
and the children of israel came near against the children of benjamin the second day .
and the children of israel asked of jehovah ( for the ark of the covenant of god was there in those days ,
and israel set liers-in-wait against gibeah round about .
and the children of israel went up against the children of benjamin on the third day , and set themselves in array against gibeah , as at other times .
and the liers-in-wait hasted , and rushed upon gibeah ; and the liers-in-wait drew themselves along , and smote all the city with the edge of the sword .
now the appointed sign between the men of israel and the liers-in-wait was , that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city .
and the men of israel turned , and the men of benjamin were dismayed ; for they saw that evil was come upon them .
they inclosed the benjamites round about , and chased them , and trod them down at their resting-place , as far as over against gibeah toward the sunrising .
and there fell of benjamin eighteen thousand men ; all these were men of valor .
so that all who fell that day of benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword ; all these were men of valor .
but six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of rimmon , and abode in the rock of rimmon four months .
now the men of israel had sworn in mizpah , saying , there shall not any of us give his daughter unto benjamin to wife .
and the people came to beth-el , and sat there till even before god , and lifted up their voices , and wept sore .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that the people rose early , and built there an altar , and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings .
and the children of israel repented them for benjamin their brother , and said , there is one tribe cut off from israel this day .
how shall we do for wives for them that remain , seeing we have sworn by jehovah that we will not give them of our daughters to wives ?
for when the people were numbered , behold , there were none of the inhabitants of jabesh-gilead there .
and this is the thing that ye shall do : ye shall utterly destroy every male , and every woman that hath lain by man .
and the whole congregation sent and spake to the children of benjamin that were in the rock of rimmon , and proclaimed peace unto them .
and the people repented them for benjamin , because that jehovah had made a breach in the tribes of israel .
then the elders of the congregation said , how shall we do for wives for them that remain , seeing the women are destroyed out of benjamin ?
and they said , there must be an inheritance for them that are escaped of benjamin , that a tribe be not blotted out from israel .
and they commanded the children of benjamin , saying , go and lie in wait in the vineyards ,
in those days there was no king in israel : every man did that which was right in his own eyes .
how doth the city sit solitary , that was full of people !
she weepeth sore in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks ;
judah is gone into captivity because of affliction , and because of great servitude ;
the ways of zion do mourn , because none come to the solemn assembly ;
her adversaries are become the head , her enemies prosper ;
and from the daughter of zion all her majesty is departed :
jerusalem remembereth in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that were from the days of old :
jerusalem hath grievously sinned ; therefore she is become as an unclean thing ;
her filthiness was in her skirts ; she remembered not her latter end ;
the adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things :
all her people sigh , they seek bread ;
is it nothing to you , all ye that pass by ?
from on high hath he sent fire into my bones , and it prevaileth against them ;
the yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand ;
the lord hath set at nought all my mighty men in the midst of me ;
for these things i weep ; mine eye , mine eye runneth down with water ;
zion spreadeth forth her hands ; there is none to comfort her ;
jehovah is righteous ; for i have rebelled against his commandment :
i called for my lovers , but they deceived me :
behold , o jehovah ; for i am in distress ; my heart is troubled ;
they have heard that i sigh ; there is none to comfort me ;
let all their wickedness come before thee ;
how hath the lord covered the daughter of zion with a cloud in his anger !
the lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of jacob , and hath not pitied :
he hath cut off in fierce anger all the horn of israel ;
he hath bent his bow like an enemy , he hath stood with his right hand as an adversary ,
the lord is become as an enemy , he hath swallowed up israel ;
and he hath violently taken away his tabernacle , as if it were of a garden ; he hath destroyed his place of assembly :
the lord hath cast off his altar , he hath abhorred his sanctuary ;
jehovah hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of zion ;
her gates are sunk into the ground ; he hath destroyed and broken her bars :
the elders of the daughter of zion sit upon the ground , they keep silence ;
mine eyes do fail with tears , my heart is troubled ;
they say to their mothers , where is grain and wine ?
what shall i testify unto thee ? what shall i liken to thee , o daughter of jerusalem ?
thy prophets have seen for thee false and foolish visions ;
all that pass by clap their hands at thee ;
all thine enemies have opened their mouth wide against thee ;
jehovah hath done that which he purposed ; he hath fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old ;
their heart cried unto the lord :
arise , cry out in the night , at the beginning of the watches ;
see , o jehovah , and behold to whom thou hast done thus !
the youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets ;
thou hast called , as in the day of a solemn assembly , my terrors on every side ;
i am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath .
he hath led me and caused me to walk in darkness , and not in light .
surely against me he turneth his hand again and again all the day .
my flesh and my skin hath he made old ; he hath broken my bones .
he hath builded against me , and compassed me with gall and travail .
he hath made me to dwell in dark places , as those that have been long dead .
he hath walled me about , that i can not go forth ; he hath made my chain heavy .
yea , when i cry , and call for help , he shutteth out my prayer .
he hath walled up my ways with hewn stone ; he hath made my paths crooked .
he is unto me as a bear lying in wait , as a lion in secret places .
he hath turned aside my ways , and pulled me in pieces ; he hath made me desolate .
he hath bent his bow , and set me as a mark for the arrow .
he hath caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my reins .
i am become a derision to all my people , and their song all the day .
he hath filled me with bitterness , he hath sated me with wormwood .
he hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones ; he hath covered me with ashes .
and thou hast removed my soul far off from peace ; i forgat prosperity .
and i said , my strength is perished , and mine expectation from jehovah .
remember mine affliction and my misery , the wormwood and the gall .
my soul hath them still in remembrance , and is bowed down within me .
this i recall to my mind ; therefore have i hope .
it is of jehovah ’ s lovingkindnesses that we are not consumed , because his compassions fail not .
they are new every morning ; great is thy faithfulness .
jehovah is my portion , saith my soul ; therefore will i hope in him .
jehovah is good unto them that wait for him , to the soul that seeketh him .
it is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of jehovah .
it is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth .
let him sit alone and keep silence , because he hath laid it upon him .
let him put his mouth in the dust , if so be there may be hope .
let him give his cheek to him that smiteth him ; let him be filled full with reproach .
for the lord will not cast off for ever .
for though he cause grief , yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses .
for he doth not afflict willingly , nor grieve the children of men .
to crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth ,
to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most high ,
to subvert a man in his cause , the lord approveth not .
who is he that saith , and it cometh to pass , when the lord commandeth it not ?
out of the mouth of the most high cometh there not evil and good ?
wherefore doth a living man complain , a man for the punishment of his sins ?
let us search and try our ways , and turn again to jehovah .
let us lift up our heart with our hands unto god in the heavens .
we have transgressed and have rebelled ; thou hast not pardoned .
thou hast covered with anger and pursued us ; thou hast slain , thou hast not pitied .
thou hast covered thyself with a cloud , so that no prayer can pass through .
thou hast made us an offscouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples .
all our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us .
fear and the pit are come upon us , devastation and destruction .
mine eye runneth down with streams of water , for the destruction of the daughter of my people .
mine eye poureth down , and ceaseth not , without any intermission ,
till jehovah look down , and behold from heaven .
mine eye affecteth my soul , because of all the daughters of my city .
they have chased me sore like a bird , they that are mine enemies without cause .
they have cut off my life in the dungeon , and have cast a stone upon me .
waters flowed over my head ; i said , i am cut off .
i called upon thy name , o jehovah , out of the lowest dungeon .
thou heardest my voice ; hide not thine ear at my breathing , at my cry .
thou drewest near in the day that i called upon thee ; thou saidst , fear not .
o lord , thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul ; thou hast redeemed my life .
o jehovah , thou hast seen my wrong ; judge thou my cause .
thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me .
thou hast heard their reproach , o jehovah , and all their devices against me ,
the lips of those that rose up against me , and their device against me all the day .
behold thou their sitting down , and their rising up ; i am their song .
thou wilt render unto them a recompense , o jehovah , according to the work of their hands .
thou wilt give them hardness of heart , thy curse unto them .
thou wilt pursue them in anger , and destroy them from under the heavens of jehovah .
how is the gold become dim ! how is the most pure gold changed !
the precious sons of zion , comparable to fine gold ,
even the jackals draw out the breast , they give suck to their young ones :
the tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst :
they that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets :
for the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of sodom ,
her nobles were purer than snow , they were whiter than milk ;
their visage is blacker than a coal ; they are not known in the streets :
they that are slain with the sword are better than they that are slain with hunger ;
the hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children ;
jehovah hath accomplished his wrath , he hath poured out his fierce anger ;
the kings of the earth believed not , neither all the inhabitants of the world ,
it is because of the sins of her prophets , and the iniquities of her priests ,
they wander as blind men in the streets , they are polluted with blood ,
depart ye , they cried unto them , unclean ! depart , depart , touch not !
the anger of jehovah hath scattered them ; he will no more regard them :
our eyes do yet fail in looking for our vain help :
they hunt our steps , so that we can not go in our streets :
our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens :
the breath of our nostrils , the anointed of jehovah , was taken in their pits ;
rejoice and be glad , o daughter of edom , that dwellest in the land of uz :
the punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished , o daughter of zion ; he will no more carry thee away into captivity :
remember , o jehovah , what is come upon us :
our inheritance is turned unto strangers ,
we are orphans and fatherless ;
we have drunken our water for money ;
our pursuers are upon our necks :
we have given the hand to the egyptians ,
our fathers sinned , and are not ;
servants rule over us :
we get our bread at the peril of our lives ,
our skin is black like an oven ,
they ravished the women in zion ,
princes were hanged up by their hand :
the young men bare the mill ;
the elders have ceased from the gate ,
the joy of our heart is ceased ;
the crown is fallen from our head :
for this our heart is faint ;
for the mountain of zion , which is desolate :
thou , o jehovah , abidest for ever ;
wherefore dost thou forget us for ever ,
turn thou us unto thee , o jehovah , and we shall be turned ;
but thou hast utterly rejected us ;
and jehovah called unto moses , and spake unto him out of the tent of meeting , saying ,
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering ; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him .
and he shall flay the burnt-offering , and cut it into its pieces .
and the sons of aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar , and lay wood in order upon the fire ;
and if his oblation to jehovah be a burnt-offering of birds , then he shall offer his oblation of turtle-doves , or of young pigeons .
and he shall take away its crop with the filth thereof , and cast it beside the altar on the east part , in the place of the ashes :
and if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the baking-pan , it shall be of fine flour unleavened , mingled with oil .
thou shalt part it in pieces , and pour oil thereon : it is a meal-offering .
and if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the frying-pan , it shall be made of fine flour with oil .
as an oblation of first-fruits ye shall offer them unto jehovah : but they shall not come up for a sweet savor on the altar .
and thou shalt put oil upon it , and lay frankincense thereon : it is a meal-offering .
and if his oblation for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto jehovah be of the flock ; male or female , he shall offer it without blemish .
if he offer a lamb for his oblation , then shall he offer it before jehovah ;
and the priest shall burn it upon the altar : it is the food of the offering made by fire unto jehovah .
and if his oblation be a goat , then he shall offer it before jehovah :
it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings , that ye shall eat neither fat nor blood .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and the anointed priest shall take of the blood of the bullock , and bring it to the tent of meeting :
and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood , and sprinkle of the blood seven times before jehovah , before the veil of the sanctuary .
as it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace-offerings : and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of burnt-offering .
and the skin of the bullock , and all its flesh , with its head , and with its legs , and its inwards , and its dung ,
and the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before jehovah ; and the bullock shall be killed before jehovah .
and the anointed priest shall bring of the blood of the bullock to the tent of meeting :
and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood , and sprinkle it seven times before jehovah , before the veil .
and all the fat thereof shall he take off from it , and burn it upon the altar .
and he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp , and burn it as he burned the first bullock : it is the sin-offering for the assembly .
when a ruler sinneth , and doeth unwittingly any one of all the things which jehovah his god hath commanded not to be done , and is guilty ;
if his sin , wherein he hath sinned , be made known to him , he shall bring for his oblation a goat , a male without blemish .
and if any one of the common people sin unwittingly , in doing any of the things which jehovah hath commanded not to be done , and be guilty ;
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering , and kill the sin-offering in the place of burnt-offering .
and if he bring a lamb as his oblation for a sin-offering , he shall bring it a female without blemish .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering , and kill it for a sin-offering in the place where they kill the burnt-offering .
and it shall be , when he shall be guilty in one of these things , that he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned :
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
it is a trespass-offering : he is certainly guilty before jehovah .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and the priest shall make atonement for him before jehovah ; and he shall be forgiven concerning whatsoever he doeth so as to be guilty thereby .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and he shall put off his garments , and put on other garments , and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place .
fire shall be kept burning upon the altar continually ; it shall not go out .
and this is the law of the meal-offering : the sons of aaron shall offer it before jehovah , before the altar .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and every meal-offering of the priest shall be wholly burnt : it shall not be eaten .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
the priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it : in a holy place shall it be eaten , in the court of the tent of meeting .
every male among the priests shall eat thereof : it is most holy .
and this is the law of the trespass-offering : it is most holy .
in the place where they kill the burnt-offering shall they kill the trespass-offering ; and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle upon the altar round about .
and he shall offer of it all the fat thereof : the fat tail , and the fat that covereth the inwards ,
and the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto jehovah : it is a trespass-offering .
every male among the priests shall eat thereof : it shall be eaten in a holy place : it is most holy .
as is the sin-offering , so is the trespass-offering ; there is one law for them : the priest that maketh atonement therewith , he shall have it .
and the priest that offereth any man ’ s burnt-offering , even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt-offering which he hath offered .
and every meal-offering , mingled with oil , or dry , shall all the sons of aaron have , one as well as another .
and this is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings , which one shall offer unto jehovah .
with cakes of leavened bread he shall offer his oblation with the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving .
but that which remaineth of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
speak unto the children of israel , saying , ye shall eat no fat , of ox , or sheep , or goat .
and ye shall eat no manner of blood , whether it be of bird or of beast , in any of your dwellings .
whosoever it be that eateth any blood , that soul shall be cut off from his people .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar ; but the breast shall be aaron ’ s and his sons ’ .
and the right thigh shall ye give unto the priest for a heave-offering out of the sacrifices of your peace-offerings .
he among the sons of aaron that offereth the blood of the peace-offerings , and the fat , shall have the right thigh for a portion .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and assemble thou all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting .
and moses did as jehovah commanded him ; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of meeting .
and moses said unto the congregation , this is the thing which jehovah hath commanded to be done .
and moses brought aaron and his sons , and washed them with water .
and he placed the breastplate upon him : and in the breastplate he put the urim and the thummim .
and moses took the anointing oil , and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein , and sanctified them .
and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times , and anointed the altar and all its vessels , and the laver and its base , to sanctify them .
and he poured of the anointing oil upon aaron ’ s head , and anointed him , to sanctify him .
and he brought the bullock of the sin-offering : and aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the sin-offering .
but the bullock , and its skin , and its flesh , and its dung , he burnt with fire without the camp ; as jehovah commanded moses .
and he presented the ram of the burnt-offering : and aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
and he killed it ; and moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about .
and he cut the ram into its pieces ; and moses burnt the head , and the pieces , and the fat .
and he presented the other ram , the ram of consecration : and aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
and he put the whole upon the hands of aaron , and upon the hands of his sons , and waved them for a wave-offering before jehovah .
and that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire .
as hath been done this day , so jehovah hath commanded to do , to make atonement for you .
and aaron and his sons did all the things which jehovah commanded by moses .
and it came to pass on the eighth day , that moses called aaron and his sons , and the elders of israel ;
and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings , to sacrifice before jehovah ; and a meal-offering mingled with oil : for to-day jehovah appeareth unto you .
and they brought that which moses commanded before the tent of meeting : and all the congregation drew near and stood before jehovah .
and moses said , this is the thing which jehovah commanded that ye should do : and the glory of jehovah shall appear unto you .
so aaron drew near unto the altar , and slew the calf of the sin-offering , which was for himself .
but the fat , and the kidneys , and the caul from the liver of the sin-offering , he burnt upon the altar ; as jehovah commanded moses .
and the flesh and the skin he burnt with fire without the camp .
and he slew the burnt-offering ; and aaron ’ s sons delivered unto him the blood , and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about .
and they delivered the burnt-offering unto him , piece by piece , and the head : and he burnt them upon the altar .
and he washed the inwards and the legs , and burnt them upon the burnt-offering on the altar .
and he presented the burnt-offering , and offered it according to the ordinance .
and he presented the meal-offering , and filled his hand therefrom , and burnt it upon the altar , besides the burnt-offering of the morning .
and they put the fat upon the breasts , and he burnt the fat upon the altar :
and the breasts and the right thigh aaron waved for a wave-offering before jehovah ; as moses commanded .
and there came forth fire from before jehovah , and devoured them , and they died before jehovah .
so they drew near , and carried them in their coats out of the camp , as moses had said .
and jehovah spake unto aaron , saying ,
and that ye may make a distinction between the holy and the common , and between the unclean and the clean ;
and that ye may teach the children of israel all the statutes which jehovah hath spoken unto them by moses .
behold , the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary within : ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary , as i commanded .
and when moses heard that , it was well-pleasing in his sight .
and jehovah spake unto moses and to aaron , saying unto them ,
speak unto the children of israel , saying , these are the living things which ye may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth .
whatsoever parteth the hoof , and is clovenfooted , and cheweth the cud , among the beasts , that may ye eat .
and the coney , because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof , he is unclean unto you .
and the hare , because she cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof , she is unclean unto you .
and the swine , because he parteth the hoof , and is clovenfooted , but cheweth not the cud , he is unclean unto you .
of their flesh ye shall not eat , and their carcasses ye shall not touch ; they are unclean unto you .
and they shall be an abomination unto you ; ye shall not eat of their flesh , and their carcasses ye shall have in abomination .
whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters , that is an abomination unto you .
and the kite , and the falcon after its kind ,
every raven after its kind ,
and the ostrich , and the night-hawk , and the sea-mew , and the hawk after its kind ,
and the little owl , and the cormorant , and the great owl ,
and the horned owl , and the pelican , and the vulture ,
and the stork , the heron after its kind , and the hoopoe , and the bat .
all winged creeping things that go upon all fours are an abomination unto you .
yet these may ye eat of all winged creeping things that go upon all fours , which have legs above their feet , wherewith to leap upon the earth .
but all winged creeping things , which have four feet , are an abomination unto you .
and by these ye shall become unclean : whosoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until the even ;
and whosoever beareth aught of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even .
and he that beareth the carcass of them shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : they are unclean unto you .
and the gecko , and the land-crocodile , and the lizard , and the sand-lizard , and the chameleon .
these are they which are unclean to you among all that creep : whosoever doth touch them , when they are dead , shall be unclean until the even .
and every earthen vessel , whereinto any of them falleth , whatsoever is in it shall be unclean , and it ye shall break .
nevertheless a fountain or a pit wherein is a gathering of water shall be clean : but that which toucheth their carcass shall be unclean .
and if aught of their carcass fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown , it is clean .
but if water be put upon the seed , and aught of their carcass fall thereon , it is unclean unto you .
and if any beast , of which ye may eat , die ; he that toucheth the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the even .
and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth is an abomination ; it shall not be eaten .
ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth , neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them , that ye should be defiled thereby .
to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean , and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised .
and jehovah spake unto moses and unto aaron , saying ,
when the plague of leprosy is in a man , then he shall be brought unto the priest ;
but whensoever raw flesh appeareth in him , he shall be unclean .
and the priest shall look on the raw flesh , and pronounce him unclean : the raw flesh is unclean : it is leprosy .
or if the raw flesh turn again , and be changed unto white , then he shall come unto the priest ;
and when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a boil , and it is healed ,
and in the place of the boil there is a white rising , or a bright spot , reddish-white , then it shall be showed to the priest ;
and if it spread abroad in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is a plague .
and when a man or woman hath a plague upon the head or upon the beard ,
then he shall be shaven , but the scall shall he not shave ; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more :
but if the scall spread abroad in the skin after his cleansing ,
and when a man or a woman hath in the skin of the flesh bright spots , even white bright spots ;
and if a man ’ s hair be fallen off his head , he is bald ; yet is he clean .
and if his hair be fallen off from the front part of his head , he is forehead bald ; yet is he clean .
he is a leprous man , he is unclean : the priest shall surely pronounce him unclean ; his plague is in his head .
the garment also that the plague of leprosy is in , whether it be a woollen garment , or a linen garment ;
whether it be in warp , or woof ; of linen , or of woollen ; whether in a skin , or in anything made of skin ;
and the priest shall look upon the plague , and shut up that which hath the plague seven days :
then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is , and he shall shut it up seven days more :
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
this shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing : he shall be brought unto the priest :
then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two living clean birds , and cedar wood , and scarlet , and hyssop :
and the priest shall command to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water .
and the priest shall take of the log of oil , and pour it into the palm of his own left hand ;
and the priest shall offer the burnt-offering and the meal-offering upon the altar : and the priest shall make atonement for him , and he shall be clean .
and on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing unto the priest , unto the door of the tent of meeting , before jehovah :
and the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass-offering , and the log of oil , and the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before jehovah .
and the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand ;
and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before jehovah :
and he shall offer one of the turtle-doves , or of the young pigeons , such as he is able to get ,
this is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy , who is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing .
and jehovah spake unto moses and unto aaron , saying ,
then he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest , saying , there seemeth to me to be as it were a plague in the house .
then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house , and shut up the house seven days .
and the priest shall come again the seventh day , and shall look ; and , behold , if the plague be spread in the walls of the house ;
then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which the plague is , and cast them into an unclean place without the city :
and they shall take other stones , and put them in the place of those stones ; and he shall take other mortar , and shall plaster the house .
moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even .
and he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes ; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes .
and he shall take to cleanse the house two birds , and cedar-wood , and scarlet , and hyssop :
and he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water :
this is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy , and for a scall ,
and for the leprosy of a garment , and for a house ,
and for a rising , and for a scab , and for a bright spot ;
to teach when it is unclean , and when it is clean : this is the law of leprosy .
and jehovah spake unto moses and to aaron , saying ,
every bed whereon he that hath the issue lieth shall be unclean ; and everything whereon he sitteth shall be unclean .
and whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and what saddle soever he that hath the issue rideth upon shall be unclean .
and the earthen vessel , which he that hath the issue toucheth , shall be broken ; and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water .
and every garment , and every skin , whereon is the seed of copulation , shall be washed with water , and be unclean until the even .
the woman also with whom a man shall lie with seed of copulation , they shall both bathe themselves in water , and be unclean until the even .
and everything that she lieth upon in her impurity shall be unclean : everything also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean .
and whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and whosoever toucheth anything that she sitteth upon shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and if it be on the bed , or on anything whereon she sitteth , when he toucheth it , he shall be unclean until the even .
and whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean , and shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
but if she be cleansed of her issue , then she shall number to herself seven days , and after that she shall be clean .
this is the law of him that hath an issue , and of him whose seed of copulation goeth from him , so that he is unclean thereby ;
and jehovah spake unto moses , after the death of the two sons of aaron , when they drew near before jehovah , and died ;
herewith shall aaron come into the holy place : with a young bullock for a sin-offering , and a ram for a burnt-offering .
and he shall take of the congregation of the children of israel two he-goats for a sin-offering , and one ram for a burnt-offering .
and aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering , which is for himself , and make atonement for himself , and for his house .
and he shall take the two goats , and set them before jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting .
and aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats ; one lot for jehovah , and the other lot for azazel .
and aaron shall present the goat upon which the lot fell for jehovah , and offer him for a sin-offering .
and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a solitary land : and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness .
and the fat of the sin-offering shall he burn upon the altar .
and he that letteth go the goat for azazel shall wash his clothes , and bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp .
and he that burneth them shall wash his clothes , and bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp .
for on this day shall atonement be made for you , to cleanse you ; from all your sins shall ye be clean before jehovah .
it is a sabbath of solemn rest unto you , and ye shall afflict your souls ; it is a statute for ever .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and bringeth it not unto the door of the tent of meeting , to sacrifice it unto jehovah ; that man shall be cut off from his people .
therefore i said unto the children of israel , no soul of you shall eat blood , neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood .
but if he wash them not , nor bathe his flesh , then he shall bear his iniquity .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
speak unto the children of israel , and say unto them , i am jehovah your god .
mine ordinances shall ye do , and my statutes shall ye keep , to walk therein : i am jehovah your god .
ye shall therefore keep my statutes , and mine ordinances ; which if a man do , he shall live in them : i am jehovah .
none of you shall approach to any that are near of kin to him , to uncover their nakedness : i am jehovah .
the nakedness of thy father , even the nakedness of thy mother , shalt thou not uncover : she is thy mother ; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness .
the nakedness of thy father ’ s wife shalt thou not uncover ; it is thy father ’ s nakedness .
the nakedness of thy father ’ s wife ’ s daughter , begotten of thy father , she is thy sister , thou shalt not uncover her nakedness .
thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father ’ s sister : she is thy father ’ s near kinswoman .
thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother ’ s sister : for she is thy mother ’ s near kinswoman .
thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father ’ s brother , thou shalt not approach to his wife : she is thine aunt .
thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law : she is thy son ’ s wife ; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness .
thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother ’ s wife : it is thy brother ’ s nakedness .
and thou shalt not take a wife to her sister , to be a rival to her , to uncover her nakedness , besides the other in her life-time .
and thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness , as long as she is impure by her uncleanness .
and thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbor ’ s wife , to defile thyself with her .
thou shalt not lie with mankind , as with womankind : it is abomination .
defile not ye yourselves in any of these things : for in all these the nations are defiled which i cast out from before you ;
and the land is defiled : therefore i do visit the iniquity thereof upon it , and the land vomiteth out her inhabitants .
ye therefore shall keep my statutes and mine ordinances , and shall not do any of these abominations ; neither the home-born , nor the stranger that sojourneth among you
( for all these abominations have the men of the land done , that were before you , and the land is defiled ) ;
that the land vomit not you out also , when ye defile it , as it vomited out the nation that was before you .
for whosoever shall do any of these abominations , even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
speak unto all the congregation of the children of israel , and say unto them , ye shall be holy ; for i jehovah your god am holy .
ye shall fear every man his mother , and his father ; and ye shall keep my sabbaths : i am jehovah your god .
turn ye not unto idols , nor make to yourselves molten gods : i am jehovah your god .
and when ye offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto jehovah , ye shall offer it that ye may be accepted .
and if it be eaten at all on the third day , it is an abomination ; it shall not be accepted :
ye shall not steal ; neither shall ye deal falsely , nor lie one to another .
and ye shall not swear by my name falsely , and profane the name of thy god : i am jehovah .
thou shalt not oppress thy neighbor , nor rob him : the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night until the morning .
thou shalt not curse the deaf , nor put a stumblingblock before the blind ; but thou shalt fear thy god : i am jehovah .
thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people : neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor : i am jehovah .
thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart : thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbor , and not bear sin because of him .
thou shalt not take vengeance , nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people ; but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself : i am jehovah .
and he shall bring his trespass-offering unto jehovah , unto the door of the tent of meeting , even a ram for a trespass-offering .
but in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy , for giving praise unto jehovah .
and in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof , that it may yield unto you the increase thereof : i am jehovah your god .
ye shall not eat anything with the blood : neither shall ye use enchantments , nor practise augury .
ye shall not round the corners of your heads , neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard .
ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead , nor print any marks upon you : i am jehovah .
profane not thy daughter , to make her a harlot ; lest the land fall to whoredom , and the land become full of wickedness .
ye shall keep my sabbaths , and reverence my sanctuary : i am jehovah .
thou shalt rise up before the hoary head , and honor the face of the old man , and thou shalt fear thy god : i am jehovah .
and if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land , ye shall not do him wrong .
ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment , in measures of length , of weight , or of quantity .
and ye shall observe all my statutes , and all mine ordinances , and do them : i am jehovah .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
sanctify yourselves therefore , and be ye holy ; for i am jehovah your god .
and ye shall keep my statutes , and do them : i am jehovah who sanctifieth you .
and if a man lie with a beast , he shall surely be put to death : and ye shall slay the beast .
and if a man shall take his brother ’ s wife , it is impurity : he hath uncovered his brother ’ s nakedness ; they shall be childless .
and for his sister a virgin , that is near unto him , that hath had no husband ; for her may he defile himself .
he shall not defile himself , being a chief man among his people , to profane himself .
they shall not make baldness upon their head , neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard , nor make any cuttings in their flesh .
and the daughter of any priest , if she profane herself by playing the harlot , she profaneth her father : she shall be burnt with fire .
neither shall he go in to any dead body , nor defile himself for his father , or for his mother ;
and he shall take a wife in her virginity .
and he shall not profane his seed among his people : for i am jehovah who sanctifieth him .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
or a man that is broken-footed , or broken-handed ,
or crook-backed , or a dwarf , or that hath a blemish in his eye , or is scurvy , or scabbed , or hath his stones broken ;
he shall eat the bread of his god , both of the most holy , and of the holy :
so moses spake unto aaron , and to his sons , and unto all the children of israel .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing , whereby he may be made unclean , or a man of whom he may take uncleanness , whatsoever uncleanness he hath ;
the soul that toucheth any such shall be unclean until the even , and shall not eat of the holy things , unless he bathe his flesh in water .
and when the sun is down , he shall be clean ; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things , because it is his bread .
that which dieth of itself , or is torn of beasts , he shall not eat , to defile himself therewith : i am jehovah .
they shall therefore keep my charge , lest they bear sin for it , and die therein , if they profane it : i am jehovah who sanctifieth them .
and if a priest ’ s daughter be married unto a stranger , she shall not eat of the heave-offering of the holy things .
and they shall not profane the holy things of the children of israel , which they offer unto jehovah ,
and so cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt , when they eat their holy things : for i am jehovah who sanctifieth them .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
that ye may be accepted , ye shall offer a male without blemish , of the bullocks , of the sheep , or of the goats .
but whatsoever hath a blemish , that shall ye not offer : for it shall not be acceptable for you .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and whether it be cow or ewe , ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day .
and when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto jehovah , ye shall sacrifice it that ye may be accepted .
on the same day it shall be eaten ; ye shall leave none of it until the morning : i am jehovah .
therefore shall ye keep my commandments , and do them : i am jehovah .
and ye shall not profane my holy name ; but i will be hallowed among the children of israel : i am jehovah who halloweth you ,
who brought you out of the land of egypt , to be your god : i am jehovah .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
these are the set feasts of jehovah , even holy convocations , which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season .
in the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month at even , is jehovah ’ s passover .
and on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto jehovah : seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread .
in the first day ye shall have a holy convocation : ye shall do no servile work .
but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto jehovah seven days : in the seventh day is a holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and he shall wave the sheaf before jehovah , to be accepted for you : on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it .
and in the day when ye wave the sheaf , ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt-offering unto jehovah .
even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days ; and ye shall offer a new meal-offering unto jehovah .
and ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin-offering , and two he-lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace-offerings .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
ye shall do no servile work ; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto jehovah .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
for whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day ; he shall be cut off from his people .
and whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day , that soul will i destroy from among his people .
ye shall do no manner of work : it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
speak unto the children of israel , saying , on the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto jehovah .
on the first day shall be a holy convocation : ye shall do no servile work .
besides the sabbaths of jehovah , and besides your gifts , and besides all your vows , and besides all your freewill-offerings , which ye give unto jehovah .
ye shall dwell in booths seven days ; all that are home-born in israel shall dwell in booths ;
and moses declared unto the children of israel the set feasts of jehovah .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
command the children of israel , that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light , to cause a lamp to burn continually .
he shall keep in order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before jehovah continually .
and thou shalt take fine flour , and bake twelve cakes thereof : two tenth parts of an ephah shall be in one cake .
and thou shalt set them in two rows , six on a row , upon the pure table before jehovah .
and thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row , that it may be to the bread for a memorial , even an offering made by fire unto jehovah .
every sabbath day he shall set it in order before jehovah continually ; it is on the behalf of the children of israel , an everlasting covenant .
and they put him in ward , that it might be declared unto them at the mouth of jehovah .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel , saying , whosoever curseth his god shall bear his sin .
and he that smiteth any man mortally shall surely be put to death .
and he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good , life for life .
and if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor ; as he hath done , so shall it be done to him :
breach for breach , eye for eye , tooth for tooth ; as he hath caused a blemish in a man , so shall it be rendered unto him .
and he that killeth a beast shall make it good : and he that killeth a man shall be put to death .
ye shall have one manner of law , as well for the sojourner , as for the home-born : for i am jehovah your god .
and jehovah spake unto moses in mount sinai , saying ,
six years thou shalt sow thy field , and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard , and gather in the fruits thereof ;
and for thy cattle , and for the beasts that are in thy land , shall all the increase thereof be for food .
for it is a jubilee ; it shall be holy unto you : ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field .
in this year of jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession .
and if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor , or buy of thy neighbor ’ s hand , ye shall not wrong one another .
and ye shall not wrong one another ; but thou shalt fear thy god : for i am jehovah your god .
wherefore ye shall do my statutes , and keep mine ordinances and do them ; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety .
and the land shall yield its fruit , and ye shall eat your fill , and dwell therein in safety .
and if ye shall say , what shall we eat the seventh year ? behold , we shall not sow , nor gather in our increase ;
then i will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year , and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years .
and the land shall not be sold in perpetuity ; for the land is mine : for ye are strangers and sojourners with me .
and in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land .
and if a man have no one to redeem it , and he be waxed rich and find sufficient to redeem it ;
nevertheless the cities of the levites , the houses of the cities of their possession , may the levites redeem at any time .
but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold ; for it is their perpetual possession .
take thou no interest of him or increase , but fear thy god ; that thy brother may live with thee .
thou shalt not give him thy money upon interest , nor give him thy victuals for increase .
and if thy brother be waxed poor with thee , and sell himself unto thee ; thou shalt not make him to serve as a bondservant .
as a hired servant , and as a sojourner , he shall be with thee ; he shall serve with thee unto the year of jubilee :
for they are my servants , whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt : they shall not be sold as bondmen .
thou shalt not rule over him with rigor , but shalt fear thy god .
after that he is sold he may be redeemed : one of his brethren may redeem him ;
if there be yet many years , according unto them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for .
as a servant hired year by year shall he be with him : he shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight .
and if he be not redeemed by these means , then he shall go out in the year of jubilee , he , and his children with him .
ye shall keep my sabbaths , and reverence my sanctuary : i am jehovah .
if ye walk in my statutes , and keep my commandments , and do them ;
then i will give your rains in their season , and the land shall yield its increase , and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit .
and ye shall chase your enemies , and they shall fall before you by the sword .
and five of you shall chase a hundred , and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand ; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword .
and i will have respect unto you , and make you fruitful , and multiply you , and will establish my covenant with you .
and ye shall eat old store long kept , and ye shall bring forth the old because of the new .
and i will set my tabernacle among you : and my soul shall not abhor you .
and i will walk among you , and will be your god , and ye shall be my people .
but if ye will not hearken unto me , and will not do all these commandments ;
and if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto me , then i will chastise you seven times more for your sins .
and i will break the pride of your power : and i will make your heaven as iron , and your earth as brass ;
and your strength shall be spent in vain ; for your land shall not yield its increase , neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit .
and if ye walk contrary unto me , and will not hearken unto me , i will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins .
and if by these things ye will not be reformed unto me , but will walk contrary unto me ;
then will i also walk contrary unto you ; and i will smite you , even i , seven times for your sins .
and if ye will not for all this hearken unto me , but walk contrary unto me ;
then i will walk contrary unto you in wrath ; and i also will chastise you seven times for your sins .
and ye shall eat the flesh of your sons , and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat .
and i will make your cities a waste , and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation , and i will not smell the savor of your sweet odors .
and i will bring the land into desolation ; and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it .
as long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest , even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths , when ye dwelt upon it .
and ye shall perish among the nations , and the land of your enemies shall eat you up .
these are the statutes and ordinances and laws , which jehovah made between him and the children of israel in mount sinai by moses .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
speak unto the children of israel , and say unto them , when a man shall accomplish a vow , the persons shall be for jehovah by thy estimation .
and if it be a female , then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels .
and if it be a beast , whereof men offer an oblation unto jehovah , all that any man giveth of such unto jehovah shall be holy .
and if it be any unclean beast , of which they do not offer an oblation unto jehovah , then he shall set the beast before the priest ;
and the priest shall value it , whether it be good or bad : as thou the priest valuest it , so shall it be .
but if he will indeed redeem it , then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto thy estimation .
if he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee , according to thy estimation it shall stand .
and if he will not redeem the field , or if he have sold the field to another man , it shall not be redeemed any more :
and if he sanctify unto jehovah a field which he hath bought , which is not of the field of his possession ;
in the year of jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought , even to him to whom the possession of the land belongeth .
and all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary : twenty gerahs shall be the shekel .
no one devoted , that shall be devoted from among men , shall be ransomed ; he shall surely be put to death .
and if a man will redeem aught of his tithe , he shall add unto it the fifth part thereof .
and all the tithe of the herd or the flock , whatsoever passeth under the rod , the tenth shall be holy unto jehovah .
these are the commandments , which jehovah commanded moses for the children of israel in mount sinai .
forasmuch as many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us ,
even as they delivered them unto us , who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word ,
it seemed good to me also , having traced the course of all things accurately from the first , to write unto thee in order , most excellent theophilus ;
that thou mightest know the certainty concerning the things wherein thou wast instructed .
and they were both righteous before god , walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless .
and they had no child , because that elisabeth was barren , and they both were now well stricken in years .
now it came to pass , while he executed the priest ’ s office before god in the order of his course ,
according to the custom of the priest ’ s office , his lot was to enter into the temple of the lord and burn incense .
and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense .
and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense .
and zacharias was troubled when he saw him , and fear fell upon him .
and thou shalt have joy and gladness ; and many shall rejoice at his birth .
and many of the children of israel shall he turn unto the lord their god .
and zacharias said unto the angel , whereby shall i know this ? for i am an old man , and my wife well stricken in years .
and the people were waiting for zacharias , and they marvelled while he tarried in the temple .
and it came to pass , when the days of his ministration were fulfilled , he departed unto his house .
and after these days elisabeth his wife conceived ; and she hid herself five months , saying ,
thus hath the lord done unto me in the days wherein he looked upon me , to take away my reproach among men .
now in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee , named nazareth ,
to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was joseph , of the house of david ; and the virgin ’ s name was mary .
and he came in unto her , and said , hail , thou that art highly favored , the lord is with thee .
but she was greatly troubled at the saying , and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this might be .
and the angel said unto her , fear not , mary : for thou hast found favor with god .
and behold , thou shalt conceive in thy womb , and bring forth a son , and shalt call his name jesus .
and he shall reign over the house of jacob for ever ; and of his kingdom there shall be no end .
and mary said unto the angel , how shall this be , seeing i know not a man ?
for no word from god shall be void of power .
and mary said , behold , the handmaid of the lord ; be it unto me according to thy word . and the angel departed from her .
and mary arose in these days and went into the hill country with haste , into a city of judah ;
and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elisabeth .
and it came to pass , when elisabeth heard the salutation of mary , the babe leaped in her womb ; and elisabeth was filled with the holy spirit ;
and she lifted up her voice with a loud cry , and said , blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb .
and whence is this to me , that the mother of my lord should come unto me ?
for behold , when the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears , the babe leaped in my womb for joy .
and blessed is she that believed ; for there shall be a fulfilment of the things which have been spoken to her from the lord .
and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my saviour .
for he hath looked upon the low estate of his handmaid :
for he that is mighty hath done to me great things ;
and his mercy is unto generations and generations
he hath showed strength with his arm ;
he hath put down princes from their thrones ,
the hungry he hath filled with good things ;
he hath given help to israel his servant ,
( as he spake unto our fathers )
and mary abode with her about three months , and returned unto her house .
now elisabeth ’ s time was fulfilled that she should be delivered ; and she brought forth a son .
and her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard that the lord had magnified his mercy towards her ; and they rejoiced with her .
and his mother answered and said , not so ; but he shall be called john .
and they said unto her , there is none of thy kindred that is called by this name .
and they made signs to his father , what he would have him called .
and he asked for a writing tablet , and wrote , saying , his name is john . and they marvelled all .
and his mouth was opened immediately , and his tongue loosed , and he spake , blessing god .
and fear came on all that dwelt round about them : and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of judaea .
and his father zacharias was filled with the holy spirit , and prophesied , saying ,
blessed be the lord , the god of israel ;
and hath raised up a horn of salvation for us
( as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from of old ) ,
salvation from our enemies , and from the hand of all that hate us ;
to show mercy towards our fathers ,
the oath which he sware unto abraham our father ,
to grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies
in holiness and righteousness before him all our days .
yea and thou , child , shalt be called the prophet of the most high :
to give knowledge of salvation unto his people
because of the tender mercy of our god ,
to shine upon them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death ;
and the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto israel .
now it came to pass in those days , there went out a decree from caesar augustus , that all the world should be enrolled .
this was the first enrolment made when quirinius was governor of syria .
and all went to enrol themselves , every one to his own city .
to enrol himself with mary , who was betrothed to him , being great with child .
and it came to pass , while they were there , the days were fulfilled that she should be delivered .
and there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the field , and keeping watch by night over their flock .
and an angel of the lord stood by them , and the glory of the lord shone round about them : and they were sore afraid .
and the angel said unto them , be not afraid ; for behold , i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all the people :
for there is born to you this day in the city of david a saviour , who is christ the lord .
and this is the sign unto you : ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes , and lying in a manger .
and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god , and saying ,
glory to god in the highest ,
and they came with haste , and found both mary and joseph , and the babe lying in the manger .
and when they saw it , they made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this child .
and all that heard it wondered at the things which were spoken unto them by the shepherds .
but mary kept all these sayings , pondering them in her heart .
and the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen , even as it was spoken unto them .
and when the days of their purification according to the law of moses were fulfilled , they brought him up to jerusalem , to present him to the lord
( as it is written in the law of the lord , every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord ) ,
and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord , a pair of turtledoves , or two young pigeons .
and it had been revealed unto him by the holy spirit , that he should not see death , before he had seen the lord ’ s christ .
then he received him into his arms , and blessed god , and said ,
now lettest thou thy servant depart , lord ,
for mine eyes have seen thy salvation ,
which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples ;
a light for revelation to the gentiles ,
and his father and his mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him ;
yea and a sword shall pierce through thine own soul ; that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed .
and she had been a widow even unto fourscore and four years ) , who departed not from the temple , worshipping with fastings and supplications night and day .
and coming up at that very hour she gave thanks unto god , and spake of him to all them that were looking for the redemption of jerusalem .
and when they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the lord , they returned into galilee , to their own city nazareth .
and the child grew , and waxed strong , filled with wisdom : and the grace of god was upon him .
and his parents went every year to jerusalem at the feast of the passover .
and when he was twelve years old , they went up after the custom of the feast ;
and when they had fulfilled the days , as they were returning , the boy jesus tarried behind in jerusalem ; and his parents knew it not ;
but supposing him to be in the company , they went a day ’ s journey ; and they sought for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance :
and when they found him not , they returned to jerusalem , seeking for him .
and all that heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers .
and he said unto them , how is it that ye sought me ? knew ye not that i must be in my father ’ s house ?
and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them .
and he went down with them , and came to nazareth ; and he was subject unto them : and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart .
and jesus advanced in wisdom and stature , and in favor with god and men .
in the high-priesthood of annas and caiaphas , the word of god came unto john the son of zacharias in the wilderness .
and he came into all the region round about the jordan , preaching the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins ;
as it is written in the book of the words of isaiah the prophet ,
every valley shall be filled ,
and all flesh shall see the salvation of god .
and the multitudes asked him , saying , what then must we do ?
and there came also publicans to be baptized , and they said unto him , teacher , what must we do ?
and he said unto them , extort no more than that which is appointed you .
and as the people were in expectation , and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning john , whether haply he were the christ ;
with many other exhortations therefore preached he good tidings unto the people ;
but herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him for herodias his brother ’ s wife , and for all the evil things which herod had done ,
added this also to them all , that he shut up john in prison .
now it came to pass , when all the people were baptized , that , jesus also having been baptized , and praying , the heaven was opened ,
the son of matthat , the son of levi , the son of melchi , the son of jannai , the son of joseph ,
the son of mattathias , the son of amos , the son of nahum , the son of esli , the son of naggai ,
the son of maath , the son of mattathias , the son of semein , the son of josech , the son of joda ,
the son of joanan , the son of rhesa , the son of zerubbabel , the son of shealtiel , the son of neri ,
the son of melchi , the son of addi , the son of cosam , the son of elmadam , the son of er ,
the son of jesus , the son of eliezer , the son of jorim , the son of matthat , the son of levi ,
the son of symeon , the son of judas , the son of joseph , the son of jonam , the son of eliakim ,
the son of melea , the son of menna , the son of mattatha , the son of nathan , the son of david ,
the son of jesse , the son of obed , the son of boaz , the son of salmon , the son of nahshon ,
the son of amminadab , the son of arni , the son of hezron , the son of perez , the son of judah ,
the son of jacob , the son of isaac , the son of abraham , the son of terah , the son of nahor ,
the son of serug , the son of reu , the son of peleg , the son of eber , the son of shelah ,
the son of cainan , the son of arphaxad , the son of shem , the son of noah , the son of lamech ,
the son of methuselah , the son of enoch , the son of jared , the son of mahalaleel , the son of cainan ,
the son of enos , the son of seth , the son of adam , the son of god .
and jesus , full of the holy spirit , returned from the jordan , and was led in the spirit in the wilderness
during forty days , being tempted of the devil . and he did eat nothing in those days : and when they were completed , he hungered .
and the devil said unto him , if thou art the son of god , command this stone that it become bread .
and jesus answered unto him , it is written , man shall not live by bread alone .
and he led him up , and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
if thou therefore wilt worship before me , it shall all be thine .
and jesus answered and said unto him , it is written , thou shalt worship the lord thy god , and him only shalt thou serve .
for it is written ,
and jesus answering said unto him , it is said , thou shalt not make trial of the lord thy god .
and when the devil had completed every temptation , he departed from him for a season .
and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee : and a fame went out concerning him through all the region round about .
and he taught in their synagogues , being glorified of all .
and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah . and he opened the book , and found the place where it was written ,
the spirit of the lord is upon me ,
to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord .
and he began to say unto them , to-day hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears .
and he said , verily i say unto you , no prophet is acceptable in his own country .
and unto none of them was elijah sent , but only to zarephath , in the land of sidon , unto a woman that was a widow .
and there were many lepers in israel in the time of elisha the prophet ; and none of them was cleansed , but only naaman the syrian .
and they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue , as they heard these things ;
but he passing through the midst of them went his way .
and he came down to capernaum , a city of galilee . and he was teaching them on the sabbath day :
and they were astonished at his teaching ; for his word was with authority .
and in the synagogue there was a man , that had a spirit of an unclean demon ; and he cried out with a loud voice ,
and there went forth a rumor concerning him into every place of the region round about .
and he stood over her , and rebuked the fever ; and it left her : and immediately she rose up and ministered unto them .
but he said unto them , i must preach the good tidings of the kingdom of god to the other cities also : for therefore was i sent .
and he was preaching in the synagogues of galilee .
now it came to pass , while the multitude pressed upon him and heard the word of god , that he was standing by the lake of gennesaret ;
and he saw two boats standing by the lake : but the fishermen had gone out of them , and were washing their nets .
and when he had left speaking , he said unto simon , put out into the deep , and let down your nets for a draught .
and simon answered and said , master , we toiled all night , and took nothing : but at thy word i will let down the nets .
and when they had done this , they inclosed a great multitude of fishes ; and their nets were breaking ;
for he was amazed , and all that were with him , at the draught of the fishes which they had taken ;
and when they had brought their boats to land , they left all , and followed him .
and he stretched forth his hand , and touched him , saying , i will ; be thou made clean . and straightway the leprosy departed from him .
but so much the more went abroad the report concerning him : and great multitudes came together to hear , and to be healed of their infirmities .
but he withdrew himself in the deserts , and prayed .
and behold , men bring on a bed a man that was palsied : and they sought to bring him in , and to lay him before him .
and seeing their faith , he said , man , thy sins are forgiven thee .
and the scribes and the pharisees began to reason , saying , who is this that speaketh blasphemies ? who can forgive sins , but god alone ?
but jesus perceiving their reasonings , answered and said unto them , why reason ye in your hearts ?
which is easier , to say , thy sins are forgiven thee ; or to say , arise and walk ?
and immediately he rose up before them , and took up that whereon he lay , and departed to his house , glorifying god .
and amazement took hold on all , and they glorified god ; and they were filled with fear , saying , we have seen strange things to-day .
and he forsook all , and rose up and followed him .
and levi made him a great feast in his house : and there was a great multitude of publicans and of others that were sitting at meat with them .
and the pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples , saying , why do ye eat and drink with the publicans and sinners ?
and jesus answering said unto them , they that are in health have no need of a physician ; but they that are sick .
i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance .
and jesus said unto them , can ye make the sons of the bride-chamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ?
but the days will come ; and when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , then will they fast in those days .
but new wine must be put into fresh wine-skins .
and no man having drunk old wine desireth new ; for he saith , the old is good .
but certain of the pharisees said , why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath day ?
and he said unto them , the son of man is lord of the sabbath .
and the scribes and the pharisees watched him , whether he would heal on the sabbath ; that they might find how to accuse him .
and he looked round about on them all , and said unto him , stretch forth thy hand . and he did so : and his hand was restored .
but they were filled with madness ; and communed one with another what they might do to jesus .
and it came to pass in these days , that he went out into the mountain to pray ; and he continued all night in prayer to god .
and when it was day , he called his disciples ; and he chose from them twelve , whom also he named apostles :
simon , whom he also named peter , and andrew his brother , and james and john , and philip and bartholomew ,
and matthew and thomas , and james the son of alphaeus , and simon who was called the zealot ,
and judas the son of james , and judas iscariot , who became a traitor ;
and they that were troubled with unclean spirits were healed .
and all the multitude sought to touch him ; for power came forth from him , and healed them all .
and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples , and said , blessed are ye poor : for yours is the kingdom of god .
blessed are ye that hunger now : for ye shall be filled . blessed are ye that weep now : for ye shall laugh .
but woe unto you that are rich ! for ye have received your consolation .
woe unto you , when all men shall speak well of you ! for in the same manner did their fathers to the false prophets .
but i say unto you that hear , love your enemies , do good to them that hate you ,
bless them that curse you , pray for them that despitefully use you .
to him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other ; and from him that taketh away thy cloak withhold not thy coat also .
give to every one that asketh thee ; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again .
and as ye would that men should do to you , do ye also to them likewise .
and if ye love them that love you , what thank have ye ? for even sinners love those that love them .
and if ye do good to them that do good to you , what thank have ye ? for even sinners do the same .
and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive , what thank have ye ? even sinners lend to sinners , to receive again as much .
be ye merciful , even as your father is merciful .
and judge not , and ye shall not be judged : and condemn not , and ye shall not be condemned : release , and ye shall be released :
and he spake also a parable unto them , can the blind guide the blind ? shall they not both fall into a pit ?
the disciple is not above his teacher : but every one when he is perfected shall be as his teacher .
and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother ’ s eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
for there is no good tree that bringeth forth corrupt fruit ; nor again a corrupt tree that bringeth forth good fruit .
for each tree is known by its own fruit . for of thorns men do not gather figs , nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes .
and why call ye me , lord , lord , and do not the things which i say ?
every one that cometh unto me , and heareth my words , and doeth them , i will show you to whom he is like :
after he had ended all his sayings in the ears of the people , he entered into capernaum .
and a certain centurion ’ s servant , who was dear unto him , was sick and at the point of death .
and when he heard concerning jesus , he sent unto him elders of the jews , asking him that he would come and save his servant .
and they , when they came to jesus , besought him earnestly , saying , he is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him ;
for he loveth our nation , and himself built us our synagogue .
wherefore neither thought i myself worthy to come unto thee : but say the word , and my servant shall be healed .
and they that were sent , returning to the house , found the servant whole .
and it came to pass soon afterwards , that he went to a city called nain ; and his disciples went with him , and a great multitude .
and when the lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and said unto her , weep not .
and he came nigh and touched the bier : and the bearers stood still . and he said , young man , i say unto thee , arise .
and he that was dead sat up , and began to speak . and he gave him to his mother .
and fear took hold on all : and they glorified god , saying , a great prophet is arisen among us : and , god hath visited his people .
and this report went forth concerning him in the whole of judaea , and all the region round about .
and the disciples of john told him of all these things .
and john calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to the lord , saying , art thou he that cometh , or look we for another ?
in that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits ; and on many that were blind he bestowed sight .
and blessed is he , whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me .
but what went ye out to see ? a prophet ? yea , i say unto you , and much more than a prophet .
this is he of whom it is written ,
and all the people when they heard , and the publicans , justified god , being baptized with the baptism of john .
but the pharisees and the lawyers rejected for themselves the counsel of god , being not baptized of him .
whereunto then shall i liken the men of this generation , and to what are they like ?
for john the baptist is come eating no bread nor drinking wine ; and ye say , he hath a demon .
and wisdom is justified of all her children .
and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him . and he entered into the pharisee ’ s house , and sat down to meat .
and jesus answering said unto him , simon , i have somewhat to say unto thee . and he saith , teacher , say on .
a certain lender had two debtors : the one owed five hundred shillings , and the other fifty .
when they had not wherewith to pay , he forgave them both . which of them therefore will love him most ?
simon answered and said , he , i suppose , to whom he forgave the most . and he said unto him , thou hast rightly judged .
thou gavest me no kiss : but she , since the time i came in , hath not ceased to kiss my feet .
my head with oil thou didst not anoint : but she hath anointed my feet with ointment .
and he said unto her , thy sins are forgiven .
and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves , who is this that even forgiveth sins ?
and he said unto the woman , thy faith hath saved thee ; go in peace .
and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities : mary that was called magdalene , from whom seven demons had gone out ,
and joanna the wife of chuzas herod ’ s steward , and susanna , and many others , who ministered unto them of their substance .
and when a great multitude came together , and they of every city resorted unto him , he spake by a parable :
and other fell on the rock ; and as soon as it grew , it withered away , because it had no moisture .
and other fell amidst the thorns ; and the thorns grew with it , and choked it .
and his disciples asked him what this parable might be .
now the parable is this : the seed is the word of god .
for nothing is hid , that shall not be made manifest ; nor anything secret , that shall not be known and come to light .
and there came to him his mother and brethren , and they could not come at him for the crowd .
and it was told him , thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to see thee .
but he answered and said unto them , my mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of god , and do it .
and they arrived at the country of the gerasenes , which is over against galilee .
and jesus asked him , what is thy name ? and he said , legion ; for many demons were entered into him .
and they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss .
and the demons came out from the man , and entered into the swine : and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake , and were drowned .
and when they that fed them saw what had come to pass , they fled , and told it in the city and in the country .
and they that saw it told them how he that was possessed with demons was made whole .
but the man from whom the demons were gone out prayed him that he might be with him : but he sent him away , saying ,
and as jesus returned , the multitude welcomed him ; for they were all waiting for him .
for he had an only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she was dying . but as he went the multitudes thronged him .
and a woman having an issue of blood twelve years , who had spent all her living upon physicians , and could not be healed of any ,
came behind him , and touched the border of his garment : and immediately the issue of her blood stanched .
but jesus said , some one did touch me ; for i perceived that power had gone forth from me .
and he said unto her , daughter , thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace .
while he yet spake , there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue ’ s house , saying , thy daughter is dead ; trouble not the teacher .
but jesus hearing it , answered him , fear not : only believe , and she shall be made whole .
and all were weeping , and bewailing her : but he said , weep not ; for she is not dead , but sleepeth .
and they laughed him to scorn , knowing that she was dead .
but he , taking her by the hand , called , saying , maiden , arise .
and her spirit returned , and she rose up immediately : and he commanded that something be given her to eat .
and her parents were amazed : but he charged them to tell no man what had been done .
and he called the twelve together , and gave them power and authority over all demons , and to cure diseases .
and he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of god , and to heal the sick .
and he said unto them , take nothing for your journey , neither staff , nor wallet , nor bread , nor money ; neither have two coats .
and into whatsoever house ye enter , there abide , and thence depart .
and as many as receive you not , when ye depart from that city , shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them .
and they departed , and went throughout the villages , preaching the gospel , and healing everywhere .
and by some , that elijah had appeared ; and by others , that one of the old prophets was risen again .
and herod said , john i beheaded : but who is this , about whom i hear such things ? and he sought to see him .
for they were about five thousand men . and he said unto his disciples , make them sit down in companies , about fifty each .
and they did so , and made them all sit down .
and they ate , and were all filled : and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces , twelve baskets .
and they answering said , john the baptist ; but others say , elijah ; and others , that one of the old prophets is risen again .
and he said unto them , but who say ye that i am ? and peter answering said , the christ of god .
but he charged them , and commanded them to tell this to no man ;
and he said unto all , if any man would come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me .
for whosoever would save his life shall lose it ; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake , the same shall save it .
for what is a man profited , if he gain the whole world , and lose or forfeit his own self ?
and as he was praying , the fashion of his countenance was altered , and his raiment became white and dazzling .
and behold , there talked with him two men , who were moses and elijah ;
who appeared in glory , and spake of his decease which he was about to accomplish at jerusalem .
and while he said these things , there came a cloud , and overshadowed them : and they feared as they entered into the cloud .
and a voice came out of the cloud , saying , this is my son , my chosen : hear ye him .
and it came to pass , on the next day , when they were come down from the mountain , a great multitude met him .
and behold , a man from the multitude cried , saying , teacher , i beseech thee to look upon my son ; for he is mine only child :
and i besought thy disciples to cast it out ; and they could not .
and jesus answered and said , o faithless and perverse generation , how long shall i be with you , and bear with you ? bring hither thy son .
and they were all astonished at the majesty of god .
let these words sink into your ears : for the son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men .
and there arose a reasoning among them , which of them was the greatest .
but when jesus saw the reasoning of their heart , he took a little child , and set him by his side ,
and john answered and said , master , we saw one casting out demons in thy name ; and we forbade him , because he followeth not with us .
but jesus said unto him , forbid him not : for he that is not against you is for you .
and it came to pass , when the days were well-nigh come that he should be received up , he stedfastly set his face to go to jerusalem ,
and sent messengers before his face : and they went , and entered into a village of the samaritans , to make ready for him .
and they did not receive him , because his face was as though he were going to jerusalem .
but he turned , and rebuked them .
and they went to another village .
and as they went on the way , a certain man said unto him , i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
and he said unto another , follow me . but he said , lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father .
but he said unto him , leave the dead to bury their own dead ; but go thou and publish abroad the kingdom of god .
and another also said , i will follow thee , lord ; but first suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house .
but jesus said unto him , no man , having put his hand to the plow , and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of god .
go your ways ; behold , i send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves .
carry no purse , no wallet , no shoes ; and salute no man on the way .
and into whatsoever house ye shall enter , first say , peace be to this house .
and if a son of peace be there , your peace shall rest upon him : but if not , it shall turn to you again .
and into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you , eat such things as are set before you :
and heal the sick that are therein , and say unto them , the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you .
but into whatsoever city ye shall enter , and they receive you not , go out into the streets thereof and say ,
i say unto you , it shall be more tolerable in that day for sodom , than for that city .
but it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon in the judgment , than for you .
and thou , capernaum , shalt thou be exalted unto heaven ? thou shalt be brought down unto hades .
he that heareth you heareth me ; and he that rejecteth you rejecteth me ; and he that rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent me .
and the seventy returned with joy , saying , lord , even the demons are subject unto us in thy name .
and he said unto them , i beheld satan fallen as lightning from heaven .
nevertheless in this rejoice not , that the spirits are subject unto you ; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven .
and turning to the disciples , he said privately , blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see :
and behold , a certain lawyer stood up and made trial of him , saying , teacher , what shall i do to inherit eternal life ?
and he said unto him , what is written in the law ? how readest thou ?
and he said unto him , thou hast answered right : this do , and thou shalt live .
but he , desiring to justify himself , said unto jesus , and who is my neighbor ?
and by chance a certain priest was going down that way : and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
and in like manner a levite also , when he came to the place , and saw him , passed by on the other side .
but a certain samaritan , as he journeyed , came where he was : and when he saw him , he was moved with compassion ,
which of these three , thinkest thou , proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers ?
and he said , he that showed mercy on him . and jesus said unto him , go , and do thou likewise .
now as they went on their way , he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman named martha received him into her house .
and she had a sister called mary , who also sat at the lord ’ s feet , and heard his word .
but the lord answered and said unto her , martha , martha , thou art anxious and troubled about many things :
but one thing is needful : for mary hath chosen the good part , which shall not be taken away from her .
and he said unto them , when ye pray , say , father , hallowed be thy name . thy kingdom come .
give us day by day our daily bread .
and forgive us our sins ; for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us . and bring us not into temptation .
for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey , and i have nothing to set before him ;
for every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
or if he shall ask an egg , will he give him a scorpion ?
but some of them said , by beelzebub the prince of the demons casteth he out demons .
and others , trying him , sought of him a sign from heaven .
but he , knowing their thoughts , said unto them , every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and a house divided against a house falleth .
and if satan also is divided against himself , how shall his kingdom stand ? because ye say that i cast out demons by beelzebub .
and if i by beelzebub cast out demons , by whom do your sons cast them out ? therefore shall they be your judges .
but if i by the finger of god cast out demons , then is the kingdom of god come upon you .
when the strong man fully armed guardeth his own court , his goods are in peace :
he that is not with me is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth .
and when he is come , he findeth it swept and garnished .
but he said , yea rather , blessed are they that hear the word of god , and keep it .
for even as jonah became a sign unto the ninevites , so shall also the son of man be to this generation .
look therefore whether the light that is in thee be not darkness .
now as he spake , a pharisee asketh him to dine with him : and he went in , and sat down to meat .
and when the pharisee saw it , he marvelled that he had not first bathed himself before dinner .
ye foolish ones , did not he that made the outside make the inside also ?
but give for alms those things which are within ; and behold , all things are clean unto you .
woe unto you pharisees ! for ye love the chief seats in the synagogues , and the salutations in the marketplaces .
woe unto you ! for ye are as the tombs which appear not , and the men that walk over them know it not .
and one of the lawyers answering saith unto him , teacher , in saying this thou reproachest us also .
woe unto you ! for ye build the tombs of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
so ye are witnesses and consent unto the works of your fathers : for they killed them , and ye build their tombs .
therefore also said the wisdom of god , i will send unto them prophets and apostles ; and some of them they shall kill and persecute ;
that the blood of all the prophets , which was shed from the foundation of the world , may be required of this generation ;
woe unto you lawyers ! for ye took away the key of knowledge : ye entered not in yourselves , and them that were entering in ye hindered .
laying wait for him , to catch something out of his mouth .
but there is nothing covered up , that shall not be revealed ; and hid , that shall not be known .
and i say unto you my friends , be not afraid of them that kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
are not five sparrows sold for two pence ? and not one of them is forgotten in the sight of god .
but the very hairs of your head are all numbered . fear not : ye are of more value than many sparrows .
and i say unto you , every one who shall confess me before men , him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god :
but he that denieth me in the presence of men shall be denied in the presence of the angels of god .
for the holy spirit shall teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say .
and one out of the multitude said unto him , teacher , bid my brother divide the inheritance with me .
but he said unto him , man , who made me a judge or a divider over you ?
and he spake a parable unto them , saying , the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully :
and he reasoned within himself , saying , what shall i do , because i have not where to bestow my fruits ?
so is he that layeth up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward god .
for the life is more than the food , and the body than the raiment .
and which of you by being anxious can add a cubit unto the measure of his life ?
if then ye are not able to do even that which is least , why are ye anxious concerning the rest ?
and seek not ye what ye shall eat , and what ye shall drink , neither be ye of doubtful mind .
for all these things do the nations of the world seek after : but your father knoweth that ye have need of these things .
yet seek ye his kingdom , and these things shall be added unto you .
fear not , little flock ; for it is your father ’ s good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
for where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
let your loins be girded about , and your lamps burning ;
and if he shall come in the second watch , and if in the third , and find them so , blessed are those servants .
be ye also ready : for in an hour that ye think not the son of man cometh .
and peter said , lord , speakest thou this parable unto us , or even unto all ?
blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
of a truth i say unto you , that he will set him over all that he hath .
i came to cast fire upon the earth ; and what do i desire , if it is already kindled ?
but i have a baptism to be baptized with ; and how am i straitened till it be accomplished !
think ye that i am come to give peace in the earth ? i tell you , nay ; but rather division :
for there shall be from henceforth five in one house divided , three against two , and two against three .
and when ye see a south wind blowing , ye say , there will be a scorching heat ; and it cometh to pass .
and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right ?
i say unto thee , thou shalt by no means come out thence , till thou have paid the very last mite .
now there were some present at that very season who told him of the galilaeans , whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices .
and he answered and said unto them , think ye that these galilaeans were sinners above all the galilaeans , because they have suffered these things ?
i tell you , nay : but , except ye repent , ye shall all in like manner perish .
i tell you , nay : but , except ye repent , ye shall all likewise perish .
and he spake this parable ; a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard ; and he came seeking fruit thereon , and found none .
and he answering saith unto him , lord , let it alone this year also , till i shall dig about it , and dung it :
and if it bear fruit thenceforth , well ; but if not , thou shalt cut it down .
and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day .
and behold , a woman that had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years ; and she was bowed together , and could in no wise lift herself up .
and when jesus saw her , he called her , and said to her , woman , thou art loosed from thine infirmity .
and he laid his hands upon her : and immediately she was made straight , and glorified god .
he said therefore , unto what is the kingdom of god like ? and whereunto shall i liken it ?
and again he said , whereunto shall i liken the kingdom of god ?
it is like unto leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal , till it was all leavened .
and he went on his way through cities and villages , teaching , and journeying on unto jerusalem .
and one said unto him , lord , are they few that are saved ? and he said unto them ,
strive to enter in by the narrow door : for many , i say unto you , shall seek to enter in , and shall not be able .
then shall ye begin to say , we did eat and drink in thy presence , and thou didst teach in our streets ;
and he shall say , i tell you , i know not whence ye are ; depart from me , all ye workers of iniquity .
and they shall come from the east and west , and from the north and south , and shall sit down in the kingdom of god .
and behold , there are last who shall be first , and there are first who shall be last .
in that very hour there came certain pharisees , saying to him , get thee out , and go hence : for herod would fain kill thee .
nevertheless i must go on my way to-day and to-morrow and the day following : for it can not be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem .
and behold , there was before him a certain man that had the dropsy .
and jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and pharisees , saying , is it lawful to heal on the sabbath , or not ?
but they held their peace . and he took him , and healed him , and let him go .
and they could not answer again unto these things .
and he spake a parable unto those that were bidden , when he marked how they chose out the chief seats ; saying unto them ,
for every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
but when thou makest a feast , bid the poor , the maimed , the lame , the blind :
and thou shalt be blessed ; because they have not wherewith to recompense thee : for thou shalt be recompensed in the resurrection of the just .
but he said unto him , a certain man made a great supper ; and he bade many :
and he sent forth his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden , come ; for all things are now ready .
and another said , i have bought five yoke of oxen , and i go to prove them ; i pray thee have me excused .
and another said , i have married a wife , and therefore i can not come .
and the servant said , lord , what thou didst command is done , and yet there is room .
and the lord said unto the servant , go out into the highways and hedges , and constrain them to come in , that my house may be filled .
for i say unto you , that none of those men that were bidden shall taste of my supper .
now there went with him great multitudes : and he turned , and said unto them ,
whosoever doth not bear his own cross , and come after me , can not be my disciple .
for which of you , desiring to build a tower , doth not first sit down and count the cost , whether he have wherewith to complete it ?
lest haply , when he hath laid a foundation , and is not able to finish , all that behold begin to mock him ,
saying , this man began to build , and was not able to finish .
or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sendeth an ambassage , and asketh conditions of peace .
so therefore whosoever he be of you that renounceth not all that he hath , he can not be my disciple .
salt therefore is good : but if even the salt have lost its savor , wherewith shall it be seasoned ?
it is fit neither for the land nor for the dunghill : men cast it out . he that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
now all the publicans and sinners were drawing near unto him to hear him .
and both the pharisees and the scribes murmured , saying , this man receiveth sinners , and eateth with them .
and he spake unto them this parable , saying ,
and when he hath found it , he layeth it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
even so , i say unto you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner that repenteth .
and he said , a certain man had two sons :
and when he had spent all , there arose a mighty famine in that country ; and he began to be in want .
and he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country ; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine .
and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat : and no man gave unto him .
i will arise and go to my father , and will say unto him , father , i have sinned against heaven , and in thy sight :
i am no more worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants .
and bring the fatted calf , and kill it , and let us eat , and make merry :
for this my son was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and is found . and they began to be merry .
now his elder son was in the field : and as he came and drew nigh to the house , he heard music and dancing .
and he called to him one of the servants , and inquired what these things might be .
and he said unto him , thy brother is come ; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf , because he hath received him safe and sound .
but he was angry , and would not go in : and his father came out , and entreated him .
but when this thy son came , who hath devoured thy living with harlots , thou killedst for him the fatted calf .
and he said unto him , son , thou art ever with me , and all that is mine is thine .
i am resolved what to do , that , when i am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses .
and calling to him each one of his lord ’ s debtors , he said to the first , how much owest thou unto my lord ?
and he said , a hundred measures of oil . and he said unto him , take thy bond , and sit down quickly and write fifty .
he that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much : and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much .
if therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will commit to your trust the true riches ?
and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another ’ s , who will give you that which is your own ?
and the pharisees , who were lovers of money , heard all these things ; and they scoffed at him .
the law and the prophets were until john : from that time the gospel of the kingdom of god is preached , and every man entereth violently into it .
but it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away , than for one tittle of the law to fall .
every one that putteth away his wife , and marrieth another , committeth adultery : and he that marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery .
now there was a certain rich man , and he was clothed in purple and fine linen , faring sumptuously every day :
and a certain beggar named lazarus was laid at his gate , full of sores ,
and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man ’ s table ; yea , even the dogs came and licked his sores .
and in hades he lifted up his eyes , being in torments , and seeth abraham afar off , and lazarus in his bosom .
and he said , i pray thee therefore , father , that thou wouldest send him to my father ’ s house ;
for i have five brethren ; that he may testify unto them , lest they also come into this place of torment .
but abraham saith , they have moses and the prophets ; let them hear them .
and he said , nay , father abraham : but if one go to them from the dead , they will repent .
and he said unto him , if they hear not moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded , if one rise from the dead .
and he said unto his disciples , it is impossible but that occasions of stumbling should come ; but woe unto him , through whom they come !
take heed to yourselves : if thy brother sin , rebuke him ; and if he repent , forgive him .
and if he sin against thee seven times in the day , and seven times turn again to thee , saying , i repent ; thou shalt forgive him .
and the apostles said unto the lord , increase our faith .
doth he thank the servant because he did the things that were commanded ?
and it came to pass , as they were on the way to jerusalem , that he was passing along the borders of samaria and galilee .
and as he entered into a certain village , there met him ten men that were lepers , who stood afar off :
and they lifted up their voices , saying , jesus , master , have mercy on us .
and one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , with a loud voice glorifying god ;
and he fell upon his face at his feet , giving him thanks : and he was a samaritan .
and jesus answering said , were not the ten cleansed ? but where are the nine ?
were there none found that returned to give glory to god , save this stranger ?
and he said unto him , arise , and go thy way : thy faith hath made thee whole .
and being asked by the pharisees , when the kingdom of god cometh , he answered them and said , the kingdom of god cometh not with observation :
neither shall they say , lo , here ! or , there ! for lo , the kingdom of god is within you .
and they shall say to you , lo , there ! lo , here ! go not away , nor follow after them :
but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation .
and as it came to pass in the days of noah , even so shall it be also in the days of the son of man .
but in the day that lot went out from sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and destroyed them all :
after the same manner shall it be in the day that the son of man is revealed .
remember lot ’ s wife .
whosoever shall seek to gain his life shall lose it : but whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it .
i say unto you , in that night there shall be two men on one bed ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left .
there shall be two women grinding together ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left .
and he spake a parable unto them to the end that they ought always to pray , and not to faint ;
saying , there was in a city a judge , who feared not god , and regarded not man :
and there was a widow in that city ; and she came oft unto him , saying , avenge me of mine adversary .
and he would not for a while : but afterward he said within himself , though i fear not god , nor regard man ;
yet because this widow troubleth me , i will avenge her , lest she wear me out by her continual coming .
and the lord said , hear what the unrighteous judge saith .
and shall not god avenge his elect , that cry to him day and night , and yet he is longsuffering over them ?
i say unto you , that he will avenge them speedily . nevertheless , when the son of man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ?
and he spake also this parable unto certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and set all others at nought :
two men went up into the temple to pray ; the one a pharisee , and the other a publican .
i fast twice in the week ; i give tithes of all that i get .
and they were bringing unto him also their babes , that he should touch them : but when the disciples saw it , they rebuked them .
verily i say unto you , whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child , he shall in no wise enter therein .
and a certain ruler asked him , saying , good teacher , what shall i do to inherit eternal life ?
and jesus said unto him , why callest thou me good ? none is good , save one , even god .
thou knowest the commandments , do not commit adultery , do not kill , do not steal , do not bear false witness , honor thy father and mother .
and he said , all these things have i observed from my youth up .
but when he heard these things , he became exceeding sorrowful ; for he was very rich .
and jesus seeing him said , how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god !
for it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle ’ s eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god .
and they that heard it said , then who can be saved ?
but he said , the things which are impossible with men are possible with god .
and peter said , lo , we have left our own , and followed thee .
who shall not receive manifold more in this time , and in the world to come eternal life .
for he shall be delivered up unto the gentiles , and shall be mocked , and shamefully treated , and spit upon :
and they shall scourge and kill him : and the third day he shall rise again .
and they understood none of these things ; and this saying was hid from them , and they perceived not the things that were said .
and it came to pass , as he drew nigh unto jericho , a certain blind man sat by the way side begging :
and hearing a multitude going by , he inquired what this meant .
and they told him , that jesus of nazareth passeth by .
and he cried , saying , jesus , thou son of david , have mercy on me .
and jesus stood , and commanded him to be brought unto him : and when he was come near , he asked him ,
what wilt thou that i should do unto thee ? and he said , lord , that i may receive my sight .
and jesus said unto him , receive thy sight : thy faith hath made thee whole .
and immediately he received his sight , and followed him , glorifying god : and all the people , when they saw it , gave praise unto god .
and he entered and was passing through jericho .
and behold , a man called by name zacchaeus ; and he was a chief publican , and he was rich .
and he sought to see jesus who he was ; and could not for the crowd , because he was little of stature .
and he ran on before , and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him : for he was to pass that way .
and he made haste , and came down , and received him joyfully .
and when they saw it , they all murmured , saying , he is gone in to lodge with a man that is a sinner .
and jesus said unto him , to-day is salvation come to this house , forasmuch as he also is a son of abraham .
for the son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost .
he said therefore , a certain nobleman went into a far country , to receive for himself a kingdom , and to return .
and he called ten servants of his , and gave them ten pounds , and said unto them , trade ye herewith till i come .
but his citizens hated him , and sent an ambassage after him , saying , we will not that this man reign over us .
and the first came before him , saying , lord , thy pound hath made ten pounds more .
and he said unto him , well done , thou good servant : because thou wast found faithful in a very little , have thou authority over ten cities .
and the second came , saying , thy pound , lord , hath made five pounds .
and he said unto him also , be thou also over five cities .
and another came , saying , lord , behold , here is thy pound , which i kept laid up in a napkin :
then wherefore gavest thou not my money into the bank , and i at my coming should have required it with interest ?
and he said unto them that stood by , take away from him the pound , and give it unto him that hath the ten pounds .
and they said unto him , lord , he hath ten pounds .
but these mine enemies , that would not that i should reign over them , bring hither , and slay them before me .
and when he had thus spoken , he went on before , going up to jerusalem .
and it came to pass , when he drew nigh unto bethphage and bethany , at the mount that is called olivet , he sent two of the disciples ,
and if any one ask you , why do ye loose him ? thus shall ye say , the lord hath need of him .
and they that were sent went away , and found even as he had said unto them .
and as they were loosing the colt , the owners thereof said unto them , why loose ye the colt ?
and they said , the lord hath need of him .
and they brought him to jesus : and they threw their garments upon the colt , and set jesus thereon .
and as he went , they spread their garments in the way .
saying , blessed is the king that cometh in the name of the lord : peace in heaven , and glory in the highest .
and some of the pharisees from the multitude said unto him , teacher , rebuke thy disciples .
and he answered and said , i tell you that , if these shall hold their peace , the stones will cry out .
and when he drew nigh , he saw the city and wept over it ,
saying , if thou hadst known in this day , even thou , the things which belong unto peace ! but now they are hid from thine eyes .
and he entered into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold ,
saying unto them , it is written , and my house shall be a house of prayer : but ye have made it a den of robbers .
and he was teaching daily in the temple . but the chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him :
and they could not find what they might do ; for the people all hung upon him , listening .
and they spake , saying unto him , tell us : by what authority doest thou these things ? or who is he that gave thee this authority ?
and he answered and said unto them , i also will ask you a question ; and tell me :
the baptism of john , was it from heaven , or from men ?
and they reasoned with themselves , saying , if we shall say , from heaven ; he will say , why did ye not believe him ?
but if we shall say , from men ; all the people will stone us : for they are persuaded that john was a prophet .
and they answered , that they knew not whence it was .
and jesus said unto them , neither tell i you by what authority i do these things .
and he sent yet another servant : and him also they beat , and handled him shamefully , and sent him away empty .
and he sent yet a third : and him also they wounded , and cast him forth .
and the lord of the vineyard said , what shall i do ? i will send my beloved son ; it may be they will reverence him .
and they cast him forth out of the vineyard , and killed him . what therefore will the lord of the vineyard do unto them ?
he will come and destroy these husbandmen , and will give the vineyard unto others . and when they heard it , they said , god forbid .
but he looked upon them , and said , what then is this that is written ,
every one that falleth on that stone shall be broken to pieces ; but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will scatter him as dust .
is it lawful for us to give tribute unto caesar , or not ?
but he perceived their craftiness , and said unto them ,
show me a denarius . whose image and superscription hath it ? and they said , caesar ’ s .
and he said unto them , then render unto caesar the things that are caesar ’ s , and unto god the things that are god ’ s .
and they were not able to take hold of the saying before the people : and they marvelled at his answer , and held their peace .
and there came to him certain of the sadducees , they that say that there is no resurrection ;
there were therefore seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and died childless ;
and the third took her ; and likewise the seven also left no children , and died .
afterward the woman also died .
in the resurrection therefore whose wife of them shall she be ? for the seven had her to wife .
and jesus said unto them , the sons of this world marry , and are given in marriage :
but they that are accounted worthy to attain to that world , and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage :
for neither can they die any more : for they are equal unto the angels ; and are sons of god , being sons of the resurrection .
now he is not the god of the dead , but of the living : for all live unto him .
and certain of the scribes answering said , teacher , thou hast well said .
for they durst not any more ask him any question .
and he said unto them , how say they that the christ is david ’ s son ?
for david himself saith in the book of psalms ,
till i make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet .
david therefore calleth him lord , and how is he his son ?
and in the hearing of all the people he said unto his disciples ,
who devour widows ’ houses , and for a pretence make long prayers : these shall receive greater condemnation .
and he looked up , and saw the rich men that were casting their gifts into the treasury .
and he saw a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites .
and he said , of a truth i say unto you , this poor widow cast in more than they all :
for all these did of their superfluity cast in unto the gifts ; but she of her want did cast in all the living that she had .
and as some spake of the temple , how it was adorned with goodly stones and offerings , he said ,
then said he unto them , nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ;
and there shall be great earthquakes , and in divers places famines and pestilences ; and there shall be terrors and great signs from heaven .
it shall turn out unto you for a testimony .
settle it therefore in your hearts , not to meditate beforehand how to answer :
for i will give you a mouth and wisdom , which all your adversaries shall not be able to withstand or to gainsay .
and ye shall be hated of all men for my name ’ s sake .
and not a hair of your head shall perish .
in your patience ye shall win your souls .
but when ye see jerusalem compassed with armies , then know that her desolation is at hand .
for these are days of vengeance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled .
men fainting for fear , and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world : for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken .
and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
but when these things begin to come to pass , look up , and lift up your heads ; because your redemption draweth nigh .
and he spake to them a parable : behold the fig tree , and all the trees :
when they now shoot forth , ye see it and know of your own selves that the summer is now nigh .
even so ye also , when ye see these things coming to pass , know ye that the kingdom of god is nigh .
verily i say unto you , this generation shall not pass away , till all things be accomplished .
heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away .
for so shall it come upon all them that dwell on the face of all the earth .
and every day he was teaching in the temple ; and every night he went out , and lodged in the mount that is called olivet .
and all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple , to hear him .
now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh , which is called the passover .
and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death ; for they feared the people .
and satan entered into judas who was called iscariot , being of the number of the twelve .
and he went away , and communed with the chief priests and captains , how he might deliver him unto them .
and they were glad , and covenanted to give him money .
and he consented , and sought opportunity to deliver him unto them in the absence of the multitude .
and the day of unleavened bread came , on which the passover must be sacrificed .
and he sent peter and john , saying , go and make ready for us the passover , that we may eat .
and they said unto him , where wilt thou that we make ready ?
and he will show you a large upper room furnished : there make ready .
and they went , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
and when the hour was come , he sat down , and the apostles with him .
and he said unto them , with desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer :
for i say unto you , i shall not eat it , until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of god .
and he received a cup , and when he had given thanks , he said , take this , and divide it among yourselves :
for i say unto you , i shall not drink from henceforth of the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of god shall come .
and the cup in like manner after supper , saying , this cup is the new covenant in my blood , even that which is poured out for you .
but behold , the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table .
for the son of man indeed goeth , as it hath been determined : but woe unto that man through whom he is betrayed !
and they began to question among themselves , which of them it was that should do this thing .
and there arose also a contention among them , which of them was accounted to be greatest .
and he said unto them , the kings of the gentiles have lordship over them ; and they that have authority over them are called benefactors .
but ye are they that have continued with me in my temptations ;
and i appoint unto you a kingdom , even as my father appointed unto me ,
that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom ; and ye shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel .
simon , simon , behold , satan asked to have you , that he might sift you as wheat :
but i made supplication for thee , that thy faith fail not ; and do thou , when once thou hast turned again , establish thy brethren .
and he said unto him , lord , with thee i am ready to go both to prison and to death .
and he said , i tell thee , peter , the cock shall not crow this day , until thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me .
and he said unto them , when i sent you forth without purse , and wallet , and shoes , lacked ye anything ? and they said , nothing .
and they said , lord , behold , here are two swords . and he said unto them , it is enough .
and he came out , and went , as his custom was , unto the mount of olives ; and the disciples also followed him .
and when he was at the place , he said unto them , pray that ye enter not into temptation .
and he was parted from them about a stone ’ s cast ; and he kneeled down and prayed ,
saying , father , if thou be willing , remove this cup from me : nevertheless not my will , but thine , be done .
and there appeared unto him an angel from heaven , strengthening him .
and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly ; and his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground .
and when he rose up from his prayer , he came unto the disciples , and found them sleeping for sorrow ,
and said unto them , why sleep ye ? rise and pray , that ye enter not into temptation .
but jesus said unto him , judas , betrayest thou the son of man with a kiss ?
and when they that were about him saw what would follow , they said , lord , shall we smite with the sword ?
and a certain one of them smote the servant of the high priest , and struck off his right ear .
but jesus answered and said , suffer ye them thus far . and he touched his ear , and healed him .
and they seized him , and led him away , and brought him into the high priest ’ s house . but peter followed afar off .
and when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court , and had sat down together , peter sat in the midst of them .
but he denied , saying , woman , i know him not .
and after a little while another saw him , and said , thou also art one of them . but peter said , man , i am not .
and after the space of about one hour another confidently affirmed , saying , of a truth this man also was with him ; for he is a galilaean .
but peter said , man , i know not what thou sayest . and immediately , while he yet spake , the cock crew .
and he went out , and wept bitterly .
and the men that held jesus mocked him , and beat him .
and they blindfolded him , and asked him , saying , prophesy : who is he that struck thee ?
and many other things spake they against him , reviling him .
if thou art the christ , tell us . but he said unto them , if i tell you , ye will not believe :
and if i ask you , ye will not answer .
but from henceforth shall the son of man be seated at the right hand of the power of god .
and they all said , art thou then the son of god ? and he said unto them , ye say that i am .
and they said , what further need have we of witness ? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth .
and the whole company of them rose up , and brought him before pilate .
and pilate asked him , saying , art thou the king of the jews ? and he answered him and said , thou sayest .
and pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes , i find no fault in this man .
but they were the more urgent , saying , he stirreth up the people , teaching throughout all judaea , and beginning from galilee even unto this place .
but when pilate heard it , he asked whether the man were a galilaean .
and when he knew that he was of herod ’ s jurisdiction , he sent him unto herod , who himself also was at jerusalem in these days .
and he questioned him in many words ; but he answered him nothing .
and the chief priests and the scribes stood , vehemently accusing him .
and herod with his soldiers set him at nought , and mocked him , and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to pilate .
and herod and pilate became friends with each other that very day : for before they were at enmity between themselves .
and pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people ,
no , nor yet herod : for he sent him back unto us ; and behold , nothing worthy of death hath been done by him .
i will therefore chastise him , and release him .
but they cried out all together , saying , away with this man , and release unto us barabbas : —
one who for a certain insurrection made in the city , and for murder , was cast into prison .
and pilate spake unto them again , desiring to release jesus ;
but they shouted , saying , crucify , crucify him .
but they were urgent with loud voices , asking that he might be crucified . and their voices prevailed .
and pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done .
and he released him that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison , whom they asked for ; but jesus he delivered up to their will .
and there followed him a great multitude of the people , and of women who bewailed and lamented him .
but jesus turning unto them said , daughters of jerusalem , weep not for me , but weep for yourselves , and for your children .
then shall they begin to say to the mountains , fall on us ; and to the hills , cover us .
for if they do these things in the green tree , what shall be done in the dry ?
and there were also two others , malefactors , led with him to be put to death .
and jesus said , father , forgive them ; for they know not what they do . and parting his garments among them , they cast lots .
and the soldiers also mocked him , coming to him , offering him vinegar ,
and saying , if thou art the king of the jews , save thyself .
and there was also a superscription over him , this is the king of the jews .
and one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him , saying , art not thou the christ ? save thyself and us .
but the other answered , and rebuking him said , dost thou not even fear god , seeing thou art in the same condemnation ?
and we indeed justly ; for we receive the due reward of our deeds : but this man hath done nothing amiss .
and he said , jesus , remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom .
and he said unto him , verily i say unto thee , to-day shalt thou be with me in paradise .
and it was now about the sixth hour , and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour ,
the sun ’ s light failing : and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst .
and when the centurion saw what was done , he glorified god , saying , certainly this was a righteous man .
and all the multitudes that came together to this sight , when they beheld the things that were done , returned smiting their breasts .
and all his acquaintance , and the women that followed with him from galilee , stood afar off , seeing these things .
and behold , a man named joseph , who was a councillor , a good and righteous man
this man went to pilate , and asked for the body of jesus .
and it was the day of the preparation , and the sabbath drew on .
and the women , who had come with him out of galilee , followed after , and beheld the tomb , and how his body was laid .
and they returned , and prepared spices and ointments .
but on the first day of the week , at early dawn , they came unto the tomb , bringing the spices which they had prepared .
and they found the stone rolled away from the tomb .
and they entered in , and found not the body of the lord jesus .
and it came to pass , while they were perplexed thereabout , behold , two men stood by them in dazzling apparel :
and as they were affrighted and bowed down their faces to the earth , they said unto them , why seek ye the living among the dead ?
he is not here , but is risen : remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in galilee ,
saying that the son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again .
and they remembered his words ,
and returned from the tomb , and told all these things to the eleven , and to all the rest .
now they were mary magdalene , and joanna , and mary the mother of james : and the other women with them told these things unto the apostles .
and these words appeared in their sight as idle talk ; and they disbelieved them .
and behold , two of them were going that very day to a village named emmaus , which was threescore furlongs from jerusalem .
and they communed with each other of all these things which had happened .
and it came to pass , while they communed and questioned together , that jesus himself drew near , and went with them .
but their eyes were holden that they should not know him .
and he said unto them , what communications are these that ye have one with another , as ye walk ? and they stood still , looking sad .
and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death , and crucified him .
moreover certain women of our company amazed us , having been early at the tomb ;
and when they found not his body , they came , saying , that they had also seen a vision of angels , who said that he was alive .
and certain of them that were with us went to the tomb , and found it even so as the women had said : but him they saw not .
and he said unto them , o foolish men , and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken !
behooved it not the christ to suffer these things , and to enter into his glory ?
and beginning from moses and from all the prophets , he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself .
and they drew nigh unto the village , whither they were going : and he made as though he would go further .
and their eyes were opened , and they knew him ; and he vanished out of their sight .
and they rose up that very hour , and returned to jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and them that were with them ,
saying , the lord is risen indeed , and hath appeared to simon .
and they rehearsed the things that happened in the way , and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread .
and as they spake these things , he himself stood in the midst of them , and saith unto them , peace be unto you .
but they were terrified and affrighted , and supposed that they beheld a spirit .
and he said unto them , why are ye troubled ? and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart ?
and when he had said this , he showed them his hands and his feet .
and while they still disbelieved for joy , and wondered , he said unto them , have ye here anything to eat ?
and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish .
and he took it , and ate before them .
then opened he their mind , that they might understand the scriptures ;
and he said unto them , thus it is written , that the christ should suffer , and rise again from the dead the third day ;
and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations , beginning from jerusalem .
ye are witnesses of these things .
and he led them out until they were over against bethany : and he lifted up his hands , and blessed them .
and it came to pass , while he blessed them , he parted from them , and was carried up into heaven .
and they worshipped him , and returned to jerusalem with great joy :
and were continually in the temple , blessing god .
the burden of the word of jehovah to israel by malachi .
but esau i hated , and made his mountains a desolation , and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness .
and your eyes shall see , and ye shall say , jehovah be magnified beyond the border of israel .
ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar . and ye say , wherein have we polluted thee ? in that ye say , the table of jehovah is contemptible .
but ye profane it , in that ye say , the table of jehovah is polluted , and the fruit thereof , even its food , is contemptible .
and now , o ye priests , this commandment is for you .
and ye shall know that i have sent this commandment unto you , that my covenant may be with levi , saith jehovah of hosts .
for the priest ’ s lips should keep knowledge , and they should seek the law at his mouth ; for he is the messenger of jehovah of hosts .
then shall the offering of judah and jerusalem be pleasant unto jehovah , as in the days of old , and as in ancient years .
for i , jehovah , change not ; therefore ye , o sons of jacob , are not consumed .
will a man rob god ? yet ye rob me . but ye say , wherein have we robbed thee ? in tithes and offerings .
ye are cursed with the curse ; for ye rob me , even this whole nation .
and all nations shall call you happy ; for ye shall be a delightsome land , saith jehovah of hosts .
your words have been stout against me , saith jehovah . yet ye say , what have we spoken against thee ?
and now we call the proud happy ; yea , they that work wickedness are built up ; yea , they tempt god , and escape .
then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked , between him that serveth god and him that serveth him not .
remember ye the law of moses my servant , which i commanded unto him in horeb for all israel , even statutes and ordinances .
behold , i will send you elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of jehovah come .
the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ , the son of god .
even as it is written in isaiah the prophet ,
the voice of one crying in the wilderness ,
john came , who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins .
and john was clothed with camel ’ s hair , and had a leathern girdle about his loins , and did eat locusts and wild honey .
i baptized you in water ; but he shall baptize you in the holy spirit .
and it came to pass in those days , that jesus came from nazareth of galilee , and was baptized of john in the jordan .
and straightway coming up out of the water , he saw the heavens rent asunder , and the spirit as a dove descending upon him :
and a voice came out of the heavens , thou art my beloved son , in thee i am well pleased .
and straightway the spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness .
and he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of satan ; and he was with the wild beasts ; and the angels ministered unto him .
now after john was delivered up , jesus came into galilee , preaching the gospel of god ,
and saying , the time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of god is at hand : repent ye , and believe in the gospel .
and passing along by the sea of galilee , he saw simon and andrew the brother of simon casting a net in the sea ; for they were fishers .
and jesus said unto them , come ye after me , and i will make you to become fishers of men .
and straightway they left the nets , and followed him .
and going on a little further , he saw james the son of zebedee , and john his brother , who also were in the boat mending the nets .
and straightway he called them : and they left their father zebedee in the boat with the hired servants , and went after him .
and they go into capernaum ; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught .
and they were astonished at his teaching : for he taught them as having authority , and not as the scribes .
and straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out ,
and jesus rebuked him , saying , hold thy peace , and come out of him .
and the unclean spirit , tearing him and crying with a loud voice , came out of him .
and the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of galilee round about .
and straightway , when they were come out of the synagogue , they came into the house of simon and andrew , with james and john .
now simon ’ s wife ’ s mother lay sick of a fever ; and straightway they tell him of her :
and he came and took her by the hand , and raised her up ; and the fever left her , and she ministered unto them .
and at even , when the sun did set , they brought unto him all that were sick , and them that were possessed with demons .
and all the city was gathered together at the door .
and in the morning , a great while before day , he rose up and went out , and departed into a desert place , and there prayed .
and simon and they that were with him followed after him ;
and they found him , and say unto him , all are seeking thee .
and he saith unto them , let us go elsewhere into the next towns , that i may preach there also ; for to this end came i forth .
and he went into their synagogues throughout all galilee , preaching and casting out demons .
and being moved with compassion , he stretched forth his hand , and touched him , and saith unto him , i will ; be thou made clean .
and straightway the leprosy departed from him , and he was made clean .
and he strictly charged him , and straightway sent him out ,
and when he entered again into capernaum after some days , it was noised that he was in the house .
and they come , bringing unto him a man sick of the palsy , borne of four .
and jesus seeing their faith saith unto the sick of the palsy , son , thy sins are forgiven .
but there were certain of the scribes sitting there , and reasoning in their hearts ,
why doth this man thus speak ? he blasphemeth : who can forgive sins but one , even god ?
and straightway jesus , perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves , saith unto them , why reason ye these things in your hearts ?
but that ye may know that the son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins ( he saith to the sick of the palsy ) ,
i say unto thee , arise , take up thy bed , and go unto thy house .
and he went forth again by the sea side ; and all the multitude resorted unto him , and he taught them .
but the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then will they fast in that day .
and the pharisees said unto him , behold , why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful ?
and he said unto them , the sabbath was made for man , and not man for the sabbath :
so that the son of man is lord even of the sabbath .
and he entered again into the synagogue ; and there was a man there who had his hand withered .
and they watched him , whether he would heal him on the sabbath day ; that they might accuse him .
and he saith unto the man that had his hand withered , stand forth .
and the pharisees went out , and straightway with the herodians took counsel against him , how they might destroy him .
and jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea : and a great multitude from galilee followed ; and from judaea ,
and he spake to his disciples , that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd , lest they should throng him :
for he had healed many ; insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed upon him that they might touch him .
and the unclean spirits , whensoever they beheld him , fell down before him , and cried , saying , thou art the son of god .
and he charged them much that they should not make him known .
and he goeth up into the mountain , and calleth unto him whom he himself would ; and they went unto him .
and he appointed twelve , that they might be with him , and that he might send them forth to preach ,
and to have authority to cast out demons :
and simon he surnamed peter ;
and james the son of zebedee , and john the brother of james ; and them he surnamed boanerges , which is , sons of thunder :
and andrew , and philip , and bartholomew , and matthew , and thomas , and james the son of alphaeus , and thaddaeus , and simon the cananaean ,
and judas iscariot , who also betrayed him .
and the multitude cometh together again , so that they could not so much as eat bread .
and when his friends heard it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , he is beside himself .
and the scribes that came down from jerusalem said , he hath beelzebub , and , by the prince of the demons casteth he out the demons .
and he called them unto him , and said unto them in parables , how can satan cast out satan ?
and if a kingdom be divided against itself , that kingdom can not stand .
and if a house be divided against itself , that house will not be able to stand .
and if satan hath risen up against himself , and is divided , he can not stand , but hath an end .
verily i say unto you , all their sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men , and their blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme :
but whosoever shall blaspheme against the holy spirit hath never forgiveness , but is guilty of an eternal sin :
because they said , he hath an unclean spirit .
and there come his mother and his brethren ; and , standing without , they sent unto him , calling him .
and a multitude was sitting about him ; and they say unto him , behold , thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee .
and he answereth them , and saith , who is my mother and my brethren ?
and looking round on them that sat round about him , he saith , behold , my mother and my brethren !
for whosoever shall do the will of god , the same is my brother , and sister , and mother .
and he taught them many things in parables , and said unto them in his teaching ,
hearken : behold , the sower went forth to sow :
and it came to pass , as he sowed , some seed fell by the way side , and the birds came and devoured it .
and other fell on the rocky ground , where it had not much earth ; and straightway it sprang up , because it had no deepness of earth :
and when the sun was risen , it was scorched ; and because it had no root , it withered away .
and other fell among the thorns , and the thorns grew up , and choked it , and it yielded no fruit .
and others fell into the good ground , and yielded fruit , growing up and increasing ; and brought forth , thirtyfold , and sixtyfold , and a hundredfold .
and he said , who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
and when he was alone , they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables .
and he saith unto them , know ye not this parable ? and how shall ye know all the parables ?
the sower soweth the word .
and these in like manner are they that are sown upon the rocky places , who , when they have heard the word , straightway receive it with joy ;
and they have no root in themselves , but endure for a while ; then , when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word , straightway they stumble .
and others are they that are sown among the thorns ; these are they that have heard the word ,
for there is nothing hid , save that it should be manifested ; neither was anything made secret , but that it should come to light .
if any man hath ears to hear , let him hear .
for he that hath , to him shall be given : and he that hath not , from him shall be taken away even that which he hath .
and he said , so is the kingdom of god , as if a man should cast seed upon the earth ;
and should sleep and rise night and day , and the seed should spring up and grow , he knoweth not how .
the earth beareth fruit of herself ; first the blade , then the ear , then the full grain in the ear .
but when the fruit is ripe , straightway he putteth forth the sickle , because the harvest is come .
and he said , how shall we liken the kingdom of god ? or in what parable shall we set it forth ?
and with many such parables spake he the word unto them , as they were able to hear it ;
and without a parable spake he not unto them : but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things .
and on that day , when even was come , he saith unto them , let us go over unto the other side .
and leaving the multitude , they take him with them , even as he was , in the boat . and other boats were with him .
and there ariseth a great storm of wind , and the waves beat into the boat , insomuch that the boat was now filling .
and he said unto them , why are ye fearful ? have ye not yet faith ?
and they feared exceedingly , and said one to another , who then is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ?
and they came to the other side of the sea , into the country of the gerasenes .
and when he was come out of the boat , straightway there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit ,
who had his dwelling in the tombs : and no man could any more bind him , no , not with a chain ;
and always , night and day , in the tombs and in the mountains , he was crying out , and cutting himself with stones .
and when he saw jesus from afar , he ran and worshipped him ;
for he said unto him , come forth , thou unclean spirit , out of the man .
and he asked him , what is thy name ? and he saith unto him , my name is legion ; for we are many .
and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country .
now there was there on the mountain side a great herd of swine feeding .
and they besought him , saying , send us into the swine , that we may enter into them .
and they that saw it declared unto them how it befell him that was possessed with demons , and concerning the swine .
and they began to beseech him to depart from their borders .
and as he was entering into the boat , he that had been possessed with demons besought him that he might be with him .
and he went his way , and began to publish in decapolis how great things jesus had done for him : and all men marvelled .
and when jesus had crossed over again in the boat unto the other side , a great multitude was gathered unto him ; and he was by the sea .
and there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue , jairus by name ; and seeing him , he falleth at his feet ,
and he went with him ; and a great multitude followed him , and they thronged him .
and a woman , who had an issue of blood twelve years ,
and had suffered many things of many physicians , and had spent all that she had , and was nothing bettered , but rather grew worse ,
having heard the things concerning jesus , came in the crowd behind , and touched his garment .
for she said , if i touch but his garments , i shall be made whole .
and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up ; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague .
and his disciples said unto him , thou seest the multitude thronging thee , and sayest thou , who touched me ?
and he looked round about to see her that had done this thing .
but the woman fearing and trembling , knowing what had been done to her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth .
and he said unto her , daughter , thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace , and be whole of thy plague .
but jesus , not heeding the word spoken , saith unto the ruler of the synagogue , fear not , only believe .
and he suffered no man to follow with him , save peter , and james , and john the brother of james .
and they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue ; and he beholdeth a tumult , and many weeping and wailing greatly .
and when he was entered in , he saith unto them , why make ye a tumult , and weep ? the child is not dead , but sleepeth .
and straightway the damsel rose up , and walked ; for she was twelve years old . and they were amazed straightway with a great amazement .
and he charged them much that no man should know this : and he commanded that something should be given her to eat .
and he went out from thence ; and he cometh into his own country ; and his disciples follow him .
and he could there do no mighty work , save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk , and healed them .
and he marvelled because of their unbelief .
and he calleth unto him the twelve , and began to send them forth by two and two ; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits ;
and he charged them that they should take nothing for their journey , save a staff only ; no bread , no wallet , no money in their purse ;
but to go shod with sandals : and , said he , put not on two coats .
and he said unto them , wheresoever ye enter into a house , there abide till ye depart thence .
and they went out , and preached that men should repent .
and they cast out many demons , and anointed with oil many that were sick , and healed them .
but others said , it is elijah . and others said , it is a prophet , even as one of the prophets .
but herod , when he heard thereof , said , john , whom i beheaded , he is risen .
for john said unto herod , it is not lawful for thee to have thy brother ’ s wife .
and herodias set herself against him , and desired to kill him ; and she could not ;
and he sware unto her , whatsoever thou shalt ask of me , i will give it thee , unto the half of my kingdom .
and she went out , and said unto her mother , what shall i ask ? and she said , the head of john the baptizer .
and the king was exceeding sorry ; but for the sake of his oaths , and of them that sat at meat , he would not reject her .
and straightway the king sent forth a soldier of his guard , and commanded to bring his head : and he went and beheaded him in the prison ,
and brought his head on a platter , and gave it to the damsel ; and the damsel gave it to her mother .
and when his disciples heard thereof , they came and took up his corpse , and laid it in a tomb .
and the apostles gather themselves together unto jesus ; and they told him all things , whatsoever they had done , and whatsoever they had taught .
and they went away in the boat to a desert place apart .
and the people saw them going , and many knew them , and they ran together there on foot from all the cities , and outwent them .
send them away , that they may go into the country and villages round about , and buy themselves somewhat to eat .
and he saith unto them , how many loaves have ye ? go and see . and when they knew , they say , five , and two fishes .
and he commanded them that all should sit down by companies upon the green grass .
and they sat down in ranks , by hundreds , and by fifties .
and they all ate , and were filled .
and they took up broken pieces , twelve basketfuls , and also of the fishes .
and they that ate the loaves were five thousand men .
and after he had taken leave of them , he departed into the mountain to pray .
and when even was come , the boat was in the midst of the sea , and he alone on the land .
but they , when they saw him walking on the sea , supposed that it was a ghost , and cried out ;
and he went up unto them into the boat ; and the wind ceased : and they were sore amazed in themselves ;
for they understood not concerning the loaves , but their heart was hardened .
and when they had crossed over , they came to the land unto gennesaret , and moored to the shore .
and when they were come out of the boat , straightway the people knew him ,
and ran round about that whole region , and began to carry about on their beds those that were sick , where they heard he was .
and there are gathered together unto him the pharisees , and certain of the scribes , who had come from jerusalem ,
and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with defiled , that is , unwashen , hands .
( for the pharisees , and all the jews , except they wash their hands diligently , eat not , holding the tradition of the elders ;
and the pharisees and the scribes ask him , why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders , but eat their bread with defiled hands ?
and he said unto them , well did isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites , as it is written ,
but in vain do they worship me ,
ye leave the commandment of god , and hold fast the tradition of men .
and he said unto them , full well do ye reject the commandment of god , that ye may keep your tradition .
for moses said , honor thy father and thy mother ; and , he that speaketh evil of father or mother , let him die the death :
ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father or his mother ;
making void the word of god by your tradition , which ye have delivered : and many such like things ye do .
and he called to him the multitude again , and said unto them , hear me all of you , and understand :
and when he was entered into the house from the multitude , his disciples asked of him the parable .
because it goeth not into his heart , but into his belly , and goeth out into the draught ? this he said , making all meats clean .
and he said , that which proceedeth out of the man , that defileth the man .
for from within , out of the heart of men , evil thoughts proceed , fornications , thefts , murders , adulteries ,
covetings , wickednesses , deceit , lasciviousness , an evil eye , railing , pride , foolishness :
all these evil things proceed from within , and defile the man .
but straightway a woman , whose little daughter had an unclean spirit , having heard of him , came and fell down at his feet .
now the woman was a greek , a syrophoenician by race . and she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter .
but she answered and saith unto him , yea , lord ; even the dogs under the table eat of the children ’ s crumbs .
and he said unto her , for this saying go thy way ; the demon is gone out of thy daughter .
and she went away unto her house , and found the child laid upon the bed , and the demon gone out .
and again he went out from the borders of tyre , and came through sidon unto the sea of galilee , through the midst of the borders of decapolis .
and they bring unto him one that was deaf , and had an impediment in his speech ; and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him .
and he took him aside from the multitude privately , and put his fingers into his ears , and he spat , and touched his tongue ;
and looking up to heaven , he sighed , and saith unto him , ephphatha , that is , be opened .
and his ears were opened , and the bond of his tongue was loosed , and he spake plain .
and he charged them that they should tell no man : but the more he charged them , so much the more a great deal they published it .
and they were beyond measure astonished , saying , he hath done all things well ; he maketh even the deaf to hear , and the dumb to speak .
i have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days , and have nothing to eat :
and if i send them away fasting to their home , they will faint on the way ; and some of them are come from far .
and his disciples answered him , whence shall one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place ?
and he asked them , how many loaves have ye ? and they said , seven .
and they had a few small fishes : and having blessed them , he commanded to set these also before them .
and they ate , and were filled : and they took up , of broken pieces that remained over , seven baskets .
and they were about four thousand : and he sent them away .
and straightway he entered into the boat with his disciples , and came into the parts of dalmanutha .
and the pharisees came forth , and began to question with him , seeking of him a sign from heaven , trying him .
and he left them , and again entering into the boat departed to the other side .
and they forgot to take bread ; and they had not in the boat with them more than one loaf .
and he charged them , saying , take heed , beware of the leaven of the pharisees and the leaven of herod .
and they reasoned one with another , saying , we have no bread .
having eyes , see ye not ? and having ears , hear ye not ? and do ye not remember ?
when i brake the five loaves among the five thousand , how many baskets full of broken pieces took ye up ? they say unto him , twelve .
and when the seven among the four thousand , how many basketfuls of broken pieces took ye up ? and they say unto him , seven .
and he said unto them , do ye not yet understand ?
and they come unto bethsaida . and they bring to him a blind man , and beseech him to touch him .
and he looked up , and said , i see men ; for i behold them as trees , walking .
then again he laid his hands upon his eyes ; and he looked stedfastly , and was restored , and saw all things clearly .
and he sent him away to his home , saying , do not even enter into the village .
and they told him , saying , john the baptist ; and others , elijah ; but others , one of the prophets .
and he asked them , but who say ye that i am ? peter answereth and saith unto him , thou art the christ .
and he charged them that they should tell no man of him .
and he spake the saying openly . and peter took him , and began to rebuke him .
for whosoever would save his life shall lose it ; and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel ’ s shall save it .
for what doth it profit a man , to gain the whole world , and forfeit his life ?
for what should a man give in exchange for his life ?
and his garments became glistering , exceeding white , so as no fuller on earth can whiten them .
and there appeared unto them elijah with moses : and they were talking with jesus .
for he knew not what to answer ; for they became sore afraid .
and there came a cloud overshadowing them : and there came a voice out of the cloud , this is my beloved son : hear ye him .
and suddenly looking round about , they saw no one any more , save jesus only with themselves .
and they kept the saying , questioning among themselves what the rising again from the dead should mean .
and they asked him , saying , how is it that the scribes say that elijah must first come ?
but i say unto you , that elijah is come , and they have also done unto him whatsoever they would , even as it is written of him .
and when they came to the disciples , they saw a great multitude about them , and scribes questioning with them .
and straightway all the multitude , when they saw him , were greatly amazed , and running to him saluted him .
and he asked them , what question ye with them ?
and one of the multitude answered him , teacher , i brought unto thee my son , who hath a dumb spirit ;
and he asked his father , how long time is it since this hath come unto him ? and he said , from a child .
and jesus said unto him , if thou canst ! all things are possible to him that believeth .
straightway the father of the child cried out , and said , i believe ; help thou mine unbelief .
but jesus took him by the hand , and raised him up ; and he arose .
and when he was come into the house , his disciples asked him privately , how is it that we could not cast it out ?
and he said unto them , this kind can come out by nothing , save by prayer .
and they went forth from thence , and passed through galilee ; and he would not that any man should know it .
but they understood not the saying , and were afraid to ask him .
and they came to capernaum : and when he was in the house he asked them , what were ye reasoning on the way ?
but they held their peace : for they had disputed one with another on the way , who was the greatest .
and he took a little child , and set him in the midst of them : and taking him in his arms , he said unto them ,
whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name , receiveth me : and whosoever receiveth me , receiveth not me , but him that sent me .
john said unto him , teacher , we saw one casting out demons in thy name ; and we forbade him , because he followed not us .
for he that is not against us is for us .
where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
for every one shall be salted with fire .
and there came unto him pharisees , and asked him , is it lawful for a man to put away his wife ? trying him .
and he answered and said unto them , what did moses command you ?
and they said , moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement , and to put her away .
but jesus said unto them , for your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment .
but from the beginning of the creation , male and female made he them .
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife ;
and the two shall become one flesh : so that they are no more two , but one flesh .
what therefore god hath joined together , let not man put asunder .
and in the house the disciples asked him again of this matter .
and he saith unto them , whosoever shall put away his wife , and marry another , committeth adultery against her :
and if she herself shall put away her husband , and marry another , she committeth adultery .
and they were bringing unto him little children , that he should touch them : and the disciples rebuked them .
verily i say unto you , whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child , he shall in no wise enter therein .
and he took them in his arms , and blessed them , laying his hands upon them .
and jesus said unto him , why callest thou me good ? none is good save one , even god .
and he said unto him , teacher , all these things have i observed from my youth .
but his countenance fell at the saying , and he went away sorrowful : for he was one that had great possessions .
and jesus looked round about , and saith unto his disciples , how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god !
it is easier for a camel to go through a needle ’ s eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god .
and they were astonished exceedingly , saying unto him , then who can be saved ?
jesus looking upon them saith , with men it is impossible , but not with god : for all things are possible with god .
peter began to say unto him , lo , we have left all , and have followed thee .
but many that are first shall be last ; and the last first .
and he said unto them , what would ye that i should do for you ?
but to sit on my right hand or on my left hand is not mine to give ; but it is for them for whom it hath been prepared .
and when the ten heard it , they began to be moved with indignation concerning james and john .
but it is not so among you : but whosoever would become great among you , shall be your minister ;
and whosoever would be first among you , shall be servant of all .
for the son of man also came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
and he , casting away his garment , sprang up , and came to jesus .
