and when they draw nigh unto jerusalem , unto bethphage and bethany , at the mount of olives , he sendeth two of his disciples ,
and they went away , and found a colt tied at the door without in the open street ; and they loose him .
and certain of them that stood there said unto them , what do ye , loosing the colt ?
and they said unto them even as jesus had said : and they let them go .
and they bring the colt unto jesus , and cast on him their garments ; and he sat upon him .
and many spread their garments upon the way ; and others branches , which they had cut from the fields .
and they that went before , and they that followed , cried , hosanna ; blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord :
blessed is the kingdom that cometh , the kingdom of our father david : hosanna in the highest .
and on the morrow , when they were come out from bethany , he hungered .
and he answered and said unto it , no man eat fruit from thee henceforward for ever . and his disciples heard it .
and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple .
and every evening he went forth out of the city .
and as they passed by in the morning , they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots .
and peter calling to remembrance saith unto him , rabbi , behold , the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away .
and jesus answering saith unto them , have faith in god .
therefore i say unto you , all things whatsoever ye pray and ask for , believe that ye receive them , and ye shall have them .
and whensoever ye stand praying , forgive , if ye have aught against any one ; that your father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses .
and they said unto him , by what authority doest thou these things ? or who gave thee this authority to do these things ?
the baptism of john , was it from heaven , or from men ? answer me .
and they reasoned with themselves , saying , if we shall say , from heaven ; he will say , why then did ye not believe him ?
but should we say , from men—they feared the people : for all verily held john to be a prophet .
and they answered jesus and say , we know not . and jesus saith unto them , neither tell i you by what authority i do these things .
and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant , that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard .
and they took him , and beat him , and sent him away empty .
and again he sent unto them another servant ; and him they wounded in the head , and handled shamefully .
and he sent another ; and him they killed : and many others ; beating some , and killing some .
he had yet one , a beloved son : he sent him last unto them , saying , they will reverence my son .
but those husbandmen said among themselves , this is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and the inheritance shall be ours .
and they took him , and killed him , and cast him forth out of the vineyard .
what therefore will the lord of the vineyard do ? he will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will give the vineyard unto others .
have ye not read even this scripture :
this was from the lord ,
and they send unto him certain of the pharisees and of the herodians , that they might catch him in talk .
and they brought it . and he saith unto them , whose is this image and superscription ? and they said unto him , caesar ’ s .
and there come unto him sadducees , who say that there is no resurrection ; and they asked him , saying ,
there were seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and dying left no seed ;
and the second took her , and died , leaving no seed behind him ; and the third likewise :
and the seven left no seed . last of all the woman also died .
in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of them ? for the seven had her to wife .
jesus said unto them , is it not for this cause that ye err , that ye know not the scriptures , nor the power of god ?
for when they shall rise from the dead , they neither marry , nor are given in marriage ; but are as angels in heaven .
he is not the god of the dead , but of the living : ye do greatly err .
jesus answered , the first is , hear , o israel ; the lord our god , the lord is one :
the second is this , thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . there is none other commandment greater than these .
and the scribe said unto him , of a truth , teacher , thou hast well said that he is one ; and there is none other but he :
and jesus answered and said , as he taught in the temple , how say the scribes that the christ is the son of david ?
david himself said in the holy spirit ,
david himself calleth him lord ; and whence is he his son ? and the common people heard him gladly .
and in his teaching he said , beware of the scribes , who desire to walk in long robes , and to have salutations in the marketplaces ,
and chief seats in the synagogues , and chief places at feasts :
they that devour widows ’ houses , and for a pretence make long prayers ; these shall receive greater condemnation .
and he sat down over against the treasury , and beheld how the multitude cast money into the treasury : and many that were rich cast in much .
and there came a poor widow , and she cast in two mites , which make a farthing .
for they all did cast in of their superfluity ; but she of her want did cast in all that she had , even all her living .
and jesus said unto him , seest thou these great buildings ? there shall not be left here one stone upon another , which shall not be thrown down .
and as he sat on the mount of olives over against the temple , peter and james and john and andrew asked him privately ,
tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign when these things are all about to be accomplished ?
and jesus began to say unto them , take heed that no man lead you astray .
many shall come in my name , saying , i am he ; and shall lead many astray .
and the gospel must first be preached unto all the nations .
and ye shall be hated of all men for my name ’ s sake : but he that endureth to the end , the same shall be saved .
and let him that is on the housetop not go down , nor enter in , to take anything out of his house :
and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak .
but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days !
and pray ye that it be not in the winter .
and then if any man shall say unto you , lo , here is the christ ; or , lo , there ; believe it not :
for there shall arise false christs and false prophets , and shall show signs and wonders , that they may lead astray , if possible , the elect .
but take ye heed : behold , i have told you all things beforehand .
but in those days , after that tribulation , the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light ,
and the stars shall be falling from heaven , and the powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken .
and then shall they see the son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory .
even so ye also , when ye see these things coming to pass , know ye that he is nigh , even at the doors .
verily i say unto you , this generation shall not pass away , until all these things be accomplished .
heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away .
but of that day or that hour knoweth no one , not even the angels in heaven , neither the son , but the father .
take ye heed , watch and pray : for ye know not when the time is .
lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping .
and what i say unto you i say unto all , watch .
for they said , not during the feast , lest haply there shall be a tumult of the people .
but there were some that had indignation among themselves , saying , to what purpose hath this waste of the ointment been made ?
for this ointment might have been sold for above three hundred shillings , and given to the poor . and they murmured against her .
but jesus said , let her alone ; why trouble ye her ? she hath wrought a good work on me .
for ye have the poor always with you , and whensoever ye will ye can do them good : but me ye have not always .
she hath done what she could ; she hath anointed my body beforehand for the burying .
and judas iscariot , he that was one of the twelve , went away unto the chief priests , that he might deliver him unto them .
and they , when they heard it , were glad , and promised to give him money . and he sought how he might conveniently deliver him unto them .
and he will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready : and there make ready for us .
and the disciples went forth , and came into the city , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
and when it was evening he cometh with the twelve .
they began to be sorrowful , and to say unto him one by one , is it i ?
and he said unto them , it is one of the twelve , he that dippeth with me in the dish .
and he took a cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave to them : and they all drank of it .
and he said unto them , this is my blood of the covenant , which is poured out for many .
and when they had sung a hymn , they went out unto the mount of olives .
howbeit , after i am raised up , i will go before you into galilee .
but peter said unto him , although all shall be offended , yet will not i .
but he spake exceeding vehemently , if i must die with thee , i will not deny thee . and in like manner also said they all .
and they come unto a place which was named gethsemane : and he saith unto his disciples , sit ye here , while i pray .
and he taketh with him peter and james and john , and began to be greatly amazed , and sore troubled .
and he saith unto them , my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death : abide ye here , and watch .
and he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass away from him .
and he cometh , and findeth them sleeping , and saith unto peter , simon , sleepest thou ? couldest thou not watch one hour ?
watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak .
and again he went away , and prayed , saying the same words .
and again he came , and found them sleeping , for their eyes were very heavy ; and they knew not what to answer him .
arise , let us be going : behold , he that betrayeth me is at hand .
and when he was come , straightway he came to him , and saith , rabbi ; and kissed him .
and they laid hands on him , and took him .
but a certain one of them that stood by drew his sword , and smote the servant of the high priest , and struck off his ear .
and jesus answered and said unto them , are ye come out , as against a robber , with swords and staves to seize me ?
i was daily with you in the temple teaching , and ye took me not : but this is done that the scriptures might be fulfilled .
and they all left him , and fled .
and a certain young man followed with him , having a linen cloth cast about him , over his naked body : and they lay hold on him ;
but he left the linen cloth , and fled naked .
and they led jesus away to the high priest : and there come together with him all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes .
now the chief priests and the whole council sought witness against jesus to put him to death ; and found it not .
for many bare false witness against him , and their witness agreed not together .
and there stood up certain , and bare false witness against him , saying ,
we heard him say , i will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and in three days i will build another made without hands .
and not even so did their witness agree together .
and the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked jesus , saying , answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
and the high priest rent his clothes , and saith , what further need have we of witnesses ?
ye have heard the blasphemy : what think ye ? and they all condemned him to be worthy of death .
and as peter was beneath in the court , there cometh one of the maids of the high priest ;
and seeing peter warming himself , she looked upon him , and saith , thou also wast with the nazarene , even jesus .
but he denied , saying , i neither know , nor understand what thou sayest : and he went out into the porch ; and the cock crew .
and the maid saw him , and began again to say to them that stood by , this is one of them .
but he began to curse , and to swear , i know not this man of whom ye speak .
and pilate asked him , art thou the king of the jews ? and he answering saith unto him , thou sayest .
and the chief priests accused him of many things .
and pilate again asked him , saying , answerest thou nothing ? behold how many things they accuse thee of .
but jesus no more answered anything ; insomuch that pilate marvelled .
now at the feast he used to release unto them one prisoner , whom they asked of him .
and there was one called barabbas , lying bound with them that had made insurrection , men who in the insurrection had committed murder .
and the multitude went up and began to ask him to do as he was wont to do unto them .
and pilate answered them , saying , will ye that i release unto you the king of the jews ?
for he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up .
but the chief priests stirred up the multitude , that he should rather release barabbas unto them .
and pilate again answered and said unto them , what then shall i do unto him whom ye call the king of the jews ?
and they cried out again , crucify him .
and pilate said unto them , why , what evil hath he done ? but they cried out exceedingly , crucify him .
and pilate , wishing to content the multitude , released unto them barabbas , and delivered jesus , when he had scourged him , to be crucified .
and the soldiers led him away within the court , which is the praetorium ; and they call together the whole band .
and they clothe him with purple , and platting a crown of thorns , they put it on him ;
and they began to salute him , hail , king of the jews !
and they smote his head with a reed , and spat upon him , and bowing their knees worshipped him .
and they bring him unto the place golgotha , which is , being interpreted , the place of a skull .
and they offered him wine mingled with myrrh : but he received it not .
and they crucify him , and part his garments among them , casting lots upon them , what each should take .
and it was the third hour , and they crucified him .
and the superscription of his accusation was written over , the king of the jews .
and with him they crucify two robbers ; one on his right hand , and one on his left .
save thyself , and come down from the cross .
in like manner also the chief priests mocking him among themselves with the scribes said , he saved others ; himself he can not save .
and when the sixth hour was come , there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour .
and some of them that stood by , when they heard it , said , behold , he calleth elijah .
and jesus uttered a loud voice , and gave up the ghost .
and the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom .
who , when he was in galilee , followed him , and ministered unto him ; and many other women that came up with him unto jerusalem .
and when even was now come , because it was the preparation , that is , the day before the sabbath ,
and pilate marvelled if he were already dead : and calling unto him the centurion , he asked him whether he had been any while dead .
and when he learned it of the centurion , he granted the corpse to joseph .
and mary magdalene and mary the mother of joses beheld where he was laid .
and very early on the first day of the week , they come to the tomb when the sun was risen .
and they were saying among themselves , who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the tomb ?
and looking up , they see that the stone is rolled back : for it was exceeding great .
and entering into the tomb , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , arrayed in a white robe ; and they were amazed .
but go , tell his disciples and peter , he goeth before you into galilee : there shall ye see him , as he said unto you .
now when he was risen early on the first day of the week , he appeared first to mary magdalene , from whom he had cast out seven demons .
she went and told them that had been with him , as they mourned and wept .
and they , when they heard that he was alive , and had been seen of her , disbelieved .
and after these things he was manifested in another form unto two of them , as they walked , on their way into the country .
and they went away and told it unto the rest : neither believed they them .
and he said unto them , go ye into all the world , and preach the gospel to the whole creation .
he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved ; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned .
and these signs shall accompany them that believe : in my name shall they cast out demons ; they shall speak with new tongues ;
so then the lord jesus , after he had spoken unto them , was received up into heaven , and sat down at the right hand of god .
and they went forth , and preached everywhere , the lord working with them , and confirming the word by the signs that followed . amen .
the book of the generation of jesus christ , the son of david , the son of abraham .
abraham begat isaac ; and isaac begat jacob ; and jacob begat judah and his brethren ;
and judah begat perez and zerah of tamar ; and perez begat hezron ; and hezron begat ram ;
and ram begat amminadab ; and amminadab begat nahshon ; and nahshon begat salmon ;
and salmon begat boaz of rahab ; and boaz begat obed of ruth ; and obed begat jesse ;
and jesse begat david the king .
and solomon begat rehoboam ; and rehoboam begat abijah ; and abijah begat asa ;
and asa begat jehoshaphat ; and jehoshaphat begat joram ; and joram begat uzziah ;
and uzziah begat jotham ; and jotham begat ahaz ; and ahaz begat hezekiah ;
and hezekiah begat manasseh ; and manasseh begat amon ; and amon begat josiah ;
and josiah begat jechoniah and his brethren , at the time of the carrying away to babylon .
and after the carrying away to babylon , jechoniah begat shealtiel ; and shealtiel begat zerubbabel ;
and zerubbabel begat abiud ; and abiud begat eliakim ; and eliakim begat azor ;
and azor begat sadoc ; and sadoc begat achim ; and achim begat eliud ;
and eliud begat eleazar ; and eleazar begat matthan ; and matthan begat jacob ;
and jacob begat joseph the husband of mary , of whom was born jesus , who is called christ .
and joseph her husband , being a righteous man , and not willing to make her a public example , was minded to put her away privily .
and she shall bring forth a son ; and thou shalt call his name jesus ; for it is he that shall save his people from their sins .
now all this is come to pass , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the lord through the prophet , saying ,
behold , the virgin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son ,
and joseph arose from his sleep , and did as the angel of the lord commanded him , and took unto him his wife ;
and knew her not till she had brought forth a son : and he called his name jesus .
now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judaea in the days of herod the king , behold , wise-men from the east came to jerusalem , saying ,
where is he that is born king of the jews ? for we saw his star in the east , and are come to worship him .
and when herod the king heard it , he was troubled , and all jerusalem with him .
and gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people , he inquired of them where the christ should be born .
and they said unto him , in bethlehem of judaea : for thus it is written through the prophet ,
and thou bethlehem , land of judah ,
then herod privily called the wise-men , and learned of them exactly what time the star appeared .
and when they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceeding great joy .
and being warned of god in a dream that they should not return to herod , they departed into their own country another way .
and he arose and took the young child and his mother by night , and departed into egypt ;
then was fulfilled that which was spoken through jeremiah the prophet , saying ,
a voice was heard in ramah ,
but when herod was dead , behold , an angel of the lord appeareth in a dream to joseph in egypt , saying ,
and he arose and took the young child and his mother , and came into the land of israel .
and came and dwelt in a city called nazareth ; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets , that he should be called a nazarene .
and in those days cometh john the baptist , preaching in the wilderness of judaea , saying ,
repent ye ; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
for this is he that was spoken of through isaiah the prophet , saying ,
now john himself had his raiment of camel ’ s hair , and a leathern girdle about his loins ; and his food was locusts and wild honey .
then went out unto him jerusalem , and all judaea , and all the region round about the jordan ;
and they were baptized of him in the river jordan , confessing their sins .
bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance :
then cometh jesus from galilee to the jordan unto john , to be baptized of him .
but john would have hindered him , saying , i have need to be baptized of thee , and comest thou to me ?
but jesus answering said unto him , suffer it now : for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness . then he suffereth him .
and lo , a voice out of the heavens , saying , this is my beloved son , in whom i am well pleased .
then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil .
and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights , he afterward hungered .
and the tempter came and said unto him , if thou art the son of god , command that these stones become bread .
then the devil taketh him into the holy city ; and he set him on the pinnacle of the temple ,
and saith unto him , if thou art the son of god , cast thyself down : for it is written ,
jesus said unto him , again it is written , thou shalt not make trial of the lord thy god .
again , the devil taketh him unto an exceeding high mountain , and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world , and the glory of them ;
and he said unto him , all these things will i give thee , if thou wilt fall down and worship me .
then the devil leaveth him ; and behold , angels came and ministered unto him .
now when he heard that john was delivered up , he withdrew into galilee ;
and leaving nazareth , he came and dwelt in capernaum , which is by the sea , in the borders of zebulun and naphtali :
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through isaiah the prophet , saying ,
the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali ,
the people that sat in darkness
from that time began jesus to preach , and to say , repent ye ; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
and he saith unto them , come ye after me , and i will make you fishers of men .
and they straightway left the nets , and followed him .
and they straightway left the boat and their father , and followed him .
and there followed him great multitudes from galilee and decapolis and jerusalem and judaea and from beyond the jordan .
and seeing the multitudes , he went up into the mountain : and when he had sat down , his disciples came unto him :
and he opened his mouth and taught them , saying ,
blessed are the poor in spirit : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
blessed are they that mourn : for they shall be comforted .
blessed are the meek : for they shall inherit the earth .
blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness : for they shall be filled .
blessed are the merciful : for they shall obtain mercy .
blessed are the pure in heart : for they shall see god .
blessed are the peacemakers : for they shall be called sons of god .
blessed are they that have been persecuted for righteousness ’ sake : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
blessed are ye when men shall reproach you , and persecute you , and say all manner of evil against you falsely , for my sake .
rejoice , and be exceeding glad : for great is your reward in heaven : for so persecuted they the prophets that were before you .
ye are the light of the world . a city set on a hill can not be hid .
neither do men light a lamp , and put it under the bushel , but on the stand ; and it shineth unto all that are in the house .
even so let your light shine before men ; that they may see your good works , and glorify your father who is in heaven .
think not that i came to destroy the law or the prophets : i came not to destroy , but to fulfil .
ye have heard that it was said to them of old time , thou shalt not kill ; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment :
if therefore thou art offering thy gift at the altar , and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee ,
leave there thy gift before the altar , and go thy way , first be reconciled to thy brother , and then come and offer thy gift .
verily i say unto thee , thou shalt by no means come out thence , till thou have paid the last farthing .
ye have heard that it was said , thou shalt not commit adultery :
but i say unto you , that every one that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart .
it was said also , whosoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of divorcement :
again , ye have heard that it was said to them of old time , thou shalt not forswear thyself , but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths :
but i say unto you , swear not at all ; neither by the heaven , for it is the throne of god ;
nor by the earth , for it is the footstool of his feet ; nor by jerusalem , for it is the city of the great king .
neither shalt thou swear by thy head , for thou canst not make one hair white or black .
but let your speech be , yea , yea ; nay , nay : and whatsoever is more than these is of the evil one .
ye have heard that it was said , an eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth :
but i say unto you , resist not him that is evil : but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also .
and if any man would go to law with thee , and take away thy coat , let him have thy cloak also .
and whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile , go with him two .
give to him that asketh thee , and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away .
ye have heard that it was said , thou shalt love thy neighbor , and hate thine enemy :
but i say unto you , love your enemies , and pray for them that persecute you ;
for if ye love them that love you , what reward have ye ? do not even the publicans the same ?
and if ye salute your brethren only , what do ye more than others ? do not even the gentiles the same ?
ye therefore shall be perfect , as your heavenly father is perfect .
take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men , to be seen of them : else ye have no reward with your father who is in heaven .
but when thou doest alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth :
that thine alms may be in secret : and thy father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee .
and in praying use not vain repetitions , as the gentiles do : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking .
be not therefore like unto them : for your father knoweth what things ye have need of , before ye ask him .
after this manner therefore pray ye : our father who art in heaven , hallowed be thy name .
thy kingdom come . thy will be done , as in heaven , so on earth .
give us this day our daily bread .
and forgive us our debts , as we also have forgiven our debtors .
and bring us not into temptation , but deliver us from the evil one .
for if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly father will also forgive you .
but if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your father forgive your trespasses .
but thou , when thou fastest , anoint thy head , and wash thy face ;
lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth , where moth and rust consume , and where thieves break through and steal :
but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust doth consume , and where thieves do not break through nor steal :
for where thy treasure is , there will thy heart be also .
the lamp of the body is the eye : if therefore thine eye be single , thy whole body shall be full of light .
and which of you by being anxious can add one cubit unto the measure of his life ?
and why are ye anxious concerning raiment ? consider the lilies of the field , how they grow ; they toil not , neither do they spin :
yet i say unto you , that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
be not therefore anxious , saying , what shall we eat ? or , what shall we drink ? or , wherewithal shall we be clothed ?
for after all these things do the gentiles seek ; for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things .
but seek ye first his kingdom , and his righteousness ; and all these things shall be added unto you .
be not therefore anxious for the morrow : for the morrow will be anxious for itself . sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof .
judge not , that ye be not judged .
for with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged : and with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured unto you .
and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother ’ s eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you :
for every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
or what man is there of you , who , if his son shall ask him for a loaf , will give him a stone ;
or if he shall ask for a fish , will give him a serpent ?
all things therefore whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you , even so do ye also unto them : for this is the law and the prophets .
for narrow is the gate , and straitened the way , that leadeth unto life , and few are they that find it .
beware of false prophets , who come to you in sheep ’ s clothing , but inwardly are ravening wolves .
by their fruits ye shall know them . do men gather grapes of thorns , or figs of thistles ?
even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit ; but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit .
a good tree can not bring forth evil fruit , neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
therefore by their fruits ye shall know them .
and then will i profess unto them , i never knew you : depart from me , ye that work iniquity .
every one therefore that heareth these words of mine , and doeth them , shall be likened unto a wise man , who built his house upon the rock :
and it came to pass , when jesus had finished these words , the multitudes were astonished at his teaching :
for he taught them as one having authority , and not as their scribes .
and when he was come down from the mountain , great multitudes followed him .
and behold , there came to him a leper and worshipped him , saying , lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
and he stretched forth his hand , and touched him , saying , i will ; be thou made clean . and straightway his leprosy was cleansed .
and when he was entered into capernaum , there came unto him a centurion , beseeching him ,
and saying , lord , my servant lieth in the house sick of the palsy , grievously tormented .
and he saith unto him , i will come and heal him .
but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast forth into the outer darkness : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
and when jesus was come into peter ’ s house , he saw his wife ’ s mother lying sick of a fever .
and he touched her hand , and the fever left her ; and she arose , and ministered unto him .
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through isaiah the prophet , saying , himself took our infirmities , and bare our diseases .
now when jesus saw great multitudes about him , he gave commandment to depart unto the other side .
and there came a scribe , and said unto him , teacher , i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
and another of the disciples said unto him , lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father .
but jesus saith unto him , follow me ; and leave the dead to bury their own dead .
and when he was entered into a boat , his disciples followed him .
and behold , there arose a great tempest in the sea , insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves : but he was asleep .
and they came to him , and awoke him , saying , save , lord ; we perish .
and the men marvelled , saying , what manner of man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey him ?
now there was afar off from them a herd of many swine feeding .
and the demons besought him , saying , if thou cast us out , send us away into the herd of swine .
and they that fed them fled , and went away into the city , and told everything , and what was befallen to them that were possessed with demons .
and behold , all the city came out to meet jesus : and when they saw him , they besought him that he would depart from their borders .
and he entered into a boat , and crossed over , and came into his own city .
and behold , certain of the scribes said within themselves , this man blasphemeth .
and jesus knowing their thoughts said , wherefore think ye evil in your hearts ?
for which is easier , to say , thy sins are forgiven ; or to say , arise , and walk ?
and he arose , and departed to his house .
but when the multitudes saw it , they were afraid , and glorified god , who had given such authority unto men .
and when the pharisees saw it , they said unto his disciples , why eateth your teacher with the publicans and sinners ?
but when he heard it , he said , they that are whole have no need of a physician , but they that are sick .
but go ye and learn what this meaneth , i desire mercy , and not sacrifice : for i came not to call the righteous , but sinners .
then come to him the disciples of john , saying , why do we and the pharisees fast oft , but thy disciples fast not ?
and jesus arose , and followed him , and so did his disciples .
and behold , a woman , who had an issue of blood twelve years , came behind him , and touched the border of his garment :
for she said within herself , if i do but touch his garment , i shall be made whole .
and when jesus came into the ruler ’ s house , and saw the flute-players , and the crowd making a tumult ,
he said , give place : for the damsel is not dead , but sleepeth . and they laughed him to scorn .
but when the crowd was put forth , he entered in , and took her by the hand ; and the damsel arose .
and the fame hereof went forth into all that land .
and as jesus passed by from thence , two blind men followed him , crying out , and saying , have mercy on us , thou son of david .
then touched he their eyes , saying , according to your faith be it done unto you .
and their eyes were opened . and jesus strictly charged them , saying , see that no man know it .
but they went forth , and spread abroad his fame in all that land .
and as they went forth , behold , there was brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon .
and when the demon was cast out , the dumb man spake : and the multitudes marvelled , saying , it was never so seen in israel .
but the pharisees said , by the prince of the demons casteth he out demons .
but when he saw the multitudes , he was moved with compassion for them , because they were distressed and scattered , as sheep not having a shepherd .
then saith he unto his disciples , the harvest indeed is plenteous , but the laborers are few .
pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest , that he send forth laborers into his harvest .
philip , and bartholomew ; thomas , and matthew the publican ; james the son of alphaeus , and thaddaeus ;
simon the cananaean , and judas iscariot , who also betrayed him .
but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel .
and as ye go , preach , saying , the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
heal the sick , raise the dead , cleanse the lepers , cast out demons : freely ye received , freely give .
get you no gold , nor silver , nor brass in your purses ;
no wallet for your journey , neither two coats , nor shoes , nor staff : for the laborer is worthy of his food .
and into whatsoever city or village ye shall enter , search out who in it is worthy ; and there abide till ye go forth .
and as ye enter into the house , salute it .
and if the house be worthy , let your peace come upon it : but if it be not worthy , let your peace return to you .
verily i say unto you , it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrah in the day of judgment , than for that city .
behold , i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves : be ye therefore wise as serpents , and harmless as doves .
but beware of men : for they will deliver you up to councils , and in their synagogues they will scourge you ;
yea and before governors and kings shall ye be brought for my sake , for a testimony to them and to the gentiles .
for it is not ye that speak , but the spirit of your father that speaketh in you .
and ye shall be hated of all men for my name ’ s sake : but he that endureth to the end , the same shall be saved .
a disciple is not above his teacher , nor a servant above his lord .
fear them not therefore : for there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; and hid , that shall not be known .
what i tell you in the darkness , speak ye in the light ; and what ye hear in the ear , proclaim upon the house-tops .
are not two sparrows sold for a penny ? and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your father :
but the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
fear not therefore : ye are of more value than many sparrows .
every one therefore who shall confess me before men , him will i also confess before my father who is in heaven .
but whosoever shall deny me before men , him will i also deny before my father who is in heaven .
think not that i came to send peace on the earth : i came not to send peace , but a sword .
and a man ’ s foes shall be they of his own household .
and he that doth not take his cross and follow after me , is not worthy of me .
he that findeth his life shall lose it ; and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it .
he that receiveth you receiveth me , and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
and it came to pass when jesus had finished commanding his twelve disciples , he departed thence to teach and preach in their cities .
now when john heard in the prison the works of the christ , he sent by his disciples
and said unto him , art thou he that cometh , or look we for another ?
and jesus answered and said unto them , go and tell john the things which ye hear and see :
and blessed is he , whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me .
but what went ye out to see ? a man clothed in soft raiment ? behold , they that wear soft raiment are in kings ’ houses .
but wherefore went ye out ? to see a prophet ? yea , i say unto you , and much more than a prophet .
this is he , of whom it is written ,
and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence , and men of violence take it by force .
for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john .
and if ye are willing to receive it , this is elijah , that is to come .
he that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
but whereunto shall i liken this generation ? it is like unto children sitting in the marketplaces , who call unto their fellows
and say , we piped unto you , and ye did not dance ; we wailed , and ye did not mourn .
for john came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , he hath a demon .
then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done , because they repented not .
but i say unto you , it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon in the day of judgment , than for you .
but i say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom in the day of judgment , than for thee .
yea , father , for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight .
come unto me , all ye that labor and are heavy laden , and i will give you rest .
take my yoke upon you , and learn of me ; for i am meek and lowly in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls .
for my yoke is easy , and my burden is light .
at that season jesus went on the sabbath day through the grainfields ; and his disciples were hungry and began to pluck ears and to eat .
but the pharisees , when they saw it , said unto him , behold , thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do upon the sabbath .
but he said unto them , have ye not read what david did , when he was hungry , and they that were with him ;
or have ye not read in the law , that on the sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the sabbath , and are guiltless ?
but i say unto you , that one greater than the temple is here .
but if ye had known what this meaneth , i desire mercy , and not sacrifice , ye would not have condemned the guiltless .
for the son of man is lord of the sabbath .
and he departed thence , and went into their synagogue :
how much then is a man of more value than a sheep ! wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day .
then saith he to the man , stretch forth thy hand . and he stretched it forth ; and it was restored whole , as the other .
but the pharisees went out , and took counsel against him , how they might destroy him .
and jesus perceiving it withdrew from thence : and many followed him ; and he healed them all ,
and charged them that they should not make him known :
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through isaiah the prophet , saying ,
behold , my servant whom i have chosen ;
he shall not strive , nor cry aloud ;
a bruised reed shall he not break ,
and in his name shall the gentiles hope .
then was brought unto him one possessed with a demon , blind and dumb : and he healed him , insomuch that the dumb man spake and saw .
and all the multitudes were amazed , and said , can this be the son of david ?
but when the pharisees heard it , they said , this man doth not cast out demons , but by beelzebub the prince of the demons .
and if satan casteth out satan , he is divided against himself ; how then shall his kingdom stand ?
and if i by beelzebub cast out demons , by whom do your sons cast them out ? therefore shall they be your judges .
but if i by the spirit of god cast out demons , then is the kingdom of god come upon you .
he that is not with me is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth .
therefore i say unto you , every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men ; but the blasphemy against the spirit shall not be forgiven .
ye offspring of vipers , how can ye , being evil , speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh .
the good man out of his good treasure bringeth forth good things : and the evil man out of his evil treasure bringeth forth evil things .
and i say unto you , that every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment .
for by thy words thou shalt be justified , and by thy words thou shalt be condemned .
then certain of the scribes and pharisees answered him , saying , teacher , we would see a sign from thee .
but the unclean spirit , when he is gone out of the man , passeth through waterless places , seeking rest , and findeth it not .
while he was yet speaking to the multitudes , behold , his mother and his brethren stood without , seeking to speak to him .
and one said unto him , behold , thy mother and thy brethren stand without , seeking to speak to thee .
but he answered and said unto him that told him , who is my mother ? and who are my brethren ?
and he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples , and said , behold , my mother and my brethren !
for whosoever shall do the will of my father who is in heaven , he is my brother , and sister , and mother .
on that day went jesus out of the house , and sat by the sea side .
and there were gathered unto him great multitudes , so that he entered into a boat , and sat ; and all the multitude stood on the beach .
and he spake to them many things in parables , saying , behold , the sower went forth to sow ;
and as he sowed , some seeds fell by the way side , and the birds came and devoured them :
and others fell upon the rocky places , where they had not much earth : and straightway they sprang up , because they had no deepness of earth :
and when the sun was risen , they were scorched ; and because they had no root , they withered away .
and others fell upon the thorns ; and the thorns grew up and choked them :
and others fell upon the good ground , and yielded fruit , some a hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .
he that hath ears , let him hear .
and the disciples came , and said unto him , why speakest thou unto them in parables ?
therefore speak i to them in parables ; because seeing they see not , and hearing they hear not , neither do they understand .
and unto them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah , which saith ,
for this people ’ s heart is waxed gross ,
but blessed are your eyes , for they see ; and your ears , for they hear .
hear then ye the parable of the sower .
and he that was sown upon the rocky places , this is he that heareth the word , and straightway with joy receiveth it ;
yet hath he not root in himself , but endureth for a while ; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word , straightway he stumbleth .
another parable set he before them , saying , the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field :
but while men slept , his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat , and went away .
but when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit , then appeared the tares also .
and the servants of the householder came and said unto him , sir , didst thou not sow good seed in thy field ? whence then hath it tares ?
and he said unto them , an enemy hath done this . and the servants say unto him , wilt thou then that we go and gather them up ?
but he saith , nay ; lest haply while ye gather up the tares , ye root up the wheat with them .
all these things spake jesus in parables unto the multitudes ; and without a parable spake he nothing unto them :
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet , saying ,
and he answered and said , he that soweth the good seed is the son of man ;
and the enemy that sowed them is the devil : and the harvest is the end of the world ; and the reapers are angels .
as therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire ; so shall it be in the end of the world .
the son of man shall send forth his angels , and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling , and them that do iniquity ,
and shall cast them into the furnace of fire : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father . he that hath ears , let him hear .
again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls :
and having found one pearl of great price , he went and sold all that he had , and bought it .
again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net , that was cast into the sea , and gathered of every kind :
so shall it be in the end of the world : the angels shall come forth , and sever the wicked from among the righteous ,
and shall cast them into the furnace of fire : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
have ye understood all these things ? they say unto him , yea .
and it came to pass , when jesus had finished these parables , he departed thence .
and his sisters , are they not all with us ? whence then hath this man all these things ?
and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief .
at that season herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning jesus ,
and said unto his servants , this is john the baptist ; he is risen from the dead ; and therefore do these powers work in him .
for herod had laid hold on john , and bound him , and put him in prison for the sake of herodias , his brother philip ’ s wife .
for john said unto him , it is not lawful for thee to have her .
and when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet .
but when herod ’ s birthday came , the daughter of herodias danced in the midst , and pleased herod .
whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she should ask .
and she , being put forward by her mother , saith , give me here on a platter the head of john the baptist .
and he sent and beheaded john in the prison .
and his head was brought on a platter , and given to the damsel : and she brought it to her mother .
and his disciples came , and took up the corpse , and buried him ; and they went and told jesus .
and he came forth , and saw a great multitude , and he had compassion on them , and healed their sick .
but jesus said unto them , they have no need to go away ; give ye them to eat .
and they say unto him , we have here but five loaves , and two fishes .
and he said , bring them hither to me .
and they all ate , and were filled : and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces , twelve baskets full .
and they that did eat were about five thousand men , besides women and children .
and straightway he constrained the disciples to enter into the boat , and to go before him unto the other side , till he should send the multitudes away .
and after he had sent the multitudes away , he went up into the mountain apart to pray : and when even was come , he was there alone .
but the boat was now in the midst of the sea , distressed by the waves ; for the wind was contrary .
and in the fourth watch of the night he came unto them , walking upon the sea .
and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , it is a ghost ; and they cried out for fear .
but straightway jesus spake unto them , saying , be of good cheer ; it is i ; be not afraid .
and peter answered him and said , lord , if it be thou , bid me come unto thee upon the waters .
and he said , come . and peter went down from the boat , and walked upon the waters to come to jesus .
but when he saw the wind , he was afraid ; and beginning to sink , he cried out , saying , lord , save me .
and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand , and took hold of him , and saith unto him , o thou of little faith , wherefore didst thou doubt ?
and when they were gone up into the boat , the wind ceased .
and they that were in the boat worshipped him , saying , of a truth thou art the son of god .
and when they had crossed over , they came to the land , unto gennesaret .
and when the men of that place knew him , they sent into all that region round about , and brought unto him all that were sick ;
and they besought him that they might only touch the border of his garment : and as many as touched were made whole .
then there come to jesus from jerusalem pharisees and scribes , saying ,
why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread .
and he answered and said unto them , why do ye also transgress the commandment of god because of your tradition ?
for god said , honor thy father and thy mother : and , he that speaketh evil of father or mother , let him die the death .
but ye say , whosoever shall say to his father or his mother , that wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is given to god ;
he shall not honor his father . and ye have made void the word of god because of your tradition .
ye hypocrites , well did isaiah prophesy of you , saying ,
this people honoreth me with their lips ;
but in vain do they worship me ,
and he called to him the multitude , and said unto them , hear , and understand :
not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man ; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth , this defileth the man .
then came the disciples , and said unto him , knowest thou that the pharisees were offended , when they heard this saying ?
but he answered and said , every plant which my heavenly father planted not , shall be rooted up .
let them alone : they are blind guides . and if the blind guide the blind , both shall fall into a pit .
and peter answered and said unto him , declare unto us the parable .
and he said , are ye also even yet without understanding ?
perceive ye not , that whatsoever goeth into the mouth passeth into the belly , and is cast out into the draught ?
but the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart ; and they defile the man .
for out of the heart come forth evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false witness , railings :
these are the things which defile the man ; but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man .
and jesus went out thence , and withdrew into the parts of tyre and sidon .
but he answered her not a word . and his disciples came and besought him , saying , send her away ; for she crieth after us .
but he answered and said , i was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel .
but she came and worshipped him , saying , lord , help me .
and he answered and said , it is not meet to take the children ’ s bread and cast it to the dogs .
but she said , yea , lord : for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters ’ table .
and jesus departed thence , and came nigh unto the sea of galilee ; and he went up into the mountain , and sat there .
and the disciples say unto him , whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude ?
and jesus said unto them , how many loaves have ye ? and they said , seven , and a few small fishes .
and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground ;
and he took the seven loaves and the fishes ; and he gave thanks and brake , and gave to the disciples , and the disciples to the multitudes .
and they all ate , and were filled : and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces , seven baskets full .
and they that did eat were four thousand men , besides women and children .
and he sent away the multitudes , and entered into the boat , and came into the borders of magadan .
and the pharisees and sadducees came , and trying him asked him to show them a sign from heaven .
but he answered and said unto them , when it is evening , ye say , it will be fair weather : for the heaven is red .
and the disciples came to the other side and forgot to take bread .
and jesus said unto them , take heed and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees .
and they reasoned among themselves , saying , we took no bread .
and jesus perceiving it said , o ye of little faith , why reason ye among yourselves , because ye have no bread ?
do ye not yet perceive , neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ?
neither the seven loaves of the four thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ?
how is it that ye do not perceive that i spake not to you concerning bread ? but beware of the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees .
then understood they that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread , but of the teaching of the pharisees and sadducees .
now when jesus came into the parts of caesarea philippi , he asked his disciples , saying , who do men say that the son of man is ?
and they said , some say john the baptist ; some , elijah ; and others , jeremiah , or one of the prophets .
he saith unto them , but who say ye that i am ?
and simon peter answered and said , thou art the christ , the son of the living god .
then charged he the disciples that they should tell no man that he was the christ .
and peter took him , and began to rebuke him , saying , be it far from thee , lord : this shall never be unto thee .
then said jesus unto his disciples , if any man would come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for whosoever would save his life shall lose it : and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it .
for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels ; and then shall he render unto every man according to his deeds .
and after six days jesus taketh with him peter , and james , and john his brother , and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart :
and he was transfigured before them ; and his face did shine as the sun , and his garments became white as the light .
and behold , there appeared unto them moses and elijah talking with him .
and when the disciples heard it , they fell on their face , and were sore afraid .
and jesus came and touched them and said , arise , and be not afraid .
and lifting up their eyes , they saw no one , save jesus only .
and his disciples asked him , saying , why then say the scribes that elijah must first come ?
and he answered and said , elijah indeed cometh , and shall restore all things :
then understood the disciples that he spake unto them of john the baptist .
and when they were come to the multitude , there came to him a man , kneeling to him , and saying ,
and i brought him to thy disciples , and they could not cure him .
and jesus rebuked him ; and the demon went out of him : and the boy was cured from that hour .
then came the disciples to jesus apart , and said , why could not we cast it out ?
and while they abode in galilee , jesus said unto them , the son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men ;
and they shall kill him , and the third day he shall be raised up . and they were exceeding sorry .
and when they were come to capernaum , they that received the half-shekel came to peter , and said , doth not your teacher pay the half-shekel ?
and when he said , from strangers , jesus said unto him , therefore the sons are free .
in that hour came the disciples unto jesus , saying , who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven ?
and he called to him a little child , and set him in the midst of them ,
whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child , the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me :
even so it is not the will of your father who is in heaven , that one of these little ones should perish .
but if he hear thee not , take with thee one or two more , that at the mouth of two witnesses or three every word may be established .
for where two or three are gathered together in my name , there am i in the midst of them .
then came peter and said to him , lord , how oft shall my brother sin against me , and i forgive him ? until seven times ?
jesus saith unto him , i say not unto thee , until seven times ; but , until seventy times seven .
therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king , who would make a reckoning with his servants .
the servant therefore fell down and worshipped him , saying , lord , have patience with me , and i will pay thee all .
and the lord of that servant , being moved with compassion , released him , and forgave him the debt .
so his fellow-servant fell down and besought him , saying , have patience with me , and i will pay thee .
and he would not : but went and cast him into prison , till he should pay that which was due .
so when his fellow-servants saw what was done , they were exceeding sorry , and came and told unto their lord all that was done .
then his lord called him unto him , and saith to him , thou wicked servant , i forgave thee all that debt , because thou besoughtest me :
shouldest not thou also have had mercy on thy fellow-servant , even as i had mercy on thee ?
and his lord was wroth , and delivered him to the tormentors , till he should pay all that was due .
so shall also my heavenly father do unto you , if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts .
and it came to pass when jesus had finished these words , he departed from galilee , and came into the borders of judaea beyond the jordan ;
and great multitudes followed him ; and he healed them there .
and there came unto him pharisees , trying him , and saying , is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause ?
and he answered and said , have ye not read , that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female ,
and said , for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife ; and the two shall become one flesh ?
so that they are no more two , but one flesh . what therefore god hath joined together , let not man put asunder .
they say unto him , why then did moses command to give a bill of divorcement , and to put her away ?
he saith unto them , moses for your hardness of heart suffered you to put away your wives : but from the beginning it hath not been so .
the disciples say unto him , if the case of the man is so with his wife , it is not expedient to marry .
but he said unto them , not all men can receive this saying , but they to whom it is given .
then were there brought unto him little children , that he should lay his hands on them , and pray : and the disciples rebuked them .
but jesus said , suffer the little children , and forbid them not , to come unto me : for to such belongeth the kingdom of heaven .
and he laid his hands on them , and departed thence .
and behold , one came to him and said , teacher , what good thing shall i do , that i may have eternal life ?
honor thy father and thy mother ; and , thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself .
the young man saith unto him , all these things have i observed : what lack i yet ?
but when the young man heard the saying , he went away sorrowful ; for he was one that had great possessions .
and jesus said unto his disciples , verily i say unto you , it is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven .
and when the disciples heard it , they were astonished exceedingly , saying , who then can be saved ?
and jesus looking upon them said to them , with men this is impossible ; but with god all things are possible .
then answered peter and said unto him , lo , we have left all , and followed thee ; what then shall we have ?
but many shall be last that are first ; and first that are last .
for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that was a householder , who went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard .
and when he had agreed with the laborers for a shilling a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
and he went out about the third hour , and saw others standing in the marketplace idle ;
and to them he said , go ye also into the vineyard , and whatsoever is right i will give you . and they went their way .
again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour , and did likewise .
and about the eleventh hour he went out , and found others standing ; and he saith unto them , why stand ye here all the day idle ?
they say unto him , because no man hath hired us . he saith unto them , go ye also into the vineyard .
and when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour , they received every man a shilling .
and when the first came , they supposed that they would receive more ; and they likewise received every man a shilling .
and when they received it , they murmured against the householder ,
but he answered and said to one of them , friend , i do thee no wrong : didst not thou agree with me for a shilling ?
take up that which is thine , and go thy way ; it is my will to give unto this last , even as unto thee .
is it not lawful for me to do what i will with mine own ? or is thine eye evil , because i am good ?
so the last shall be first , and the first last .
and as jesus was going up to jerusalem , he took the twelve disciples apart , and on the way he said unto them ,
and shall deliver him unto the gentiles to mock , and to scourge , and to crucify : and the third day he shall be raised up .
then came to him the mother of the sons of zebedee with her sons , worshipping him , and asking a certain thing of him .
and when the ten heard it , they were moved with indignation concerning the two brethren .
not so shall it be among you : but whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister ;
and whosoever would be first among you shall be your servant :
even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
and as they went out from jericho , a great multitude followed him .
and jesus stood still , and called them , and said , what will ye that i should do unto you ?
they say unto him , lord , that our eyes may be opened .
and jesus , being moved with compassion , touched their eyes ; and straightway they received their sight , and followed him .
and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem , and came unto bethphage , unto the mount of olives , then jesus sent two disciples ,
and if any one say aught unto you , ye shall say , the lord hath need of them ; and straightway he will send them .
now this is come to pass , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet , saying ,
tell ye the daughter of zion ,
and the disciples went , and did even as jesus appointed them ,
and brought the ass , and the colt , and put on them their garments ; and he sat thereon .
and the most part of the multitude spread their garments in the way ; and others cut branches from the trees , and spread them in the way .
and when he was come into jerusalem , all the city was stirred , saying , who is this ?
and the multitudes said , this is the prophet , jesus , from nazareth of galilee .
and he saith unto them , it is written , my house shall be called a house of prayer : but ye make it a den of robbers .
and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple ; and he healed them .
and he left them , and went forth out of the city to bethany , and lodged there .
now in the morning as he returned to the city , he hungered .
and when the disciples saw it , they marvelled , saying , how did the fig tree immediately wither away ?
and all things , whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive .
but if we shall say , from men ; we fear the multitude ; for all hold john as a prophet .
and they answered jesus , and said , we know not . he also said unto them , neither tell i you by what authority i do these things .
but what think ye ? a man had two sons ; and he came to the first , and said , son , go work to-day in the vineyard .
and he answered and said , i will not : but afterward he repented himself , and went .
and he came to the second , and said likewise . and he answered and said , i go , sir : and went not .
and when the season of the fruits drew near , he sent his servants to the husbandmen , to receive his fruits .
and the husbandmen took his servants , and beat one , and killed another , and stoned another .
again , he sent other servants more than the first : and they did unto them in like manner .
but afterward he sent unto them his son , saying , they will reverence my son .
and they took him , and cast him forth out of the vineyard , and killed him .
when therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come , what will he do unto those husbandmen ?
jesus saith unto them , did ye never read in the scriptures ,
therefore say i unto you , the kingdom of god shall be taken away from you , and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof .
and he that falleth on this stone shall be broken to pieces : but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will scatter him as dust .
and when the chief priests and the pharisees heard his parables , they perceived that he spake of them .
and when they sought to lay hold on him , they feared the multitudes , because they took him for a prophet .
and jesus answered and spake again in parables unto them , saying ,
the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain king , who made a marriage feast for his son ,
and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the marriage feast : and they would not come .
but they made light of it , and went their ways , one to his own farm , another to his merchandise ;
and the rest laid hold on his servants , and treated them shamefully , and killed them .
but the king was wroth ; and he sent his armies , and destroyed those murderers , and burned their city .
then saith he to his servants , the wedding is ready , but they that were bidden were not worthy .
go ye therefore unto the partings of the highways , and as many as ye shall find , bid to the marriage feast .
but when the king came in to behold the guests , he saw there a man who had not on a wedding-garment :
and he saith unto him , friend , how camest thou in hither not having a wedding-garment ? and he was speechless .
for many are called , but few chosen .
then went the pharisees , and took counsel how they might ensnare him in his talk .
tell us therefore , what thinkest thou ? is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar , or not ?
but jesus perceived their wickedness , and said , why make ye trial of me , ye hypocrites ?
show me the tribute money . and they brought unto him a denarius .
and he saith unto them , whose is this image and superscription ?
and when they heard it , they marvelled , and left him , and went away .
on that day there came to him sadducees , they that say that there is no resurrection : and they asked him ,
now there were with us seven brethren : and the first married and deceased , and having no seed left his wife unto his brother ;
in like manner the second also , and the third , unto the seventh .
and after them all , the woman died .
in the resurrection therefore whose wife shall she be of the seven ? for they all had her .
but jesus answered and said unto them , ye do err , not knowing the scriptures , nor the power of god .
for in the resurrection they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are as angels in heaven .
but as touching the resurrection of the dead , have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by god , saying ,
and when the multitudes heard it , they were astonished at his teaching .
but the pharisees , when they heard that he had put the sadducees to silence , gathered themselves together .
and one of them , a lawyer , asked him a question , trying him :
teacher , which is the great commandment in the law ?
and he said unto him , thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind .
this is the great and first commandment .
and a second like unto it is this , thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself .
on these two commandments the whole law hangeth , and the prophets .
now while the pharisees were gathered together , jesus asked them a question ,
saying , what think ye of the christ ? whose son is he ? they say unto him , the son of david .
he saith unto them , how then doth david in the spirit call him lord , saying ,
the lord said unto my lord ,
if david then calleth him lord , how is he his son ?
and no one was able to answer him a word , neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions .
then spake jesus to the multitudes and to his disciples ,
saying , the scribes and the pharisees sit on moses ’ seat :
all things therefore whatsoever they bid you , these do and observe : but do not ye after their works ; for they say , and do not .
but all their works they do to be seen of men : for they make broad their phylacteries , and enlarge the borders of their garments ,
and love the chief place at feasts , and the chief seats in the synagogues ,
and the salutations in the marketplaces , and to be called of men , rabbi .
but be not ye called rabbi : for one is your teacher , and all ye are brethren .
and call no man your father on the earth : for one is your father , even he who is in heaven .
neither be ye called masters : for one is your master , even the christ .
but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant .
and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled ; and whosoever shall humble himself shall be exalted .
ye fools and blind : for which is greater , the gold , or the temple that hath sanctified the gold ?
and , whosoever shall swear by the altar , it is nothing ; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it , he is a debtor .
ye blind : for which is greater , the gift , or the altar that sanctifieth the gift ?
he therefore that sweareth by the altar , sweareth by it , and by all things thereon .
and he that sweareth by the temple , sweareth by it , and by him that dwelleth therein .
and he that sweareth by the heaven , sweareth by the throne of god , and by him that sitteth thereon .
ye blind guides , that strain out the gnat , and swallow the camel !
thou blind pharisee , cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter , that the outside thereof may become clean also .
even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men , but inwardly ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity .
woe unto you , scribes and pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets , and garnish the tombs of the righteous ,
and say , if we had been in the days of our fathers , we should not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets .
wherefore ye witness to yourselves , that ye are sons of them that slew the prophets .
fill ye up then the measure of your fathers .
ye serpents , ye offspring of vipers , how shall ye escape the judgment of hell ?
verily i say unto you , all these things shall come upon this generation .
behold , your house is left unto you desolate .
for i say unto you , ye shall not see me henceforth , till ye shall say , blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord .
and jesus went out from the temple , and was going on his way ; and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple .
and jesus answered and said unto them , take heed that no man lead you astray .
for many shall come in my name , saying , i am the christ ; and shall lead many astray .
for nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; and there shall be famines and earthquakes in divers places .
but all these things are the beginning of travail .
then shall they deliver you up unto tribulation , and shall kill you : and ye shall be hated of all the nations for my name ’ s sake .
and then shall many stumble , and shall deliver up one another , and shall hate one another .
and many false prophets shall arise , and shall lead many astray .
and because iniquity shall be multiplied , the love of the many shall wax cold .
but he that endureth to the end , the same shall be saved .
and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world for a testimony unto all the nations ; and then shall the end come .
then let them that are in judaea flee unto the mountains :
let him that is on the housetop not go down to take out the things that are in his house :
and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak .
but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days !
and pray ye that your flight be not in the winter , neither on a sabbath :
for then shall be great tribulation , such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now , no , nor ever shall be .
and except those days had been shortened , no flesh would have been saved : but for the elect ’ s sake those days shall be shortened .
then if any man shall say unto you , lo , here is the christ , or , here ; believe it not .
behold , i have told you beforehand .
for as the lightning cometh forth from the east , and is seen even unto the west ; so shall be the coming of the son of man .
wheresoever the carcase is , there will the eagles be gathered together .
even so ye also , when ye see all these things , know ye that he is nigh , even at the doors .
verily i say unto you , this generation shall not pass away , till all these things be accomplished .
heaven and earth shall pass away , but my words shall not pass away .
but of that day and hour knoweth no one , not even the angels of heaven , neither the son , but the father only .
and as were the days of noah , so shall be the coming of the son of man .
and they knew not until the flood came , and took them all away ; so shall be the coming of the son of man .
then shall two men be in the field ; one is taken , and one is left :
two women shall be grinding at the mill ; one is taken , and one is left .
watch therefore : for ye know not on what day your lord cometh .
therefore be ye also ready ; for in an hour that ye think not the son of man cometh .
who then is the faithful and wise servant , whom his lord hath set over his household , to give them their food in due season ?
blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
verily i say unto you , that he will set him over all that he hath .
but if that evil servant shall say in his heart , my lord tarrieth ;
and shall begin to beat his fellow-servants , and shall eat and drink with the drunken ;
the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not , and in an hour when he knoweth not ,
and shall cut him asunder , and appoint his portion with the hypocrites : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins , who took their lamps , and went forth to meet the bridegroom .
and five of them were foolish , and five were wise .
for the foolish , when they took their lamps , took no oil with them :
but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps .
now while the bridegroom tarried , they all slumbered and slept .
but at midnight there is a cry , behold , the bridegroom ! come ye forth to meet him .
then all those virgins arose , and trimmed their lamps .
and the foolish said unto the wise , give us of your oil ; for our lamps are going out .
afterward came also the other virgins , saying , lord , lord , open to us .
but he answered and said , verily i say unto you , i know you not .
watch therefore , for ye know not the day nor the hour .
for it is as when a man , going into another country , called his own servants , and delivered unto them his goods .
straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them , and made other five talents .
in like manner he also that received the two gained other two .
but he that received the one went away and digged in the earth , and hid his lord ’ s money .
now after a long time the lord of those servants cometh , and maketh a reckoning with them .
and he also that received the two talents came and said , lord , thou deliveredst unto me two talents : lo , i have gained other two talents .
and i was afraid , and went away and hid thy talent in the earth : lo , thou hast thine own .
thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers , and at my coming i should have received back mine own with interest .
take ye away therefore the talent from him , and give it unto him that hath the ten talents .
and cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
but when the son of man shall come in his glory , and all the angels with him , then shall he sit on the throne of his glory :
and before him shall be gathered all the nations : and he shall separate them one from another , as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats ;
and he shall set the sheep on his right hand , but the goats on the left .
naked , and ye clothed me ; i was sick , and ye visited me ; i was in prison , and ye came unto me .
then shall the righteous answer him , saying , lord , when saw we thee hungry , and fed thee ? or athirst , and gave thee drink ?
and when saw we thee a stranger , and took thee in ? or naked , and clothed thee ?
and when saw we thee sick , or in prison , and came unto thee ?
for i was hungry , and ye did not give me to eat ; i was thirsty , and ye gave me no drink ;
and these shall go away into eternal punishment : but the righteous into eternal life .
and it came to pass , when jesus had finished all these words , he said unto his disciples ,
ye know that after two days the passover cometh , and the son of man is delivered up to be crucified .
then were gathered together the chief priests , and the elders of the people , unto the court of the high priest , who was called caiaphas ;
and they took counsel together that they might take jesus by subtlety , and kill him .
but they said , not during the feast , lest a tumult arise among the people .
now when jesus was in bethany , in the house of simon the leper ,
there came unto him a woman having an alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment , and she poured it upon his head , as he sat at meat .
but when the disciples saw it , they had indignation , saying , to what purpose is this waste ?
for this ointment might have been sold for much , and given to the poor .
but jesus perceiving it said unto them , why trouble ye the woman ? for she hath wrought a good work upon me .
for ye have the poor always with you ; but me ye have not always .
for in that she poured this ointment upon my body , she did it to prepare me for burial .
then one of the twelve , who was called judas iscariot , went unto the chief priests ,
and said , what are ye willing to give me , and i will deliver him unto you ? and they weighed unto him thirty pieces of silver .
and from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him unto them .
now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus , saying , where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover ?
and the disciples did as jesus appointed them ; and they made ready the passover .
now when even was come , he was sitting at meat with the twelve disciples ;
and as they were eating , he said , verily i say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
and they were exceeding sorrowful , and began to say unto him every one , is it i , lord ?
and he answered and said , he that dipped his hand with me in the dish , the same shall betray me .
and judas , who betrayed him , answered and said , is it i , rabbi ? he saith unto him , thou hast said .
and he took a cup , and gave thanks , and gave to them , saying , drink ye all of it ;
for this is my blood of the covenant , which is poured out for many unto remission of sins .
and when they had sung a hymn , they went out into the mount of olives .
but after i am raised up , i will go before you into galilee .
but peter answered and said unto him , if all shall be offended in thee , i will never be offended .
jesus said unto him , verily i say unto thee , that this night , before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
peter saith unto him , even if i must die with thee , yet will i not deny thee . likewise also said all the disciples .
then cometh jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane , and saith unto his disciples , sit ye here , while i go yonder and pray .
and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee , and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled .
then saith he unto them , my soul is exceeding sorrowful , even unto death : abide ye here , and watch with me .
and he cometh unto the disciples , and findeth them sleeping , and saith unto peter , what , could ye not watch with me one hour ?
watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak .
and he came again and found them sleeping , for their eyes were heavy .
and he left them again , and went away , and prayed a third time , saying again the same words .
arise , let us be going : behold , he is at hand that betrayeth me .
now he that betrayed him gave them a sign , saying , whomsoever i shall kiss , that is he : take him .
and straightway he came to jesus , and said , hail , rabbi ; and kissed him .
and jesus said unto him , friend , do that for which thou art come . then they came and laid hands on jesus , and took him .
then saith jesus unto him , put up again thy sword into its place : for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword .
or thinkest thou that i can not beseech my father , and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels ?
how then should the scriptures be fulfilled , that thus it must be ?
but all this is come to pass , that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . then all the disciples left him , and fled .
and they that had taken jesus led him away to the house of caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were gathered together .
but peter followed him afar off , unto the court of the high priest , and entered in , and sat with the officers , to see the end .
now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against jesus , that they might put him to death ;
and they found it not , though many false witnesses came . but afterward came two ,
and said , this man said , i am able to destroy the temple of god , and to build it in three days .
and the high priest stood up , and said unto him , answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
what think ye ? they answered and said , he is worthy of death .
then did they spit in his face and buffet him : and some smote him with the palms of their hands ,
saying , prophesy unto us , thou christ : who is he that struck thee ?
now peter was sitting without in the court : and a maid came unto him , saying , thou also wast with jesus the galilaean .
but he denied before them all , saying , i know not what thou sayest .
and again he denied with an oath , i know not the man .
then began he to curse and to swear , i know not the man . and straightway the cock crew .
and peter remembered the word which jesus had said , before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice . and he went out , and wept bitterly .
now when morning was come , all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against jesus to put him to death :
and they bound him , and led him away , and delivered him up to pilate the governor .
saying , i have sinned in that i betrayed innocent blood . but they said , what is that to us ? see thou to it .
and he cast down the pieces of silver into the sanctuary , and departed ; and he went away and hanged himself .
and they took counsel , and bought with them the potter ’ s field , to bury strangers in .
wherefore that field was called , the field of blood , unto this day .
and they gave them for the potter ’ s field , as the lord appointed me .
and when he was accused by the chief priests and elders , he answered nothing .
then saith pilate unto him , hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee ?
and he gave him no answer , not even to one word : insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly .
now at the feast the governor was wont to release unto the multitude one prisoner , whom they would .
and they had then a notable prisoner , called barabbas .
when therefore they were gathered together , pilate said unto them , whom will ye that i release unto you ? barabbas , or jesus who is called christ ?
for he knew that for envy they had delivered him up .
now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for barabbas , and destroy jesus .
but the governor answered and said unto them , which of the two will ye that i release unto you ? and they said , barabbas .
pilate saith unto them , what then shall i do unto jesus who is called christ ? they all say , let him be crucified .
and he said , why , what evil hath he done ? but they cried out exceedingly , saying , let him be crucified .
and all the people answered and said , his blood be on us , and on our children .
then released he unto them barabbas ; but jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified .
then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the praetorium , and gathered unto him the whole band .
and they stripped him , and put on him a scarlet robe .
and they spat upon him , and took the reed and smote him on the head .
and when they had mocked him , they took off from him the robe , and put on him his garments , and led him away to crucify him .
and when they were come unto a place called golgotha , that is to say , the place of a skull ,
they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall : and when he had tasted it , he would not drink .
and when they had crucified him , they parted his garments among them , casting lots ;
and they sat and watched him there .
and they set up over his head his accusation written , this is jesus the king of the jews .
then are there crucified with him two robbers , one on the right hand and one on the left .
and they that passed by railed on him , wagging their heads ,
in like manner also the chief priests mocking him , with the scribes and elders , said ,
he trusteth on god ; let him deliver him now , if he desireth him : for he said , i am the son of god .
and the robbers also that were crucified with him cast upon him the same reproach .
now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour .
and some of them that stood there , when they heard it , said , this man calleth elijah .
and the rest said , let be ; let us see whether elijah cometh to save him .
and jesus cried again with a loud voice , and yielded up his spirit .
and the tombs were opened ; and many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised ;
and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared unto many .
and many women were there beholding from afar , who had followed jesus from galilee , ministering unto him :
among whom was mary magdalene , and mary the mother of james and joses , and the mother of the sons of zebedee .
and when even was come , there came a rich man from arimathaea , named joseph , who also himself was jesus ’ disciple :
this man went to pilate , and asked for the body of jesus . then pilate commanded it to be given up .
and joseph took the body , and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
and mary magdalene was there , and the other mary , sitting over against the sepulchre .
now on the morrow , which is the day after the preparation , the chief priests and the pharisees were gathered together unto pilate ,
saying , sir , we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive , after three days i rise again .
pilate said unto them , ye have a guard : go , make it as sure as ye can .
so they went , and made the sepulchre sure , sealing the stone , the guard being with them .
his appearance was as lightning , and his raiment white as snow :
and for fear of him the watchers did quake , and became as dead men .
and the angel answered and said unto the women , fear not ye ; for i know that ye seek jesus , who hath been crucified .
he is not here ; for he is risen , even as he said . come , see the place where the lord lay .
and they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy , and ran to bring his disciples word .
and behold , jesus met them , saying , all hail . and they came and took hold of his feet , and worshipped him .
then saith jesus unto them , fear not : go tell my brethren that they depart into galilee , and there shall they see me .
and when they were assembled with the elders , and had taken counsel , they gave much money unto the soldiers ,
saying , say ye , his disciples came by night , and stole him away while we slept .
and if this come to the governor ’ s ears , we will persuade him , and rid you of care .
so they took the money , and did as they were taught : and this saying was spread abroad among the jews , and continueth until this day .
but the eleven disciples went into galilee , unto the mountain where jesus had appointed them .
and when they saw him , they worshipped him ; but some doubted .
and jesus came to them and spake unto them , saying , all authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth .
go ye therefore , and make disciples of all the nations , baptizing them into the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit :
teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i commanded you : and lo , i am with you always , even unto the end of the world .
for , behold , jehovah cometh forth out of his place , and will come down , and tread upon the high places of the earth .
for her wounds are incurable ; for it is come even unto judah ; it reacheth unto the gate of my people , even to jerusalem .
tell it not in gath , weep not at all : at beth-le-aphrah have i rolled myself in the dust .
for the inhabitant of maroth waiteth anxiously for good , because evil is come down from jehovah unto the gate of jerusalem .
therefore shalt thou give a parting gift to moresheth-gath : the houses of achzib shall be a deceitful thing unto the kings of israel .
i will yet bring unto thee , o inhabitant of mareshah , him that shall possess thee : the glory of israel shall come even unto adullam .
therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the line by lot in the assembly of jehovah .
prophesy ye not , thus they prophesy . they shall not prophesy to these : reproaches shall not depart .
the women of my people ye cast out from their pleasant houses ; from their young children ye take away my glory for ever .
arise ye , and depart ; for this is not your resting-place ; because of uncleanness that destroyeth , even with a grievous destruction .
ye who hate the good , and love the evil ; who pluck off their skin from off them , and their flesh from off their bones ;
they build up zion with blood , and jerusalem with iniquity .
for all the peoples walk every one in the name of his god ; and we will walk in the name of jehovah our god for ever and ever .
and now many nations are assembled against thee , that say , let her be defiled , and let our eye see our desire upon zion .
but they know not the thoughts of jehovah , neither understand they his counsel ; for he hath gathered them as the sheaves to the threshing-floor .
let thy hand be lifted up above thine adversaries , and let all thine enemies be cut off .
and i will cut off the cities of thy land , and will throw down all thy strongholds .
and i will cut off witchcrafts out of thy hand ; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers :
and i will cut off thy graven images and thy pillars out of the midst of thee ; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thy hands ;
and i will pluck up thine asherim out of the midst of thee ; and i will destroy thy cities .
and i will execute vengeance in anger and wrath upon the nations which hearkened not .
hear ye now what jehovah saith : arise , contend thou before the mountains , and let the hills hear thy voice .
o my people , what have i done unto thee ? and wherein have i wearied thee ? testify against me .
wherewith shall i come before jehovah , and bow myself before the high god ? shall i come before him with burnt-offerings , with calves a year old ?
the voice of jehovah crieth unto the city , and the man of wisdom will see thy name : hear ye the rod , and who hath appointed it .
are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked , and a scant measure that is abominable ?
shall i be pure with wicked balances , and with a bag of deceitful weights ?
for the rich men thereof are full of violence , and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies , and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth .
therefore i also have smitten thee with a grievous wound ; i have made thee desolate because of thy sins .
trust ye not in a neighbor ; put ye not confidence in a friend ; keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom .
but as for me , i will look unto jehovah ; i will wait for the god of my salvation : my god will hear me .
a day for building thy walls ! in that day shall the decree be far removed .
yet shall the land be desolate because of them that dwell therein , for the fruit of their doings .
as in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of egypt will i show unto them marvellous things .
the nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might ; they shall lay their hand upon their mouth ; their ears shall be deaf .
he will again have compassion upon us ; he will tread our iniquities under foot ; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea .
thou wilt perform the truth to jacob , and the lovingkindness to abraham , which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old .
the burden of nineveh . the book of the vision of nahum the elkoshite .
