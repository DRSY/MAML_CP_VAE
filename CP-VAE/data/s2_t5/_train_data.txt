john baptized people with water , but in a few days you will be baptized with the holy spirit . ”
the apostles were all together . they asked jesus , “ lord , is this the time for you to give the people of israel their kingdom again ? ”
jesus said to them , “ the father is the only one who has the authority to decide dates and times . they are not for you to know .
they were staring into the sky where he had gone . suddenly two men wearing white clothes were standing beside them .
then the apostles went back to jerusalem from the mount of olives . this mountain is about a half mile from jerusalem .
after a few days there was a meeting of the believers . there were about 120 of them . peter stood up and said ,
peter said , “ in the book of psalms , this is written about judas :
they put two men before the group . one was joseph barsabbas . he was also called justus . the other man was matthias .
when the day of pentecost came , they were all together in one place .
suddenly a noise came from heaven . it sounded like a strong wind blowing . this noise filled the whole house where they were sitting .
they saw something that looked like flames of fire . the flames were separated and stood over each person there .
they were all filled with the holy spirit , and they began to speak different languages . the holy spirit was giving them the power to do this .
there were some godly jews in jerusalem at this time . they were from every country in the world .
a large crowd came together because they heard the noise . they were surprised because , as the apostles were speaking , everyone heard in their own language .
but we hear them in our own languages . how is this possible ? we are from all these different places :
parthia , media , elam , mesopotamia , judea , cappadocia , pontus , asia ,
phrygia , pamphylia , egypt , the areas of libya near the city of cyrene , rome ,
the people were all amazed and confused . they asked each other , “ what is happening ? ”
but others were laughing at the apostles , saying they were drunk from too much wine .
these men are not drunk as you think ; it ’ s only nine o ’ clock in the morning .
but joel the prophet wrote about what you see happening here today . this is what he wrote :
‘ god says : in the last days
in those days i will pour out my spirit
i will work wonders in the sky above .
the sun will be changed into darkness ,
and everyone who trusts in the lord will be saved . ’
jesus suffered the pain of death , but god made him free . he raised him from death . there was no way for death to hold him .
david said this about him :
so my heart is happy ,
because you will not leave me in the place of death .
you taught me how to live .
david knew this before it happened . that is why he said this about that future king :
so jesus is the one god raised from death . we are all witnesses of this . we saw him .
david was not the one who was lifted up to heaven . david himself said ,
until i put your enemies under your power . ’
when the people heard this , they felt very , very sorry . they asked peter and the other apostles , “ brothers , what should we do ? ”
peter warned them with many other words ; he begged them , “ save yourselves from the evil of the people who live now ! ”
then those who accepted what peter said were baptized . on that day about 3000 people were added to the group of believers .
the believers spent their time listening to the teaching of the apostles . they shared everything with each other . they ate together and prayed together .
many wonders and miraculous signs were happening through the apostles , and everyone felt great respect for god .
all the believers stayed together and shared everything .
they sold their land and the things they owned . then they divided the money and gave it to those who needed it .
that day he saw peter and john going into the temple area . he asked them for money .
peter and john looked at the crippled man and said , “ look at us ! ”
he looked at them ; he thought they would give him some money .
then peter took the man ’ s right hand and lifted him up . immediately his feet and legs became strong .
the man was holding on to peter and john . all the people were amazed . they ran to peter and john at solomon ’ s porch .
jesus was holy and good , but you said you did not want him . you told pilate to give you a murderer instead of jesus .
and so you killed the one who gives life ! but god raised him from death . we are witnesses of this—we saw it with our own eyes .
so you must change your hearts and lives . come back to god , and he will forgive your sins .
then the lord will give you times of spiritual rest . he will send you jesus , the one he chose to be the messiah .
and anyone who refuses to obey that prophet will die , separated from god ’ s people . ’
“ samuel , and all the other prophets who spoke for god after samuel , said that this time would come .
the jewish leaders arrested peter and john and put them in jail . it was already night , so they kept them in jail until the next day .
but many of the people who heard the apostles believed what they said . there were now about 5000 men in the group of believers .
the next day the jewish rulers , the older jewish leaders , and the teachers of the law met in jerusalem .
annas the high priest , caiaphas , john , and alexander were there . everyone from the high priest ’ s family was there .
then peter was filled with the holy spirit and said to them , “ rulers of the people and you older leaders ,
are you questioning us today about what we did to help this crippled man ? are you asking us what made him well ?
they saw the crippled man standing there beside the apostles . they saw that he was healed , so they could say nothing against the apostles .
the jewish leaders told them to leave the council meeting . then the leaders talked to each other about what they should do .
but we must make them afraid to talk to anyone again using that name . then this problem will not spread among the people . ”
so the jewish leaders called peter and john in again . they told the apostles not to say anything or to teach anything in the name of jesus .
but peter and john answered them , “ what do you think is right ? what would god want ? should we obey you or god ?
we can not be quiet . we must tell people about what we have seen and heard . ”
our ancestor david was your servant . with the help of the holy spirit he wrote these words :
‘ the kings of the earth prepare themselves to fight ,
these people who came together against jesus made your plan happen . it was done because of your power and your will .
with great power the apostles were making it known to everyone that the lord jesus was raised from death . and god blessed all the believers very much .
none of them could say they needed anything . everyone who owned fields or houses sold them . they brought the money they got
and gave it to the apostles . then everyone was given whatever they needed .
joseph sold a field he owned . he brought the money and gave it to the apostles .
there was a man named ananias . his wife ’ s name was sapphira . ananias sold some land he had ,
about three hours later his wife came in . sapphira did not know about what had happened to her husband .
peter said to her , “ tell me how much money you got for your field . was it this much ? ”
the whole church and all the other people who heard about this were filled with fear .
none of the other people dared to stand with the apostles , but everyone was saying wonderful things about them .
more and more people believed in the lord , and many men and women were added to the group of believers .
people came from all the towns around jerusalem . they brought those who were sick or troubled by evil spirits . all of them were healed .
the high priest and all his friends , a group called the sadducees , became very jealous .
they grabbed the apostles and put them in jail .
but during the night , an angel of the lord opened the doors of the jail . the angel led the apostles outside and said ,
“ go and stand in the temple area . tell the people everything about this new life . ”
when the apostles heard this , they did what they were told . they went into the temple area about sunrise and began to teach the people .
when the men went to the jail , they could not find the apostles there . so they went back and told the jewish leaders about this .
the captain of the temple guards and the leading priests heard this . they were confused and wondered what it all meant .
then another man came and told them , “ listen ! the men you put in jail are standing in the temple area teaching the people . ”
the soldiers brought the apostles in and made them stand before the council . the high priest questioned them .
peter and the other apostles answered , “ we must obey god , not you !
you killed jesus by nailing him to a cross . but god , the same god our fathers had , raised jesus up from death .
when the council members heard this , they became very angry . they began to plan a way to kill the apostles .
then he said to them , “ men of israel , be careful of what you are planning to do to these men .
and so now i tell you , stay away from these men . leave them alone . if their plan is something they thought up , it will fail .
but if it is from god , you will not be able to stop them . you might even be fighting against god himself ! ”
they called the apostles in again . they beat them and told them not to speak anymore using the name of jesus . then they let them go free .
the apostles left the council meeting . they were happy because they were given the honor of suffering dishonor for jesus .
the twelve apostles called the whole group of followers together .
then we can use all our time to pray and to teach the word of god . ”
then they put these men before the apostles , who prayed and laid their hands on them .
stephen received a great blessing . god gave him power to do great wonders and miraculous signs among the people .
but the spirit was helping him speak with wisdom . his words were so strong that these jews could not argue with him .
so they told some men to say , “ we heard stephen say bad things against moses and against god ! ”
we heard him say that jesus from nazareth will destroy this place and change what moses told us to do . ”
everyone there in the council meeting was staring at stephen . they saw that his face looked like the face of an angel .
the high priest said to stephen , “ is all this true ? ”
god said to him , ‘ leave your country and your people , and go to the country i will show you . ’
“ these ancestors of ours became jealous of their brother joseph and sold him to be a slave in egypt . but god was with him
“ but jacob heard that there was food in egypt . so he sent our people there . this was their first trip to egypt .
then they went there a second time . this time joseph told his brothers who he was . and pharaoh learned about joseph ’ s family .
then joseph sent some men to tell jacob , his father , to come to egypt . he also invited all his relatives , a total of 75 people .
so jacob went down to egypt . he and our other ancestors lived there until they died .
then a different king began to rule egypt , one who knew nothing about joseph .
this king tricked our people . he treated them badly , making them leave their children outside to die .
“ this was the time when moses was born . he was a very beautiful child , and for three months his parents took care of him at home .
when they put him outside , pharaoh ’ s daughter took him . she raised him as her own son .
the egyptians taught moses everything they knew . he was powerful in all he said and did .
“ when moses was about 40 years old , he decided to visit his own people , the people of israel .
moses thought that his people would understand that god was using him to save them . but they did not understand .
the man who was hurting the other one pushed moses away and said to him , ‘ did anyone say you could be our ruler and judge ?
will you kill me just as you killed that egyptian yesterday ? ’
“ forty years later moses was in the desert near mount sinai . an angel appeared to him in the flame of a burning bush .
when moses saw this , he was amazed . he went near to look closer at it . he heard a voice ; it was the lord ’ s .
“ the lord said to him , ‘ take off your sandals , because the place where you are now standing is holy ground .
“ but our ancestors did not want to obey moses . they rejected him . they wanted to go back to egypt again .
you carried with you the tent for worshiping moloch
god was very pleased with david . he asked god to let him build a temple for the people of jacob .
but solomon was the one who built the temple .
“ but the most high god does not live in houses built by human hands . this is what the prophet writes :
‘ the lord says , heaven is my throne ,
remember , i made all these things ! ’ ”
you are the people who received god ’ s law , which he gave you through his angels . but you don ’ t obey it ! ”
when those in the council meeting heard this , they became very angry . they were so mad they were grinding their teeth at him .
stephen said , “ look ! i see heaven open . and i see the son of man standing at god ’ s right side . ”
everyone there started shouting loudly , covering their ears with their hands . together they all ran at stephen .
as they were throwing the stones at him , stephen was praying . he said , “ lord jesus , receive my spirit ! ”
he fell on his knees and shouted , “ lord , don ’ t blame them for this sin ! ” these were his last words before he died .
saul agreed that the killing of stephen was a good thing . some godly men buried stephen and cried loudly for him .
they were scattered everywhere , and in every place they went , they told people the good news .
philip went to the city of samaria and told people about the messiah .
the people there heard philip and saw the miraculous signs he was doing . they all listened carefully to what he said .
what a happy day this was for that city !
simon amazed the people with his magic for so long that the people became his followers .
but philip told the people the good news about god ’ s kingdom and the power of jesus christ . men and women believed philip and were baptized .
the apostles in jerusalem heard that the people of samaria had accepted the word of god . so they sent peter and john to the people in samaria .
when peter and john arrived , they prayed for the samaritan believers to receive the holy spirit .
when the two apostles laid their hands on the people , they received the holy spirit .
simon saw that the spirit was given to people when the apostles laid their hands on them . so he offered the apostles money .
he said , “ give me this power so that when i lay my hands on someone , they will receive the holy spirit . ”
peter said to simon , “ you and your money should both be destroyed because you thought you could buy god ’ s gift with money .
you can not share with us in this work . your heart is not right before god .
change your heart ! turn away from these evil thoughts and pray to the lord . maybe he will forgive you .
i see that you are full of bitter jealousy and can not stop yourself from doing wrong . ”
simon answered , “ both of you pray to the lord for me , so that what you have said will not happen to me . ”
now he was on his way home . he was sitting in his chariot reading from the book of isaiah the prophet .
the spirit said to philip , “ go to that chariot and stay near it . ”
the part of the scriptures that he was reading was this :
he was shamed , and all his rights were taken away .
the official said to philip , “ please , tell me , who is the prophet talking about ? is he talking about himself or about someone else ? ”
philip began to speak . he started with this same scripture and told the man the good news about jesus .
then the official ordered the chariot to stop . both philip and the official went down into the water , and philip baptized him .
in jerusalem saul was still trying to scare the followers of the lord , even saying he would kill them . he went to the high priest
so saul went to damascus . when he came near the city , a very bright light from heaven suddenly shined around him .
he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him , “ saul , saul ! why are you persecuting me ? ”
saul said , “ who are you , lord ? ”
get up now and go into the city . someone there will tell you what you must do . ”
the men traveling with saul just stood there , unable to speak . they heard the voice , but they saw no one .
for three days , saul could not see ; he did not eat or drink .
there was a follower of jesus in damascus named ananias . in a vision the lord said to him , “ ananias ! ”
he has seen a vision in which a man named ananias came and laid his hands on him so that he could see again . ”
now he has come here to damascus . the leading priests have given him the power to arrest all people who trust in you . ”
i will show him all that he must suffer for me . ”
immediately , something that looked like fish scales fell off saul ’ s eyes . he was able to see ! then he got up and was baptized .
after he ate , he began to feel strong again .
soon he began to go to the synagogues and tell people about jesus . he told the people , “ jesus is the son of god ! ”
after many days , some jews made plans to kill saul .
they were watching the city gates day and night . they wanted to kill saul , but he learned about their plan .
and so saul stayed with the followers and went all around jerusalem speaking boldly for the lord .
he often had arguments with the greek-speaking jews , who began making plans to kill him .
when the believers learned about this , they took saul to caesarea , and from there they sent him to the city of tarsus .
peter was traveling through all the areas around jerusalem , and he stopped to visit the believers who lived in lydda .
there he met a man named aeneas , who was paralyzed and had not been able to get out of bed for the past eight years .
peter said to him , “ aeneas , jesus christ heals you . get up and make your bed ! ” he stood up immediately .
all the people living in lydda and on the plain of sharon saw him , and they decided to follow the lord .
while peter was in lydda , tabitha became sick and died . they washed her body and put it in an upstairs room .
people everywhere in joppa learned about this , and many believed in the lord .
peter stayed in joppa for many days at the home of a man named simon , who was a leatherworker .
in the city of caesarea there was a man named cornelius , a roman army officer in what was called the italian unit .
one afternoon about three o ’ clock , cornelius had a vision . he clearly saw an angel from god coming to him and saying , “ cornelius ! ”
staring at the angel and feeling afraid , cornelius said , “ what do you want , sir ? ”
send some men now to the city of joppa to get a man named simon , who is also called peter .
he is staying with someone also named simon , a leatherworker who has a house beside the sea . ”
cornelius explained everything to these three men and sent them to joppa .
the next day they were coming near joppa about noon , when peter was going up to the roof to pray .
he was hungry and wanted to eat . but while they were preparing the food for peter to eat , he had a vision .
he saw something coming down through the open sky . it looked like a big sheet being lowered to the ground by its four corners .
in it were all kinds of animals , reptiles , and birds .
then a voice said to him , “ get up , peter ; kill anything here and eat it . ”
but the voice said to him again , “ god has made these things pure . don ’ t say they are unfit to eat . ”
this happened three times . then the whole thing was taken back up into heaven .
peter wondered what this vision meant .
they asked , “ is simon peter staying here ? ”
while peter was still thinking about the vision , the spirit said to him , “ listen , three men are looking for you .
get up and go downstairs . go with these men without wondering if it ’ s all right , because i sent them . ”
so peter went downstairs and said to them , “ i think i ’ m the man you are looking for . why did you come here ? ”
peter asked the men to come in and stay for the night .
the next day they came to the city of caesarea . cornelius was waiting for them and had already gathered his relatives and close friends at his house .
when peter entered the house , cornelius met him . he fell down at peter ’ s feet and worshiped him .
but peter told him to get up . peter said , “ stand up ! i am only a man like you . ”
peter continued talking with cornelius . then peter went inside and saw a large group of people gathered there .
that ’ s why i didn ’ t argue when your men asked me to come here . now , please tell me why you sent for me . ”
he said , ‘ cornelius , god has heard your prayer and has seen your gifts to the poor . he remembers you and all you have done .
peter began to speak : “ i really understand now that god does not consider some people to be better than others .
he accepts anyone who worships him and does what is right . it is not important what nation they come from .
god has spoken to the people of israel . he sent them the good news that peace has come through jesus christ , the lord of all people .
“ you know what has happened all over judea . it began in galilee after john told the people they needed to be baptized .
“ we saw all that jesus did in judea and in jerusalem . but he was killed . they put him on a cross made of wood .
but on the third day after his death , god raised him to life and let him be seen openly .
everyone who believes in jesus will have their sins forgiven through his name . all the prophets agree that this is true . ”
while peter was still speaking these words , the holy spirit came down on all those who were listening to his speech .
the jewish believers who came with peter were amazed that the holy spirit had been poured out as a gift also to people who were not jews .
they heard them speaking different languages and praising god . then peter said ,
“ how can anyone object to these people being baptized in water ? they have received the holy spirit the same as we did ! ”
the apostles and the believers in judea heard that non-jewish people had accepted god ’ s teaching too .
but when peter came to jerusalem , some jewish believers argued with him .
they said , “ you went into the homes of people who are not jews and are not circumcised , and you even ate with them ! ”
so peter explained the whole story to them .
and i looked inside . i saw all kinds of animals , including wild ones , as well as reptiles and birds .
i heard a voice say to me , ‘ get up , peter . kill anything here and eat it ! ’
“ but the voice from heaven answered again , ‘ god has made these things pure . don ’ t say they are unfit to eat ! ’
“ this happened three times . then the whole thing was taken back into heaven .
suddenly there were three men standing outside the house where i was staying . they had been sent from caesarea to get me .
he will speak to you , and what he tells you will save you and everyone living in your house . ’
“ after i began speaking , the holy spirit came on them just as he came on us at the beginning .
then i remembered the words of the lord jesus : ‘ john baptized people in water , but you will be baptized in the holy spirit . ’
the lord was helping these men , and a large number of people believed and decided to follow the lord .
when the church in jerusalem heard about this , they sent barnabas to antioch .
then barnabas went to the city of tarsus to look for saul .
about that same time some prophets went from jerusalem to antioch .
the lord ’ s followers decided that they would each send as much as they could to help their brothers and sisters who lived in judea .
they gathered the money and gave it to barnabas and saul , who took it to the elders in judea .
during this same time , king herod began to do harm to some of those who were part of the church .
he ordered james , the brother of john , to be killed with a sword .
herod saw that many of the jews liked this , so he decided to arrest peter too . this happened during the festival of unleavened bread .
so peter was kept in jail , but the church was constantly praying to god for him .
so the angel went out and peter followed . he did not know if the angel was really doing this . he thought he might be seeing a vision .
peter knocked on the outside door . a servant girl named rhoda came to answer it .
but peter continued to knock . when the believers opened the door , they saw him . they were amazed .
the next day the soldiers were very upset . they wondered what happened to peter .
herod looked everywhere for him but could not find him . so he questioned the guards and then ordered that they be killed .
the people shouted , “ this is the voice of a god , not a man ! ”
the message of god was spreading , reaching more and more people .
after barnabas and saul finished their work in jerusalem , they returned to antioch , taking john mark with them .
so the church fasted and prayed . they laid their hands on barnabas and saul and sent them out .
barnabas and saul were sent out by the holy spirit . they went to the city of seleucia . then they sailed from there to the island of cyprus .
when barnabas and saul came to the city of salamis , they told the message of god in the jewish synagogues . john mark was with them to help .
they went across the whole island to the city of paphos . there they met a jewish man named barjesus who did magic . he was a false prophet .
but the magician elymas ( as barjesus was called in greek ) spoke against them , trying to stop the governor from believing in jesus .
but saul ( also known as paul ) , filled with the holy spirit , looked hard at elymas
when the governor saw this , he believed . he was amazed at the teaching about the lord .
they continued their trip from perga and went to antioch , a city near pisidia .
and he was patient with them for 40 years in the desert .
god destroyed seven nations in the land of canaan and gave their land to his people .
all this happened in about 450 years .
“ as he promised , god has brought one of david ’ s descendants to israel to be their savior . that descendant is jesus .
they could not find any real reason why jesus should die , but they asked pilate to kill him .
but god raised him up from death !
after this , for many days , those who had gone with jesus from galilee to jerusalem saw him . they are now his witnesses to our people .
“ we tell you the good news about the promise god made to our ancestors .
god raised jesus from death . jesus will never go back to the grave and become dust . so god said ,
but in another psalm it says ,
but the one god raised from death did not rot in the grave .
so be careful ! don ’ t let what the prophets said happen to you :
‘ listen , you people who doubt !
as paul and barnabas were leaving the synagogue , the people asked them to come again on the next sabbath day and tell them more about these things .
on the next sabbath day , almost all the people in the city came together to hear the word of the lord .
when the jews there saw all these people , they became very jealous . shouting insults , they argued against everything paul said .
this is what the lord told us to do :
and so the message of the lord was being told throughout the whole country .
so paul and barnabas shook the dust off their feet . then they went to the city of iconium .
but the lord ’ s followers in antioch were happy and filled with the holy spirit .
but some of the jews did not believe . they said things that caused the non-jewish people to be angry and turn against the believers .
when paul and barnabas learned about this , they left the city . they went to lystra and derbe , cities in lycaonia , and to the surrounding areas .
they told the good news there too .
in lystra there was a man who had something wrong with his feet . he had been born crippled and had never walked .
he was sitting and listening to paul speak . paul looked straight at him and saw that the man believed god could heal him .
so paul shouted , “ stand up on your feet ! ” the man jumped up and began walking around .
the people began to call barnabas “ zeus , ” and they called paul “ hermes , ” because he was the main speaker .
“ in the past god let all the nations do what they wanted .
even after saying all this , paul and barnabas still could hardly stop the people from offering sacrifices to them .
paul and barnabas went through the country of pisidia . then they came to the country of pamphylia .
they told people the message of god in the city of perga , and then they went down to the city of attalia .
and they stayed there a long time with the lord ’ s followers .
then the apostles and the elders gathered to study this problem .
to god , those people are not different from us . when they believed , god made their hearts pure .
no , we believe that we and these people will be saved the same way—by the grace of the lord jesus . ”
when they finished speaking , james said , “ my brothers , listen to me .
simon peter has told us how god showed his love for the non-jewish people . for the first time , god accepted them and made them his people .
the words of the prophets agree with this too :
‘ i will return after this .
then the rest of the world will look for the lord god—
‘ all this has been known from the beginning of time . ’
“ so i think we should not make things hard for those who have turned to god from among the non-jewish people .
instead , we should send a letter telling them only the things they should not do :
the group sent the letter with these men . the letter said :
we have all agreed to choose some men and send them to you . they will be with our dear friends , barnabas and paul .
barnabas and paul have given their lives to serve our lord jesus christ .
so we have sent judas and silas with them . they will tell you the same things .
we agree with the holy spirit that you should have no more burdens , except for these necessary things :
don ’ t eat food that has been given to idols .
so paul , barnabas , judas , and silas left jerusalem and went to antioch . there they gathered the group of believers together and gave them the letter .
when the believers read it , they were happy . the letter comforted them .
judas and silas , who were also prophets , said many things to encourage the believers and make them stronger in their faith .
but paul and barnabas stayed in antioch . they and many others taught the believers and told other people the good news about the lord .
barnabas wanted to bring john mark with them too .
paul chose silas to go with him . the believers in antioch put paul into the lord ’ s care and sent him out .
paul and silas went through the countries of syria and cilicia , helping the churches grow stronger .
the believers in the cities of lystra and iconium had only good things to say about him .
so the churches were becoming stronger in their faith , and the number of believers was growing every day .
when they reached the border of mysia , they tried to go on into bithynia , but the spirit of jesus did not let them go there .
so they passed by mysia and went to the city of troas .
we left troas in a ship and sailed to the island of samothrace . the next day we sailed to the city of neapolis .
then we went to philippi , a roman colony and the leading city in that part of macedonia . we stayed there for a few days .
they brought paul and silas before the roman officials and said , “ these men are jews , and they are making trouble in our city .
they are telling people to do things that are not right for us as romans to do . ”
the whole crowd turned against paul and silas . the officials tore the clothes off both men and ordered that they be beaten with rods .
they were beaten severely and thrown into jail . the officials told the jailer , “ guard them very carefully ! ”
when the jailer heard this special order , he put paul and silas far inside the jail and bound their feet between large blocks of wood .
about midnight paul and silas were praying and singing songs to god . the other prisoners were listening to them .
but paul shouted , “ don ’ t hurt yourself ! we are all here ! ”
the jailer told someone to bring a light . then he ran inside and , shaking with fear , fell down in front of paul and silas .
then he brought them outside and said , “ men , what must i do to be saved ? ”
they said to him , “ believe in the lord jesus and you will be saved—you and all who live in your house . ”
so paul and silas told the message of the lord to the jailer and all the people who lived in his house .
it was late at night , but the jailer took paul and silas and washed their wounds . then the jailer and all his people were baptized .
after this the jailer took paul and silas home and gave them some food . all the people were very happy because they now believed in god .
the next morning the roman officials sent some soldiers to tell the jailer , “ let these men go free . ”
the jailer said to paul , “ the officials have sent these soldiers to let you go free . you can leave now . go in peace . ”
the soldiers told the officials what paul said . when they heard that paul and silas were roman citizens , they were afraid .
so they came and told them they were sorry . they led them out of the jail and asked them to leave the city .
paul and silas traveled through the cities of amphipolis and apollonia . they came to the city of thessalonica , where there was a jewish synagogue .
jason is keeping them in his house . they all do things against the laws of caesar . they say there is another king called jesus . ”
when the city leaders and the other people heard this , they became very upset .
they made jason and the other believers deposit money to guarantee that there would be no more trouble . then they let them go .
that same night the believers sent paul and silas to another city named berea . when they arrived there , they went to the jewish synagogue .
the result was that many of them believed , including many important greek women and men .
so the believers immediately sent paul away to the coast , but silas and timothy stayed in berea .
while paul was waiting for silas and timothy in athens , he was upset because he saw that the city was full of idols .
some of the epicurean and some of the stoic philosophers argued with him .
they took paul to a meeting of the areopagus council . they said , “ please explain to us this new idea that you have been teaching .
the things you are saying are new to us . we have never heard this teaching before , and we want to know what it means . ”
( the people of athens and the foreigners who lived there spent all their time either telling or listening to all the latest ideas . )
then paul stood up before the meeting of the areopagus council and said , “ men of athens , everything i see here tells me you are very religious .
in the past people did not understand god , and he overlooked this . but now he is telling everyone in the world to change and turn to him .
so paul left the council meeting .
later , paul left athens and went to the city of corinth .
they were tentmakers , the same as paul , so he stayed with them and worked with them .
every sabbath day paul went to the synagogue and talked with both jews and greeks , trying to persuade them to believe in jesus .
i am with you , and no one will be able to hurt you . many of my people are in this city . ”
paul stayed there for a year and a half teaching god ’ s message to the people .
during the time that gallio was the governor of achaia , some of the jews came together against paul . they took him to court .
they said to gallio , “ this man is teaching people to worship god in a way that is against our law ! ”
so gallio made them leave the court .
then they all grabbed sosthenes , the leader of the synagogue . they beat him before the court . but this did not bother gallio .
they asked him to stay longer , but he refused .
he left them and said , “ i will come back to you again if god wants me to. ” and so he sailed away from ephesus .
when paul arrived at caesarea , he went to jerusalem and visited the church there . after that he went to antioch .
a jew named apollos came to ephesus . born in the city of alexandria , he was an educated man who knew the scriptures well .
he asked them , “ did you receive the holy spirit when you believed ? ”
paul asked them , “ so what kind of baptism did you have ? ”
when these followers heard this , they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus .
then paul laid his hands on them , and the holy spirit came on them . they began speaking different languages and prophesying .
there were about twelve men in this group .
he did this for two years . because of this work , everyone in asia , jews and greeks , heard the word of the lord .
god used paul to do some very special miracles .
but one time an evil spirit said to these jews , “ i know jesus , and i know about paul , but who are you ? ”
all the people in ephesus , jews and greeks , learned about this . they were all filled with fear and gave great honor to the lord jesus .
many of the believers began to confess , telling about all the evil things they had done .
some of them had used magic . these believers brought their magic books and burned them before everyone . these books were worth about 50,000 silver coins .
this is how the word of the lord was spreading in a powerful way , causing more and more people to believe .
timothy and erastus were two of his helpers . paul sent them ahead to macedonia . but he stayed in asia for a while .
but during that time there was some trouble in ephesus about the way . this is how it all happened :
when the men heard this , they became very angry . they shouted , “ great is artemis , the goddess of ephesus ! ”
paul wanted to go in and talk to the people , but the lord ’ s followers did not let him go .
also , some leaders of the country who were friends of paul sent him a message telling him not to go into the stadium .
no one can deny this , so you should be quiet . you must stop and think before you do anything else .
“ you brought these men here , but they have not said anything bad against our goddess . they have not stolen anything from her temple .
“ is there something else you want to talk about ? then come to the regular town meeting of the people . it can be decided there .
after the city clerk said this , he told the people to go home .
when the trouble stopped , paul invited the lord ’ s followers to come visit him . after encouraging them , he told them goodbye and left for macedonia .
on his way through macedonia he had many words of encouragement for the followers in various places . then he went to greece
and stayed there three months .
these men went first , ahead of paul . they waited for us in the city of troas .
we sailed from the city of philippi after the festival of unleavened bread . we met these men in troas five days later and stayed there seven days .
we were all together in a room upstairs , and there were many lights in the room .
the lord ’ s followers took eutychus home alive , and they were all greatly comforted .
when he caught up with us at assos , we took him on board , and we all sailed to mitylene .
in miletus paul sent a message back to ephesus , telling the elders of the church in ephesus to come to him .
i always did what was best for you . i told you the good news about jesus in public before the people and also taught in your homes .
i told everyone—jewish and non-jewish people—to change and turn to god . i told them all to believe in our lord jesus .
“ but now i must obey the spirit and go to jerusalem . i don ’ t know what will happen to me there .
i know only that in every city the holy spirit tells me that troubles and even jail wait for me .
so today i can tell you one thing that i am sure of : god will not blame me if some of you are not saved .
i can say this because i know that i told you everything that god wants you to know .
i know that after i leave , some men will come into your group . they will be like wild wolves and will try to destroy the flock .
when i was with you , i never wanted anyone ’ s money or fine clothes .
you know that i always worked to take care of my own needs and the needs of the people who were with me .
when paul finished speaking , he knelt down , and they all prayed together .
there we found a ship that was going to the area of phoenicia . we got on the ship and sailed away .
and said goodbye . then we got on the ship , and the followers went home .
we continued our trip from tyre and went to the city of ptolemais . we greeted the believers there and stayed with them one day .
he had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophesying .
after we had been there for several days , a prophet named agabus came from judea .
when we heard this , we and the other followers there begged paul not to go to jerusalem .
after this , we got ready and left for jerusalem .
the brothers and sisters in jerusalem were very happy to see us .
the next day paul went with us to visit james , and all the elders were there .
after greeting them , paul told them point by point all that god had used him to do among the non-jewish people .
“ what should we do ? the jewish believers here will learn that you have come .
so we will tell you what to do : four of our men have made a vow to god .
“ in regard to the non-jewish believers , we have already sent a letter to them saying what we think they should do :
while they were trying to kill paul , the commander of the roman army in jerusalem got word that the whole city was in a state of riot .
when the soldiers were ready to take paul into the army building , he asked the commander , “ can i say something to you ? ”
paul said , “ my brothers and fathers , listen to me ! i will make my defense to you . ”
when the jews heard paul speaking aramaic , they became very quiet . then paul said ,
i persecuted the people who followed the way . some of them were killed because of me . i arrested men and women and put them in jail .
i fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me , ‘ saul , saul , why are you persecuting me ? ’
“ i asked , ‘ who are you , lord ? ’ the voice said , ‘ i am jesus from nazareth , the one you are persecuting . ’
the men who were with me did not understand the voice , but they saw the light .
i could not see , because the bright light had made me blind . so the men led me into damascus .
he came to me and said , ‘ saul , my brother , look up and see again ! ’ immediately i was able to see him .
you will be his witness to all people . you will tell them what you have seen and heard .
now , don ’ t wait any longer . get up , be baptized and wash away your sins , trusting in jesus to save you . ’
“ later , i came back to jerusalem . i was praying in the temple area , and i saw a vision .
“ but jesus said to me , ‘ leave now . i will send you far away to the non-jewish people . ’ ”
they kept on shouting , ripping off their clothes and throwing dust into the air .
the commander came to paul and said , “ tell me , are you really a roman citizen ? ”
the commander said , “ i paid a lot of money to become a roman citizen . ”
ananias , the high priest , was there . when he heard this , he told the men who were standing near paul to hit him in the mouth .
the men standing near paul said to him , “ are you sure you want to insult god ’ s high priest like that ? ”
when paul said this , a big argument started between the pharisees and the sadducees . the group was divided .
( the sadducees believe that after people die , they will not live again as an angel or as a spirit . but the pharisees believe in both . )
there were more than 40 of them who made this plan .
but paul ’ s nephew heard about this plan . he went to the army building and told paul .
then paul called one of the army officers and said to him , “ take this young man to the commander . he has a message for him . ”
the commander led the young man to a place where they could be alone . the commander asked , “ what do you want to tell me ? ”
the commander sent the young man away , telling him , “ don ’ t tell anyone that you have told me about their plan . ”
get some horses for paul to ride so that he can be taken to governor felix safely . ”
the commander wrote a letter that said :
i wanted to know why they were accusing him . so i brought him before their council meeting .
the soldiers did what they were told . they got paul and took him to the city of antipatris that night .
the next day the soldiers on horses went with paul to caesarea , but the other soldiers and the spearmen went back to the army building in jerusalem .
the soldiers on horses entered caesarea , gave the letter to governor felix , and then turned paul over to him .
the governor read the letter and asked paul , “ what country are you from ? ” the governor learned that paul was from cilicia .
paul was called into the meeting , and tertullus began to make his accusations .
but i don ’ t want to take any more of your time . so i will say only a few words . please be patient .
this man is a troublemaker . he causes trouble with the jews everywhere in the world . he is a leader of the nazarene group .
the other jews agreed and said it was all true .
i went to worship in jerusalem only twelve days ago . you can learn for yourself that this is true .
these men can not prove the things they are saying against me now .
i have the same hope in god that these jews have—the hope that all people , good and bad , will be raised from death .
this is why i always try to do what i believe is right before god and before everyone .
ask these men here if they found any wrong in me when i stood before the high council meeting in jerusalem .
felix told the army officer to keep paul guarded but to give him some freedom and to let his friends bring whatever he needed .
but felix had another reason for talking with paul . he hoped paul would pay him a bribe , so he sent for paul often and talked with him .
but after two years , porcius festus became governor . so felix was no longer governor . but he left paul in prison to please the jews .
festus became governor , and three days later he went from caesarea to jerusalem .
the leading priests and the important jewish leaders made charges against paul before festus .
they asked festus to do them a favor . they wanted him to send paul back to jerusalem because they had a plan to kill paul on the way .
but festus answered , “ no , paul will be kept in caesarea . i will be going there soon myself ,
and your leaders can go with me . if this man has really done anything wrong , they can accuse him there . ”
paul defended himself , saying , “ i have done nothing wrong against the jewish law , against the temple , or against caesar . ”
festus talked about this with his advisors . then he said , “ you have asked to see caesar , so you will go to caesar ! ”
a few days later king agrippa and bernice came to caesarea to visit festus .
when i went to jerusalem , the leading priests and the older jewish leaders there made charges against him . they wanted me to order his death .
the jews stood up and accused him . but they did not accuse him of the kind of crimes i thought they would .
their charges were all about their own religion and about a man named jesus . jesus died , but paul said that he is still alive .
agrippa said to festus , “ i would like to hear this man too . ”
i think it is foolish to send a prisoner to caesar without making some charges against him . ”
agrippa said to paul , “ you may now speak to defend yourself. ” paul raised his hand to get their attention and began to speak .
he said , “ king agrippa , i feel fortunate that i can stand here before you today and answer all the charges these jews have made against me .
“ all the jews know about my whole life . they know the way i lived from the beginning in my own country and later in jerusalem .
now i am on trial because i hope for the promise that god made to our fathers .
why do you people think it is impossible for god to raise people from death ?
“ i used to think that i should do everything i could against jesus from nazareth .
“ one time the leading priests gave me permission and the authority to go to the city of damascus .
“ i said , ‘ who are you , lord ? ’
i will keep you safe from your own people and from the non-jewish people , the ones i am sending you to .
paul continued speaking : “ king agrippa , after i had this vision from heaven , i obeyed it .
“ this is why the jews grabbed me and were trying to kill me at the temple .
while paul was still defending himself , festus shouted , “ paul , you are out of your mind ! too much study has made you crazy . ”
paul said , “ most honorable festus , i am not crazy . what i am saying is true . it all makes perfect sense .
king agrippa , do you believe what the prophets wrote ? i know you believe ! ”
king agrippa said to paul , “ do you think you can persuade me to become a ‘ christ-follower ’ so easily ? ”
king agrippa , governor festus , bernice , and all the people sitting with them stood up
and agrippa said to festus , “ we could let him go free , but he has asked to see caesar . ”
we left that city and sailed close to the island of cyprus because the wind was blowing against us .
we went across the sea by cilicia and pamphylia . then we came to the city of myra in lycia .
there the army officer found a ship from the city of alexandria that was going to italy . so he put us on it .
we sailed along the coast , but the sailing was hard . then we came to a place called safe harbors , near the city of lasea .
we had lost much time , and it was now dangerous to sail , because it was already after the jewish day of fasting . so paul warned them ,
but the captain and the owner of the ship did not agree with paul . so the army officer accepted what they said instead of believing paul .
but then a very strong wind called the “ northeaster ” came from across the island .
this wind took the ship and carried it away . the ship could not sail against the wind , so we stopped trying and let the wind blow us .
the next day the storm was blowing against us so hard that the men threw some things out of the ship .
a day later they threw out the ship ’ s equipment .
but now i tell you to be happy . none of you will die , but the ship will be lost .
last night an angel came to me from god—the god i worship and belong to .
so men , there is nothing to worry about . i trust god , and i am sure everything will happen just as his angel told me .
but we will crash on an island . ”
on the fourteenth night we were still being blown around in the adriatic sea . the sailors thought we were close to land .
the sailors were afraid that we would hit the rocks , so they threw four anchors into the water . then they prayed for daylight to come .
so the soldiers cut the ropes and let the lifeboat fall into the water .
now i beg you to eat something . you need it to stay alive . none of you will lose even one hair off your heads . ”
after he said this , paul took some bread and thanked god for it before all of them . he broke off a piece and began eating .
all the men felt better and started eating too .
( there were 276 people on the ship . )
we ate all we wanted . then we began making the ship lighter by throwing the grain into the sea .
the soldiers decided to kill the prisoners so that none of the prisoners could swim away and escape .
the others used wooden boards or pieces of the ship . and this is how all the people went safely to land .
when we were safe on land , we learned that the island was called malta .
the people who lived there were very good to us . it was raining and very cold , so they built a fire and welcomed all of us .
but paul shook the snake off into the fire and was not hurt .
after this happened , all the other sick people on the island came to paul , and he healed them too .
we stopped at the city of syracuse . we stayed there three days and then left .
we found some believers there , who asked us to stay with them a week . finally , we came to rome .
when we came to rome , paul was allowed to live alone . but a soldier stayed with him to guard him .
they asked me many questions , but they could not find any reason why i should be put to death . so they wanted to let me go free .
that is why i wanted to see you and talk with you . i am bound with this chain because i believe in the hope of israel . ”
we want to hear your ideas . we know that people everywhere are speaking against this new group . ”
some of the jews believed what he said , but others did not believe .
‘ go to this people and tell them :
yes , the minds of these people are now closed .
“ i want you jews to know that god has sent his salvation to the non-jewish people . they will listen ! ”
paul stayed two full years in his own rented house . he welcomed all the people who came and visited him .
so i will start a fire at hazael ’ s house that will destroy the great palaces of ben-hadad .
so i will start a fire at the wall of gaza that will destroy the high towers in gaza .
so i will start a fire at the walls of tyre that will destroy the high towers in tyre . ”
so i will start a fire at teman that will destroy the high towers of bozrah . ”
then their kings and leaders will be captured . they will all be taken together. ” this is what the lord said .
so i will bring an end to the kings of moab , and i will kill all the leaders of moab. ” this is what the lord said .
so i will start a fire in judah that will destroy the high towers of jerusalem . ”
“ but you made the nazirites drink wine . you told the prophets not to prophesy .
you have become more than i can bear . i am bent low like a wagon loaded with grain .
no one will escape , not even the fastest runner . strong men will not be strong enough . soldiers will not be able to save themselves .
people with bows and arrows will not survive . fast runners will not escape . people on horses will not escape alive .
at that time even very brave soldiers will run away . they will not take the time to put their clothes on. ” this is what the lord said .
two people will not walk together
a lion will roar in the forest
a bird doesn ’ t fly into a trap
if people hear the warning blast of a trumpet ,
when the lord god decides to do something , he will first tell his servants , the prophets .
when a lion roars , people are frightened . when the lord god speaks , a prophet must prophesy .
this is what the lord god all-powerful says : “ warn the family of jacob about these things .
your city will be destroyed . the women will rush out through cracks in the wall and throw themselves onto the pile of dead bodies .
“ so , israel , this is what i will do to you . you people of israel , prepare to meet your god . ”
he is the one who made the mountains .
people of israel , listen to this song . this funeral song is about you .
the virgin of israel has fallen .
this is what the lord god says :
the lord says this to the nation of israel :
but don ’ t look in bethel .
come to the lord and live .
you should go to the lord for help .
you hate those prophets , who go to public places and speak against evil ,
you take unfair taxes from the poor .
this is because i know about your many sins .
at that time wise teachers will be quiet ,
you say that god is with you ,
hate evil and love goodness .
the lord , the lord god all-powerful says ,
people will be crying in the vineyards ,
some of you want to see
you will be like someone who escapes from a lion
the lord ’ s special day will be
“ i hate your festivals ;
even if you offer me burnt offerings and grain offerings ,
take your noisy songs away from here .
but let justice flow like a river ,
israel , you offered me sacrifices
but you also carried statues of sakkuth , your king , and kaiwan .
so i will send you as captives , far beyond damascus . ”
oh , look at the people enjoying life in zion ,
go look at calneh .
you people are rushing toward the day of punishment .
but now you lie on ivory beds
you play your harps ,
you drink wine in fancy cups .
the lord god used his own name and made an oath . the lord god all-powerful said ,
at that time ten people in one house might survive , but they too will die .
look , the lord will give the command ,
do horses run over loose rocks ?
you are so excited about defeating lo debar .
then the lord changed his mind about this . the lord said , “ it will not happen . ”
but i said , “ lord god , stop , i beg you ! jacob can not survive ! he is too small ! ”
then the lord changed his mind about this . the lord god said , “ it will not happen either . ”
the lord said to me , “ amos , what do you see ? ”
amos has said , ‘ jeroboam will die by the sword , and the people of israel will be taken as prisoners out of their country . ’ ”
amaziah also said to amos , “ you seer , go down to judah and eat there . do your prophesying there .
but don ’ t prophesy anymore here at bethel . this is jeroboam ’ s holy place . this is israel ’ s temple . ”
i was a shepherd and the lord took me from following the sheep . the lord said to me , ‘ go , prophesy to my people israel . ’
this is what the lord god showed me : i saw a basket of summer fruit .
he said to me , “ amos , what do you see ? ”
listen to me , you who trample on helpless people .
the poor can not pay their loans ,
the lord made a promise . he used his name , “ pride of jacob , ” and made this promise :
there will be an earthquake
the lord god also said ,
i will change your festivals into days of crying for the dead .
the lord god says ,
the people will wander around the country ,
at that time the beautiful young men and women
they made promises by the sin of samaria ,
i saw the lord standing by the altar , and he said ,
if they dig deep into the ground ,
if they hide at the top of mount carmel ,
if they are captured and taken away by their enemies ,
the lord god all-powerful will touch the land ,
he built his upper rooms above the skies .
this is what the lord says :
the lord god is watching this sinful kingdom .
i am giving the command
“ sinners among my people say ,
“ david ’ s tent has fallen ,
then the people left alive in edom ,
the lord says , “ a time of great blessing is coming .
i will bring my people , israel ,
i will plant my people on their land ,
to the holy and faithful brothers and sisters in christ who live in colossae .
in our prayers we always thank god for you . he is the father of our lord jesus christ .
we thank him because we have heard about the faith you have in christ jesus and the love you have for all of god ’ s people .
your faith and love continue because you know what is waiting for you in heaven—the hope you have had since you first heard the true message , the good news
you heard it from epaphras , our dear friend and co-worker . he is a faithful servant of christ for us .
he also told us about the love you have from the spirit .
since the day we heard these things about you , we have continued praying for you . this is what we pray :
that god will strengthen you with his own great power , so that you will be patient and not give up when troubles come .
god made us free from the power of darkness . and he brought us into the kingdom of his dear son .
the son paid the price to make us free . in him we have forgiveness of our sins .
no one can see god ,
through his power all things were made :
the son was there before anything was made .
he is the head of the body , which is the church .
god was pleased for all of himself to live in the son .
and through him , god was happy to bring all things back to himself again—
at one time you were separated from god . you were his enemies in your minds , because the evil you did was against him .
to do this , i work and struggle using the great strength that christ gives me . that strength is working in my life .
in him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are kept safe .
i tell you this so that no one can fool you by telling you ideas that seem good , but are false .
even though i am far away , my thoughts are always with you . i am happy to see your good lives and your strong faith in christ .
you accepted christ jesus as lord , so continue to live following him .
i say this because all of god lives in christ fully , even in his life on earth .
and because you belong to christ you are complete , having everything you need . christ is ruler over every other power and authority .
so don ’ t let anyone make rules for you about eating and drinking or about jewish customs ( festivals , new moon celebrations , or sabbath days ) .
in the past these things were like a shadow that showed what was coming . but the new things that were coming are found in christ .
“ don ’ t eat this , ” “ don ’ t taste that , ” “ don ’ t touch that ” ?
these rules are talking about earthly things that are gone after they are used . they are only human commands and teachings .
you were raised from death with christ . so live for what is in heaven , where christ is sitting at the right hand of god .
think only about what is up there , not what is here on earth .
your old self has died , and your new life is kept with christ in god .
yes , christ is now your life , and when he comes again , you will share in his glory .
god will show his anger against those who don ’ t obey him , because they do these evil things .
you also did these things in the past , when you lived like them .
but now put these things out of your life : anger , losing your temper , doing or saying things to hurt others , and saying shameful things .
don ’ t lie to each other . you have taken off those old clothes—the person you once were and the bad things you did then .
together with these things , the most important part of your new life is to love each other . love is what holds everything together in perfect unity .
let the peace that christ gives control your thinking . it is for peace that you were chosen to be together in one body . and always be thankful .
everything you say and everything you do should be done for jesus your lord . and in all you do , give thanks to god the father through jesus .
wives , be willing to serve your husbands . this is the right thing to do in following the lord .
husbands , love your wives , and be gentle to them .
children , obey your parents in everything . this pleases the lord .
fathers , don ’ t upset your children . if you are too hard to please , they might want to stop trying .
in all the work you are given , do the best you can . work as though you are working for the lord , not any earthly master .
remember that anyone who does wrong will be punished for that wrong . and the lord treats everyone the same .
masters , give what is good and fair to your servants . remember that you have a master in heaven .
never stop praying . be ready for anything by praying and being thankful .
pray that i will say what is necessary to make this truth clear to everyone .
be wise in the way you act with those who are not believers . use your time in the best way you can .
when you talk , you should always be kind and wise . then you will be able to answer everyone in the way you should .
that is why i am sending him . i want you to know how we are , and i am sending him to encourage you .
i am sending him with onesimus , the faithful and dear brother from your group . they will tell you everything that has happened here .
i know that he has worked hard for you and the people in laodicea and in hierapolis .
greetings also from demas and our dear friend luke , the doctor .
give our greetings to the brothers and sisters in laodicea . greetings also to nympha and to the church that meets in her house .
tell archippus , “ be sure to do the work the lord gave you . ”
here ’ s my greeting in my own handwriting— paul . remember me in prison . god ’ s grace be with you .
greetings from paul , silas , and timothy .
we always remember you when we pray , and we thank god for all of you .
brothers and sisters , god loves you . and we know that he has chosen you to be his people .
you became an example to all the believers in macedonia and achaia .
brothers and sisters , you know that our visit to you was not a failure .
when we encourage people to believe the good news , it ’ s not out of wrong motives . we are not trying to trick or fool anyone .
we were not looking for praise from people—not from you or anyone else .
you know that we treated each one of you the way a father treats his own children .
we encouraged you , we comforted you , and we told you to live good lives for god . he calls you to be part of his glorious kingdom .
yes , we wanted to come to you . i , paul , tried more than once to come , but satan stopped us .
you are our hope , our joy , and the crown we will be proud of when our lord jesus christ comes .
you bring us honor and joy .
we sent him so that none of you would be upset by the troubles we have now . you yourselves know that we must have these troubles .
even when we were with you , we told you that we would all have to suffer . and you know that it happened just as we said .
so , brothers and sisters , we are encouraged about you because of your faith . we have much trouble and suffering , but still we are encouraged .
our life is really full if you stand strong in the lord .
we pray that our god and father and our lord jesus will prepare the way for us to come to you .
you know all that we told you to do by the authority of the lord jesus .
god wants you to be holy . he wants you to stay away from sexual sins .
god wants each one of you to learn to control your own body . use your body in a way that is holy and that gives honor to god .
don ’ t let your sexual desires control you like the people who don ’ t know god .
god chose us to be holy . he does not want us to live in sin .
so anyone who refuses to obey this teaching is refusing to obey god , not us . and god is the one who gives you his holy spirit .
we don ’ t need to write to you about having love for your brothers and sisters in christ . god has already taught you to love each other .
in fact , you love all the believers in macedonia . we encourage you now , brothers and sisters , to show your love more and more .
do all you can to live a peaceful life . mind your own business , and earn your own living , as we told you before .
so encourage each other with these words .
now , brothers and sisters , we don ’ t need to write to you about times and dates .
you know very well that the day when the lord comes again will be a surprise , like a thief who comes at night .
but you , brothers and sisters , are not living in darkness . and so that day will not surprise you like a thief .
you are all people who belong to the light . you belong to the day . we don ’ t belong to the night or to darkness .
so we should not be like other people . we should not be sleeping . we should be awake and have self-control .
people who sleep , sleep at night . people who drink too much , drink at night .
god did not choose us to suffer his anger . god chose us to have salvation through our lord jesus christ .
jesus died for us so that we can live together with him . it is not important if we are alive or dead when jesus comes .
so encourage each other and help each other grow stronger in faith , just as you are already doing .
show them the highest respect and love because of the work they do .
be sure that no one pays back wrong for wrong . but always try to do what is good for each other and for all people .
always be full of joy .
whatever happens , always be thankful . this is how god wants you to live in christ jesus .
don ’ t stop the work of the holy spirit .
don ’ t treat prophecy like something that is not important .
but test everything . keep what is good ,
and stay away from everything that is evil .
the one who chose you will do that for you . you can trust him .
brothers and sisters , please pray for us .
give all the brothers and sisters the special greeting of god ’ s people .
i tell you by the authority of the lord to read this letter to all the believers there .
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you .
greetings from paul , silas , and timothy .
grace and peace to you from god the father and the lord jesus christ .
this is proof that god is right in his judgment . he wants you to be worthy of his kingdom . your suffering is for that kingdom .
god will do what is right . he will punish those who are causing you trouble .
he will come with burning fire to punish those who don ’ t know god—those who refuse to accept the good news about our lord jesus .
i told you before that all these things would happen . remember ?
and you know what is stopping that man of evil now . he is being stopped now so that he will appear at the right time .
so god will send them something powerful that leads them away from the truth and causes them to believe a lie .
they will all be condemned because they did not believe the truth and because they enjoyed doing evil .
so , brothers and sisters , stand strong and continue to believe the teachings we gave you when we were there and by letter .
and pray that we will be protected from crooked and evil people . not everyone believes in the lord , you know .
but the lord is faithful . he will give you strength and protect you from the evil one .
the lord gives us confidence that you are doing what we told you and that you will continue to do it .
we pray that the lord will cause you to feel god ’ s love and remember christ ’ s patient endurance .
you yourselves know that you should live like we do . we were not lazy when we were with you .
when we were with you , we gave you this rule : “ whoever will not work should not be allowed to eat . ”
we hear that some people in your group refuse to work . they are doing nothing except being busy in the lives of others .
brothers and sisters , never get tired of doing good .
but don ’ t treat them as enemies . counsel them as fellow believers .
we pray that the lord of peace will give you peace at all times and in every way . the lord be with you all .
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all .
greetings from paul , an apostle of christ jesus . i am an apostle by the command of god our savior and christ jesus our hope .
to timothy , a true son to me in the faith we share .
but some have missed this key point in their teaching and have gone off in another direction . now they talk about things that help no one .
we know that the law is good if someone uses it right .
that teaching is part of the good news that our blessed god gave me to tell . in it we see his glory .
i thank christ jesus our lord because he trusted me and gave me this work of serving him . he gives me strength .
but our lord gave me a full measure of his grace . and with that grace came the faith and love that are in christ jesus .
here is a true statement that should be accepted without question : christ jesus came into the world to save sinners , and i am the worst of them .
continue to trust in god and do what you know is right . some people have not done this , and their faith is now in ruins .
hymenaeus and alexander are men like that . i have given them to satan so that they will learn not to speak against god .
first of all , i ask that you pray for all people . ask god to bless them and give them what they need . and give thanks .
this is good and pleases god our savior .
god wants everyone to be saved and to fully understand the truth .
there is only one god , and there is only one way that people can reach god . that way is through christ jesus , who as a man
gave himself to pay for everyone to be free . this is the message that was given to us at just the right time .
but they should make themselves attractive by the good things they do . that is more appropriate for women who say they are devoted to god .
a woman should learn while listening quietly and being completely willing to obey .
i don ’ t allow a woman to teach a man or tell him what to do . she must listen quietly ,
because adam was made first . eve was made later .
also , adam was not the one who was tricked . it was the woman who was tricked and became a sinner .
it is a true statement that anyone whose goal is to serve as an elder has his heart set on a good work .
he must be a good leader of his own family . this means that his children obey him with full respect .
if a man does not know how to lead his own family , he will not be able to take care of god ’ s church .
they must follow the true faith that god has now made known to us and always do what they know is right .
you should test them first . then , if you find that they have done nothing wrong , they can be special servants .
the men who are special servants must be faithful in marriage . they must be good leaders of children and their own families .
those who do well as special servants are making an honorable place for themselves . and they will feel very sure of their faith in christ jesus .
i hope i can come to you soon . but i am writing this to you now ,
without a doubt , the secret of our life of worship is great :
everything that god made is good . nothing he made should be refused if it is accepted with thanks to him .
everything he created is made holy by what he has said and by prayer .
here is a true statement that should be accepted without question :
command and teach these things .
continue to read the scriptures to the people , encourage them , and teach them . do this until i come .
remember to use the gift you have , which was given to you through a prophecy when the group of elders laid their hands on you .
continue to do these things . give your life to doing them . then everyone can see that your work is progressing .
be careful in your life and in your teaching . continue to live and teach rightly . then you will save yourself and those who listen to your teaching .
don ’ t speak angrily to an older man . but talk to him as if he were your father . treat the younger men like brothers .
treat the older women like mothers . and treat the younger women with respect like sisters .
take care of widows who really need help .
but the widow who uses her life to please herself is really dead while she is still living .
tell the believers there to take care of their family so that no one can say they are doing wrong .
to be added to your list of widows , a woman must be 60 years old or older . she must have been faithful to her husband .
then they will be guilty of not doing what they first promised to do .
but some of the younger widows have already turned away to follow satan .
the elders who lead the church in a good way should receive double honor—in particular , those who do the work of counseling and teaching .
tell those who sin that they are wrong . do this in front of the whole church so that the others will have a warning .
before god and jesus christ and the chosen angels , i tell you to make these judgments without any prejudice . treat every person the same .
think carefully before you lay your hands on anyone to make him an elder . don ’ t share in the sins of others . keep yourself pure .
timothy , stop drinking only water , and drink a little wine . this will help your stomach , and you will not be sick so often .
the sins of some people are easy to see . their sins show that they will be judged . but the sins of some others are seen only later .
all those who are slaves should show full respect to their masters . then god ’ s name and our teaching will not be criticized .
devotion to god is , in fact , a way for people to be very rich , but only if it makes them satisfied with what they have .
when we came into the world , we brought nothing . and when we die , we can take nothing out .
so , if we have food and clothes , we will be satisfied with that .
do what you were commanded to do without fault or blame until the time when our lord jesus christ comes again .
tell those who are rich to do good—to be rich in good works . and tell them they should be happy to give and ready to share .
some people who claim to have that “ knowledge ” have gone completely away from what we believe .
to timothy , a dear son to me .
i remember that you cried for me . i want very much to see you so that i can be filled with joy .
the spirit god gave us does not make us afraid . his spirit is a source of power and love and self-control .
i was chosen to tell people that message as an apostle and teacher .
this teaching is a treasure that you have been trusted with . protect it with the help of the holy spirit , who lives inside us .
you know that everyone in asia has left me . even phygelus and hermogenes have left me .
i pray that the lord will show mercy to the family of onesiphorus . many times onesiphorus encouraged me . he was not ashamed that i was in prison .
no , he was not ashamed . when he came to rome , he looked and looked for me until he found me .
timothy , you are a son to me . be strong in the grace that we have because we belong to christ jesus .
as a good soldier of christ jesus , accept your share of the troubles we have .
a soldier wants to please his commanding officer , so he does not spend any time on activities that are not a part of his duty .
athletes in a race must obey all the rules to win .
the farmer who works hard deserves the first part of the harvest .
think about what i am saying . the lord will help you understand it all .
here is a true statement :
if we remain faithful even in suffering ,
if we are not faithful ,
stay away from people who talk about useless things that are not from god . that kind of talk will lead a person more and more against god .
their evil teaching will spread like a sickness inside the body . hymenaeus and philetus are men like that .
stay away from foolish and stupid arguments . you know that these arguments grow into bigger arguments .
you must gently teach those who don ’ t agree with you . maybe god will let them change their hearts so that they can accept the truth .
remember this : there are some terrible times coming in the last days .
these women always want to learn something new , but they are never able to fully understand the truth .
but they will not succeed in what they are trying to do . everyone will see how foolish they are . that is what happened to jannes and jambres .
everyone who wants to live showing true devotion to god in christ jesus will be persecuted .
people who are evil and cheat others will become worse and worse . they will fool others , but they will also be fooling themselves .
but you should continue following the teaching you learned . you know it is true , because you know you can trust those who taught you .
using the scriptures , those who serve god will be prepared and will have everything they need to do every good work .
people will stop listening to the truth . they will begin to follow the teaching in false stories .
my life is being given as an offering for god . the time has come for me to leave this life here .
i have fought the good fight . i have finished the race . i have served the lord faithfully .
do your best to come to me as soon as you can .
demas loved this world too much . that is why he left me . he went to thessalonica . crescens went to galatia . and titus went to dalmatia .
luke is the only one still with me . get mark and bring him with you when you come . he can help me in my work here .
i sent tychicus to ephesus .
alexander the metalworker caused me so much harm . the lord will punish him for what he did .
he fought against everything we teach . you should be careful that he doesn ’ t hurt you too .
the first time i defended myself , no one helped me . everyone left me . i pray that god will forgive them .
give my greetings to priscilla and aquila and to the family of onesiphorus .
erastus stayed in corinth . and i left trophimus in miletus—he was sick .
try as hard as you can to come to me before winter .
the lord be with your spirit . grace be with you .
nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came to jerusalem and surrounded it with his army . this happened during the third year that jehoiakim was king of judah .
among those young men were daniel , hananiah , mishael , and azariah from the tribe of judah .
god caused ashpenaz , the man in charge of the officials , to be kind and loyal to daniel .
then daniel talked to the guard who had been put in charge of daniel , hananiah , mishael , and azariah by ashpenaz .
he said , “ please give us this test for ten days : don ’ t give us anything but vegetables to eat and water to drink .
so the guard agreed to test daniel , hananiah , mishael , and azariah for ten days .
after ten days , daniel and his friends looked healthier than all the young men who ate the king ’ s food .
so the guard continued to take away the king ’ s special food and wine and to give only vegetables to daniel , hananiah , mishael , and azariah .
at the end of the three years of training , ashpenaz brought all the young men to king nebuchadnezzar .
so daniel served the king until the first year that cyrus was king .
during nebuchadnezzar ’ s second year as king , he had dreams . they bothered him , and he could not sleep .
then the king said to them , “ i had a dream that bothers me . i want to know what it means . ”
again the wise men said to the king , “ please , sir , tell us about the dream , and we will tell you what it means . ”
then king nebuchadnezzar answered , “ i know that you are trying to get more time . you know that i meant what i said .
when the king heard that , he became very angry . so he gave an order for all the wise men of babylon to be killed .
and said , “ why did the king order such a severe punishment ? ”
so daniel went to his house . he explained the whole story to his friends hananiah , mishael , and azariah .
during the night , god explained the secret to daniel in a vision . then daniel praised the god of heaven .
he changes the times and seasons .
he knows hidden secrets that are hard to understand .
god of my ancestors , i thank you and praise you .
the king asked daniel ( belteshazzar ) a question . he said , “ are you able to tell me about my dream , and what it means ? ”
“ king , in your dream you saw a large statue in front of you that was very large and shiny . it was very impressive .
the lower part of the legs was made from iron . its feet were made partly of iron and partly of clay .
“ that was your dream . now we will tell the king what it means .
king , you are the most important king . the god of heaven has given you a kingdom , power , strength , and glory .
the toes of the statue were partly iron and partly clay . so the fourth kingdom will be partly strong like iron and partly weak like clay .
so all the men came and stood in front of the idol that king nebuchadnezzar had set up .
whoever does not bow down and worship this gold idol will immediately be thrown into a very hot furnace . ”
then some of the chaldeans came up to the king and began speaking against the people from judah .
they said , “ king , may you live forever !
and you also said that whoever does not bow down and worship the gold idol will be thrown into a very hot furnace .
nebuchadnezzar became very angry . he called for shadrach , meshach , and abednego . so they were brought to him .
shadrach , meshach , and abednego answered the king , “ nebuchadnezzar , we don ’ t need to explain these things to you .
shadrach , meshach , and abednego fell into the fire . they were tied up very tightly .
then the king gave shadrach , meshach , and abednego more important jobs in the province of babylon .
king nebuchadnezzar sent this letter to the many nations and language groups living around the world .
i am very happy to tell you about the miracles and wonderful things that the most high god did for me .
god has done amazing miracles !
i , nebuchadnezzar , was at my palace . i was happy and successful .
so i gave an order that all the wise men of babylon be brought to me to tell me what my dream meant .
when the men of magic and the chaldeans came , i told them about the dream , but they could not tell me what it meant .
the tree grew large and strong . the top of the tree touched the sky . it could be seen from anywhere on earth .
“ i was looking at those things in the vision while lying on my bed . and then i saw a holy angel coming down from heaven .
he will not think like a man any longer . he will have the mind of an animal . seven seasons will pass while he is like this . ’
“ king , this is the meaning of the dream . god most high has commanded these things to happen to my lord the king :
all these things happened to king nebuchadnezzar .
king belshazzar gave a big party for 1000 of his officials . the king was drinking wine with them .
so all the king ’ s wise men came in , but they could not read the writing or understand what it meant .
king belshazzar ’ s officials were confused , and the king became even more afraid and worried . his face was white from fear .
so they brought daniel to the king and he asked , “ is your name daniel , one of the captives my father the king brought here from judah ?
i have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you understand secrets and are very smart and very wise .
“ king , god most high made your grandfather nebuchadnezzar a very great and powerful king and gave him great wealth .
“ but nebuchadnezzar became proud and stubborn , so his power was taken away from him . he was taken off his royal throne and stripped of his glory .
“ but belshazzar , you already knew this . you are nebuchadnezzar ’ s grandson , but still you have not made yourself humble .
so because of that , god sent the hand that wrote on the wall .
these are the words that were written on the wall :
“ this is what these words mean :
that very same night , belshazzar , king of the babylonians , was killed .
a man named darius the mede became the new king . darius was about 62 years old .
darius thought it would be a good idea to choose 120 satraps to rule throughout his kingdom .
so the two supervisors and the satraps went as a group to the king . they said , “ king darius , live forever !
so king darius made the law and signed it .
then the supervisors and satraps went as a group and found daniel praying and asking god for help .
the next morning , king darius got up just as it was getting light and ran to the lions ’ den .
daniel answered , “ king , live forever !
then king darius wrote this letter to all the people from other nations and language groups all around the world :
god helps and saves people .
so daniel was successful during the time darius was king and when cyrus the persian was king .
daniel said , “ i saw my vision at night . in the vision the wind was blowing from all four directions . these winds made the sea rough .
i saw four big animals and each one was different from the others . these four animals came up out of the sea .
“ as i was looking , thrones were put in their places ,
a river of fire flowed out
the authority and rule of the other animals had been taken from them . but they were permitted to live for a certain period of time .
“ i , daniel , was confused and worried . the visions that went through my mind bothered me .
i went to someone who was standing there and asked him what all this meant . so he explained it to me .
he said , ‘ the four great animals are four kingdoms that will come from the earth .
but god ’ s holy people will receive the kingdom , and they will have the kingdom forever and ever . ’
as i was watching , this little horn began attacking and making war against god ’ s holy people and killing them .
“ ‘ but the court will decide what should happen , and that king ’ s power will be taken away . his kingdom will end completely .
after that vision , i , daniel , saw another vision during the third year that belshazzar was king .
then a little horn grew from one of those four horns . it grew and became very big . it grew toward the southeast , toward the beautiful land .
because of this sin , the daily sacrifices were stopped . truth was thrown down to the ground . the little horn did these things and was very successful .
the other holy one said , “ this will last for 2300 days . then the holy place will be repaired . ”
“ you saw a ram with two horns . the horns are the countries of media and persia .
the goat is the king of greece . the big horn between its eyes is the first king .
i prayed to the lord my god and told him about all my sins . i said ,
“ lord , we should all be ashamed . all our kings and leaders should be ashamed . our ancestors should be ashamed , because we sinned against you .
“ but , lord our god , you are kind and forgiving , even though we rebelled against you .
we have not obeyed the lord our god . he used his servants , the prophets , and gave us laws , but we have not obeyed his laws .
i was praying to the lord my god about his holy mountain and telling about my sins and the sins of the people of israel .
gabriel helped me understand the things i wanted to know . he said , “ daniel , i have come to give you wisdom and to help you understand .
at that time i , daniel , was very sad for three weeks .
on the 24th day of the first month of the year , i was standing beside the great tigris river .
then a hand touched me . when that happened , i got on my hands and knees . i was so afraid that i was shaking .
while the man was talking to me , i bowed low with my face toward the ground . i could not speak .
sir , i am daniel your servant . how can i talk with you ? my strength is gone and it is hard for me to breathe . ”
the one who looked like a man touched me again . when he touched me , i felt better .
“ during the first year that darius the mede was king , i stood up to support michael in his fight against the prince of persia .
then a very strong and powerful king will come who will rule with much power . he will do anything he wants .
the northern king will attack the southern kingdom . but he will lose , and then he will go back to his own country .
he will defeat large and powerful armies . he will even defeat the leader with the agreement .
“ at the right time , the northern king will attack the southern king again . but this time he will not be successful as he was before .
when those wise people are punished , they will receive some help , but many people who join them will be hypocrites .
the northern king will show his power in many countries . egypt will also learn how powerful he is .
he will get treasures of gold and silver and all the riches of egypt . the libyans and ethiopians will obey him .
but that northern king will hear news from the east and the north that will make him afraid and angry . he will go to completely destroy many nations .
there are many who are dead and buried . some of them will wake up and live forever , but others will wake up to shame and disgrace forever .
the wise people will shine as bright as the sky . those who teach others to live right will shine like stars forever and ever .
i heard the answer , but i really didn ’ t understand . so i asked , “ sir , what will happen after all this comes true ? ”
he answered , “ go on about your life daniel . the message is hidden . it will be a secret until the time of the end .
“ the daily sacrifice will be stopped . there will be 1290 days from that time until the time that the terrible thing that destroys is set up .
the one who waits for and comes to the end of the 1335 days will be very happy .
the trip from mount horeb through the mountains of seir to kadesh barnea takes only eleven days .
the israelites were in moab on the east side of the jordan river when moses began to explain what god had commanded :
“ at mount horeb the lord our god spoke to us . he said , ‘ you have stayed at this mountain long enough .
“ at that time i told you , ‘ i can ’ t take care of you by myself .
may the lord , the god of your ancestors , give you 1000 times more people than you are now ! may he bless you as he promised .
but i can not take care of you and solve all your arguments by myself .
so choose some men from each tribe , and i will make them leaders over you . choose wise men with experience who understand people . ’
“ and you said , ‘ that is a good thing to do . ’
at that same time i also told you everything you must do .
then i said to you , ‘ you have now come to the hill country of the amorites . the lord our god will give us this country .
“ i thought that was a good idea . so i chose twelve men from among you , one man from each tribe .
then they left and went up to the hill country . they came to the valley of eshcol and explored it .
“ but you refused to go into the land . you refused to obey the lord your god .
“ so i said to you , ‘ don ’ t be upset or afraid of those people .
the lord your god is in front , leading you . he will fight for you just as he did in egypt .
“ but you didn ’ t trust the lord your god then either .
“ the lord heard what you said , and he was angry . he made a vow . he said ,
‘ not one of you evil people who are alive now will go into the good land that i promised to your ancestors .
“ the lord was also angry with me because of you . he said to me , ‘ moses , you can not enter the land , either .
but you—you must turn around , take the road to the red sea and go back into the desert . ’
the amorites who lived there came out like a swarm of bees and chased you all the way from seir to hormah .
then you came back crying to the lord for help , but the lord refused to listen to you .
so you stayed at kadesh for such a long time .
then the lord said to me ,
‘ you have traveled around these mountains long enough . turn north .
you must pay the people of esau for any food you eat or water you drink there .
the anakites were part of the rephaites . people thought the emites were also rephaites , but the people of moab called them emites .
“ the lord told me , ‘ now , go to the other side of zered valley. ’ so we crossed zered valley .
the lord had opposed those men until they were all dead and gone from our camp .
“ after all the fighting men were dead and gone ,
the lord said to me ,
‘ today you must cross the border at ar and go into moab .
( that country is also known as the land of rephaim . the rephaites lived there in the past . the people of ammon called them the zamzummites .
today i will make all people everywhere afraid of you . they will hear the news about you , and they will be afraid and shake with fear . ’
“ while we were in the desert of kedemoth , i sent messengers to king sihon of heshbon . the messengers offered peace to sihon . they said ,
‘ let us go through your land . we will stay on the road . we will not turn off the road to the right or to the left .
we will pay you in silver for any food we eat or any water we drink . we only want to march through your country .
“ the lord said to me , ‘ i am giving king sihon and his country to you . now , go take his land ! ’
“ then king sihon and all his people came out to fight against us at jahaz .
but the lord our god gave him to us . we defeated king sihon , his sons , and all his people .
we took only the cattle and the valuable things from those cities .
“ we turned and went on the road to bashan . king og of bashan and all his men came out to fight against us at edrei .
“ so the lord our god let us defeat king og of bashan . we destroyed him and all his men . not one of them was left .
but we kept all the cattle and the valuable things from the cities for ourselves .
( the people from sidon call mount hermon , sirion , but the amorites called it senir . )
i gave the other half of gilead and the whole area of bashan to half the tribe of manasseh . ”
“ i gave gilead to makir .
your wives , your little children , and your cattle ( i know you have many cattle ) will stay here in the cities i have given you .
don ’ t fear the kings of these lands , because the lord your god will fight for you . ’
“ then i begged the lord to do something special for me . i said ,
please let me go across the jordan river and see the good land on the other side . let me see the beautiful hill country and lebanon . ’
“ so we stayed in the valley across from beth peor .
“ you have seen what the lord did at baal peor . the lord your god destroyed all your people who followed the false god baal at that place .
but all of you who stayed with the lord your god are alive today .
“ the lord our god is near when we ask him to help us . no other nation has a god like that !
and no other nation is great enough to have laws and rules as good as the teachings i give you today .
“ on the day the lord spoke to you from the fire at mount horeb , you did not see him—there was no shape for god .
or like an animal on the earth , or like a bird that flies in the sky .
and don ’ t make an idol that looks like anything that crawls on the ground or like a fish in the sea .
because the lord your god hates for his people to worship other gods . and he can be like a fire that destroys !
there you will serve gods made by men—things made of wood and stone that can not see or hear or eat or smell !
when you are in trouble—when all these things happen to you—then you will come back to the lord your god and obey him .
you people heard god speaking to you from a fire , and you are still alive . has that ever happened to anyone else ? no !
the lord showed you all this so that you would know that he is god . there is no other god like him .
then moses chose three cities on the east side of the jordan river .
any person who killed someone by accident and not out of hate could run away to one of these three cities and not be put to death .
moses gave god ’ s law to the israelites .
moses gave these teachings , laws , and rules to the people after they came out of egypt .
this land goes from aroer on the edge of the arnon valley all the way to mount sirion , that is , mount hermon .
the lord our god made an agreement with us at mount horeb .
the lord did not make this agreement with our ancestors , but with us—yes , with all of us who are alive here today .
the lord spoke with you face to face at that mountain . he spoke to you from the fire .
‘ i am the lord your god . i am the one who freed you from egypt , where you were slaves .
‘ you must not worship any other gods except me .
but i will be very kind to people who love me and obey my commands . i will be kind to their families for thousands of generations !
‘ you must not use the name of the lord your god to make empty promises . if you do , the lord will not let you go unpunished .
‘ you must keep the sabbath a special day like the lord your god commanded .
work six days a week and do your job ,
‘ you must not murder anyone .
‘ you must not commit the sin of adultery .
‘ you must not steal .
‘ you must not tell lies about other people .
no one has ever heard the living god speak from the fire like we have and still lived !
“ the lord heard what you said and told me , ‘ i heard what the people said . and that is fine .
“ ‘ go and tell the people to go back to their tents ,
“ so you people must be careful to do everything the lord commanded you . do not stop following god !
“ listen , people of israel ! the lord is our god . the lord is the only god .
you must love the lord your god with all your heart , with all your soul , and with all your strength .
always remember these commands that i give you today .
tie them on your hands and wear them on your foreheads to help you remember my teachings .
write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates .
“ but be careful ! don ’ t forget the lord . you were slaves in egypt , but he brought you out of the land of egypt .
respect the lord your god and serve only him . you must use only his name to make promises .
you must not follow other gods . you must not follow the gods of the people who live around you .
“ you must not test the lord your god like you tested him at massah .
you must be sure to obey the commands of the lord your god . you must follow all the teachings and laws he has given you .
and you will force out all your enemies , just as the lord said .
then you will say to them , ‘ we were pharaoh ’ s slaves in egypt , but the lord brought us out of egypt with his great power .
he brought us out of egypt so that he could give us the land that he promised our ancestors .
don ’ t marry any of them , and don ’ t let your sons or daughters marry any of the people from those other nations .
why did the lord love and choose you ? it was not because you are such a large nation . you had the fewest of all people !
but the lord punishes people who hate him . he will destroy them . he will not be slow to punish those who hate him .
so you must be careful to obey the commands , laws , and rules that i give you today .
“ you will be blessed more than all people . every husband and wife will be able to have children . your cows will be able to have calves .
“ don ’ t say in your heart , ‘ these nations are stronger than we are . how can we force them out ? ’
you must not be afraid of them . you must remember what the lord your god did to pharaoh and to all the people of egypt .
“ the lord your god will send the hornet against them . he will do this until he destroys all the people who escaped and tried to hide .
don ’ t be afraid of them , because the lord your god is with you . he is a great and awesome god .
but the lord your god will let you defeat those nations . he will confuse them in battle , until they are destroyed .
these past 40 years , your clothes did not wear out , and your feet did not swell .
you must remember that the lord your god teaches and corrects you as a father teaches and corrects his son .
“ you must obey the commands of the lord your god . follow him and respect him .
it is a land with wheat and barley , grapevines , fig trees , and pomegranates . it is a land with olive oil and honey .
you will have all you want to eat . then you will praise the lord your god for the good land he has given you .
“ be careful . don ’ t forget the lord your god ! be careful to obey the commands , laws , and rules that i give you today .
then you will have plenty to eat , and you will build good houses and live in them .
your cattle , sheep , and goats will grow large . you will get plenty of gold and silver . you will have plenty of everything .
don ’ t ever say to yourself , ‘ i got all this wealth by my own power and ability . ’
the lord is destroying other nations for you . but if you stop listening to the lord your god , you will be destroyed just like them !
you made the lord angry at mount horeb . the lord was angry enough to destroy you !
“ so at the end of 40 days and 40 nights , the lord gave me two stone tablets—the stones of the agreement .
“ the lord also said to me , ‘ i have watched these people . they are very stubborn !
so i took the two stone tablets and threw them down . there before your eyes i broke the stones into pieces .
i was afraid of the lord ’ s terrible anger . he was angry enough to destroy you , but the lord listened to me again .
the lord was very angry with aaron—enough to destroy him ! so i also prayed for aaron at that time .
“ also , at taberah , massah , and kibroth hattaavah you made the lord angry .
all the time that i have known you , you have refused to obey the lord .
“ so i bowed down before the lord 40 days and 40 nights , because the lord said he would destroy you .
but they are your people , lord . they belong to you . you brought them out of egypt with your great power and strength . ’
then the israelites went from moserah to gudgodah . and they went from gudgodah to jotbathah , a land of rivers .
so obey the laws and commands of the lord that i am giving you today . these laws and commands are for your own good .
“ stop being stubborn . give your hearts to god .
he defends widows and orphans . he loves even the strangers living among us . he gives them food and clothes .
so you must also love them , because you yourselves were strangers in the land of egypt .
“ you must respect the lord your god and worship only him . never leave him . when you make promises , you must use his name only .
“ so you must love the lord your god . you must do what he tells you to do and always obey his laws , rules , and commands .
it was you , not your children , who saw everything he did for you in the desert until you came to this place .
it was you , not your children , who saw all the great things the lord did .
the lord your god cares for that land . the lord your god watches over it , from the beginning to the end of the year .
and i will make grass grow in your fields for your cattle . you will have plenty to eat . ’
write these commands on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates .
“ today i am giving you a choice . you may choose the blessing or the curse .
you will get the blessing if you listen and obey the commands of the lord your god that i have told you today .
you must carefully obey all the laws and rules i give you today .
“ you must not worship the lord your god in the same way these people worship their gods .
“ you must not continue to worship the way we have been worshiping . until now each of us has been worshiping god any way we wanted .
this is because we have not yet entered the peaceful land that the lord your god is giving you .
be sure you don ’ t offer your burnt offerings in just any place you see .
the lord will choose his special place among your tribes . offer your burnt offerings and do everything else i told you only in that place .
but you must not eat the blood . you must pour the blood on the ground like water .
but be sure that you always share these meals with the levites . do this as long as you live in your land .
you may eat this meat the same as you would eat gazelle or deer meat . anyone can do this—people who are clean and people who are unclean .
don ’ t eat the blood . pour it out like water onto the ground .
so don ’ t eat blood . you must do what the lord says is right , and good things will happen to you and to your descendants .
“ a prophet or someone who explains dreams might come to you and tell you that they will show you a sign or a miracle .
they are the gods of the people who live in the other lands around you , some near and some far away . )
you must not agree with them . don ’ t listen to them or feel sorry for them . don ’ t let them go free or protect them .
then all the israelites will hear about it and be afraid . and they will not do those evil things any more .
“ the lord your god has given you cities to live in . sometimes you might hear some bad news about one of these cities . you might hear that
then you must kill all the people of that city and their animals too . you must destroy that city completely .
“ you are the children of the lord your god . when someone dies , you must not cut yourselves or shave your heads to show your sadness .
“ don ’ t eat anything that the lord hates .
you may eat these animals : cattle , sheep , goats ,
deer , gazelles , roe deer , wild sheep , wild goats , antelopes , and mountain sheep .
you may eat any animal that has hooves divided into two parts and that chews the cud .
“ you may eat any kind of fish that has fins and scales .
but don ’ t eat anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales . it is not a clean food for you .
“ you may eat any clean bird .
but don ’ t eat any of these birds : eagles , vultures , buzzards ,
red kites , falcons , any kind of kite ,
any kind of raven ,
horned owls , screech owls , sea gulls , any kind of hawk ,
little owls , great owls , white owls ,
desert owls , ospreys , cormorants ,
storks , any kind of heron , hoopoes , or bats .
“ all insects with wings are unclean , so don ’ t eat them .
but you may eat any clean bird .
“ every year you must be sure to save one-tenth of all the crops that grow in your fields .
sell that part of your crops and take the money with you to the special place the lord has chosen .
“ at the end of every three years , you must gather one-tenth of your harvest for that year . store this food in your towns .
“ at the end of every seven years , you must cancel debts .
you may require a foreigner to repay you , but you must cancel any debt another israelite owes you .
there should not be any poor people in your country , because the lord your god is giving you this land . and the lord will greatly bless you .
but this will happen only if you obey the lord your god . you must be careful to obey every command that i have told you today .
you must be willing to share with them . you must lend them whatever they need .
but when you let your slave go free , don ’ t send him away with nothing .
remember , you were slaves in egypt . and the lord your god set you free . so that is why i am giving you this command today .
but you must not eat the blood from the animal . you must pour the blood out on the ground like water .
“ you must not sacrifice the passover animal in any of the towns that the lord your god gives you .
you must cook the meal and eat it at the place the lord your god will choose . the next morning you may go back home .
“ you must count seven weeks from the time you begin to harvest the grain .
remember , you were slaves in egypt . so be sure to obey these laws .
“ seven days after you have gathered your harvest in from your threshing floor and from your winepress , you should celebrate the festival of shelters .
each man should give as much as he can . he should decide how much to give by thinking about how much the lord has given him .
you must not set up special stones for worshiping false gods . the lord your god hates them .
“ you must not sacrifice to the lord your god an ox or sheep that has anything wrong with it . the lord your god would hate that .
that they have worshiped other gods or maybe the sun , the moon or the stars . i never told you to do that !
you must go to the priests who are levites and to the judge on duty at that time . they will decide what to do about that problem .
you must accept their decision and follow their instructions exactly—don ’ t change anything !
all the people will hear about this punishment and be afraid . then they will not be stubborn anymore .
the tribe of levi will not get any share of land like the other tribes . their share is the lord himself , as he said to them .
this is because the lord your god looked at all your tribes and chose levi and his descendants to serve him as priests forever .
and this levite may serve in the name of the lord his god , the same as all his brother levites who are on duty before the lord .
and that levite will get an equal share with the other levites , in addition to the share his family normally gets .
you must be faithful to the lord your god , never doing anything he considers wrong .
“ the lord said to me , ‘ what they ask for is good .
this prophet will speak for me , and i will punish anyone who refuses to listen to my commands . ’
you might be thinking , ‘ how can we know if something a prophet says is not from the lord ? ’
that is why i commanded you to choose three special cities .
then innocent people will not be killed in the land that the lord your god is giving you . and you will not be guilty for any such deaths .
“ a witness might try to hurt another person by lying and saying that this person did wrong .
when the judges carefully ask their questions , they might find that the witness lied against the other person . if the witnesses tell lies ,
you must punish them with the same punishment the other person would have received . in this way you will remove this evil from your group .
other people will hear about this and be afraid , and people will not do evil things like that again .
“ when you go to the battle , the priest must go to the soldiers and speak to them .
the lord your god is going with you to help you fight against your enemies . he will help you win ! ’
then , after the officers have finished speaking to the army , they must choose captains to lead the soldiers .
“ when you go to attack a city , you must first offer peace to the people there .
if they accept your offer and open their gates , all the people in that city will become your slaves and be forced to work for you .
but if the city refuses to make peace with you and fights against you , you should surround the city .
and when the lord your god lets you take the city , you must kill all the men in it .
that is what you must do to all the cities that are very far from you—the cities that are not in the land where you will live .
“ but when you take cities in the land that the lord your god is giving you , you must kill everyone .
your leaders and judges must come out and measure the distance to the towns around the dead body .
all the leaders of the town nearest the dead body must wash their hands over the cow that had its neck broken in the valley .
these leaders must say , ‘ we did not kill this person , and we did not see it happen .
in this way you will remove that guilt from your group by doing what the lord said .
“ you might fight against your enemies , and the lord your god might let you defeat them and take them as captives .
you might see a beautiful woman among the captives who you want to be your wife .
you must then bring her into your house where she will shave her head and cut her nails .
when the man divides his property among his children , he can not give the rights of the firstborn to the son of his favorite wife .
his father and mother must then take him to the leaders of the town at the town meeting place .
“ a man might be guilty of a sin that must be punished by death . people might kill him and hang his body on a tree .
“ you must not plow with an ox and a donkey together .
“ you must not wear clothes made by weaving together wool and linen .
“ tie several pieces of thread together . then put these tassels on the four corners of the robes you wear .
“ a man might marry a woman and have sexual relations with her . then he might decide that he does not like her .
then the leaders of that town must take that man and punish him .
“ a man might meet a virgin girl engaged to another man . he might have sexual relations with her . if this happens in the city ,
“ but if a man finds an engaged girl out in the field and forces her to have sexual relations with him , only the man must die .
you must do nothing to the girl . she did nothing that deserves the punishment of death . this is like someone attacking their neighbor and killing them .
the man found the engaged girl out in the field and attacked her . maybe she called for help , but there was no one to help her .
“ a man might find a virgin girl who is not engaged and force her to have sexual relations with him . if other people see this happen ,
“ a man must not bring shame to his father by marrying his father ’ s wife .
“ a man with a crushed testicle or part of his sex organ cut off may not join with the men of israel to worship the lord .
you must never try to make peace with the ammonites or moabites . as long as you live , don ’ t be friendly to them .
“ you must not hate edomites , because they are your relatives . you must not hate egyptians , because you were a stranger in their land .
the children of the third generation born to the edomites and egyptians may join with the people of israel to worship the lord .
“ when your army goes to fight against your enemies , stay away from everything that would make you unclean .
then , when evening comes , the man must bathe himself in water . and when the sun goes down , he may come into the camp again .
“ you also must have a place outside the camp where people can go to relieve themselves .
“ if slaves run away and come to you , don ’ t force them to go back to their masters .
runaway slaves may live with you wherever they like in whatever city they choose . you must not trouble them .
“ an israelite man or woman must never become a temple prostitute .
if you don ’ t make a promise , you are not sinning .
when she has left his house , she may go and become another man ’ s wife .
remember what the lord your god did to miriam on your trip out of egypt .
“ when you give someone any kind of loan , you must not go into their house to get security .
you must stand outside . then the person who you gave the loan to will bring out the security to you .
if he is a poor man , then he might give the clothes that keep him warm . you must not keep that security overnight .
“ you must make sure that foreigners and orphans are treated fairly . and you must never take clothes from a widow as security .
remember you were poor slaves in egypt . that is why i tell you to do these things for the poor .
“ when two people have an argument , they should go to the court . the judges will decide which person is right and which is wrong .
don ’ t hit anyone more than 40 times during punishment , because more than that means that their life is not important to you .
“ when an animal is being used to separate grain , you must not cover its mouth to stop it from eating .
then the first son she has will be considered the dead man ’ s son in order to keep the dead man ’ s name alive in israel .
from then on , the brother ’ s family will be known in israel as , ‘ the family of the man whose sandal was removed . ’
if she does that , cut off her hand . don ’ t feel sorry for her .
“ don ’ t use weights that are too heavy or too light .
don ’ t keep measures in your house that are too large or too small .
the lord your god hates people who cheat with false weights and measures . yes , he hates all people who do wrong .
“ remember what the amalekites did to you when you were coming from egypt .
“ you will soon enter the land that the lord your god is giving you . you will take that land and live there .
“ then the priest will take the basket from you . he will put it down in front of the altar of the lord your god .
the egyptians treated us badly . they made us slaves . they hurt us and forced us to work very hard .
then the lord brought us out of egypt with his great power and strength . he used great miracles and wonders and did amazing things .
so he brought us to this place . he gave us this land—a land filled with many good things .
now , lord , i bring you the first harvest from the land that you gave me . ’
“ today the lord your god commands you to obey all these laws and rules . be careful to follow them with all your heart and soul .
moses and the elders of israel spoke to the people . moses said , “ obey all the commands that i give you today .
also , use some stones there to build an altar to the lord your god . don ’ t use iron tools to cut the stones .
you must not use cut stones to build the altar for the lord your god . offer burnt offerings on this altar to the lord your god .
and you must sacrifice and eat fellowship offerings there . eat and enjoy yourselves there together with the lord your god .
you must write all these teachings on the stones that you set up . write clearly so that they are easy to read . ”
so you must do everything that the lord your god tells you . you must obey his commands and his laws that i am giving you today . ”
that day moses also told the people ,
and these tribes will stand on mount ebal to read the curses : reuben , gad , asher , zebulun , dan , and naphtali .
“ and the levites will say to all the israelites in a loud voice :
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who does not show respect to their father or their mother ! ’
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who moves a neighbor ’ s landmark ! ’
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who tricks a blind man into going the wrong way ! ’
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who does not give fair judgment for the foreigners , orphans , and widows ! ’
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who shames his father by having sexual relations with his father ’ s wife . ’
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who has sexual relations with any kind of animal ! ’
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who has sexual relations with his sister or half sister ! ’
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who has sexual relations with his mother-in-law ! ’
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who kills anyone , even if he is not caught ! ’
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who takes money to kill an innocent person ! ’
“ the levites will say , ‘ cursed is the one who does not support this law and agree to obey it . ’
if you will obey the lord your god , all these blessings will come to you and be yours :
“ he will bless you
he will bless your baskets and pans
he will bless you at all times
if you follow the lord your god and obey his commands , he will do what he promised . the lord will make you his own special people .
then all the people in that land will see that you are called to be the lord ’ s people , and they will be afraid of you .
“ the lord will curse you
he will curse you ,
he will curse you at all times
the lord will send you terrible diseases until you no longer exist , until you are completely gone from the land .
there will be no clouds in the sky—the sky will look like polished brass . and the ground under you will be hard like iron .
the lord will not send rain—only sand and dust will fall from the sky . it will come down on you until you are destroyed .
your dead bodies will be food for the wild birds and animals . there will be no one to scare them away from your dead bodies .
the lord will punish you by making you crazy . he will make you blind and confused .
“ a nation that you don ’ t know will take all your crops and everything you worked for . people will treat you badly and abuse you .
the things you see will make you go crazy .
“ your fields will produce plenty of grain . but your harvest will be small , because the locusts will eat your harvest .
you will have sons and daughters . but you will not be able to keep them , because they will be captured and taken away .
locusts will destroy all your trees and the crops in your fields .
the foreigners living among you will get more and more power , and you will lose the power you had .
these curses will show people that god judged you and your descendants forever . people will be amazed at the terrible things that happen to you .
“ the lord your god gave you many blessings . but you did not serve him with joy and a glad heart .
these people will be cruel . they will not care about old people or show mercy to young children .
he will bring on you all the diseases you saw in egypt that filled you with fear , and you will not be able to avoid them .
the lord will even bring troubles and diseases that are not written in this book of teachings . he will continue to do this until you are destroyed .
you will live with danger and always be afraid . you will be afraid night and day . you will never feel sure about your life .
you saw the great troubles he gave them . you saw the miracles and amazing things he did .
but even today , you still don ’ t understand what happened . the lord has not let you really understand what you saw and heard .
he led you through the desert for 40 years , and in all that time , your clothes and sandals did not wear out .
“ you came to this place , and king sihon of heshbon and king og of bashan came out to fight against us . but we defeated them .
then we took their land and gave it to the people in the tribes of reuben and gad and to half the tribe of manasseh .
if you obey all the commands in this agreement , you will continue to succeed in everything you do .
your wives and children are here and also the foreigners living among you—the people who cut your wood and bring you water .
you are all here to enter into an agreement with the lord your god . the lord your god is making this agreement with you today .
the lord is making this agreement with its promises with you people , but not only with you .
you remember how we lived in the land of egypt . and you remember how we traveled through the countries that were on our way here .
you saw their hated things—the idols they had made from wood , stone , silver , and gold .
“ all the other nations will ask , ‘ why did the lord do this to this land ? why was he so angry ? ’
the israelites started serving other gods—gods they never worshiped before . the lord told his people not to worship those gods .
that is why the lord became very angry with the people of this land . so he brought to them all the curses that are written in this book .
even if you were sent to the farthest parts of the earth , the lord your god will gather you from there and bring you back .
“ then the lord your god will make all these bad things happen to your enemies , who hate you and cause you trouble .
and you will again obey the lord . you will obey all his commands that i give you today .
“ this command that i give you today is not too hard for you . it is not a secret hidden in some far away land .
no , the word is very near to you . it is in your mouth and in your heart . so you can obey it .
“ today i have given you a choice between life and death , success and disaster .
but if you turn away from your god and refuse to listen , if you are led away to worship and serve other gods ,
then moses went and spoke these words to all the israelites .
“ the lord destroyed sihon and og . he destroyed those amorite kings and he will do the same thing for you again !
the lord will help you defeat these nations . but you must do to them everything i told you to do .
the lord appeared at the tent in a tall cloud . the tall cloud stood over the entrance of the tent .
and i will refuse to help them , because they have done evil and worshiped other gods .
so that same day moses wrote down the song and taught it to the israelites .
moses carefully wrote all these teachings in a book . when he finished ,
he gave a command to the levites . ( these men carry the lord ’ s box of the agreement . ) moses said ,
all the israelites were gathered together , and moses sang this whole song for them :
“ skies , listen and i will speak .
my teachings will come like the rain ,
“ the lord is the rock ,
and you are not really his children .
is this the way you repay the lord for all he has done for you ?
“ remember the days of the past .
god most high separated the people on earth
the lord chose his people to be his own .
“ the lord found them in the desert ,
like an eagle when she makes her young leave the nest to fly .
the lord alone led his people .
the lord helped them take control of the hill country .
he gave his people butter from the herd and milk from the flock .
“ but jeshurun became fat and kicked like a bull .
they made him jealous by worshiping other gods .
they offered sacrifices to demons—gods that are not god .
you people left the rock who made you ;
“ the lord saw this and became upset .
so he said , ‘ i will turn away from them ,
they made me jealous with things that are not really gods .
my anger will burn like a fire ,
“ ‘ i will bring troubles to the israelites .
they will become thin from hunger .
in the streets , soldiers will kill them .
“ ‘ i thought about destroying the israelites
but i know what their enemies would say .
“ they are foolish .
if they were wise ,
can one person chase away 1000 men ?
the ‘ rock ’ of our enemies is not strong like our rock .
their vines and fields will be destroyed
their wine is like the poison of deadly snakes .
“ the lord says , ‘ i am saving that punishment .
i will punish them for the bad things they did .
“ the lord will judge his people .
then the lord will say , ‘ where are the false gods ?
those false gods ate the fat of your sacrifices .
“ ‘ now , see that i , and only i , am god !
i raise my hand toward heaven and make this promise .
my enemies will be killed and taken as prisoners .
“ the whole world should be happy for god ’ s people !
moses and joshua son of nun came and sang all the words of this song for the israelites to hear .
when moses finished giving these teachings to the people ,
the lord spoke to moses that same day . he said ,
you will die on that mountain . you will go to be with your people , the same as your brother aaron died on mount hor .
so now you may see the land that i am giving to the israelites . but you can not go into that land . ”
this is the blessing that moses , the man of god , gave the israelites before he died :
“ the lord came from sinai ,
yes , the lord loves his people .
moses gave us the law .
at that time the israelites
“ let reuben live , and not die !
moses said this about judah :
moses said this about levi :
they were more loyal to you , lord , than to their own families .
they will teach your rules to jacob
“ lord , bless everything levi has .
moses said this about benjamin :
moses said this about joseph :
let the sun give them good fruit .
let the hills and ancient mountains
let the earth give its best to joseph .
joseph is like a powerful bull .
moses said this about zebulun :
they will call the people to their mountain .
moses said this about gad :
he chose the best part for himself .
moses said this about dan :
moses said this about naphtali :
moses said this about asher :
your gates will have locks made from iron and bronze .
“ there is no one like the god of israel !
so israel will live in safety .
israel , you are blessed .
he showed him all the land of naphtali , ephraim , and manasseh . he showed him all the land of judah as far as the mediterranean sea .
he showed moses the negev and the valley that goes from zoar to jericho , the city of palm trees .
then moses , the lord ’ s servant , died there in the land of moab . the lord had told moses this would happen .
he buried moses in moab . this was in the valley across from beth peor . but even today , no one knows exactly where moses ’ grave is .
moses was 120 years old when he died . he was as strong as ever , and his eyes were still good .
the israelites cried for moses for 30 days . they stayed in the jordan valley in moab until the time of sadness was finished .
israel never had another prophet like moses : the lord knew moses face to face .
the lord sent moses to do powerful miracles in the land of egypt . pharaoh , all his officers , and all the people in egypt saw those miracles .
no other prophet ever did as many powerful and amazing things as moses did for the israelites to see .
these are the words from the teacher , a son of david and king of jerusalem .
everything is so meaningless . the teacher says that it is all a waste of time !
do people really gain anything from all the hard work they do in this life ?
people live and people die , but the earth continues forever .
the sun rises and the sun goes down , and then it hurries to rise again in the same place .
all rivers flow again and again to the same place . they all flow to the sea , but the sea never becomes full .
someone might say , “ look , this is new , ” but that thing has always been here . it was here before we were .
i , the teacher , was king over israel in jerusalem .
i looked at everything done on earth , and i saw that it is all a waste of time . it is like trying to catch the wind .
if something is crooked , you can not say it is straight . and if something is missing , you can not say it is there .
with much wisdom comes frustration . the one who gains more wisdom also gains more sorrow .
i said to myself , “ i should have fun—i should enjoy everything as much as i can. ” but i learned that this is also useless .
it is foolish to laugh all the time . having fun does not do any good .
then i began doing great things . i built houses , and i planted vineyards for myself .
i planted gardens , and i made parks . i planted all kinds of fruit trees .
i made pools of water for myself , and i used them to water my growing trees .
i became very rich and famous . i was greater than anyone who lived in jerusalem before me . my wisdom was always there to help me .
i saw that wisdom is better than foolishness in the same way that light is better than darkness .
wise people use their minds like eyes to see where they are going . but for fools , it is as if they are walking in the dark .
this made me hate life . it was depressing to think that everything in this life is useless , like trying to catch the wind .
so i became sad about all the work i had done .
what do people really have after all their work and struggling in this life ?
there is a right time for everything , and everything on earth will happen at the right time .
there is a time to be born
there is a time to kill
there is a time to cry
there is a time to throw weapons down
there is a time to look for something
there is a time to tear cloth
there is a time to love
do people really gain anything from their hard work ?
i saw all the hard work god gave us to do .
i learned that the best thing for people to do is to be happy and enjoy themselves as long as they live .
god wants everyone to eat , drink , and enjoy their work . these are gifts from god .
what happened in the past has happened , and what will happen in the future will happen . but god wants to help those who have been treated badly .
i also saw these things in this life : i saw that the courts should be filled with goodness and fairness , but there is evil there now .
i thought about what people do to each other . and i said to myself , “ god wants people to see that they are like animals .
i decided that it is better for those who have died than for those who are still alive .
and it is even better for those who die at birth , because they never saw the evil that is done in this world .
some people say , “ it is foolish to fold your hands and do nothing . if you don ’ t work , you will starve to death . ”
maybe that is true . but i say it is better to be satisfied with the few things you have than to always be struggling to get more .
again i saw something else that didn ’ t make sense :
two people are better than one . when two people work together , they get more work done .
if one person falls , the other person can reach out to help . but those who are alone when they fall have no one to help them .
if two people sleep together , they will be warm . but a person sleeping alone will not be warm .
a young leader who is poor but wise is better than a king who is old but foolish . that old king does not listen to warnings .
maybe the young ruler was born a poor man in the kingdom . and maybe he came from prison to rule the country .
but i have watched people in this life , and i know this : people will follow that young man . he will become the new king .
bad dreams come from too many worries ,
it is better to promise nothing than to promise something and not be able to do it .
you should not let your useless dreams and bragging bring you trouble . you should respect god .
even the king is a slave—his country owns him .
there is a very sad thing that i have seen happen in this life . people save their money for the future .
then something bad happens and they lose everything . so they have nothing to give to their children .
it is very sad that people leave the world just as they came . so what does a person gain from “ trying to catch the wind ” ?
they only get days that are filled with sadness and sorrow . in the end , they are troubled , sick , and angry .
i have seen another thing in this life that is not fair and is very hard to understand .
it is senseless when a baby is born dead . the baby is quickly buried in a dark grave , without even a name .
the baby never saw the sun and never knew anything . but the baby finds more rest than the man who never enjoyed what god gave him .
people work and work to feed themselves , but they are never satisfied .
a good reputation is better than expensive pleasures .
it is better to go to a funeral than to a party ,
sorrow is even better than laughter ,
a wise person thinks about death ,
it is better to be criticized by the wise
the laughter of fools is such a waste .
even the wise will forget their wisdom ,
it is better to finish something
don ’ t become angry quickly ,
don ’ t say , “ life was better in the ‘ good old days . ’
wisdom is better if you also have property . wise people will get more than enough wealth .
wisdom and money can protect you . but knowledge gained through wisdom is even better—it can save your life .
look at what god has made . you can not change a thing , even if you think it is wrong .
in my short life , i have seen everything . i have seen good people die young , and i have seen evil people live long lives .
try to be a little of this and a little of that . even god ’ s followers will do some good things and some bad things .
surely there is no one on earth who always does good and never sins . but wisdom can make one person stronger than ten leaders in a city .
don ’ t listen to everything people say . you might hear your own servant saying bad things about you .
and you know that many times you too have said bad things about other people .
i used my wisdom and thought about all these things . i wanted to be wise , but i couldn ’ t do it .
i can not understand why things are as they are . it is too hard for anyone to understand .
i studied and i tried very hard to find true wisdom . i tried to find a reason for everything .
“ there is one other thing i have learned . god made people good , but they have found many ways to be bad . ”
no one can understand and explain things the way wise people can . their wisdom makes them happy . it changes a sad face into a happy one .
i say you should always obey the king ’ s command . do this because you made a promise to god .
he has the authority to give commands , and no one can tell him what to do .
there is a right time and a right way to do everything . you must decide what you should do , even when it might cause problems
and you are not sure what will happen . no one can tell you what will happen in the future .
a sinner might do a hundred evil things and still live a long time . but i know that it is still better to obey and respect god .
i carefully studied the things people do in this life . i saw how busy people are . they work day and night , and they almost never sleep .
there is hope for those who are still alive—it does not matter who they are . but this saying is true :
the living know that they will die , but the dead don ’ t know anything . they have no more reward . people will soon forget them .
after people are dead , their love , hate , and jealousy are all gone . and they will never again share in what happens on earth .
so go and eat your food now and enjoy it . drink your wine and be happy . it is all right with god if you do these things .
wear nice clothes and make yourself look good .
i also saw a person doing a wise thing in this life , and it seemed very important to me .
there was a small town with a few people in it . a great king fought against that town and put his armies all around it .
words spoken by the wise are heard more clearly
wisdom is better than weapons of war ,
a few dead flies will make even the best perfume stink . in the same way , a little foolishness can ruin much wisdom and honor .
the thoughts of the wise lead them the right way , but the thoughts of the foolish lead them the wrong way .
fools show how foolish they are , just walking down the road . their minds are empty , and everyone knows it .
don ’ t quit your job simply because the boss is angry with you . if you remain calm and helpful , you can correct even great mistakes .
here is something else that i have seen in this life that isn ’ t fair . it is the kind of mistake that rulers make .
fools are given important positions , while the rich get jobs that are not important .
i have seen servants riding on horses , while rulers were walking beside them like slaves .
if you dig a hole , you might fall into it . if you break down a wall , you might be bitten by a snake .
someone might know how to control snakes . but that skill is useless if a snake bites when that person is not around .
words from the wise bring praise ,
fools begin by saying something foolish . but in the end , they speak nonsense .
fools are always talking about what they will do , but you never know what will happen . people can not tell what will happen in the future .
fools aren ’ t smart enough to find their way home ,
if someone is too lazy to work ,
people enjoy eating , and wine makes life happier . but money solves a lot of problems .
do good wherever you go . after a while , the good you do will come back to you .
invest what you have in several different things . you don ’ t know what bad things might happen on earth .
it is good to be alive . it is nice to see the light from the sun .
remember your creator while you are young , before the bad times come—before the years come when you say , “ i have wasted my life . ”
remember your creator while you are young ,
your body came from the earth .
everything is so meaningless . the teacher says that it is all a waste of time !
the teacher was very wise . he used his wisdom to teach the people . he very carefully studied and arranged many wise teachings .
the teacher tried very hard to find the right words , and he wrote the teachings that are true and dependable .
greetings from paul , an apostle of christ jesus . i am an apostle because that is what god wanted .
grace and peace to you from god our father and the lord jesus christ .
praise be to the god and father of our lord jesus christ . in christ , god has given us every spiritual blessing in heaven .
in christ we are made free by his blood sacrifice . we have forgiveness of sins because of god ’ s rich grace .
god gave us that grace fully and freely . with full wisdom and understanding
he let us know his secret plan . this was what god wanted , and he planned to do it through christ .
we jews were the first to hope in christ . and we were chosen so that we would bring praise to god in all his glory .
and you will know that god ’ s power is very great for us who believe . it is the same as the mighty power
he used to raise christ from death and put him at his right side in the heavenly places .
god put everything under christ ’ s power and made him head over everything for the church .
the church is christ ’ s body . it is filled with him . he makes everything complete in every way .
in the past you were spiritually dead because of your sins and the things you did against god .
but god is rich in mercy , and he loved us very much .
yes , it is because we are a part of christ jesus that god raised us from death and seated us together with him in the heavenly places .
god did this so that his kindness to us who belong to christ jesus would clearly show for all time to come the amazing richness of his grace .
i mean that you have been saved by grace because you believed . you did not save yourselves ; it was a gift from god .
you are not saved by the things you have done , so there is nothing to boast about .
yes , through christ we all have the right to come to the father in one spirit .
the whole building is joined together in christ , and he makes it grow and become a holy temple in the lord .
and in christ you are being built together with his other people . you are being made into a place where god lives through the spirit .
so i , paul , am a prisoner because i serve christ jesus for you who are not jews .
surely you know that god gave me this work through his grace to help you .
god let me know his secret plan by showing it to me . i have already written a little about this .
and if you read what i wrote , you can see that i understand the secret truth about christ .
by god ’ s special gift of grace , i became a servant to tell that good news . he gave me that grace by using his power .
this agrees with the plan god had since the beginning of time . he did what he planned , and he did it through christ jesus our lord .
in christ we come before god with freedom and without fear . we can do this because of our faith in christ .
so i ask you not to be discouraged because of what is happening to me . my sufferings are for your benefit—for your honor and glory .
so i bow in prayer before the father .
every family in heaven and on earth gets its true name from him .
i ask the father with his great glory to give you the power to be strong in your spirits . he will give you that strength through his spirit .
i pray that christ will live in your hearts because of your faith . i pray that your life will be strong in love and be built on love .
with god ’ s power working in us , he can do much , much more than anything we can ask or think of .
to him be glory in the church and in christ jesus for all time , forever and ever . amen .
always be humble and gentle . be patient and accept each other with love .
you are joined together with peace through the spirit . do all you can to continue as you are , letting peace hold you together .
there is one body and one spirit , and god chose you to have one hope .
there is one lord , one faith , and one baptism .
there is one god and father of us all , who rules over everyone . he works through all of us and in all of us .
christ gave each one of us a special gift . everyone received what he wanted to give them .
that is why the scriptures say ,
when it says , “ he went up , ” what does it mean ? it means that he first came down low to earth .
so christ came down , and he is the same one who went up . he went up above the highest heaven in order to fill everything with himself .
christ gave these gifts to prepare god ’ s holy people for the work of serving , to make the body of christ stronger .
no , we will speak the truth with love . we will grow to be like christ in every way . he is the head ,
they have no understanding , and they know nothing because they refuse to listen . so they can not have the life that god gives .
they have lost their feeling of shame and use their lives to do what is morally wrong . more and more they want to do all kinds of evil .
but that way of life is nothing like what you learned when you came to know christ .
i know that you heard about him , and in him you were taught the truth . yes , the truth is in jesus .
you must be made new in your hearts and in your thinking .
be that new person who was made to be like god , truly good and pleasing to him .
“ when you are angry , don ’ t let that anger make you sin , ” and don ’ t stay angry all day .
don ’ t give the devil a way to defeat you .
never be bitter , angry , or mad . never shout angrily or say things to hurt others . never do anything evil .
be kind and loving to each other . forgive each other the same as god forgave you through christ .
you are god ’ s dear children , so try to be like him .
live a life of love . love others just as christ loved us . he gave himself for us—a sweet-smelling offering and sacrifice to god .
don ’ t let anyone fool you with words that are not true . god gets very angry when people who don ’ t obey him talk like that .
so don ’ t have anything to do with them .
in the past you were full of darkness , but now you are full of light in the lord . so live like children who belong to the light .
this light produces every kind of goodness , right living , and truth .
try to learn what pleases the lord .
have no part in the things that people in darkness do , which produce nothing good . instead , tell everyone how wrong those things are .
actually , it is shameful to even talk about the things those people do in secret .
but the light makes clear how wrong those things are .
yes , everything is made clear by the light . this is why we say ,
so be very careful how you live . live wisely , not like fools .
i mean that you should use every opportunity you have for doing good , because these are evil times .
so don ’ t be foolish with your lives , but learn what the lord wants you to do .
don ’ t be drunk with wine , which will ruin your life , but be filled with the spirit .
encourage each other with psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs . sing and make music in your hearts to the lord .
always give thanks to god the father for everything in the name of our lord jesus christ .
be willing to serve each other out of respect for christ .
wives , be willing to serve your husbands the same as the lord .
the church serves under christ , so it is the same with you wives . you should be willing to serve your husbands in everything .
husbands , love your wives the same as christ loved the church and gave his life for it .
he died to make the church holy . he used the telling of the good news to make the church clean by washing it with water .
and husbands should love their wives like that . they should love their wives as they love their own bodies . the man who loves his wife loves himself ,
because no one ever hates his own body , but feeds and takes care of it . and that is what christ does for the church
because we are parts of his body .
the scriptures say , “ that is why a man will leave his father and mother and join his wife , and the two people will become one . ”
that secret truth is very important—i am talking about christ and the church .
but each one of you must love his wife as he loves himself . and a wife must respect her husband .
children , obey your parents the way the lord wants , because this is the right thing to do .
the command says , “ you must respect your father and mother. ” this is the first command that has a promise with it .
and this is the promise : “ then all will go well with you , and you will have a long life on the earth . ”
fathers , don ’ t make your children angry , but raise them with the kind of teaching and training you learn from the lord .
slaves , obey your masters here on earth with fear and respect . and do this with a heart that is true , just as you obey christ .
do your work , and be happy to do it . work as though it is the lord you are serving , not just an earthly master .
remember that the lord will give everyone a reward for doing good . everyone , slave or free , will get a reward for the good things they do .
to end my letter i tell you , be strong in the lord and in his great power .
wear the full armor of god . wear god ’ s armor so that you can fight against the devil ’ s clever tricks .
so stand strong with the belt of truth tied around your waist , and on your chest wear the protection of right living .
on your feet wear the good news of peace to help you stand strong .
and also use the shield of faith with which you can stop all the burning arrows that come from the evil one .
accept god ’ s salvation as your helmet . and take the sword of the spirit—that sword is the teaching of god .
also pray for me—that when i speak , god will give me words so that i can tell the secret truth about the good news without fear .
that ’ s why i am sending him—to let you know how we are and to encourage you .
i pray that god the father and the lord jesus christ will give peace and love with faith to all the brothers and sisters there .
god ’ s grace to all of you who love our lord jesus christ with love that never ends .
this is what happened during the time when xerxes was king . xerxes ruled over the 127 provinces from india to ethiopia .
king xerxes ruled from his throne in the capital city of susa .
wine was served in golden cups , and every cup was different . there was plenty of the king ’ s wine , because the king was very generous .
queen vashti also gave a party for the women in the king ’ s palace .
but when the eunuchs told queen vashti about the king ’ s command , she refused to come . then the king was very angry .
the king and his important officials were happy with this advice , so king xerxes did as memucan suggested .
later , king xerxes stopped being angry . then he remembered vashti and what she had done . he remembered his commands about her .
then the king ’ s personal servants had a suggestion . they said , “ search for beautiful young virgins for the king .
mordecai had been carried into captivity from jerusalem by king nebuchadnezzar of babylon . he was with the group that was taken into captivity with king jehoiachin of judah .
esther didn ’ t tell anyone she was a jew . she didn ’ t tell anyone about her family background , because mordecai had told her not to .
when her time came to go in to the king , she could choose to wear or take whatever she wanted from the women ’ s living area .
mordecai was sitting next to the king ’ s gate at the time the young women were gathered together the second time .
when haman saw that mordecai refused to bow down to him or give him honor , he was very angry .
so the king took the official ring off his finger and gave it to haman son of hammedatha the agagite . haman was the enemy of the jews .
then the king said to haman , “ keep the money . do what you want with them . ”
but mordecai went only as far as the king ’ s gate . no one was allowed to enter the gate dressed in sackcloth .
so hathach went out to where mordecai was in the open place of the city in front of the king ’ s gate .
hathach went back and told esther everything mordecai had said .
then esther told hathach to say this to mordecai :
so mordecai went away and did everything esther told him to do .
esther said , “ i have prepared a party for you and haman . will you and haman please come to the party today ? ”
then the king said , “ bring haman quickly so that we may do what esther asks . ”
esther answered , “ this is what i want to ask for :
but haman controlled his anger and went home . then haman called together his friends and his wife , zeresh .
but all this means nothing to me . i can not be happy as long as i see that jew mordecai sitting at the king ’ s gate . ”
then the king asked , “ what honor and good things have been given to mordecai for this ? ”
the king ’ s servants said , “ haman is standing in the courtyard . ”
so haman answered the king , “ do this for the man the king loves to honor :
after that mordecai went back to the king ’ s gate , but haman hurried home with his head covered because he was embarrassed and ashamed .
so the king and haman went to eat with queen esther .
then king xerxes asked queen esther , “ who did this to you ? where is the man who dared to do such a thing to your people ? ”
esther said , “ the man against us , our enemy , is this wicked haman . ”
so they hanged haman on the hanging post he had built for mordecai . then the king stopped being angry .
then the king held out the gold scepter to esther . esther got up and stood in front of the king .
it was an especially happy day for the jews , a day of great joy and happiness .
the jews defeated all their enemies . they used swords to kill and destroy them . they did what they wanted to the people who hated them .
they killed and destroyed 500 men in the capital city of susa .
they also killed these men : parshandatha , dalphon , aspatha ,
poratha , adalia , aridatha ,
parmashta , arisai , aridai , and vaizatha .
that day the king heard how many men had been killed in the capital city of susa .
so the king gave the command that it should be done . so the law was given in susa , and they hanged haman ’ s ten sons .
this happened on the 13th day of the month adar . on the 14th day the jews rested and made that day a happy day of feasting .
he did this to tell the jews to celebrate purim every year on the 14th and 15th days of the month of adar .
so the jews agreed to do what mordecai had written to them . and they agreed to continue the celebration they had begun .
esther ’ s letter made the rules for purim official , and these things were written down in a book .
king xerxes made people pay taxes . all the people in the kingdom , even the faraway cities on the seacoast , had to pay taxes .
when jacob ( israel ) went to egypt , his sons and their families went with him . here are the names of those sons :
reuben , simeon , levi , judah ,
issachar , zebulun , benjamin ,
dan , naphtali , gad , and asher .
another son , joseph , was already in egypt . so jacob ’ s whole family was with him in egypt—70 descendants in all .
later , joseph , his brothers , and all the people of that generation died .
but the israelites had many children , and their number grew until the country of egypt was filled with them .
then a new king began to rule egypt . he did not know joseph .
this king said to his people , “ look at the israelites . there are too many of them , and they are stronger than we are !
so the egyptians made them work even harder .
there were two hebrew nurses who helped the israelite women give birth . they were named shiphrah and puah . the king of egypt said to the nurses ,
but the nurses trusted god , so they did not obey the king ’ s command . they let all the baby boys live .
the king of egypt called for the nurses and asked them , “ why did you do this ? why did you let the baby boys live ? ”
the nurses trusted god , so he was good to them and allowed them to have their own families .
there was a man from the family of levi who decided to marry a woman from the tribe of levi .
she became pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy . the mother saw how beautiful the baby was and hid him for three months .
the baby ’ s sister stayed and watched to see what would happen to the baby .
the king ’ s daughter said , “ yes , please . ”
moses looked around and saw that no one was watching , so he killed the egyptian and buried him in the sand .
pharaoh heard about what moses did , so he decided to kill him . but moses ran away from pharaoh and went to the land of midian .
then they went back to their father , reuel . he asked them , “ why have you come home early today ? ”
the girls answered , “ the shepherds chased us away , but an egyptian rescued us . he got water for us and gave it to our animals . ”
so reuel said to his daughters , “ where is this man ? why did you leave him ? go invite him to eat with us . ”
moses was happy to stay with that man . reuel let moses marry his daughter , zipporah .
zipporah became pregnant and had a son . moses named him gershom because moses was a stranger in a land that was not his own .
god heard their painful cries and remembered the agreement he made with abraham , isaac , and jacob .
god saw the troubles of the israelites , and he knew that he would soon help them .
on that mountain , moses saw the angel of the lord in a burning bush .
so he decided to go closer to the bush and see how a bush could continue burning without being burned up .
the lord saw moses was coming to look at the bush . so he called to him from the bush . he said , “ moses , moses ! ”
then god said , “ don ’ t come any closer . take off your sandals . you are standing on holy ground .
i am the god of your ancestors . i am the god of abraham , the god of isaac , and the god of jacob . ”
i have heard the cries of the israelites , and i have seen the way the egyptians have made life hard for them .
so now i am sending you to pharaoh . go ! lead my people , the israelites , out of egypt . ”
“ but i know that the pharaoh will not let you go . only a great power will force him to let you go ,
and i will cause the egyptians to be kind to the israelites . they will give many gifts to your people when they leave egypt .
but the lord said to moses , “ what is that you have in your hand ? ”
then god said , “ throw your walking stick on the ground . ”
but the lord said to him , “ reach out and grab the snake by its tail . ”
then the lord said to moses , “ i will give you another proof . put your hand under your robe . ”
so go . i will be with you when you speak . i will give you the words to say . ”
but moses said , “ my lord , i beg you to send someone else , not me . ”
so aaron will speak for you . like god , you will speak to him , and he will tell the people what you say .
so go and carry your walking stick with you . use it and the other miracles to show the people that i am with you . ”
so moses put his wife and children on the donkey and returned to egypt . he carried his walking stick with him—the walking stick with the power of god .
then you should say to pharaoh , ‘ this is what the lord says : israel is my firstborn son .
on the way to egypt , moses stopped at a place to spend the night . the lord met moses at that place and tried to kill him .
zipporah said this because she had to circumcise her son . so god let moses live .
moses told aaron everything the lord had commanded him to say and all the miracles he must do to prove that god had sent him .
so moses and aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the israelites .
then aaron spoke to the people and told them everything the lord had told moses . then moses did the miracles for all the people to see ,
but pharaoh said to them , “ moses and aaron , you are bothering the workers . let them do their work . go back to your own work !
there are very many workers , and you are keeping them from doing their jobs . ”
that same day pharaoh gave a command to the slave masters and hebrew foremen .
so make these people work harder . keep them busy . then they will not have enough time to listen to the lies of moses . ”
you must go and get the straw for yourselves . so go and find straw , but you must still make as many bricks as you made before . ”
so the people went everywhere in egypt looking for straw .
the slave masters forced the people to work even harder . they forced the people to make as many bricks as before .
then the hebrew foremen went to pharaoh . they complained and said , “ we are your servants . why are you treating us like this ?
now , go back to work ! we will not give you any straw . and you must still make as many bricks as you did before . ”
the hebrew foremen knew they were in trouble , because the pharaoh had told them , “ you must still make as many bricks as you made before . ”
when they were leaving the meeting with pharaoh , they passed moses and aaron . moses and aaron were waiting for them .
then moses prayed to the lord and said , “ lord , why have you done this terrible thing to your people ? why did you send me here ?
then god said to moses , “ i am the lord .
i appeared to abraham , isaac , and jacob . they called me god all-powerful . they did not know my name , the lord .
i made an agreement with them . i promised to give them the land of canaan . they lived in that land , but it was not their own .
now , i have heard their painful cries . i know that they are slaves in egypt . and i remember my agreement .
so moses told this to the israelites , but the people would not listen to him . they were working so hard that they were not patient with moses .
then the lord said to moses ,
“ go tell pharaoh that he must let the israelites leave his land . ”
these are the names of the leaders of the families of israel :
simeon ’ s sons were jemuel , jamin , ohad , jakin , zohar , and shaul . ( shaul was the son from a canaanite woman ) .
levi lived 137 years . his sons were gershon , kohath , and merari .
gershon had two sons , libni and shimei .
kohath lived 133 years . his sons were amram , izhar , hebron , and uzziel .
merari ’ s sons were mahli and mushi .
amram lived 137 years . he married his father ’ s sister , jochebed . amram and jochebed gave birth to aaron and moses .
izhar ’ s sons were korah , nepheg , and zicri .
uzziel ’ s sons were mishael , elzaphan , and sithri .
the sons of korah ( that is , the ancestors of the korahites ) were assir , elkanah , and abiasaph .
aaron ’ s son , eleazar , married a daughter of putiel . she gave birth to phinehas .
aaron and moses are the men who talked to pharaoh , the king of egypt , and told him to let the israelites leave egypt .
the lord spoke to moses again in the land of egypt .
he said , “ i am the lord . tell the king of egypt everything i tell you . ”
you will tell aaron everything that i command you . then he will tell the king what i say . and pharaoh will let the israelites leave this country .
i will punish the people of egypt , and they will learn that i am the lord . then i will lead my people out of their country . ”
moses and aaron did what the lord told them .
moses was 80 years old at the time , and aaron was 83 .
the lord said to moses and aaron ,
so pharaoh called for his wise men and magicians . these men used their magic , and they were able to do the same thing as aaron .
they threw their walking sticks on the ground , and their sticks became snakes . but then aaron ’ s walking stick ate theirs .
pharaoh still refused to let the people go , just as the lord had said . pharaoh refused to listen to moses and aaron .
then the lord said to moses , “ pharaoh is being stubborn . he refuses to let the people go .
the magicians used their magic to do the same thing . so pharaoh refused to listen to moses and aaron . this happened just as the lord said .
pharaoh ignored what moses and aaron had done . he turned and went into his house .
the egyptians could not drink the water from the river , so they dug wells around the river for water to drink .
seven days passed after the lord changed the nile river .
then the lord told moses , “ go to pharaoh and tell him that the lord says , ‘ let my people go to worship me !
if you refuse to let my people go , then i will fill egypt with frogs .
the frogs will be all over you , your people , and your officials . ’ ”
so aaron raised his hand over the waters of egypt , and the frogs began coming out of the water and covered the land of egypt .
the magicians used their magic to do the same thing—so even more frogs came out onto the land in egypt !
pharaoh said , “ tomorrow . ”
the frogs will leave you , your house , your officials , and your people . they will remain only in the river . ”
moses and aaron left pharaoh . moses prayed to the lord about the frogs he had sent against pharaoh .
and the lord did what moses asked . the frogs died in the houses , in the yards , and in the fields .
they began to rot , and the whole country began to stink .
so the magicians told pharaoh that the power of god did this . but pharaoh refused to listen to them . this happened just as the lord had said .
so tomorrow i will treat my people differently from your people . this will be my proof . ’ ”
so pharaoh called for moses and aaron and told them , “ offer sacrifices to your god here in this country . ”
let us go three days into the desert and offer sacrifices to the lord our god . this is what he told us to do . ”
so moses left pharaoh and prayed to the lord .
and the lord did what moses asked . he removed the flies from pharaoh , his officials , and his people . none of the flies remained .
but pharaoh again became stubborn and did not let the people go .
if you continue to hold them and refuse to let them go ,
but the lord will treat israel ’ s animals differently from the animals of egypt . none of the animals that belong to the israelites will die .
the lord has set the time for this to happen . he said , ‘ tomorrow the lord will make this happen in this country . ’ ”
the magicians could not stop moses from doing this , because even the magicians had the sores . this happened everywhere in egypt .
but the lord made pharaoh stubborn , so he refused to listen to moses and aaron , just as the lord had said .
i could use my power and cause a disease that would wipe you and your people off the earth .
you are still against my people . you are not letting them go free .
some of pharaoh ’ s officials paid attention to the lord ’ s message . they quickly put all of their animals and slaves into houses .
but other people ignored the lord ’ s message and lost all their slaves and animals that were in the fields .
the hail was falling , and lightning was flashing all through it . it was the worst hailstorm that had ever hit egypt since it had become a nation .
the only place that did not get hail was the land of goshen , where the israelites lived .
pharaoh sent for moses and aaron and told them , “ this time i have sinned . the lord is right , and i and my people are wrong .
but i know that you and your officials don ’ t really fear and respect the lord yet . ”
the flax had already developed its seeds , and the barley was already blooming . so these plants were destroyed .
but wheat and spelt ripen later than the other grains , so these plants were not destroyed .
when pharaoh saw that the rain , hail , and thunder had stopped , he again did wrong . he and his officials became stubborn again .
pharaoh refused to let the israelites go free , just as the lord had said through moses .
if you refuse to let my people go , then tomorrow i will bring locusts into your country .
pharaoh quickly called for moses and aaron . pharaoh said , “ i have sinned against the lord your god and against you .
now , forgive me for my sins this time . ask the lord to remove this ‘ death ’ from me . ”
moses left pharaoh and prayed to the lord .
but the lord caused pharaoh to be stubborn again , and pharaoh did not let the israelites go .
then the lord told moses , “ raise your hand into the air and darkness will cover egypt . it will be so dark you can feel it ! ”
so moses raised his hand into the air and a cloud of darkness covered egypt . the darkness stayed in egypt for three days .
the lord made pharaoh stubborn again , so he refused to let them go .
then moses told pharaoh , “ you are right about one thing . i will not come to see you again . ”
moses said to the king , “ the lord says , ‘ at midnight tonight , i will go through egypt ,
the crying in egypt will be worse than at any time in the past or any time in the future .
then the lord told moses , “ the reason pharaoh did not listen to you is so that i could show my great power in egypt . ”
while moses and aaron were still in egypt , the lord spoke to them . he said ,
“ this month will be the first month of the year for you .
this command is for the whole community of israel : on the tenth day of this month each man must get one lamb for the people in his house .
the lamb must be a one-year-old male , and it must be completely healthy . this animal can be either a young sheep or a young goat .
you must collect the blood from these animals and put it on the top and sides of the doorframe of every house where the people eat this meal .
“ on this night you must roast the lamb and eat all the meat . you must also eat bitter herbs and bread made without yeast .
you must eat all the meat that night . if any of the meat is left until morning , you must burn it in the fire .
“ you will always remember tonight—it will be a special festival for you . your descendants will honor the lord with this festival forever .
during this festival you must not eat any yeast . you must eat bread without yeast wherever you live . ”
so moses called all the elders together and told them , “ get the lambs for your families . kill the lambs for the passover .
you must remember this command . this law is for you and your descendants forever .
you must remember to do this even when you go to the land the lord is giving you .
when your children ask you , ‘ why are we doing this ceremony ? ’
the lord had given this command to moses and aaron , so the israelites did what the lord commanded .
that night someone died in every house in egypt . pharaoh , his officials , and all the people of egypt began to cry loudly .
take all of your sheep and cattle with you , just as you said you would . go ! and say a blessing for me too . ”
the people of egypt also asked them to hurry and leave . they said , “ if you don ’ t leave , we will all die ! ”
the israelites did not have time to put the yeast in their bread . they just wrapped the bowls of dough with cloth and carried them on their shoulders .
then the israelites did what moses asked them to do . they went to their egyptian neighbors and asked for clothing and things made from silver and gold .
the lord caused the egyptians to be kind to the israelites , so the egyptians gave their riches to the israelites .
the israelites traveled from rameses to succoth . there were about 600,000 men , not counting the small boys .
a great number of people who were not israelites went with them , along with many sheep , cattle , and other livestock .
the israelites had lived in egypt for 430 years .
after 430 years , to the very day , all the armies of the lord left egypt .
the lord told moses and aaron , “ these are the rules for passover : no foreigner is allowed to eat the passover meal .
the whole community of israel must do this ceremony .
the same rules are for everyone . it doesn ’ t matter if they are citizens or foreigners living among you . ”
so all the israelites obeyed the commands that the lord gave to moses and aaron .
on that same day the lord led all the israelites out of the country of egypt . the people left in groups .
then the lord said to moses ,
today , in the month of abib , you are leaving egypt .
“ for seven days , you must eat only bread without yeast . on the seventh day there will be a great festival to show honor to the lord .
so for seven days , you must not eat any bread made with yeast . there must be no bread with yeast any place in your land .
on this day you should tell your children , ‘ we are having this festival because the lord took me out of egypt . ’
so remember this festival every year at the right time .
you must remember to give the lord every firstborn boy . and every male animal that is the firstborn must also be given to the lord .
so god led them another way through the desert by the red sea . the israelites were dressed for war when they left egypt .
the israelites left succoth and camped at etham . etham was near the desert .
the cloud was always with them during the day , and the column of fire was always with them at night .
then the lord said to moses ,
“ tell the people to go back to pi hahiroth . tell them to spend the night between migdol and the red sea , near baal zephon .
pharaoh will think that the israelites are lost in the desert and that the people will have no place to go .
so pharaoh prepared his chariot and took his men with him .
he took 600 of his best men and all of his chariots . there was an officer in each chariot .
when the israelites saw pharaoh and his army coming toward them , they were very frightened and cried to the lord for help .
you will not have to do anything but stay calm . the lord will do the fighting for you . ”
then the lord said to moses , “ why are you still crying to me ? tell the israelites to start moving .
raise the walking stick in your hand over the red sea , and the sea will split . then the people can go across on dry land .
then egypt will know that i am the lord . they will honor me when i defeat pharaoh and his horse soldiers and chariots . ”
the israelites went through the sea on dry land . the water was like a wall on their right and on their left .
then all of pharaoh ’ s chariots and horse soldiers followed them into the sea .
early that morning the lord looked down from the tall cloud and column of fire at the egyptian army . then he made them panic .
then the lord told moses , “ raise your hand over the sea to make the water fall and cover the egyptian chariots and horse soldiers . ”
but the israelites crossed the sea on dry land . the water was like a wall on their right and on their left .
then moses and the israelites began singing this song to the lord :
the lord is my strength .
the lord is a great soldier .
he threw pharaoh ’ s chariots
the deep water covered them ,
“ lord , your right hand is amazingly strong .
in your great majesty you destroyed
the wind you sent in anger
“ the enemy said ,
but you blew on them
“ are there any gods like the lord ?
you raised your right hand to punish the enemy ,
“ the other nations will hear this story ,
the commanders of edom will tremble .
they will be filled with fear
you will lead your people
“ the lord will rule forever and ever ! ”
then aaron ’ s sister , the woman prophet miriam , took a tambourine . she and the women began singing and dancing .
miriam repeated the words ,
the people began complaining to moses . they said , “ now what will we drink ? ”
then the whole community of israelites began complaining again . they complained to moses and aaron in the desert .
then moses said to aaron , “ tell the whole community of israelites to come together before the lord , because he has heard their complaints . ”
the lord said to moses ,
that evening , flocks of quail came and filled the camp , and in the morning dew lay on the ground all around it .
after the dew was gone , something like thin flakes of frost was on the ground .
the lord says , ‘ each of you should gather what you need , a basket of manna for everyone in your family . ’ ”
so that is what the israelites did . some people gathered a large amount , some people gathered a little .
but when they measured what they had gathered , there was no shortage and there was none left over . everyone gathered just what they needed .
moses told them , “ don ’ t save that food to eat the next day . ”
every morning the people gathered as much food as they could eat , but by noon the food melted and was gone .
on friday the people gathered twice as much food—two baskets for every person . so all the leaders of the people came and told this to moses .
on saturday , some of the people went out to gather some of the food , but they could not find any .
then the lord said to moses , “ how long will you people refuse to obey my commands and teachings ?
so the people rested on the sabbath .
the people called the special food “ manna. ” it was like small white coriander seeds and tasted like thin cakes made with honey .
( aaron did what the lord had commanded moses . aaron put the jar of manna in front of the box of the agreement . )
( the measure they used for the manna was an omer . an omer was about 8 cups . )
so they turned against moses and started arguing with him . they said , “ give us water to drink . ”
so moses cried to the lord , “ what can i do with these people ? they are ready to kill me . ”
at rephidim the amalekites came and fought against the israelites .
so joshua and his men defeated the amalekites in this battle .
then moses built an altar and named it , “ the lord is my flag . ”
moses said , “ i lifted my hands toward the lord ’ s throne . so the lord fought against the amalekites , as he always has . ”
so jethro went to moses while moses was camped in the desert near the mountain of god . moses ’ wife and his two sons were with jethro .
jethro sent a message to moses that said , “ this is your father-in-law jethro . i am bringing your wife and her two sons to you . ”
he said , “ praise the lord ! he freed you from the power of egypt . he saved you from pharaoh .
now i know the lord is greater than all the gods . they thought they were in control , but look what god did ! ”
the next day , moses had the special job of judging the people . there were so many people that they had to stand before him all day .
then moses said to his father-in-law , “ the people come to me and ask me to ask for god ’ s decision for their problem .
but moses ’ father-in-law said to him , “ this isn ’ t the right way to do this .
but you should also choose some of the people to be judges and leaders .
so moses did what jethro told him .
these rulers were judges for the people . the people could always bring their arguments to these rulers , and moses had to decide only the most important cases .
after a short time moses said goodbye to his father-in-law jethro , and jethro went back to his own home .
the israelites reached the desert of sinai in the third month of their trip from egypt .
they had traveled from rephidim to the sinai desert . the israelites camped in the desert near mount sinai .
you will be a special nation—a kingdom of priests. ’ moses , you must tell the israelites what i have said . ”
so moses climbed down the mountain and called the elders of the people together . moses told the elders everything the lord had commanded him to tell them .
all the people spoke at the same time and said , “ we will obey everything the lord says . ”
and the lord said to moses , “ today and tomorrow you must prepare the people for a special meeting . they must wash their clothes
so moses climbed down the mountain and went to the people . he got them ready for the special meeting and they washed their clothes .
then moses said to the people , “ be ready for the meeting with god in three days . until that time do not have sexual relations . ”
then moses led the people out of the camp to a place near the mountain to meet god .
the noise from the trumpet became louder and louder . every time moses spoke to god , god answered him with a voice like thunder .
so moses went down to the people and told them these things .
these are the things god told his people :
“ i am the lord your god . i am the one who freed you from the land of egypt , where you were slaves .
“ you must not worship any other gods except me .
but i will be very kind to people who love me and obey my commands . i will be kind to their families for thousands of generations .
“ you must not use the name of the lord your god to make empty promises . if you do , the lord will not let you go unpunished .
“ you must remember to keep the sabbath a special day .
you may work six days a week to do your job .
“ you must not murder anyone .
“ you must not commit adultery .
“ you must not steal anything .
“ you must not tell lies about other people .
the people stood far away from the mountain while moses went to the dark cloud where god was .
then the lord told moses to say this to the israelites : “ you people have seen that i talked with you from heaven .
so you must not make idols using gold or silver to compete with me . you must not make these false gods .
then god said to moses , “ these are the other laws that you will give to the people :
if the master promised to let the slave woman marry his son , he must treat her like a daughter , not like a slave .
“ whoever hits and kills someone must be killed too .
but whoever plans to kill someone out of anger or hatred must be punished . take them away from my altar and kill them .
“ whoever hits their father or their mother must be killed .
“ whoever steals someone to sell them as a slave or to keep them for their own slave must be killed .
“ whoever curses their father or mother must be killed .
“ sometimes people beat their slaves . if the slave dies after being beaten , the killer must be punished .
you must trade an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth , a hand for a hand , a foot for a foot ,
a burn for a burn , a bruise for a bruise , a cut for a cut .
“ this same law must be followed if the bull kills someone ’ s son or daughter .
if you don ’ t find the thief , then the owner of the house must go before the judges who will decide if that person is guilty .
but if the neighbor stole the animal , then he must pay the owner for the animal .
if the father refuses to allow his daughter to marry him , then the man must still pay the full amount for her .
“ you must not allow any woman to do evil magic . if she does magic , you must not let her live .
“ you must not allow anyone to have sexual relations with an animal . if this happens , that person must be killed .
“ whoever makes a sacrifice to a false god should be destroyed . the lord is the only one you should make sacrifices to .
“ you must never do anything bad to women whose husbands are dead or to orphans .
if you do anything wrong to these widows or orphans , i will know it . i will hear about their suffering .
and i will be very angry . i will kill you with a sword . then your wives will become widows , and your children will become orphans .
you might take their cloak to make sure they pay the money back , but you must give that cloak back to them before sunset .
“ you must not curse god or the leaders of your people .
“ at harvest time you should give me the first grain and the first juice from your fruit . don ’ t wait until late in the year .
“ don ’ t tell lies against other people . if you are a witness in court , don ’ t agree to help a bad person tell lies .
“ in court , don ’ t treat a person in a special way simply because that person is poor .
“ if you see a lost bull or donkey , then you must return it to its owner—even if the owner is your enemy .
“ in court , don ’ t let anyone take advantage of a person simply because that person is poor .
“ plant seeds , harvest your crops , and work the ground for six years .
“ be sure that you obey all these laws . don ’ t worship false gods . you should not even speak their names !
“ you will have three special festivals each year . you must come to my special place to worship me during these festivals .
“ so three times each year all the men will come to the special place to be with the lord god .
“ when you gather your crops at harvest time , you should bring the first of everything you harvest to the house of the lord your god .
“ i am sending an angel before you to protect you along the way and to lead you to the place that i have prepared for you .
your women will all be able to have babies . none of their babies will die at birth . and i will allow you to live long lives .
i will send the hornet in front of you . he will force your enemies to leave . the hivites , canaanites , and hittites will leave your country .
so i will force them out of your land very slowly . i will do this as you grow and eventually take the land to be your own .
“ you must not make any agreements with any of those people or their gods .
then moses sent young men of israel to offer sacrifices . these men offered bulls to the lord as burnt offerings and fellowship offerings .
moses saved the blood from these animals . he put half of the blood in bowls , and he poured the other half of the blood on the altar .
then moses , aaron , nadab , abihu , and the 70 elders of israel went up the mountain .
on the mountain , these men saw the god of israel . he was standing on something that looked like blue sapphires , as clear as the sky !
all the leaders of israel saw god , but god did not destroy them . they all ate and drank together .
so moses and his helper , joshua , went up the mountain of god .
then moses went up the mountain , and the cloud covered the mountain .
the israelites could see the glory of the lord . it was like a fire burning on top of the mountain .
then moses went higher up the mountain into the cloud . he was on the mountain for 40 days and 40 nights .
the lord said to moses ,
“ tell the israelites to bring me gifts . you will accept gifts for me from everyone who is willing to give .

“ aaron must burn sweet-smelling incense on the altar every morning . he will do this when he comes to care for the lamps .
he must burn incense again when he checks the lamps in the evening so that incense will be burned before the lord every day forever .
don ’ t use this altar for offering any other kind of incense or burnt offering or for any kind of grain offering or drink offering .
the lord said to moses ,
every man who is at least 20 years old must be counted . and every man who is counted must give the lord this offering .
the lord said to moses ,
aaron and his sons must wash their hands and feet with the water from this bowl .
then the lord said to moses ,
and 12 pounds of cassia . use the official measure to measure all these things . also get 1 gallon of olive oil .
“ mix all these things to make a special sweet-smelling anointing oil .
pour this oil on the meeting tent and on the box of the agreement . this will show that these things have a special purpose .
you will make all these things holy . they will be very special to the lord . anything that touches these things will also become holy .
“ pour the oil on aaron and his sons to show that they are separated from the rest of the people to serve as priests .
tell the israelites that the anointing oil is holy—it must always be used only for me .
whoever makes a perfume like that and puts it on anyone except a priest must be separated from the people . ”
then the lord said to moses ,
“ i have chosen a man from the tribe of judah to do some special work for me . his name is bezalel son of uri son of hur .
i have filled bezalel with the spirit of god—i have given him the skill and knowledge to do all kinds of things .
he is a very good designer . and he can make things from gold , silver , and bronze .
he can cut and set beautiful jewels . and he can work with wood . he can do all kinds of work .
the table and everything on it ;
the altar for burning offerings and the things used at the altar ;
the special clothes for aaron the priest ;
the sweet-smelling anointing oil ;
then the lord said to moses ,
aaron said to the people , “ bring me the gold earrings that belong to your wives , sons , and daughters . ”
so the people collected all their gold earrings and brought them to aaron .
the lord said to moses , “ i have seen these people , and i know that they are very stubborn . they will always turn against me .
so now let me destroy them in anger . then i will make a great nation from you . ”
so the lord felt sorry for the people . he did not do what he said he might do—he did not destroy them .
god himself made the stones , and god himself wrote the commandments on them .
joshua heard the noise from the party in camp . he said to moses , “ it sounds like war down in the camp ! ”
aaron answered , “ don ’ t be angry , sir . you know that these people are always ready to do wrong .
moses saw that aaron had let the people get out of control . they were being wild , and all their enemies could see them acting like fools .
the people from the tribe of levi obeyed moses . that day about 3000 of the people died .
so moses went back to the lord and said , “ please listen ! these people committed a terrible sin and made a god from gold .
now , forgive them of this sin . if you will not forgive them , then erase my name from your book . ”
but the lord said to moses , “ the only people i erase from my book are those who sin against me .
so the lord caused a terrible sickness to come to the people . he did this because they told aaron to make the golden calf .
the people heard this bad news and became very sad , so they stopped wearing jewelry .
so the israelites stopped wearing their jewelry at mount horeb .
whenever moses went into the tent , the tall cloud would come down and stay at the entrance to the tent . and the lord would speak with moses .
the lord answered , “ i myself will go with you . i will lead you . ”
then moses said to him , “ if you don ’ t go with us , then don ’ t make us leave this place .
then moses said , “ now , please show me your glory . ”
but you can not see my face . no one can see me and continue to live . ”
then the lord said , “ here is a place for you to stand by me on this large rock .
i will put you in a large crack in that rock . then i will cover you with my hand , and my glory will pass by .
then i will take away my hand , and you will see my back . but you will not see my face . ”
be ready tomorrow morning and come up on mount sinai . stand before me there on the top of the mountain .
then the lord came down to him in a cloud , stood there with moses , and spoke his own name .
then moses quickly bowed to the ground and worshiped the lord . moses said ,
so destroy their altars , break the stones they worship , and cut down their idols .
don ’ t worship any other god . i am yahweh kanah—the jealous lord . that is my name . i hate for my people to worship other gods .
you might choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons . those daughters serve false gods . they might lead your sons to do the same thing .
“ don ’ t make idols .
“ a woman ’ s first baby always belongs to me . even the first animals that are born from your cattle or sheep belong to me .
“ you will work for six days , but on the seventh day you must rest . you must rest even during the times of planting and harvesting .
“ celebrate the festival of harvest . use the first grain from the wheat harvest for this festival . and in the fall celebrate the festival of shelters .
“ three times each year all your men must go to be with the lord god , the god of israel .
“ when you kill an animal and offer its blood as a sacrifice , you must not include anything that has yeast in it .
“ give the lord the very first crops that you harvest . bring them to the house of the lord your god .
then the lord said to moses , “ write everything that i have told you . this is the agreement that i made with you and the israelites . ”
aaron and all the people of israel saw that moses ’ face was shining bright . so they were afraid to go near him .
but moses called to them . so aaron and all the leaders of the people went to him . moses talked with them .
after that all the israelites came near moses , and he gave them the commands that the lord had given him on mount sinai .
when moses finished speaking to the people , he put a covering over his face .
moses gathered all the israelites together and said to them , “ i will tell you what the lord has commanded you to do :
on the sabbath you should not even light a fire in any of the places where you live . ”
moses said to all the israelites , “ this is what the lord commanded :
blue , purple , and red yarn and fine linen ; goat hair ;
ram skins dyed red and fine leather ; acacia wood ;
oil for the lamps ; spices for the anointing oil and spices for the sweet-smelling incense .
also , bring onyx stones and other jewels to be put on the ephod and the judgment pouch .
“ all of you who are skilled workers should make all the things the lord commanded :

the curtains around the yard , their posts and bases , and the curtain that covers the entrance to the yard ;

then all the israelites went away from moses .
everyone who wanted to give silver or bronze brought that as a gift to the lord . everyone who had acacia wood came and gave it to the lord .
every skilled woman made fine linen and blue , purple , and red yarn .
and all the women who were skilled and wanted to help made cloth from the goat hair .

the lord has given bezalel and oholiab special skills to teach other people . ( oholiab was the son of ahisamach from the tribe of dan . )
finally , all the skilled workers left the work they were doing on the holy place , and they went to speak to moses . they said ,
“ the people have brought too much . we have more than we need to finish the work the lord told us to do . ”
the people had brought more than enough things to finish the work of building god ’ s holy place .

then moses put the lamps on the lampstand before the lord . he did this just as the lord had commanded him .
then moses put the golden altar in the meeting tent , in front of the curtain .
then he burned sweet-smelling incense on the altar . he did this as the lord had commanded him .
then moses put the curtain at the entrance to the holy tent .
then moses put the bowl between the meeting tent and the altar . he put water in the bowl for washing .
moses , aaron , and aaron ’ s sons used this bowl to wash their hands and feet .
then the cloud covered the meeting tent and the glory of the lord filled the holy tent .
moses could not go into the meeting tent because the cloud had settled on it , and the glory of the lord had filled the holy tent .
when the cloud rose from the holy tent , the israelites would begin to travel .
but when the cloud stayed on the holy tent , the people did not try to move . they stayed in that place until the cloud rose .
inside the cloud , there were four living beings that looked like people .
but each one of them had four faces and four wings .
their legs were straight . their feet looked like calves ’ feet , and they sparkled like polished brass .
under their wings were human arms . there were four living beings . each living being had four faces and four wings .
the wings touched each other . the living beings did not turn when they moved . they went in the direction they were looking .
each living being went in the direction it was looking . they went wherever the spirit caused them to go , but they did not turn when they moved .
that is what the living beings looked like .
the living beings ran back and forth—as fast as lightning .
they could turn to move in any direction . but the living beings did not turn when they moved .
the rims of the wheels were tall and frightening . there were eyes all over the rims of all four wheels .
the wheels always moved with the living beings . if the living beings went up into the air , the wheels went with them .
they went wherever the spirit wanted them to go , and the wheels went with them , because the power that moved the living being was in the wheels .
there was an amazing thing over the heads of the living beings . it was like a bowl turned upside down , and the bowl was clear like crystal .
the living beings stopped moving and lowered their wings . then there was another loud sound that came from above the bowl over their heads .
the voice said , “ son of man , stand up and i will speak with you . ”
then the spirit came into me and lifted me up on my feet , and i listened to the one who spoke to me .
you must tell them what i say , whether they listen or not . they are people who usually refuse to listen !
then i saw an arm reach out toward me . it was holding a scroll with words written on it .
so i opened my mouth and he put the scroll into my mouth .
then god said , “ son of man , i am giving you this scroll . swallow it ! let that scroll fill your body . ”
then god said to me , “ son of man , go to the family of israel . speak my words to them .
but i will make you just as stubborn as they are , and your head just as hard .
then god said to me , “ son of man , listen to every word i say to you and remember them .
the spirit lifted me and took me away . i was very sad and upset in my spirit , but i felt the lord ’ s power in me .
after seven days , the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
but the spirit came into me and lifted me up on my feet . he said to me , “ go home and lock yourself in your house .
son of man , people will come with ropes and tie you up . they will not let you go out among the people .
“ son of man , take a brick and scratch a picture on it . draw a picture of a city—the city of jerusalem .
you can drink only 3 cups of water each day . you can drink it from time to time throughout the day .
that is because there will not be enough food and water for everyone . they will be terrified as they watch each other wasting away because of their sins .
but then you must get a few of those hairs and wrap them up in your robe .
so the lord god says , “ so now , even i am against you ! i will punish you while those other people watch .
then the word of the lord came to me again .
he said , “ son of man , turn toward the mountains of israel and speak against them for me .
your altars will be broken into pieces . your incense altars will be smashed , and i will throw down your dead bodies in front of your filthy idols .
i will put the dead bodies of the people of israel in front of their filthy idols . i will scatter your bones around your altars .
your people will be killed , and then you will know that i am the lord ! ’ ”
then the word of the lord came to me .
he said , “ now , son of man , here is a message from the lord god . this message is for the land of israel :
your end is coming now !
i will not show you any mercy or feel sorry for you .
this is what the lord god said : “ there will be one disaster after another !
the end is coming , and it will come quickly !
they will be too tired and sad to raise their arms . their legs will be like water .
they will wear sackcloth and be covered with fear . you will see the shame on every face . they will shave their heads to show their sadness .
i will let strangers take them . those strangers will make fun of them . they will kill some of the people and take others away as prisoners .
“ make chains for the prisoners , because many people will be punished for killing other people . there will be violence every place in the city .
“ you will shake with fear . you will look for peace , but there will be none .
but the glory of the god of israel was there . the glory looked just like the vision i saw in the valley by the kebar canal .
so i went to the entrance to the courtyard , and i saw a hole in the wall .
then god said to me , “ go in and look at the terrible , evil things that the people are doing here . ”
then he said to me , “ if you come with me , you will see these men doing even more terrible things ! ”
then god shouted to the leaders in charge of punishing the city . each leader had his own destructive weapon in his hand .
so i will not show any mercy or feel sorry for them . they brought it on themselves . i am only giving them the punishment they deserve ! ”
then the man wearing linen clothes and a scribe ’ s pen and ink set spoke up . he said , “ i have done what you commanded . ”
the cherub angels were standing in the area south of the temple as the man walked to them . the cloud filled the inner courtyard .
( the cherub angels had what looked like human arms under their wings . )
then i noticed that there were four wheels . there was one wheel by each cherub angel , and the wheels looked like a clear yellow jewel .
there were four wheels , and they all looked the same . they looked like there was a wheel in a wheel .
these wheels were what i heard called , “ the area between the wheels . ”
and the wheels rose with them . when the cherub angels raised their wings and flew into the air , not even the wheels turned around .
then the glory of the lord rose from the threshold of the temple , moved to the place over the cherub angels , and stopped there .
each living being had four faces , four wings , and something that looked like human arms under their wings .
these men say , ‘ we will be building our houses again very soon . we are as safe in this city as meat in a pot ! ’
so you must speak to the people for me . son of man , prophesy against the people . ”
you have killed many people in this city . you have filled the streets with dead bodies .
you are afraid of the sword , but i am bringing the sword against you ! ’ ” this is what the lord god said .
he also said , “ i will take you out of this city and give you to strangers . i will punish you .
you will die by the sword . i will punish you here in israel , so you will know that i am the lord .
yes , this place will be the cooking pot , and you will be the meat cooking in it . i will punish you here in israel .
but then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
when my people come back , they will destroy all the terrible , filthy idols that are here now .
then the cherub angels raised their wings and flew into the air . the wheels went with them . the glory of the god of israel was above them .
the glory of the lord rose into the air and left the city and stopped on the hill east of jerusalem .
then i spoke to the people in exile . i told them about everything the lord showed me .
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
while the people are watching , make a hole in the wall and go out through that hole in the wall .
the next morning , the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , did the people of israel—those people who always refuse to obey—ask you what you were doing ?
tell them that this is what the lord god said . this sad message is about the leader of jerusalem and all the people of israel who live there .
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , why do people quote this saying about the land of israel :
“ tell the people that the lord god will end that saying . they will not say that about israel anymore . now they will quote this saying :
“ there will not be any more false visions in israel . there will not be any more magicians telling things that don ’ t come true .
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ ‘ israel , your prophets are false prophets . they are like jackals hunting for food among the ruins of a city .
when the wall falls down , the people will ask the prophets , ‘ what happened to the plaster you put on the wall ? ’ ”
some of the elders of israel came to me . they sat down to talk with me .
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
so both the one who came for advice and the prophet who gave an answer will get the same punishment .
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ or i might send wild animals through that country to kill all the people . then no one would travel through that country because of the wild animals .
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , are the pieces of wood from a grapevine any better than the little branches cut from trees in the forest ?
can you use that wood from a grapevine to make anything ? can you use that wood to make pegs to hang dishes on ?
people throw that wood into the fire . the ends burn , and the middle is scorched .
if you can not make anything from that wood before it is burned , you surely can not make anything from that wood after it is burned !
i will destroy that country because the people left me to worship false gods. ” this is what the lord god said .
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , tell the people of jerusalem about the terrible things they have done .
i gave you a nice dress and soft leather sandals , a linen headband , and a silk scarf .
i also gave you some jewelry . i put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck .
i gave you a nose ring , earrings , and a beautiful crown to wear .
you became famous for your beauty , all because i made you so lovely ! ’ ” this is what the lord god said .
you slaughtered my sons and then passed them through the fire to those false gods .
“ after all these evil things , … it will be very bad for you ! ” the lord god said all these things .
“ after all those things , you made a mound for worshiping that false god . you built those places for worshiping false gods on every street corner .
then you went to egypt , your neighbor that is always ready for sex . with more and more sexual sin , you made me angry .
then you went to have sex with assyria . you could not get enough . you were never satisfied .
so you turned to canaan , and then to babylonia , and still you were not satisfied .
you are a woman guilty of adultery . you would rather have sex with strangers than with your own husband .
you are just the opposite of most prostitutes who force men to pay them , because you pay the men to have sex with you . ”
prostitute , listen to the message from the lord .
they will bring a crowd of people and throw rocks at you to kill you . then they will cut you into pieces with their swords .
then i will stop being angry and jealous . i will calm down . i will not be angry anymore .
“ all the people who talk about you will now have one more thing to say . they will say , ‘ like mother , like daughter . ’
you did all the terrible things they did , but you also did much worse !
sodom and her daughters became too proud and began to do terrible things in front of me . so i punished them !
so you must bear your shame . you have made your sisters look good compared to you . you have done terrible things , so you should be ashamed .
i will comfort you . then you will remember the terrible things you did , and you will be ashamed .
“ in the past , you were proud and made fun of your sister sodom . but you will not do that again .
you did that before you were punished , before your neighbors started making fun of you . the daughters of edom and philistia are making fun of you now .
now you must suffer for the terrible things you did. ” this is what the lord said .
but i will remember the agreement we made when you were young . i made an agreement with you that will continue forever !
so i will make my agreement with you , and you will know that i am the lord .
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , i have a story with a hidden meaning for you to tell the family of israel .
tell them that this is what the lord god says :
he broke the top out of that big cedar tree and brought it to canaan .
then the eagle took some of the seeds from canaan .
the seeds grew and became a grapevine .
then another eagle with big wings saw the grapevine .
the grapevine was planted in a good field near plenty of water .
this is what the lord god says :
will the plant grow where it is planted ?
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
but the king of judah will not escape , because he ignored his agreement . he broke his promise to nebuchadnezzar . ”
this is what the lord god says :
i myself will plant it on a high mountain in israel .
“ then the other trees will know that
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ why do you people say this proverb :
but the lord god says , “ by my life , i swear that people in israel will not think this proverb is true anymore !
i will treat everyone , child and parent , just the same . the one who sins is the one who will die !
“ a person who is good will live ! he is fair and does what is right .
“ but someone like that might have a son who does not do any of these good things . the son steals things and kills people .
the father hurts people and steals things . he never does anything good for my people ! he will die because of his own sins .
god will not remember all the bad things they did . he will remember only their goodness , so they will live ! ”
the lord god says , “ i don ’ t want evil people to die . i want them to change their lives so that they can live !
if good people change and become evil , they must die for the bad things they do .
and if evil people change and become good and fair , they will save their lives . they will live !
the people of israel said , “ that ’ s not fair ! the lord isn ’ t fair ! ”
i don ’ t want to kill you ! please come back and live ! ” this is what the lord god said .
the lord said to me , “ you must sing this sad song about the leaders of israel :
“ ‘ your mother is like a female lion ,
one of her cubs gets up .
“ ‘ the people heard him roar ,
“ ‘ the mother lion had hoped that cub would become the leader ,
he hunted with the adult lions
he attacked the palaces and destroyed the cities .
then the people who lived around him set a trap for him ,
they put hooks on him and locked him up .
“ ‘ your mother is like a grapevine
then she grew large branches .
but the vine was pulled up by the roots ,
“ ‘ now that grapevine is planted in the desert .
a fire started in the large branch
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
should you judge them ? will you judge them , son of man ? you must tell them about the terrible things their fathers have done .
i brought the family of israel out of egypt . i led them into the desert .
then i gave them my laws and told them all my rules . all those who obey them will live .
but i felt sorry for them , so i did not destroy them . i did not completely destroy them in the desert .
i am the lord . i am your god . obey my laws and keep my commands . do the things i tell you .
so i made another promise to those people in the desert . i promised to scatter them among the nations , to send them to many different countries .
so i gave them laws that were not good . i gave them commands that would not bring life .
i asked the people of israel why they were going to the high places . but that high place is still there today . ’
i will judge you as i judged your ancestors in the desert near egypt. ” this is what the lord god said .
“ i will judge you guilty and punish you according to the agreement .
in that country you will remember all the evil things you did that made you filthy , and you will be ashamed .
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , look toward the negev , the southern part of judah . speak against the negev forest .
then all people will see that i , the lord , have started the fire . the fire will not be put out ! ’ ”
then i said , “ oh , lord god ! if i say this , the people will say that i am only telling them stories . ”
so the word of the lord came to me again . he said ,
“ son of man , look toward jerusalem and speak against their holy places . speak against the land of israel for me .
“ son of man , make sad sounds like a sad person with a broken heart . make these sad sounds in front of the people .
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , speak to the people for me . say this , ‘ this is what the lord says :
the sword was made sharp for killing .
so the sword has been polished .
“ son of man , clap your hands to show your sadness ,
their hearts will melt with fear ,
sword , be sharp !
“ then i , too , will clap my hands
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
and you , evil leader of israel , you will be killed . your time of punishment has come ! the end is here ! ”
“ ‘ your visions are useless .
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , will you judge the city of murderers ? will you tell her about all the terrible things she has done ?
people far and near will make fun of you . you have ruined your name . you are filled with confusion .
“ ‘ look , all the leaders in israel are using their strength just to kill other people .
you hate all that i consider holy . you treat my special days of rest as if they are not important .
there men commit sexual sins with their father ’ s wife . there the men rape women—even during their monthly time of bleeding .
“ ‘ now look ! i will slam my hand down and stop you ! i will punish you for cheating and killing people .
i will scatter you among the nations . i will force you to go to many countries . i will completely destroy the filthy things in this city .
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
so this is what the lord god says : ‘ all of you have become like worthless waste . so i will gather you into jerusalem .
i will put you in my fire of anger and blow on it , and you will begin to melt .
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ the leaders in jerusalem are like a wolf eating the animal it has caught . they attack people and kill them just to get rich .
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , listen to this story about samaria and jerusalem . there were two sisters , daughters of the same mother .
they became prostitutes in egypt while they were still young girls . that ’ s where they first let men touch and handle their young breasts .
“ then oholah became unfaithful to me—she began to live like a prostitute . she began to want her lovers . she saw the assyrian soldiers
in their blue uniforms . they were all handsome young men riding horses . they were leaders and officers ,
so i let her lovers have her . she wanted assyria , so i gave her to them !
they raped her . they took her children and killed her . they punished her , and women still talk about her .
“ her younger sister oholibah saw all these things happen . but oholibah sinned more than her sister did ! she was more unfaithful than oholah .
she wanted the assyrian leaders and officers . she wanted those soldiers in blue uniforms riding their horses . they were all handsome young men .
i saw that both women were going to ruin their lives with the same mistakes .
they wore belts around their waists and long turbans on their heads . all those men looked like chariot officers . they all looked like native-born babylonian men ,
and oholibah wanted them .
so the babylonian men came to her bed to have sex with her . they used her and made her so filthy that she became disgusted with them .
but oholibah thought about her time as a prostitute in egypt when she was young , and she turned to even more prostitution .
she remembered the lovers who excited her there , who were like animals in their sexual desires and abilities .
“ oholibah , you dreamed of those times when you were young , when your lovers touched and handled your young breasts .
they will take your nice clothes and jewelry .
so i will stop your dreams about your love affair with egypt . you will never again look for them . you will never remember egypt again ! ’ ”
you did those bad things when you left me to chase after the other nations . you did those bad things when you began to worship their filthy idols .
you followed your sister and lived as she did . you , yourself , took her cup of poison and held it in your hands . ”
this is what the lord god says :
you will stagger like a drunk .
you will drink the poison in that cup .
the lord said to me , “ son of man , will you judge oholah and oholibah ? then tell them about the terrible things they have done .
they also treated my special days of rest and my holy place as though they were not important .
they killed their children for their idols , and then they went into my holy place and made it filthy too ! they did this inside my temple !
you sat on a fine bed with a table set before it . you put my incense and my oil on this table .
but they kept going to her as they would go to a prostitute . yes , they went again and again to oholah and oholibah , those wicked women .
“ but good men will judge them guilty of adultery and murder , because oholah and oholibah committed adultery and their hands are covered with blood ! ”
this is what the lord god said : “ gather the people together to punish and terrorize oholah and oholibah .
in this way i will remove that shame from this country , and all the other women will be warned not to do the shameful things you have done .
the word of the lord came to me . this was on the tenth day of the tenth month in the ninth year of exile . he said ,
“ son of man , write today ’ s date and this note : ‘ on this date the army of the king of babylon surrounded jerusalem . ’
the people there refuse to obey me . i have a story with a message for them . tell them , ‘ this is what the lord god says :
put in the pieces of meat .
use the best animals in the flock .
“ ‘ so this is what the lord god says :
jerusalem is like a pot with rust on it .
i put her blood on the bare rock
“ ‘ so this is what the lord god says :
put plenty of wood under the pot .
then let the pot stand empty on the coals .
“ ‘ jerusalem might work hard
“ ‘ you sinned against me
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
the next morning i told the people what god had said . that evening , my wife died . the next morning i did what god commanded .
then the people said to me , “ why are you doing this ? what does it mean ? ”
then i said to them , “ the word of the lord came to me . he told me
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , look toward the people of ammon and speak against them for me .
this is what the lord god says : “ moab and seir say , ‘ the family of judah is just like any other nation . ’
so i will punish moab , and then they will know that i am the lord . ”
i will punish them—i will get even . i will let my anger teach them a lesson . then they will know that i am the lord ! ”
in the eleventh year of exile , on the first day of the month , the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
her daughters on the mainland will be killed in battle . then they will know that i am the lord . ”
he will bring the logs to break down your walls . he will use picks and break down your towers .
so i will stop the sound of your happy songs . people will not hear your harps anymore .
they will sing this sad song about you :
now , on the day you fall ,
the word of the lord came to me again . he said ,
“ son of man , sing this sad song about tyre .
the mediterranean sea is the border around your city .
your builders used cypress trees
they used oak trees from bashan
for your sail , they used colorful linen made in egypt .
men from sidon and arvad rowed your boats for you .
the elders and wise men from byblos
“ ‘ tarshish was one of your best customers . they traded silver , iron , tin , and lead for all the wonderful things you sold .
people in greece , turkey , and the area around the black sea traded with you . they traded slaves and bronze for the things you sold .
people from the nation of togarmah traded horses , war horses , and mules for the things you sold .
the people of rhodes traded with you . you sold your things in many places . people brought ivory tusks and ebony wood to pay you .
damascus was a good customer . they traded with you for the many wonderful things you had . they traded wine from helbon and white wool for those things .
damascus traded wine from uzal for the things you sold . they paid with wrought iron , cassia , and sugar cane .
dedan provided good business and traded with you for saddle blankets and riding horses .
arabia and all the leaders of kedar traded lambs , rams , and goats for your goods .
the merchants of sheba and raamah traded with you . they traded all the best spices and every kind of precious stone and gold for your goods .
haran , canneh , eden , the merchants of sheba , asshur , and kilmad traded with you .
the ships from tarshish carried the things you sold .
your oarsmen rowed you far out to sea .
all your wealth will spill into the sea .
“ ‘ you send your merchants to faraway places .
your whole crew will jump ship .
they will be very sad about you .
they will shave their heads for you .
“ ‘ and in their loud crying they will sing this sad song about you :
your merchants sailed across the seas .
but now you are broken by the seas
all the people living on the coast
the merchants in other nations whistle about you .
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , say to the ruler of tyre , ‘ this is what the lord god says :
you think you are wiser than daniel
through your wisdom and understanding
through your great wisdom and trade ,
“ ‘ so this is what the lord god says :
i will bring strangers to fight against you .
they will bring you down to the grave .
that person will kill you .
strangers will treat you like a foreigner and kill you ,
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , sing this sad song about the king of tyre . say to him , ‘ this is what the lord god says :
you were in eden , the garden of god .
you were one of the chosen cherubs
you were good and honest when i created you ,
your business brought you many riches .
your beauty made you proud .
you did many wrong things .
“ ‘ all the people in other nations
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , look toward sidon and speak for me against that place .
say , ‘ this is what the lord god says :
i will send disease and death to sidon ,
on the twelfth day of the tenth month of the tenth year of exile , the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , look toward pharaoh , king of egypt . speak for me against him and egypt .
say , ‘ this is what the lord god says :
“ ‘ but i will put hooks in your jaws .
then all the people living in egypt
the people of israel leaned on egypt for support ,
so this is what the lord god says :
egypt will be empty and destroyed .
no person or animal will pass through egypt . nothing will pass through or settle there for 40 years .
on the first day of the first month in the twenty-seventh year of exile , the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
i will give egypt to nebuchadnezzar as a reward for the hard work he did for me. ” this is what the lord god said !
the word of the lord came to me again . he said ,
“ son of man , speak for me . say , ‘ this is what the lord god says :
that day is near !
a sword will come against egypt !
“ ‘ this is what the lord says :
egypt will join the other countries that were destroyed .
i will start a fire in egypt ,
this is what the lord god says :
i will make the nile river become dry land .
this is what the lord god says :
i will make pathros empty .
i will pour out my anger against pelusium , the fortress of egypt !
i will start a fire in egypt ;
the young men of heliopolis and bubastis will die in battle ,
it will be a dark day in tahpanhes when i break egypt ’ s control .
so i will punish egypt .
on the seventh day of the first month of the eleventh year of exile , the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
i will scatter the egyptians among the nations .
i will scatter the egyptians among the nations . then they will know that i am the lord ! ”
on the first day of the third month in the eleventh year of exile , the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , say this to pharaoh , king of egypt , and to his people :
assyria was a cedar tree in lebanon with beautiful branches ,
the water made the tree grow .
so that tree was taller than all the other trees of the field ,
all the birds of the sky made their nests
the tree was very beautiful .
even the cedar trees in god ’ s garden
i gave it many branches
now birds live in that fallen tree . wild animals walk over its fallen branches .
on the first day of the twelfth month in the twelfth year of exile , the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , sing this sad song about pharaoh , king of egypt . say to him :
this is what the lord god says :
then i will drop you on the dry ground .
i will scatter your body on the mountains .
i will pour your blood on the mountains ,
i will make you disappear .
i will darken the lights in the sky over you .
“ i will make many people sad and upset when i bring an enemy to destroy you . nations you don ’ t even know will be upset .
that will happen because of what the lord god said : “ the sword of the king of babylon will come to fight against you .
on the fifteenth day of that month in the twelfth year of exile , the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ egypt , you are no better than anyone else ! go down to the place of death . go lie down with those foreigners .
“ egypt will go to be with all the other men who were killed in battle . the enemy has pulled her and all her people away .
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
if this guard sees enemy soldiers coming , he blows the trumpet and warns the people .
if people hear the warning but ignore it , the enemy will capture them and take them away as prisoners . they will be responsible for their own death .
i will not remember the bad things they did in the past , because now they live right and are fair . so they will live !
“ but your people say , ‘ that ’ s not fair ! the lord can not be like that ! ’
if good people stop doing good and begin to sin , they will die because of their sins .
and if evil people stop doing wrong and start living right and being fair , they will live .
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
the people have done many terrible things , so i will make that place an empty wasteland . then they will know that i am the lord . ”
but the things you sing about really will happen , and then the people will know that there was a prophet living among them . ’ ”
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
you eat the fat sheep and use their wool to make clothes for yourselves . you kill the fat sheep , but you don ’ t feed the flock .
“ ‘ and now the sheep are scattered because there was no shepherd . they became food for every wild animal , so they were scattered .
so , you shepherds , listen to the word of the lord .
so , you shepherds , listen to the word of the lord !
the lord god says , “ i myself will be their shepherd . i will search for my sheep and take care of them .
yes , i will feed my flock , and i will lead them to a place of rest. ” this is what the lord god said .
my flock must eat the grass you crushed with your feet , and they must drink the water you stir with your feet ! ”
so the lord god says to them : “ i myself will judge between the fat sheep and the thin sheep !
you push with your side and shoulder . you knock down all the weak sheep with your horns . you push until you have forced them away ,
so i will save my flock . they will not be caught by wild animals anymore . i will judge between one sheep and another .
then i will put one shepherd over them , my servant david . he will feed them and be their shepherd .
i will bless the sheep and the places around my hill . i will cause the rains to fall at the right time and will shower them with blessings .
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
“ son of man , look toward mount seir and speak against it for me .
say to it , ‘ this is what the lord god says :
i will destroy your cities ,
i will make mount seir an empty ruin . i will kill everyone who enters or leaves that city .
i will make you empty forever . no one will live in your cities . then you will know that i am the lord . ”
you said , “ these two nations and countries , israel and judah , will be mine . we will take them for our own . ”
and then you , too , will know that i am the lord .
your proud boasting is really against me . time after time you have insulted me , and i have heard every word . ”
this is what the lord god says : “ all the earth will be happy when i destroy you .
“ son of man , speak to the mountains of israel for me . tell them to listen to the word of the lord !
“ but mountains of israel , you will grow new trees and produce fruit for my people israel . my people will soon come back .
i am with you , and i will help you . people will till your soil and plant seeds in you .
yes , i will lead many people—my people , israel—to your land . you will be their property , and you will not take away their children again . ”
but you will not destroy people anymore or take away their children again. ” this is what the lord god said .
then the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
i scattered them among the nations and spread them through all the lands . i gave them the punishment they deserved for the bad things they did .
“ the people of israel ruined my holy name wherever they went , and i felt sorry for my name .
“ i will take you out of those nations , gather you together , and bring you back to your own land .
i will put my spirit inside you and change you so that you will obey my laws . you will carefully obey my commands .
then you will live in the land that i gave to your ancestors . you will be my people , and i will be your god .
also , i will save you and keep you from becoming unclean . i will command the grain to grow . i will not bring a famine against you .
people will begin again to work the land so when other people pass by they will not see ruins anymore .
then the lord said to me , “ son of man , can these bones come to life ? ”
then he said to me , “ speak to these bones for me . tell them , ‘ dry bones , listen to the word of the lord !
this is what the lord god says to you : i will cause breath to come into you , and you will come to life !
there before my eyes , i saw sinew and muscles begin to cover the bones . skin began to cover them , but there was no breath in them .
my people , i will open your graves and bring you up out of your graves , and then you will know that i am the lord .
the word of the lord came to me again . he said ,
then join the two sticks together . in your hand , they will be one stick .
“ your people will ask you to explain what that means .
“ take the sticks that you wrote on and hold them in front of you .
my holy tent will be with them . yes , i will be their god and they will be my people .
the word of the lord came to me . he said ,
soldiers from persia , ethiopia , and put will be with them . they will all be wearing their shields and helmets .
“ ‘ be prepared . yes , prepare yourself and the armies that have joined with you . you must watch and be ready .
this is what the lord god says : “ at that time an idea will come into your mind . you will begin to make an evil plan .
the lord god said , “ at that time gog will come to fight against the land of israel . i will show my anger .
in my anger and strong emotions , i make this promise : i promise that there will be a strong earthquake in the land of israel .
i will capture you and bring you back . i will bring you from the far north . i will bring you to fight against the mountains of israel .
but i will knock your bow from your left hand and your arrows from your right hand .
that time is coming ! it will happen ! ” this is what the lord god said . “ that is the day i am talking about .
it will take seven months for the family of israel to bury them . they must do this to make the land pure .
the city of the dead will be named hamonah . in this way they will make the country pure . ”
then from that day on , the family of israel will know that i am the lord their god .
they sinned and made themselves filthy , so i punished them for the things they did . i turned away from them and refused to help them . ”
then the man went to the east gate . he walked up its steps and measured the opening for the gate . it was one ruler wide .
then he measured the porch .
there were three little guardrooms on each side of the gateway . all these rooms and their side walls measured the same .
the man measured the entrance to the gateway . it was 10 cubits wide and 13 cubits long .
he measured the faces of all the side walls , including the side walls on either side of the porch at the courtyard . the total was 60 cubits .
from the inside edge of the outer gate to the far end of the porch was 50 cubits .
the pavement was as wide as the gates were long . the pavement reached to the inside end of the gateway . this was the lower pavement .
then the man measured the length and width of the north gate that was in the wall surrounding the outer courtyard .
the gateway and its porch had windows all around like the other gates . the gateway was 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide .
the porch was 25 cubits wide and 5 cubits long .
then the man led me into the inner courtyard on the east side . he measured the gate . it measured the same as the other gates .
then the man led me to the north gate . he measured it , and it measured the same as the other gates .
there was also a doorway in the side walls of the gates . that doorway led into a room where the priests washed the sacrifices .
there were also two tables on each side of the door on the outside wall of this porch .
so there were four tables on the inside wall and four tables on the outside wall—eight tables that the priests used when they killed the animals for sacrifices .
there were meat hooks three inches long on all the walls in this area . the meat of the offerings was put on the tables .
there were two rooms in the inner courtyard . one was by the north gate facing south . the other room was by the south gate facing north .
the man said to me , “ the room that looks to the south is for the priests who are on duty and serving in the temple area .
the outer wall of the side rooms was 5 cubits thick . there was an open area between the side rooms of the temple
and the priests ’ rooms . it was 20 cubits wide and went all the way around the temple .
the restricted area on the east side , in front of the temple , was 100 cubits long .
of cherub angels and palm trees . a palm tree was between each cherub angel . every cherub angel had two faces .
from the floor to the area above the door , cherub angels and palm trees were carved on all walls of the holy place .
the walls on either side of the holy place were square . in front of the most holy place , there was something that looked like
both the holy place and the most holy place had a double door .
each of the doors was made from two smaller doors . each door was really two swinging doors .
this building was 100 cubits long and 50 cubits wide . people entered it from the courtyard on the north side .
there was a path 10 cubits wide and 100 cubits long running along the south side of the building , even though the entrance was on the north side .
there was a wall outside that was parallel to the rooms and ran along the outer courtyard . it ran in front of the rooms for 50 cubits .
the entrance was below these rooms at the east end of the building so that people could enter from the outer courtyard .
the entrance was at the start of the wall beside the courtyard .
path in front of them . they were like the rooms on the north side . they had the same length and width and the same kind of doors .
the entrance to the lower rooms was at the east end of the building so that people could enter from the open end of the path by the wall .
the man had finished measuring inside the temple area . then he brought me out through the east gate and measured all around that area .
he measured the east side with the ruler . it was 500 cubits long .
he measured the north side . it was 500 cubits long .
he measured the south side . it was 500 cubits long .
he went around to the west side and measured it . it was 500 cubits long .
the man led me to the east gate .
the vision that i saw was like the vision i saw by the kebar canal . i bowed with my face to the ground .
the glory of the lord came into the temple through the east gate .
then the spirit picked me up and brought me into the inner courtyard . the glory of the lord filled the temple .
i heard someone speaking to me from inside the temple . the man was still standing beside me .
now let them take their sexual sins and the dead bodies of their kings far away from me . then i will live among them forever .
the place for the fire on the altar was 4 cubits high . the four corners were shaped like horns .
the place for the fire on the altar was 12 cubits long by 12 cubits wide . it was perfectly square .
then take the bull for the sin offering and burn it in the proper place in the temple area , outside the temple building .
for seven days , the priests will make the altar pure and ready for use in worshiping god .
then the man brought me back to the east gate of the temple area . we were outside the gate and the gate was shut .
you did not take care of my holy things . no , you let foreigners have responsibility of my holy place ! ’ ”
but i will let them take care of the temple . they will work in the temple and do the things that must be done in it .
“ they will enter my holy place and come near my table to serve me . they will take care of the things i gave them .
they will wear linen turbans on their heads , and they will wear linen underwear . they will not wear anything that makes them sweat .
“ these priests will not shave their heads or let their hair grow long . the priests may only trim the hair of their heads .
none of the priests may drink wine when they go into the inner courtyard .
after the priest has been made clean , he must wait seven days .
the priests must not eat any bird or animal that has died a natural death or has been torn to pieces by a wild animal .
“ stop cheating people . use accurate scales and measures !
a shekel must equal 20 gerahs . a mina must equal 60 shekels . it must be equal to 20 shekels plus 25 shekels plus 15 shekels .
“ this is a special offering that you must give :
1/6 ephah of wheat for every homer of wheat ;
1/6 ephah of barley for every homer of barley ;
1/10 bath of olive oil for every cor of olive oil ;
and one sheep for every 200 sheep
“ everyone in the country will give to this offering for the ruler of israel .
at that time the ruler will offer a bull for himself and for all the people of israel . the bull will be for a sin offering .
on the sabbath day and on the day of the new moon , the common people will also worship the lord at that gate .
“ when the ruler goes in , he must enter at the porch of the east gate—and he must leave that same way .
so they will give the lamb , the grain offering , and the oil every morning for a burnt offering forever . ”
there was a brick wall around each of the four small courtyards , and there were places built into the brick walls for cooking .
the man said to me , “ these are the kitchens where those who serve at the temple cook the sacrifices for the people . ”
then the man said to me , “ son of man , did you pay close attention to the things you saw ? ”
as i walked back along the side of the river , i saw many trees on both sides of the water .
he said to me , “ this water flows east , down to the arabah valley .
but the swamps and small marshes will not become fresh . they will be left for salt .
this is what the lord god says : “ these are the borders for dividing the land among the twelve tribes of israel . joseph will have two parts .
you will divide the land equally . i promised to give this land to your ancestors , so i am giving this land to you .
berothah , sibraim ( which is on the border between damascus and hamath ) and hazer hatticon , which is on the border of hauran .
so the border will go from the sea to hazar enan on the northern border of damascus and hamath . this will be on the north side .
“ so you will divide this land among you for the tribes of israel .
the tribe where that resident lives must give him some land. ” this is what the lord god said !
you will dedicate this land to the lord . it will be 25,000 cubits long and 20,000 cubits wide .
this special area of land will be divided among the priests and levites .
this share from this holy part of the land will be especially for these priests . it will be next to the land of the levites .
the city workers from all the tribes of israel will farm this land .
“ the southern border of gad ’ s land will go from tamar to the oasis at meribah-kadesh , then along the brook of egypt to the mediterranean sea .
this is the land that you will divide among the tribes of israel . this is what each group will get. ” this is what the lord god said !
“ these are the gates of the city . the gates will be named for the tribes of israel .
there will be three gates : reuben ’ s gate , judah ’ s gate , and levi ’ s gate .
“ the distance around the city will be 18,000 cubits . from now on , the name of the city will be the lord is there . ”
from king cyrus of persia :
this is what mithredath brought out of the lord ’ s temple : 30 gold dishes , 1000 silver dishes , 29 knives and pans ,
30 gold bowls , 410 silver bowls similar to the gold bowls , and 1000 other dishes .
all together , there were 5400 things made from gold and silver . sheshbazzar brought them all with him when the prisoners left babylon and went back to jerusalem .

from the family of priests there were descendants of
they had 736 horses , 245 mules , 435 camels , and 6720 donkeys .
then they celebrated the festival of shelters just as the law of moses said . they offered the right number of burnt offerings for each day of the festival .
they sang songs of praise and thanksgiving , taking turns in singing each part . they sang ,
so the enemies began to discourage them and tried to frighten them in order to stop them from building the temple .
these enemies even wrote letters to the king of persia trying to stop the jews . they wrote a letter the year that xerxes became the king of persia .
and from the other people who the great and powerful ashurbanipal moved to the city of samaria and other places in the country west of the euphrates river .
this is the copy of the letter sent to king artaxerxes :
we have a responsibility to the king . we don ’ t want to see this happen , so we are sending this letter to inform the king .
then king artaxerxes sent this answer :
the letter you sent us has been translated and read to me .
now , you must give an order for these men to stop work . that order must be given to keep jerusalem from being rebuilt until i say so .
so the work stopped on god ’ s temple in jerusalem . the work did not continue until the second year that darius was king of persia .
at that time the prophets haggai and zechariah son of iddo began to prophesy in the name of god . they encouraged the jews in judah and jerusalem .
they also asked zerubbabel , “ what are the names of the men who are working on this building ? ”
tattenai the governor of the area west of the euphrates river , shethar bozenai , and the important people with them sent a letter to king darius .
this is a copy of that letter :
we also asked for their names . we wanted to write down the names of their leaders so that you would know who they are .
this is the answer they gave us :
but , in the first year that cyrus was king of babylon , king cyrus gave a special order for god ’ s temple to be rebuilt .
a scroll was found in the fortress of ecbatana . ( ecbatana is in the province of media . ) this is what was written on that scroll :
during the first year that cyrus was king , he gave an order about the temple of god in jerusalem . the order said :
so king darius sent this message to his officials :
the temple was finished on the third day of the month of adar . that was in the sixth year of the rule of king darius .
on the fourteenth day of the first month , the jews who came back from captivity celebrated the passover .
hilkiah was the son of shallum . shallum was the son of zadok . zadok was the son of ahitub .
ahitub was the son of amariah . amariah was the son of azariah . azariah was the son of meraioth .
meraioth was the son of zerahiah . zerahiah was the son of uzzi . uzzi was the son of bukki .
ezra arrived in jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year that artaxerxes was king .
i and my advisors are giving gold and silver to the god of israel , who lives in jerusalem . you must take this gold and silver with you .
take all these things to the god of jerusalem . they are for the worship in the temple of your god .
from the descendants of phinehas : gershom ; from the descendants of ithamar : daniel ; from the descendants of david : hattush ;

they also sent hashabiah and jeshaiah from the descendants of merari , along with their brothers and nephews . in all there were 20 men .
so we fasted and prayed to our god about our trip . he answered our prayers .
then i chose twelve of the priests who were leaders . i chose sherebiah , hashabiah , and ten of their brothers .
then we arrived in jerusalem . we rested there for three days .
we counted and weighed everything and we wrote down the total weight .
then i prayed this prayer :
“ now , god , what can we say to you ? we have stopped obeying you again .
get up , ezra . this is your responsibility , but we will support you . so be brave and do it . ”
so ezra got up . he made the leading priests , the levites , and all the israelites promise to do what he said .
those who did not come to jerusalem in three days like the officials and elders said would lose their property and be removed from the group .
then the whole group who met together answered ezra . they shouted , “ ezra , you are right ! we must do what you say .
and by the first day of the first month , they finished discussing all the men who had married foreign women .
these are the names of the descendants of the priests who married foreign women :

greetings also from all those in god ’ s family who are with me .
i pray that god our father and the lord jesus christ will be good to you and give you peace .
jesus gave himself for our sins to free us from this evil world we live in . this is what god our father wanted .
the glory belongs to god forever and ever . amen .
there is no other message that is the good news , but some people are confusing you . they want to change the good news about christ .
brothers and sisters , i want you to know that the good news message i told you was not made up by anyone .
you have heard about my past life in the jewish religion . i persecuted the church of god very much . i tried to destroy his people .
but god had special plans for me even before i was born . so he chose me through his grace .
three years later i went to jerusalem to meet peter . i stayed with him 15 days .
i met no other apostles—only james , the brother of the lord .
god knows there is nothing untrue in any of this .
later , i went to the areas of syria and cilicia .
no one in any of christ ’ s churches in judea had ever met me before .
these believers praised god because of me .
after 14 years i went back to jerusalem with barnabas and took titus with me .
titus , who was with me , is a greek . but these leaders still did not force him to be circumcised .
but we did not agree with anything those false brothers wanted . we wanted the truth of the good news to continue for you .
they asked us to do only one thing—to remember to help those who are poor . and this was something that i really wanted to do .
when peter came to antioch , he did something that was not right . i stood against him , because he was wrong .
we are jews by birth . we were not born “ sinners , ” as we call those who are not jews .
but i would be wrong to begin teaching again those things that i gave up .
you began your life in christ with the spirit . now do you try to complete it by your own power ? that is foolish .
you have experienced many things . were all those experiences wasted ? i hope they were not wasted !
so you should know that the true children of abraham are those who have faith .
abraham believed this , and because he believed , he was blessed . all people who believe are blessed the same as abraham was .
the law does not depend on faith . no , it says that the only way a person will find life by the law is to obey its commands .
but when god gave the promise , there was no mediator , because a mediator is not needed when there is only one side , and god is one .
before this faith came , the law held us as prisoners . we had no freedom until god showed us the way of faith that was coming .
i mean the law was the guardian in charge of us until christ came . after he came , we could be made right with god through faith .
now that the way of faith has come , we no longer need the law to be our guardian .
it is the same for us . we were once like children , slaves to the useless rules of this world .
but when the right time came , god sent his son , who was born from a woman and lived under the law .
god did this so that he could buy the freedom of those who were under the law . god ’ s purpose was to make us his children .
now you are not slaves like before . you are god ’ s children , and you will receive everything he promised his children .
in the past you did not know god . you were slaves to gods that were not real .
it worries me that you follow teachings about special days , months , seasons , and years . i fear that my work for you has been wasted .
brothers and sisters , i became like you . so please become like me . you were very good to me before .
you know that i came to you the first time because i was sick . that was when i told the good news to you .
am i now your enemy because i tell you the truth ?
some of you people want to be under the law . tell me , do you know what the law says ?
but the heavenly jerusalem that is above is like the free woman , who is our mother .
my brothers and sisters , you are children who were born because of god ’ s promise , just as isaac was .
so , my brothers and sisters , we are not children of the slave woman . we are children of the free woman .
we have freedom now , because christ made us free . so stand strong in that freedom . don ’ t go back into slavery again .
listen ! i , paul , tell you that if you start following the law by being circumcised , then christ can not help you .
again , i warn everyone : if you allow yourselves to be circumcised , then you must follow the whole law .
if you try to be made right with god through the law , your life with christ is finished—you have left god ’ s grace .
i say this because our hope of being right with god comes through faith . and the spirit helps us feel sure as we wait for that hope .
you were doing so well . who caused you to stop following the truth ?
it certainly wasn ’ t the one who chose you .
be careful ! “ just a little yeast makes the whole batch of dough rise . ”
i trust in the lord that you will not believe those different ideas . someone is trying to confuse you . whoever it is will be punished .
i wish those people who are bothering you would add castration to their circumcision .
the whole law is made complete in this one command : “ love your neighbor the same as you love yourself . ”
if you continue hurting each other and tearing each other apart , be careful , or you will completely destroy each other .
so i tell you , live the way the spirit leads you . then you will not do the evil things your sinful self wants .
but if you let the spirit lead you , you are not under law .
the wrong things the sinful self does are clear : committing sexual sin , being morally bad , doing all kinds of shameful things ,
but the fruit that the spirit produces in a person ’ s life is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
gentleness , and self-control . there is no law against these kinds of things .
those who belong to christ jesus have crucified their sinful self . they have given up their old selfish feelings and the evil things they wanted to do .
we get our new life from the spirit , so we should follow the spirit .
we must not feel proud and boast about ourselves . we must not cause trouble for each other or be jealous of each other .
help each other with your troubles . when you do this , you are obeying the law of christ .
if you think you are too important to do this , you are only fooling yourself .
don ’ t compare yourself with others . just look at your own work to see if you have done anything to be proud of .
you must each accept the responsibilities that are yours .
whoever is being taught god ’ s word should share the good things they have with the one who is teaching them .
if you think you can fool god , you are only fooling yourselves . you will harvest what you plant .
we must not get tired of doing good . we will receive our harvest of eternal life at the right time . we must not give up .
this is my own handwriting . you can see how big the letters are .
it doesn ’ t matter if anyone is circumcised or not . the only thing that matters is this new life we have from god .
peace and mercy to those who follow this rule—to all god ’ s people .
so don ’ t give me any more trouble . i have scars on my body that show i belong to jesus .
my brothers and sisters , i pray that the grace of our lord jesus christ will be with your spirits . amen .
god created the sky and the earth . at first ,
the earth was completely empty . there was nothing on the earth . darkness covered the ocean , and god ’ s spirit moved over the water .
then god said , “ let there be light ! ” and light began to shine .
he saw the light , and he knew that it was good . then he separated the light from the darkness .
god named the light “ day , ” and he named the darkness “ night . ”
then god said , “ let there be a space to separate the water into two parts ! ”
so god made the space and separated the water . some of the water was above it , and some of the water was below it .
god named that space “ sky. ” there was evening , and then there was morning . this was the second day .
then god said , “ let the water under the sky be gathered together so that the dry land will appear. ” and it happened .
god named the dry land “ earth , ” and he named the water that was gathered together “ seas. ” and god saw that this was good .
there was evening , and then there was morning . this was the third day .
they will be in the sky to shine light on the earth. ” and it happened .
god put these lights in the sky to shine on the earth .
there was evening , and then there was morning . this was the fourth day .
then god said , “ let the water be filled with many living things , and let there be birds to fly in the air over the earth . ”
there was evening , and then there was morning . this was the fifth day .
so god created humans in his own image . he created them to be like himself . he created them male and female .
god looked at everything he had made . and he saw that everything was very good .
so the earth , the sky , and everything in them were finished .
god finished the work he was doing , so on the seventh day he rested from his work .
this is the story about the creation of the sky and the earth . this is what happened when the lord god made the earth and the sky .
so water came up from the earth and spread over the ground .
then the lord god planted a garden in the east , in a place named eden . he put the man he made in that garden .
a river flowed from eden and watered the garden . the river then separated and became four smaller rivers .
the name of the first river was pishon . this river flowed around the entire country of havilah .
( there is gold in that country , and that gold is pure . a kind of expensive perfume and onyx are also found there . )
the name of the second river was gihon . this river flowed around the whole land of cush .
the name of the third river was tigris . this river flowed east of assyria . the fourth river was the euphrates .
the lord god put the man in the garden of eden to work the soil and take care of the garden .
the lord god gave him this command : “ you may eat from any tree in the garden .
the lord god used the rib from the man to make a woman . then he brought the woman to the man .
and the man said ,
that is why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife . in this way two people become one .
the man and his wife were naked , but they were not ashamed .
the woman answered the snake , “ no , we can eat fruit from the trees in the garden .
but the snake said to the woman , “ you will not die .
god knows that if you eat the fruit from that tree you will learn about good and evil , and then you will be like god ! ”
the lord god called to the man and said , “ where are you ? ”
the man said , “ i heard you walking in the garden , and i was afraid . i was naked , so i hid . ”
the man said , “ the woman you put here with me gave me fruit from that tree . so i ate it . ”
then the lord god said to the woman , “ what have you done ? ”
so the lord god said to the snake ,
i will make you and the woman enemies to each other .
then god said to the woman ,
then god said to the man ,
the ground will grow thorns and weeds for you .
you will work hard for your food ,
adam named his wife eve . he gave her this name because eve would be the mother of everyone who ever lived .
the lord god used animal skins and made some clothes for the man and his wife . then he put the clothes on them .
so the lord god forced the man out of the garden of eden to work the ground he was made from .
eve gave birth again to cain ’ s brother abel . abel became a shepherd , and cain became a farmer .
but he did not accept cain and his offering . cain was sad because of this , and he became very angry .
the lord asked cain , “ why are you angry ? why does your face look sad ?
later , the lord said to cain , “ where is your brother abel ? ”
then cain said to the lord , “ this punishment is more than i can bear !
cain went away from the lord and lived in the land of nod .
enoch had a son named irad . irad had a son named mehujael . mehujael had a son named methushael . and methushael had a son named lamech .
lamech married two women . one wife was named adah , and the other was named zillah .
adah gave birth to jabal . jabal was the father of people who live in tents and earn their living by keeping cattle .
jabal was jubal ’ s brother . jubal was the father of people who play the harp and flute .
zillah gave birth to tubal-cain . tubal-cain was the father of people who work with bronze and iron . the sister of tubal-cain was named naamah .
lamech said to his wives ,
the punishment for killing cain was very bad .
seth also had a son . he named him enosh . at that time people began to pray to the lord .
this is the history of adam ’ s family . when god created people , he made them like himself .
he created them male and female . and on the same day he made them , he blessed them and called them “ humans . ”
after adam was 130 years old , he had another son . this son looked just like adam . adam named his son seth .
after seth was born , adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters .
so adam lived a total of 930 years ; then he died .
after seth was 105 years old , he had a son named enosh .
after enosh was born , seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters .
so seth lived a total of 912 years ; then he died .
after enosh was 90 years old , he had a son named kenan .
after kenan was born , enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters .
so enosh lived a total of 905 years ; then he died .
after kenan was 70 years old , he had a son named mahalalel .
after mahalalel was born , kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters .
so kenan lived a total of 910 years ; then he died .
when mahalalel was 65 years old , he had a son named jared .
after jared was born , mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters .
so mahalalel lived a total of 895 years ; then he died .
after jared was 162 years old , he had a son named enoch .
after enoch was born , jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters .
so jared lived a total of 962 years ; then he died .
after enoch was 65 years old , he had a son named methuselah .
after methuselah was born , enoch walked with god for 300 years and had other sons and daughters .
so enoch lived a total of 365 years .
one day enoch was walking with god , and he disappeared . god took him .
after methuselah was 187 years old , he had a son named lamech .
after lamech was born , methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters .
so methuselah lived a total of 969 years ; then he died .
when lamech was 182 years old , he had a son .
lamech named his son noah . lamech said , “ we work very hard as farmers because god cursed the ground . but noah will bring us rest . ”
after noah was born , lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters .
so lamech lived a total of 777 years ; then he died .
after noah was 500 years old , he had sons named shem , ham , and japheth .
the lord saw that the people on the earth were very evil . he saw that they thought only about evil things all the time .
the lord was sorry that he had made people on the earth . it made him very sad in his heart .
but noah pleased the lord .
this is the history of noah ’ s family . he was a good man all his life , and he always followed god .
noah had three sons : shem , ham , and japheth .
when god looked at the earth , he saw that people had ruined it . violence was everywhere , and it had ruined their life on earth .
use cypress wood and build a boat for yourself . make rooms in the boat and cover it with tar inside and out .
“ this is the size i want you to make the boat : 300 cubits long , 50 cubits wide , and 30 cubits high .
i will make a special agreement with you . you , your wife , your sons , and their wives will all go into the boat .
two of every kind of bird , animal , and creeping thing will come to you so that you might keep them alive .
also bring every kind of food into the boat , for you and for the animals . ”
noah did everything god commanded him .
noah did everything the lord told him to do .
noah was 600 years old at the time the rains came .
he and his family went into the boat to be saved from the flood . his wife and his sons and their wives were on the boat with him .
all the clean animals , all the other animals on the earth , the birds , and everything that crawls on the earth
went into the boat with noah . these animals went into the boat in groups of two , male and female , just as god commanded .
seven days later the flood started . the rain began to fall on the earth .
all these animals went into the boat with noah . they came in groups of two from every kind of animal that had the breath of life .
all these animals went into the boat in groups of two , just as god had commanded noah . then the lord closed the door behind noah .
water flooded the earth for 40 days . the water began rising and lifted the boat off the ground .
the water continued to rise , and the boat floated on the water high above the earth .
the water rose so much that even the highest mountains were covered by the water .
the water continued to rise above the mountains . the water was more than 20 feet above the highest mountain .
the water continued to cover the earth for 150 days .
rain stopped falling from the sky , and water stopped flowing from under the earth .
the water continued to go down , and by the first day of the tenth month , the tops of the mountains were above the water .
forty days later noah opened the window he had made in the boat .
then he sent out a raven . the raven flew from place to place until the ground was dry and the water was gone .
noah also sent out a dove . he wanted it to find dry ground . he wanted to know if water still covered the earth .
after seven days noah again sent out the dove .
seven days later noah sent the dove out again . but this time the dove didn ’ t come back .
by the 27th day of the second month , the ground was completely dry .
then god said to noah ,
“ leave the boat . you , your wife , your sons , and your sons ’ wives should go out now .
so noah went out with his sons , his wife , and his sons ’ wives .
all the animals , everything that crawls , and every bird left the boat . all the animals came out of the boat in family groups .
god blessed noah and his sons and said to them , “ have many children . fill the earth with your people .
but i give you one command . you must not eat meat that still has its life ( blood ) in it .
also , i will demand your blood for your lives . that is , i will demand the life of any person or animal that takes a human life .
“ god made humans to be like himself .
“ have many children and fill the earth with your people . ”
then god said to noah and his sons ,
“ i now make my promise to you and to your people who will live after you .
i am putting a rainbow in the clouds as proof of the agreement between me and the earth .
when i bring clouds over the earth , you will see the rainbow in the clouds .
so god said to noah , “ this rainbow is proof of the agreement that i made with all living things on earth . ”
these three men were noah ’ s sons . and all the people on earth came from these three sons .
noah became a farmer and planted a vineyard .
one day noah made some wine . he got drunk , went into his tent , and took off all his clothes .
ham , the father of canaan , saw that his father was naked and told his brothers who were outside the tent .
shem and japheth took a robe , put it across their shoulders , and walked backward into the tent . then they covered their father without looking at him .
later , noah woke up . ( he was sleeping because of the wine . ) when he learned what his youngest son ham had done to him ,
may god give more land to japheth .
after the flood noah lived 350 years .
he lived a total of 950 years ; then he died .
this is the history of the families of shem , ham , and japheth . they are noah ’ s sons . these men had children after the flood .
japheth ’ s sons were gomer , magog , madai , javan , tubal , meshech , and tiras .
gomer ’ s sons were ashkenaz , riphath , and togarmah .
javan ’ s sons were elishah , tarshish , kittim , and dodanim .
ham ’ s sons were cush , mizraim , put , and canaan .
cush ’ s sons were seba , havilah , sabtah , raamah , and sabteca .
cush also had a son named nimrod who became a very powerful man on earth .
nimrod ’ s kingdom spread from babylon to erech , to akkad , and then to calneh in the land of babylonia .
nimrod also went into assyria . in assyria , nimrod built the cities of nineveh , rehoboth ir , calah , and
resen . ( resen is the city between nineveh and calah , the big city . )
mizraim was the father of the people of lud , anam , lehab , naphtuh ,
pathrus , casluh , and caphtor . ( the philistine people came from casluh . )
canaan was the father of sidon . sidon was canaan ’ s first son . canaan was also the father of the hittites ,
jebusites , amorites , girgashites ,
hivites , arkites , the sinites ,
arvadites , zemarites , and hamathites .
all these people were descendants of ham . they are arranged by families , languages , countries , and nations .
shem was japheth ’ s older brother . one of shem ’ s descendants was eber , the father of all the hebrew people .
shem ’ s sons were elam , asshur , arphaxad , lud , and aram .
aram ’ s sons were uz , hul , gether , and mash .
arphaxad was the father of shelah .
joktan was the father of almodad , sheleph , hazarmaveth , jerah ,
hadoram , uzal , diklah ,
obal , abimael , sheba ,
ophir , havilah , and jobab . all these people were joktan ’ s sons .
they lived in the area between mesha and the hill country in the east . mesha was toward the country of sephar .
these are the people from the family of shem . they are arranged by families , languages , countries , and nations .
there was a time when the whole world spoke one language . everyone used the same words .
then people began to move from the east . they found a plain in the land of babylonia and stayed there to live .
then the lord came down to see the city and the tower .
let ’ s go down and confuse their language . then they will not understand each other . ”
so people stopped building the city , and the lord scattered them all over the earth .
this is the history of shem ’ s family . two years after the flood , when shem was 100 years old , his son arphaxad was born .
after that shem lived 500 years . he had other sons and daughters .
when arphaxad was 35 years old , his son shelah was born .
after shelah was born , arphaxad lived 403 years . during that time he had other sons and daughters .
after shelah was 30 years old , his son eber was born .
after eber was born , shelah lived 403 years . during that time he had other sons and daughters .
after eber was 34 years old , his son peleg was born .
after peleg was born , eber lived another 430 years . during that time he had other sons and daughters .
after peleg was 30 years old , his son reu was born .
after reu was born , peleg lived another 209 years . during that time he had other sons and daughters .
after reu was 32 years old , his son serug was born .
after serug was born , reu lived another 207 years . during that time he had other sons and daughters .
after serug was 30 years old , his son nahor was born .
after nahor was born , serug lived another 200 years . during that time he had other sons and daughters .
after nahor was 29 years old , his son terah was born .
after terah was born , nahor lived another 119 years . during that time he had other sons and daughters .
after terah was 70 years old , his sons abram , nahor , and haran were born .
this is the history of terah ’ s family . terah was the father of abram , nahor , and haran . haran was the father of lot .
haran died in his hometown , ur of babylonia , while his father terah was still alive .
sarai did not have any children because she was not able to have children .
terah lived to be 205 years old . he died in haran .
i will build a great nation from you .
i will bless those who bless you ,
so abram left haran just like the lord said , and lot went with him . abram was 75 years old when he left haran .
the lord appeared to abram and said , “ i will give this land to your descendants . ”
then he moved on toward the negev , stopping for a time at several places on the way .
during this time there was not enough food in the land , so abram went down to egypt to live .
just before they arrived in egypt , abram told sarai , “ look , i know that you are a very beautiful woman .
so tell them that you are my sister . then they will be good to me because of you . in this way you will save my life . ”
so when abram went into egypt , the egyptian men saw that sarai was a very beautiful woman .
even some of pharaoh ’ s officials noticed her and told pharaoh how beautiful she was . so they took her to pharaoh ’ s house .
pharaoh took abram ’ s wife , so the lord caused pharaoh and all the people in his house to have very bad diseases .
then pharaoh commanded his men to lead abram out of egypt . so abram and his wife left that place and took everything they had with them .
so abram left egypt . he traveled through the negev with his wife and everything he owned . lot was also with them .
at this time abram was very rich . he had many animals and much silver and gold .
this was where abram had built an altar earlier . so he worshiped the lord there .
during this time lot was also traveling with abram . lot had many animals and tents .
abram and lot had so many animals that the land could not support both of them together .
( the canaanites and the perizzites were also living in this land at the same time . ) the shepherds of abram and lot began to argue .
so abram said to lot , “ there should be no arguing between you and me or between your people and my people . we are all brothers .
so lot chose to live in the jordan valley . the two men separated , and lot began traveling east .
abram stayed in the land of canaan , and lot lived among the cities in the valley . lot moved as far as sodom and made his camp there .
the lord knew that the people of sodom were very evil sinners .
after lot left , the lord said to abram , “ look around you . look north , south , east , west .
all this land that you see i will give to you and your people who live after you . this will be your land forever .
so go . walk through your land . i now give it to you . ”
amraphel was the king of babylonia , arioch was the king of ellasar , kedorlaomer was the king of elam , and tidal was the king of goiim .
all these kings joined their armies in the valley of siddim . ( the valley of siddim is now the salt sea . )
these kings had served kedorlaomer for twelve years . but in the 13th year , they all rebelled against him .
and they defeated the horites who lived in the area from the hill country of seir to el paran . ( el paran is near the desert . )
so kedorlaomer and his armies took everything that the people of sodom and gomorrah owned . they took all their food and clothing and left .
lot , the son of abram ’ s brother , was living in sodom , and they captured him . they also took everything he owned and left .
that night he and his men made a surprise attack against the enemy . they defeated them and chased them to hobah , north of damascus .
then abram brought back everything the enemy had stolen , as well as the women and servants , his nephew lot , and everything lot owned .
melchizedek , the king of salem and a priest of god most high , also went to meet abram . he brought bread and wine .
he blessed abram and said ,
and we praise god most high ,
then the king of sodom told abram , “ give me my people who were captured . but you can keep everything else . ”
but abram said to the king of sodom , “ i promise to the lord , the god most high , the one who made heaven and earth .
abram said , “ you have given me no son , so a slave born in my house will get everything i have . ”
abram believed the lord , and because of this faith the lord accepted him as one who has done what is right .
but abram said , “ lord god , how can i be sure that i will get this land ? ”
later , large birds flew down to eat the animals , but abram chased them away .
the sun began to go down and abram got very sleepy . while he was asleep , a very terrible darkness came over him .
but then i will punish the nation that made them slaves . your people will leave that land , and they will take many good things with them .
“ you yourself will live to be very old . you will die in peace and will be buried with your family .
this is the land of the kenites , kenizzites , kadmonites ,
hittites , perizzites , rephaites ,
amorites , canaanites , girgashites , and jebusites . ”
sarai was abram ’ s wife , but she did not have any children . she had an egyptian slave named hagar .
so after living ten years in the land of canaan , sarai gave her egyptian slave to abram as a second wife .
the angel of the lord found hagar near a spring of water in the desert . the spring was by the road to shur .
the angel said , “ hagar , sarai ’ s slave girl , why are you here ? where are you going ? ”
the angel of the lord said to her , “ sarai is your owner . go home to her and obey her . ”
the angel of the lord also said , “ from you will come many people—too many people to count . ”
then the angel of the lord said ,
ishmael will be wild and free
so the well there was called beer lahai roi . it is between kadesh and bered .
hagar gave birth to abram ’ s son , and abram named the son ishmael .
abram was 86 years old when ishmael was born from hagar .
when abram was 99 years old , the lord appeared to him . he said , “ i am god all-powerful . obey me and live the right way .
if you do this , i will prepare an agreement between us . i will promise to make your people a great nation . ”
then abram bowed down before god . god said to him ,
“ this is my part of our agreement : i will make you the father of many nations .
i will change your name from abram to abraham , because i am making you the father of many nations .
i will give you many descendants . new nations and kings will come from you .
then god said to abraham , “ now , this is your part of the agreement : you and all your descendants will obey my agreement .
this is my agreement that all of you must obey . this is the agreement between me and you and all your descendants . every male must be circumcised .
you will cut the skin to show that you follow the agreement between me and you .
so every baby boy in your nation will be circumcised . every boy who is born from your family or bought as a slave will be circumcised .
god said to abraham , “ i will give sarai , your wife , a new name . her new name will be sarah .
then abraham said to god , “ i hope ishmael will live and serve you . ”
but i will make my agreement with isaac , the son who sarah will have . he will be born at this same time next year . ”
after god finished talking with abraham , god went up into heaven .
abraham was 99 years old when he was circumcised .
and ishmael , his son , was 13 years old when he was circumcised .
abraham and his son were circumcised on the same day .
he looked up and saw three men standing in front of him . when he saw the men , he ran to them and bowed before them .
abraham said , “ sirs , please stay a while with me , your servant .
i will bring some water to wash your feet . you can rest under the trees .
i will get some food for you , and you can eat as much as you want . then you can continue your journey . ”
abraham hurried to the tent . he said to sarah , “ quickly , prepare enough flour for three loaves of bread . ”
then the men said to abraham , “ where is your wife sarah ? ”
then one of them said , “ i will come again in the spring . at that time your wife sarah will have a son . ”
abraham and sarah were very old . sarah was past the right age for women to have children .
so she laughed to herself and said , “ i am old , and my husband is old . i am too old to have a baby . ”
then the lord said to abraham , “ sarah laughed and said she was too old to have a baby .
sarah said , “ i didn ’ t laugh ! ” ( she said this because she was afraid . )
then the men got up to leave . they looked toward sodom and began walking in that direction . abraham walked with them to send them on their way .
the lord said to himself , “ should i tell abraham what i am going to do now ?
abraham will become a great and powerful nation , and all the nations on earth will be blessed because of him .
then the lord said , “ i have heard many times that the people of sodom and gomorrah are very evil .
i will go and see if they are as bad as i have heard . then i will know for sure . ”
so the men turned and started walking toward sodom while abraham stood there before the lord .
then abraham approached him and asked , “ will you destroy the good people while you are destroying those who are evil ?
then the lord said , “ if i find fifty good people in the city of sodom , i will save the whole city . ”
then abraham said , “ compared to you , lord , i am only dust and ashes . but let me bother you again and ask you this question .
what if there are five less than fifty ? will you destroy a whole city because of just five people ? ”
abraham spoke again . he said , “ and if you find only forty good people there , will you destroy the city ? ”
then abraham said , “ lord , may i bother you again and ask , what if there are twenty good people ? ”
the lord finished speaking to abraham and left . then abraham went back home .
“ where are the two men who came to you tonight ? bring them out to us . we want to have sex with them . ”
lot went outside and closed the door behind him .
he said to the men , “ no , my friends , i beg you , please don ’ t do this evil thing !
but the two men staying with lot opened the door , pulled him back inside the house , and closed the door .
we are going to destroy this city . the lord heard how evil this city is , so he sent us to destroy it . ”
but lot said to the two men , “ sirs , please don ’ t force me to run so far !
look , there is a very small town near here . let me run to that town . i can run there and be safe . ”
the angel said to lot , “ very well , i ’ ll let you do that . i will not destroy that town .
lot was entering the town as the sun came up ,
and the lord began to destroy sodom and gomorrah . he caused fire and burning sulfur to fall from the sky .
he destroyed the whole valley—all the cities , the people living in the cities , and all the plants in the valley .
lot ’ s wife was following behind him and looked back at the city . when she did , she became a block of salt .
early the next morning , abraham got up and went to the place where he stood before the lord .
abraham looked down into the valley toward the cities of sodom and gomorrah . he saw clouds of smoke rising from the land , like smoke from a furnace .
god destroyed the cities in the valley , but he remembered what abraham had said . so god sent lot away from those cities before destroying them .
lot was afraid to stay in zoar , so he and his two daughters went to live in the mountains in a cave .
both of lot ’ s daughters became pregnant . their father was the father of their babies .
the older daughter gave birth to a son . she named him moab . moab is the ancestor of all the moabites living today .
the younger daughter also gave birth to a son . she named him ben-ammi . ben-ammi is the ancestor of all the ammonites living today .
abraham left that place and traveled to the negev . he settled in the city of gerar , between kadesh and shur . while in gerar ,
abraham told people that sarah was his sister . king abimelech of gerar heard this . abimelech wanted sarah , so he sent some servants to take her .
but one night god spoke to abimelech in a dream and said , “ you will die . the woman you took is married . ”
but abimelech had not yet slept with sarah , so he said , “ lord , i am not guilty . would you kill an innocent man ?
so very early the next morning , abimelech called all his servants and told them about the dream . the servants were very afraid .
what were you afraid of ? why did you do this to me ? ”
then abraham said , “ i thought no one in this place respected god . i thought someone would kill me to get sarah .
she is my wife , but she is also my sister . she is the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother .
so abimelech gave sarah back to abraham . abimelech also gave abraham some sheep , cattle , and slaves .
and abimelech said , “ look all around you . this is my land . you may live any place you want . ”
the lord came back to visit sarah as he said he would , and he kept his promise to her .
at exactly the time god said it would happen , sarah became pregnant and gave birth to a son for abraham in his old age .
abraham named his son isaac .
abraham did what god commanded and circumcised isaac when he was eight days old .
abraham was 100 years old when his son isaac was born .
sarah said , “ god has made me happy , and everyone who hears about this will be happy with me .
isaac continued to grow , and soon he was old enough to begin eating solid food . so abraham gave a big party .
sarah saw hagar ’ s son playing . ( hagar was the egyptian slave woman who gave birth to abraham ’ s first son . )
this upset abraham very much . he was worried about his son ishmael .
but i will also bless the son of your slave woman . he is your son , so i will make a great nation from his family also . ”
after some time , when all their drinking water was gone , hagar put her son under a bush .
go help the boy . hold his hand and lead him . i will make him the father of many people . ”
his mother found a wife for him in egypt . they continued to live in the paran desert .
and abraham said , “ i promise to treat you the same way you have treated me . ”
then abraham complained to abimelech because abimelech ’ s servants had captured a well of water .
but abimelech said , “ i don ’ t know who did this . you never told me about this before today ! ”
so abraham and abimelech made an agreement . abraham gave abimelech some sheep and cattle as proof of the agreement .
abraham also put seven female lambs in front of abimelech .
abimelech asked abraham , “ why did you put these seven female lambs by themselves ? ”
abraham answered , “ when you accept these lambs from me , it will be proof that i dug this well . ”
so after that , the well was called beersheba . abraham gave the well this name because it was the place where they made a promise to each other .
so abraham and abimelech made an agreement at beersheba . then abimelech and phicol , his military commander , went back to the country of the philistines .
abraham planted a special tree at beersheba and prayed to the lord , the god who lives forever .
and abraham lived as a stranger for a long time in the country of the philistines .
after these things god decided to test abraham ’ s faith . god said to him , “ abraham ! ”
after they traveled three days , abraham looked up , and in the distance he saw the place where they were going .
isaac said to his father abraham , “ father ! ”
abraham answered , “ god himself is providing the lamb for the sacrifice , my son . ”
then abraham reached for his knife to kill his son .
but the angel of the lord stopped him . the angel called from heaven and said , “ abraham , abraham ! ”
the angel of the lord called to abraham from heaven a second time .
every nation on the earth will be blessed through your descendants . i will do this because you obeyed me . ”
then abraham went back to his servants . they all traveled back to beersheba , and abraham stayed there .
after all these things happened , a message was sent to abraham . it said , “ your brother nahor and his wife milcah have children now .
the first son is uz . the second son is buz . the third son is kemuel , the father of aram .
then there are kesed , hazo , pildash , jidlaph , and bethuel . ”
bethuel was the father of rebekah . milcah was the mother of these eight sons , and nahor was the father . nahor was abraham ’ s brother .
also nahor had four other sons from his slave woman reumah . the sons were tebah , gaham , tahash , and maacah .
sarah lived to be 127 years old .
she died in the city of kiriath arba ( hebron ) in the land of canaan . abraham was very sad and cried for her there .
then he left his dead wife and went to talk to the hittites . he said ,
the hittites answered abraham ,
abraham got up and bowed to the people .
he said to them , “ if you really want to help me bury my dead wife , speak to ephron the son of zohar for me .
ephron was sitting there among the people . he answered abraham ,
abraham bowed before the hittites .
“ sir , listen to me . ten pounds of silver mean nothing to you or me . take the land and bury your dead wife . ”
after this , abraham buried his wife sarah in the cave of that field near mamre ( hebron ) in the land of canaan .
abraham bought the field and the cave in it from the hittites . so this became his property to be used as a burial place .
abraham lived to be a very old man . the lord blessed him and everything he did .
abraham ’ s oldest servant was in charge of everything he owned . abraham called that servant to him and said , “ put your hand under my leg .
go back to my country , to my own people , to find a wife for my son isaac . bring her here to him . ”
abraham said to him , “ no , don ’ t take my son to that place .
if the girl refuses to come with you , you will be free from this promise . but you must not take my son back to that place . ”
so the servant put his hand under his master ’ s leg and made the promise .
here i am , standing by this well of water , and the young women from the city are coming out to get water .
then the servant ran to her and said , “ please give me a little water to drink from your jar . ”
rebekah quickly lowered the jar from her shoulder and gave him a drink . she said , “ drink this , sir . ”
as soon as she finished giving him something to drink , rebekah said , “ i will also pour some water for your camels . ”
the servant quietly watched her . he wanted to be sure that the lord had given him an answer and had made his trip successful .
the servant asked , “ who is your father ? and is there a place in your father ’ s house for me and my men to sleep ? ”
rebekah answered , “ my father is bethuel , the son of milcah and nahor . ”
then she said , “ yes , we have straw and other food for your camels and a place for you to sleep . ”
the servant bowed and worshiped the lord .
then rebekah ran and told her family about all these things .
the servant said , “ i am abraham ’ s servant .
so you must promise to go to my father ’ s country . go to my family and choose a wife for my son . ’
i said to my master , ‘ maybe the woman will not come back to this place with me . ’
“ today i came to this well and said , ‘ lord , god of my master abraham , please make my trip successful .
then laban and bethuel answered , “ we see that this is from the lord , so there is nothing we can say to change it .
here is rebekah . take her and go . let her marry your master ’ s son . this is what the lord wants . ”
when abraham ’ s servant heard this , he bowed to the ground before the lord .
rebekah ’ s brother and mother said , “ we will call rebekah and ask her what she wants to do . ”
they called her and asked her , “ do you want to go with this man now ? ”
so they allowed rebekah to go with abraham ’ s servant and his men . her nurse also went with them .
while rebekah was leaving they said to her ,
then rebekah and her nurse got on the camels and followed the servant and his men . so the servant took rebekah and left .
isaac had left beer lahai roi and was now living in the negev .
one evening he went out to the field to think . he looked up and saw the camels coming from far away .
rebekah also looked and saw isaac . then she jumped down from the camel .
she said to the servant , “ who is that young man walking in the field to meet us ? ”
the servant told isaac everything that had happened .
abraham married again . his new wife was named keturah .
she gave birth to zimran , jokshan , medan , midian , ishbak , and shuah .
jokshan was the father of sheba and dedan . the people of asshur , leum , and letush were descendants of dedan .
the sons of midian were ephah , epher , hanoch , abida , and eldaah . all these sons came from the marriage of abraham and keturah .
abraham lived to be 175 years old .
then he grew weak and died . he had lived a long and satisfying life . he died and went to be with his people .
this is the same cave that abraham bought from the hittites . he was buried there with his wife sarah .
after abraham died , god blessed isaac . isaac was living at beer lahai roi .
this is the list of ishmael ’ s family . ishmael was abraham and hagar ’ s son . ( hagar was sarah ’ s egyptian maid . )
these are the names of ishmael ’ s sons : the first son was nebaioth ; then kedar was born , then adbeel , mibsam ,
mishma , dumah , massa ,
hadad , tema , jetur , naphish , and kedemah .
ishmael lived to be 137 years old . then he died and went to be with his people .
this is the story of isaac . abraham had a son named isaac .
while rebekah was pregnant , the babies inside her struggled with one another . she prayed to the lord and said , “ what is happening to me ? ”
the lord said to her ,
when the right time came , rebekah gave birth to twins .
the first baby was red . his skin was like a hairy robe . so he was named esau .
isaac loved esau . he liked to eat the animals esau killed . but rebekah loved jacob .
one day esau came back from hunting . he was tired and weak from hunger . jacob was boiling a pot of beans .
but jacob said , “ you must sell me your rights as the firstborn son . ”
esau said , “ i am almost dead with hunger , so what good are these rights to me now ? ”
the lord spoke to isaac and said , “ don ’ t go down to egypt . live in the land that i commanded you to live in .
i will do this because your father abraham obeyed my words and did what i said . he obeyed my commands , my laws , and my rules . ”
so isaac settled in gerar .
after isaac had lived there a long time , abimelech looked out of his window and saw isaac and his wife enjoying one another .
abimelech called for isaac and said , “ this woman is your wife . why did you tell us that she was your sister ? ”
isaac planted fields in that place , and that year he gathered a great harvest . the lord blessed him very much .
isaac became rich . he gathered more and more wealth until he became a very rich man .
he had many flocks and herds of animals . he also had many slaves . all the philistines were jealous of him .
so they destroyed all the wells that isaac ’ s father abraham and his servants had dug many years before . they filled them with sand .
abimelech said to isaac , “ leave our country . you have become much more powerful than we are . ”
so isaac left that place and camped near the little river of gerar . he stayed there and lived .
isaac ’ s servants also dug a well near the little river and found fresh water .
then isaac ’ s servants dug another well . but there was an argument over this well too . so isaac named that well sitnah .
from there isaac went to beersheba .
so isaac built an altar and worshiped the lord in that place . he set up camp there , and his servants dug a well .
abimelech came from gerar to see isaac . he brought with him ahuzzath , his advisor , and phicol , the commander of his army .
isaac asked , “ why have you come to see me ? you were not friendly to me before . you even forced me to leave your country . ”
so isaac gave a party for them . they all ate and drank .
early the next morning each man made a promise and a vow . then the men left in peace .
so isaac named it shibah . and that city is still called beersheba .
when esau was 40 years old , he married two hittite women . one was judith the daughter of beeri . the other was basemath the daughter of elon .
these marriages made isaac and rebekah very unhappy .
isaac said , “ i am old . maybe i will die soon .
so take your bow and arrows and go hunting . kill an animal for me to eat .
prepare the food that i love . bring it to me , and i will eat it . then i will bless you before i die . ”
so esau went hunting .
rebekah said to her son jacob , “ listen , i heard your father talking to your brother esau .
so listen , son , and do what i tell you .
go out to our goats and bring me two young ones . i will prepare them the way your father loves them .
then you will carry the food to your father , and he will bless you before he dies . ”
but jacob told his mother rebekah , “ my brother esau is a hairy man . i am not hairy like him .
so rebekah said to him , “ i will accept the blame if there is trouble . do what i said . go get the goats for me . ”
so jacob went out and got two goats and brought them to his mother . his mother cooked the goats in the special way that isaac loved .
then rebekah took the clothes that her older son esau loved to wear . she put these clothes on the younger son jacob .
she took the skins of the goats and put them on jacob ’ s hands and on his neck .
then she got the food she had cooked and gave it to jacob .
jacob went to his father and said , “ father . ”
but isaac said to his son , “ how have you hunted and killed the animals so quickly ? ”
isaac did not know it was jacob , because his arms were hairy like esau ’ s . so isaac blessed jacob .
isaac said , “ are you really my son esau ? ”
then isaac said to him . “ son , come near and kiss me . ”
so jacob went to his father and kissed him . when isaac smelled esau ’ s clothes , he blessed him and said ,
may god give you plenty of rain ,
may the nations serve you
isaac finished blessing jacob . then , just as jacob left his father isaac , esau came in from hunting .
but isaac said to him , “ who are you ? ”
isaac said , “ your brother tricked me ! he came and took your blessing ! ”
but esau continued to beg his father . “ do you have only one blessing , father ? bless me also , father ! ” esau began to cry .
then isaac said to him ,
you will have to fight to live ,
so , son , do what i say . my brother laban is living in haran . go to him and hide .
stay with him for a short time until your brother stops being angry .
isaac called jacob and blessed him . then isaac gave him a command and said , “ you must not marry a canaanite woman .
i pray that god all-powerful will bless you and give you many children . i pray that you will become the father of a great nation
esau learned that jacob obeyed his father and his mother and went to paddan aram .
esau saw from this that his father did not want his sons to marry canaanite women .
jacob left beersheba and went to haran .
jacob was afraid and said , “ this is a very great place . this is the house of god . this is the gate to heaven . ”
the name of that place was luz , but jacob named it bethel .
and if i return in peace to my father ’ s house—if he does all these things—then the lord will be my god .
then jacob continued his trip . he went to the country in the east .
jacob said to the shepherds there , “ brothers , where are you from ? ”
then jacob said , “ do you know laban , the son of nahor ? ”
then jacob said , “ how is he ? ”
while jacob was talking with the shepherds , rachel came with her father ’ s sheep . ( it was her job to take care of the sheep . )
then jacob kissed rachel and cried .
then laban said , “ this is wonderful ! you are from my own family. ” so jacob stayed with laban for a month .
now laban had two daughters . the older was leah and the younger was rachel .
leah ’ s eyes were gentle , but rachel was beautiful .
jacob loved rachel , so he said to laban , “ i will work seven years for you if you will allow me to marry your daughter rachel . ”
laban said , “ it would be better for her to marry you than someone else . so stay with me . ”
so jacob stayed and worked for laban for seven years . but it seemed like a very short time because he loved rachel very much .
after seven years jacob said to laban , “ give me rachel so that i can marry her . my time of work for you is finished . ”
so laban gave a party for all the people in that place .
that night laban brought his daughter leah to jacob . jacob and leah had sexual relations together .
( laban gave his maid zilpah to his daughter to be her maid . )
laban said , “ in our country we don ’ t allow the younger daughter to marry before the older daughter .
continue for the full week of the marriage ceremony , and i will also give you rachel to marry . but you must serve me another seven years . ”
so jacob did this and finished the week . then laban gave him his daughter rachel as a wife .
( laban gave his maid bilhah to his daughter rachel to be her maid . )
so jacob had sexual relations with rachel also . and jacob loved rachel more than leah . jacob worked for laban for another seven years .
the lord saw that jacob loved rachel more than leah , so he made it possible for leah to have children . but rachel did not have any children .
jacob became angry with rachel and said , “ i am not god . he is the one who has caused you to not have children . ”
so rachel gave bilhah to her husband jacob . he had sexual relations with bilhah .
she became pregnant and gave birth to a son for jacob .
rachel said , “ god has listened to my prayer . he decided to give me a son. ” so she named this son dan .
bilhah became pregnant again and gave jacob a second son .
rachel said , “ i have fought hard to compete with my sister , and i have won. ” so she named that son naphtali .
leah saw that she could have no more children . so she gave her slave girl zilpah to jacob .
then zilpah had a son .
leah said , “ i am lucky. ” so she named the son gad .
zilpah gave birth to another son .
leah said , “ i am very happy ! now women will call me happy. ” so she named that son asher .
leah answered , “ you have already taken away my husband . now you are trying to take away my son ’ s flowers . ”
then god allowed leah to become pregnant again . she gave birth to a fifth son .
she said , “ god has given me a reward because i gave my slave to my husband. ” so she named her son issachar .
leah became pregnant again and gave birth to a sixth son .
later , leah gave birth to a daughter . she named her dinah .
then god heard rachel ’ s prayer and made it possible for rachel to have children .
she became pregnant and gave birth to a son . she said , “ god has taken away my shame . ”
rachel named the son joseph , saying , “ may the lord give me another son . ”
after the birth of joseph , jacob said to laban , “ now let me go back to my own homeland .
give me my wives and my children . i have earned them by working for you . you know that i served you well . ”
laban said to him , “ please , let me say something . i know that the lord has blessed me because of you .
tell me what i should pay you , and i will give it to you . ”
jacob answered , “ you know that i have worked hard for you . your flocks have grown and been well while i cared for them .
laban asked , “ then what should i give you ? ”
laban answered , “ i agree to that . we will do what you ask . ”
then jacob cut green branches from poplar and almond trees . he stripped off some of the bark so that the branches had white stripes on them .
he put the branches in front of the flocks at the watering places . when the animals came to drink , they also mated in that place .
then when the goats mated in front of the branches , the young that were born were spotted , striped , or black .
jacob separated the spotted and the black animals from the other animals in the flock . he kept his animals separate from laban ’ s .
any time the stronger animals in the flock were mating , jacob put the branches before their eyes . the animals mated near those branches .
in this way jacob became very rich . he had large flocks , many servants , camels , and donkeys .
then jacob noticed that laban was not as friendly as he had been in the past .
the lord said to jacob , “ go back to your own land where your ancestors lived . i will be with you . ”
so jacob told rachel and leah to meet him in the field where he kept his flocks of sheep and goats .
you both know that i have worked as hard as i could for your father .
but he cheated me . he has changed my pay ten times . but during all this time , god protected me from all of laban ’ s tricks .
so god has taken the animals away from your father and has given them to me .
the angel of god spoke to me in that dream . the angel said , ‘ jacob ! ’
rachel and leah answered jacob , “ our father has nothing to give us when he dies .
he treated us like strangers . he sold us to you , and then he spent all the money that should have been ours .
so jacob prepared for the trip . he put his children and his wives on camels .
while laban was gone to cut the wool from his sheep , rachel went into his house and stole the false gods that belonged to her father .
jacob tricked laban the aramean . he did not tell laban he was leaving .
jacob took his family and everything he owned and left quickly . they crossed the euphrates river and traveled toward the hill country of gilead .
three days later laban learned that jacob had run away .
so he gathered his men together and began to chase jacob . after seven days laban found jacob near the hill country of gilead .
that night god came to laban in a dream and said , “ be careful ! be careful of every word you say to jacob . ”
laban said to jacob , “ why did you trick me ? why did you take my daughters like they were women you captured during war ?
you didn ’ t even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye . you were very foolish to do this !
i know that you want to go back to your home . that is why you left . but why did you steal the gods from my house ? ”
jacob answered , “ i left without telling you , because i was afraid . i thought you would take your daughters away from me .
in the daytime the sun took away my strength , and at night sleep was taken from my eyes by the cold .
so i am ready to make an agreement with you . we will set up a pile of stones to show that we have an agreement . ”
so jacob found a large rock and put it there to show that he had made an agreement .
he told his men to find some more rocks and to make a pile of rocks . then they ate beside the pile of rocks .
laban named that place yegar sahadutha . but jacob named that place galeed .
laban said to jacob , “ this pile of rocks will help us both remember our agreement. ” that is why jacob called the place galeed .
then laban said , “ let the lord watch over us while we are separated from each other. ” so that place was also named mizpah .
then laban said , “ if you hurt my daughters , remember that god will punish you . if you marry other women , remember that god is watching .
here are the rocks that i have put between us , and here is the special rock to show that we made an agreement .
may the god of abraham , the god of nahor , and the god of their ancestors judge us guilty if we break this agreement . ”
early the next morning laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters goodbye . he blessed them and went back home .
jacob also left that place . while he was traveling , he saw god ’ s angels .
when he saw them , he said , “ this is god ’ s camp ! ” so jacob named that place mahanaim .
jacob ’ s brother esau was living in the area called seir in the hill country of edom . jacob sent messengers to esau .
he told them , “ tell this to my master esau : ‘ your servant jacob says , i have lived with laban all these years .
i have many cattle , donkeys , flocks , and servants . sir , i am sending you this message to ask you to accept us . ’ ”
jacob was very frightened and worried . he divided the people who were with him and all the flocks , herds , and camels into two groups .
jacob thought , “ if esau comes and destroys one group , the other group can run away and be saved . ”
jacob stayed in that place for the night . he prepared some things to give to esau as a gift .
he took 200 female goats and 20 male goats , 200 female sheep and 20 male sheep .
he took 30 camels and their colts , 40 cows and 10 bulls , 20 female donkeys and 10 male donkeys .
you will say , ‘ this is a gift to you , and your servant jacob is behind us . ’ ”
so jacob sent the gifts to esau , but he stayed that night in the camp .
during the night , jacob got up and began moving his two wives , his two maids , and his eleven sons across the jabbok river at the crossing .
after he sent his family across the river , he sent across everything he had .
jacob was left alone , and a man came and wrestled with him . the man fought with him until the sun came up .
when the man saw that he could not defeat jacob , he touched jacob ’ s leg and put it out of joint .
then the man said to jacob , “ let me go . the sun is coming up . ”
and the man said to him , “ what is your name ? ”
then jacob asked him , “ please tell me your name . ”
so jacob named that place peniel . he said , “ at this place , i saw god face to face , but my life was spared . ”
then the sun came up as jacob left peniel . he was limping because of his leg .
jacob put the maids with their children first . then he put leah and her children behind them , and he put rachel and joseph in the last place .
jacob himself went out before them . while he was walking toward his brother esau , he bowed down to the ground seven times .
esau looked up and saw the women and children . he said , “ who are all these people with you ? ”
then the two maids and the children with them went to esau . they bowed down before him .
then leah and the children with her went to esau and bowed down . and then rachel and joseph went to him and bowed down .
esau said , “ who were all those people i saw while i was coming here ? and what were all those animals for ? ”
but esau said , “ you don ’ t have to give me gifts , brother . i have enough for myself . ”
then esau said , “ now you can continue your journey . i will go with you . ”
so esau said , “ then i will leave some of my men to help you . ”
so that day esau started on his trip back to seir .
but jacob went to succoth . there he built a house for himself and small barns for his cattle . that is why the place was named succoth .
jacob safely ended his trip from paddan aram when he came to the town of shechem in canaan . he made his camp in a field near the city .
he bought the field where he camped from the family of hamor , father of shechem . he paid 100 pieces of silver for it .
he built an altar there to honor god . he named the place “ el , the god of israel . ”
one day , dinah , the daughter of leah and jacob , went out to see the women of that place .
she was seen by shechem , the son of hamor the hivite , who ruled that area . shechem took dinah and raped her .
but he was so attracted to her that he fell in love and began expressing his feelings to her .
he told his father , “ please get this girl for me so that i can marry her . ”
then shechem ’ s father , hamor , came out to talk with jacob .
but hamor talked to dinah ’ s brothers and said , “ my son shechem wants dinah very much . please let him marry her .
this marriage will show we have a special agreement . then our men can marry your women , and your men can marry our women .
you can live in the same land with us . you will be free to own the land and to trade here . ”
shechem also talked to jacob and to dinah ’ s brothers and said , “ please accept me . i will do anything you ask me to do .
jacob ’ s sons decided to lie to shechem and his father because shechem had done such a bad thing to their sister dinah .
the brothers said to them , “ we can not allow our sister to marry you because you are not yet circumcised . that would bring us shame .
but we will allow you to marry her if you do this one thing : every man in your town must be circumcised like us .
then your men can marry our women , and our men can marry your women . then we will become one people .
if you refuse to be circumcised , we will take dinah away . ”
this agreement made hamor and shechem very happy .
shechem was very happy to do what dinah ’ s brothers asked .
hamor and shechem went to the meeting place of their city . they spoke to the men of the city and said ,
but there is one thing that all our men must agree to do . they must agree to be circumcised as they are .
all the men who heard this in the meeting place agreed with hamor and shechem . and every man was circumcised at that time .
dinah ’ s brothers , simeon and levi , killed hamor and his son shechem . then they took dinah out of shechem ’ s house and left .
jacob ’ s sons went to the city and stole everything that was there because of what shechem had done to their sister .
so the brothers took all their animals , all their donkeys , and everything else in the city and in the fields .
the brothers took everything those people owned . they even took their wives and children .
but the brothers said , “ should we let these people treat our sister like a prostitute ? they were wrong to do that to our sister ! ”
so jacob and his people went to luz , which is now called bethel . it is in the land of canaan .
deborah , rebekah ’ s nurse , died there . they buried her under the oak tree at bethel . they named that place allon bacuth .
when jacob came back from paddan aram , god appeared to him again . god blessed jacob
i gave abraham and isaac some special land . now i give the land to you and to all your people who will live after you . ”
then god left that place .
jacob and his group left bethel . before they came to ephrath , rachel began giving birth to her baby .
rachel died while giving birth to the son . before dying , she named the boy benoni . but jacob called him benjamin .
rachel was buried on the road to ephrath ( that is , bethlehem ) .
jacob put a special rock on rachel ’ s grave to honor her . that special rock is still there today .
then israel continued his journey . he camped just south of eder tower .
his firstborn son was reuben , whose mother was leah . jacob ’ s other sons by leah were simeon , levi , judah , issachar , and zebulun .
his sons by rachel were joseph and benjamin .
his sons by bilhah , rachel ’ s maid , were dan and naphtali .
his sons by zilpah , leah ’ s maid , were gad and asher .
jacob went to his father isaac at mamre in kiriath arba ( hebron ) . this is where abraham and isaac had lived .
isaac lived 180 years .
this is the history of the family of esau ( edom ) .
basemath , ishmael ’ s daughter , the sister of nebaioth .
esau and adah had a son named eliphaz . basemath had a son named reuel .
oholibamah had three sons : jeush , jalam , and korah . these were esau ’ s sons who were born in the land of canaan .
esau is the father of the people of edom . these are the names of esau ’ s family living in the hill country of seir :
esau and adah ’ s son was eliphaz . esau and basemath ’ s son was reuel .
eliphaz had five sons : teman , omar , zepho , gatam , and kenaz .
eliphaz also had a slave woman named timna . timna and eliphaz had a son named amalek .
reuel had four sons : nahath , zerah , shammah , and mizzah .
these are the family groups that came from esau :
korah , gatam , and amalek .
esau ’ s son reuel was the father of these families : nahath , zerah , shammah , and mizzah .
esau ’ s wife oholibamah , daughter of anah , gave birth to jeush , jalam , and korah . these three men were the leaders of their families .
they were all sons of esau and leaders of the family groups of edom .
seir , a horite man , lived in edom before esau . these are the sons of seir :
dishon , ezer , and dishan . these sons were all horite family leaders from seir in edom .
lotan was the father of hori and heman . ( timna was lotan ’ s sister . )
shobal was the father of alvan , manahath , ebal , shepho , and onam .
anah was the father of dishon and oholibamah .
dishon had four sons . they were hemdan , eshban , ithran , and keran .
ezer had three sons . they were bilhan , zaavan , and akan .
dishan had two sons . they were uz and aran .
these are the names of the leaders of the horite families : lotan , shobal , zibeon , anah ,
dishon , ezer , and dishan . these men were the leaders of the families that lived in the country of seir .
at that time there were kings in edom . edom had kings a long time before israel did .
bela son of beor was a king who ruled in edom . he ruled over the city of dinhabah .
when bela died , jobab became king . jobab was the son of zerah from bozrah .
when jobab died , husham ruled . husham was from the land of the temanites .
when hadad died , samlah ruled that country . samlah was from masrekah .
when samlah died , shaul ruled that area . shaul was from rehoboth by the river .
when shaul died , baal hanan ruled that country . baal hanan was the son of acbor .
esau was the father of these edomite families :
jacob stayed and lived in the land of canaan . this is the same land where his father had lived .
this is the story of jacob ’ s family .
one time joseph had a special dream . later , he told his brothers about this dream , and after that his brothers hated him even more .
joseph said , “ i had a dream .
joseph ’ s brothers continued to be jealous of him , but his father thought about all these things and wondered what they could mean .
one day joseph ’ s brothers went to shechem to care for their father ’ s sheep .
jacob said to joseph , “ go to shechem . your brothers are there with my sheep . ”
at shechem , joseph got lost . a man found him wandering in the fields . the man said , “ what are you looking for ? ”
joseph answered , “ i am looking for my brothers . can you tell me where they are with their sheep ? ”
joseph ’ s brothers saw him coming from far away . they decided to make a plan to kill him .
they said to each other , “ here comes joseph the dreamer .
but reuben wanted to save joseph . he said , “ let ’ s not kill him .
we can put him into a well without hurting him. ” reuben planned to save joseph and send him back to his father .
when joseph came to his brothers , they attacked him and tore off his long and beautiful coat .
then they threw him into an empty well that was dry .
so judah said to his brothers , “ what profit will we get if we kill our brother and hide his death ?
we will profit more if we sell him to these traders . then we will not be guilty of killing our own brother. ” the other brothers agreed .
reuben went to the brothers and said , “ the boy is not in the well ! what will i do ? ”
the brothers killed a goat and put the goat ’ s blood on joseph ’ s beautiful coat .
then the brothers showed the coat to their father . and the brothers said , “ we found this coat . is this joseph ’ s coat ? ”
the midianite traders later sold joseph in egypt . they sold him to potiphar , an officer of the king of egypt and the captain of his palace guards .
about that time , judah left his brothers and went to stay with a man named hirah from the town of adullam .
judah met a canaanite girl there and married her . the girl ’ s father was named shua .
the canaanite girl gave birth to a son and named him er .
later , she gave birth to another son and named him onan .
then she had another son named shelah . judah lived in kezib when his third son was born .
judah chose a woman named tamar to be the wife of his first son er .
but er did many bad things . the lord was not happy with him , so the lord killed him .
this made the lord angry . so he killed onan also .
tamar learned that judah , her father-in-law , was going to timnah to cut the wool from his sheep .
so he went to her and said , “ let me have sex with you. ” ( judah did not know that she was tamar , his daughter-in-law . )
judah answered , “ i will send you a young goat from my flock . ”
judah asked , “ what do you want me to give you as proof that i will send you the goat ? ”
then tamar went home , took off her veil that covered her face , and again put on the special clothes that showed she was a widow .
he asked some of the men at the town of enaim , “ where is the prostitute who was here by the road ? ”
about three months later , someone told judah , “ your daughter-in-law tamar sinned like a prostitute , and now she is pregnant . ”
the time came for tamar to give birth . she was going to have twins .
after this , the other baby was born . this was the baby with the red string on his hand . they named him zerah .
the traders who bought joseph took him down to egypt . they sold him to the captain of pharaoh ’ s guard , potiphar .
the lord helped joseph become a successful man . joseph lived in the house of his master , potiphar the egyptian .
potiphar saw that the lord was with joseph and that the lord helped joseph be successful in everything he did .
so potiphar allowed joseph to take responsibility for everything in the house . potiphar didn ’ t have to worry about anything except deciding what to eat .
but joseph refused . he said , “ my master trusts me with everything in his house . he has given me responsibility for everything here .
the woman talked with joseph every day , but he refused to sleep with her .
one day joseph went into the house to do his work . he was the only man in the house at the time .
the woman saw that joseph had left his coat in her hand and had run out of the house .
my scream scared him and he ran away , but he left his coat with me . ”
then she kept his coat until her husband , joseph ’ s master , came home .
she told her husband the same story . she said , “ this hebrew slave you brought here tried to attack me !
but when he came near me , i screamed . he ran away , but he left his coat . ”
joseph ’ s master listened to what his wife said , and he became very angry .
so potiphar put joseph into the prison where the king ’ s enemies were held , and that is where joseph remained .
the lord was with joseph and continued to show his kindness to him , so the commander of the prison guards began to like joseph .
the commander of the guards put joseph in charge of all the prisoners . joseph was their leader , but he still did the same work they did .
later , two of pharaoh ’ s servants did something wrong to pharaoh . these servants were the baker and the man who served wine to pharaoh .
pharaoh became angry with his baker and wine server ,
so he put them in the same prison as joseph . potiphar , the commander of pharaoh ’ s guards , was in charge of this prison .
the commander put the two prisoners under joseph ’ s care . the two men continued to stay in prison for some time .
one night both of the prisoners had a dream . the baker and the wine server each had his own dream , and each dream had its own meaning .
joseph went to them the next morning and saw that the two men were worried .
he asked them , “ why do you look so worried today ? ”
so the wine server told joseph his dream . the server said , “ i dreamed i saw a vine .
on the vine there were three branches . i watched the branches grow flowers and then become grapes .
i was holding pharaoh ’ s cup , so i took the grapes and squeezed the juice into the cup . then i gave the cup to pharaoh . ”
then joseph said , “ i will explain the dream to you . the three branches mean three days .
i was kidnapped and taken from the land of my people , the hebrews . i have done nothing wrong ! i should not be in prison . ”
in the top basket there were all kinds of baked food for the king , but birds were eating this food . ”
joseph answered , “ i will tell you what the dream means . the three baskets mean three days .
he freed the wine server and gave him his job back , and once again the wine server put a cup of wine in pharaoh ’ s hand .
but pharaoh hanged the baker , and everything happened the way joseph said it would .
but the wine server did not remember to help joseph . he said nothing about him to pharaoh . the wine server forgot about joseph .
two years later pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the nile river .
in the dream , seven cows came out of the river and stood there eating grass . they were healthy , good-looking cows .
the seven sick cows ate the seven healthy cows . then pharaoh woke up .
then he saw seven more heads of grain sprouting , but they were thin and scorched by the hot wind .
the thin heads of grain ate the seven good heads of grain . then pharaoh woke up again and realized it was only a dream .
then the wine servant remembered joseph and said to pharaoh , “ i remember something that happened to me .
you were angry with the baker and me , and you put us in prison .
then one night he and i had a dream . each dream had a different meaning .
joseph answered , “ i can not ! but god can explain the dream for you , pharaoh . ”
then pharaoh said to joseph , “ in my dream i was standing by the nile river .
seven cows came up out of the river and stood there eating the grass . they were healthy , good-looking cows .
the thin , sick cows ate the first healthy cows ,
“ in my next dream i saw seven heads of grain growing on one plant . they were healthy and full of grain .
and then seven more heads of grain grew after them , but they were thin and scorched by the hot wind .
then the thin heads of grain ate the seven good heads of grain .
then joseph said to pharaoh , “ both of these dreams have the same meaning . god is telling you what will happen soon .
the seven good cows and the seven good heads of grain are seven good years .
god has shown you what will happen soon . he will make these things happen just as i told you .
for seven years there will be plenty of food in egypt .
it will be so bad that people will forget what it was like to have plenty of food .
so , pharaoh , you should choose a wise , intelligent man and put him in charge of egypt .
then during the seven years of hunger , there will be food for the country of egypt . and egypt will not be destroyed by the famine . ”
this seemed like a very good idea to pharaoh , and all his officials agreed .
so pharaoh said to joseph , “ god showed these things to you , so you must be the wisest man .
pharaoh said to joseph , “ i now make you governor over all of egypt . ”
joseph was 30 years old when he began serving the king of egypt . he traveled throughout the country of egypt .
during the seven good years , the crops in egypt grew very well .
joseph stored so much grain that it was like the sands of the sea . he stored so much grain that it could not be measured .
for seven years people had all the food they needed , but those years ended .
the famine began , and the people cried to pharaoh for food . pharaoh said to the egyptian people , “ go ask joseph what to do . ”
but the famine was bad everywhere . so people from the countries around egypt had to come to joseph in egypt to buy grain .
i have heard that there is grain for sale in egypt . go there and buy grain for us so that we will live and not die ! ”
so ten of joseph ’ s brothers went to egypt to buy grain .
jacob did not send benjamin . ( benjamin was joseph ’ s only full brother . ) jacob was afraid that something bad might happen to benjamin .
joseph recognized his brothers , but they did not know who he was .
then joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed about his brothers .
but the brothers said to him , “ no , sir , we come as your servants . we have come only to buy food .
we are all brothers—we all have the same father . we are honest men . we have come only to buy food . ”
then joseph said to them , “ no , you have come to spy on us ! ”
but joseph said to them , “ no ! i can see that i am right . you are spies .
then joseph put them all in prison for three days .
after three days joseph said to them , “ i am a god-fearing man . do this , and i will let you live .
if you are honest men , one of your brothers can stay here in prison , and the others can go and carry grain back to your people .
so the brothers put the grain on their donkeys and left .
the brothers went back to their father jacob in the land of canaan . they told him about everything that had happened .
they said , “ the governor of that country spoke rudely to us . he thought that we were spies !
we told him , ‘ we are honest men , not spies .
the famine was very bad in that country .
if you send benjamin with us , we will go down and buy grain .
but if you refuse to send benjamin , we will not go . the man warned us to not come back without him . ”
israel said , “ why did you tell him you had another brother ? why did you do such a bad thing to me ? ”
if you had let us go before , we could have already made two trips for food . ”
take benjamin , and go back to the man .
the servant did as he was told . he brought the men into joseph ’ s house .
so the brothers went to the servant in charge of joseph ’ s house .
they said , “ sir , i promise this is the truth . the last time we came , we came to buy food .
the servant led the men into joseph ’ s house . he gave them water , and they washed their feet . then he fed their donkeys .
the brothers heard that they were going to eat with joseph , so they worked until noon preparing their gifts for him .
when joseph came home , the brothers gave him the gifts they had brought with them . then they bowed down to the ground in front of him .
joseph asked them how they were doing . then he said , “ how is your elderly father you told me about ? is he still alive ? ”
the brothers answered , “ yes , sir , our father is still alive. ” and they again bowed before joseph .
then joseph washed his face and came out . he regained control of himself and said , “ now it is time to eat . ”
put the youngest brother ’ s money in his sack too . but also put my special silver cup in his sack. ” so the servant obeyed joseph .
early the next morning the brothers and their donkeys were sent back to their country .
my master drinks from that cup , and he uses it to learn secret things . what you did was wrong ! ’ ”
so the servant obeyed . he rode out to the brothers and stopped them . the servant said to them what joseph had told him to say .
but the brothers said to the servant , “ why does the governor say these things ? we wouldn ’ t do anything like that !
we brought back the money that we found in our sacks before . so surely we wouldn ’ t steal silver or gold from your master ’ s house .
if you find the silver cup in any of our sacks , let that man die . you can kill him , and we will be your slaves . ”
then every brother quickly opened his sack on the ground .
the servant started looking in the sacks . he started with the oldest brother and ended with the youngest . he found the cup in benjamin ’ s sack .
the brothers were very sad . they tore their clothes to show their sadness . they put their sacks back on the donkeys and went back to the city .
when judah and his brothers went back to joseph ’ s house , joseph was still there . the brothers fell to the ground and bowed down before him .
when we were here before , you asked us , ‘ do you have a father or a brother ? ’
then you said to us , ‘ bring that brother to me . i want to see him . ’
but you said to us , ‘ you must bring your youngest brother , or i will not sell you grain again . ’
so we went back to our father and told him what you said .
“ later , our father said , ‘ go back and buy us some more food . ’
then my father said to us , ‘ you know that my wife rachel gave me two sons .
i let one son go away , and he was killed by a wild animal . and i haven ’ t seen him since .
if you take my other son away from me , and something happens to him , i will be sad enough to die . ’
now , imagine what will happen when we go home without our youngest brother—he is the most important thing in our father ’ s life !
so now i beg you , please let the boy go back with his brothers , and i will stay and be your slave .
i can not go back to my father if the boy is not with me . i am very afraid of what would happen to my father . ”
joseph continued to cry , and all the egyptian people in pharaoh ’ s house heard it .
this terrible famine has continued for two years now , and there will be five more years without planting or harvest .
so god sent me here ahead of you so that i can save your people in this country .
you can live near me in the land of goshen . you , your children , your grandchildren , and all of your animals are welcome here .
i will take care of you during the next five years of hunger . so you and your family will not lose everything you own . ’
“ surely you can see that i really am joseph . even my brother benjamin knows it is me , your brother , talking to you .
then joseph hugged his brother benjamin , and they both began crying .
then joseph cried as he kissed all his brothers . after this , the brothers began talking with him .
pharaoh learned that joseph ’ s brothers had come to him . this news spread throughout pharaoh ’ s house . pharaoh and his servants were very excited !
so pharaoh told joseph , “ tell your brothers to take all the food they need and go back to the land of canaan .
don ’ t worry about bringing all of their belongings . we can give them the best of egypt . ”
so the sons of israel did this . joseph gave them good wagons just as pharaoh had promised . and joseph gave them enough food for their trip .
he gave each brother a suit of beautiful clothes . but to benjamin he gave five suits of beautiful clothes and 300 pieces of silver .
so the brothers left egypt and went to their father in the land of canaan .
they told him , “ father , joseph is still alive ! and he is the governor over the whole country of egypt . ”
israel said , “ now i believe you . my son joseph is still alive ! i am going to see him before i die ! ”
so israel began his trip to egypt . first he went to beersheba . there he worshiped god , the god of his father isaac . he offered sacrifices .
during the night god spoke to israel in a dream and said , “ jacob , jacob . ”
they also had their cattle and everything they owned in the land of canaan . so israel went to egypt with all his children and his family .
with him were his sons and his grandsons , his daughters and his granddaughters . all of his family went with him .
these are the names of israel ’ s sons and family who went to egypt with him :
reuben ’ s sons were hanoch , pallu , hezron , and carmi .
levi ’ s sons were gershon , kohath , and merari .
issachar ’ s sons were tola , puah , job , and shimron .
zebulun ’ s sons were sered , elon , and jahleel .
gad ’ s sons were zephon , haggi , shuni , ezbon , eri , arodi , and areli .
asher ’ s sons were imnah , ishvah , ishvi , beriah , and their sister serah . also there were beriah ’ s sons , heber and malkiel .
benjamin ’ s sons were bela , beker , ashbel , gera , naaman , ehi , rosh , muppim , huppim , and ard .
these were the sons of jacob from his wife rachel . there were 14 people in this family .
dan ’ s son was hushim .
naphtali ’ s sons were jahziel , guni , jezer , and shillem .
also , joseph had two sons in egypt . with these two grandsons , jacob ’ s family in egypt numbered 70 people in all .
jacob sent judah ahead to speak to joseph . judah went to joseph in the land of goshen . then jacob and his people followed into the land .
then israel said to joseph , “ now i can die in peace . i have seen your face , and i know that you are still alive . ”
they are a family of shepherds . they have always kept sheep and cattle . they have brought all their animals and everything they own with them . ’
when pharaoh calls you , he will ask , ‘ what work do you do ? ’
joseph chose five of his brothers to be with him before the pharaoh .
pharaoh said to the brothers , “ what work do you do ? ”
then pharaoh said to joseph , “ your father and your brothers have come to you .
then joseph called his father jacob to come in to meet pharaoh . jacob blessed pharaoh .
then pharaoh said to him , “ how old are you ? ”
then jacob blessed pharaoh and left from his meeting with him .
joseph also gave his father , his brothers , and all their people the food they needed .
the famine got worse ; there was no food anywhere in the land . egypt and canaan became very poor because of this bad time .
people in the land bought more and more grain . joseph saved the money and brought it to pharaoh ’ s house .
but joseph answered , “ give me your cattle , and i will give you food . ”
so the people used their cattle and horses and all their other animals to buy food . and that year , joseph gave them food and took their animals .
so joseph bought all the land in egypt for pharaoh . all the people in egypt sold joseph their fields . they did this because they were very hungry .
and everywhere in egypt all the people became pharaoh ’ s slaves .
the people said , “ you have saved our lives . we are happy to be slaves to pharaoh . ”
israel stayed in egypt . he lived in the land of goshen . his family grew and became very large . they became landowners there and did very well .
jacob lived in egypt 17 years , so he was 147 years old .
bury me in the place where my ancestors are buried . carry me out of egypt and bury me in our family grave . ”
some time later joseph learned that his father was very sick . so he took his two sons , manasseh and ephraim , and went to his father .
then israel said to joseph , “ god all-powerful appeared to me at luz in the land of canaan . god blessed me there .
then israel saw joseph ’ s sons . israel said , “ who are these boys ? ”
joseph said to his father , “ these are my sons . these are the boys god gave me . ”
israel was old and his eyes were not good . so joseph brought the boys close to his father . israel kissed and hugged the boys .
then joseph took the boys off israel ’ s lap , and they bowed down in front of his father .
and israel blessed joseph and said ,
he was the angel who saved me from all my troubles .
joseph said to his father , “ you have your right hand on the wrong boy . manasseh is the firstborn . put your right hand on him . ”
so israel blessed them that day . he said ,
“ children of jacob , gather around .
“ reuben , my first son , you are my strength ,
but your passion was like a flood you couldn ’ t control .
“ simeon and levi are brothers .
i will not join their secret meetings .
their anger is so strong that it is a curse .
“ judah , your brothers will praise you .
judah is like a young lion .
men from judah ’ s family will be kings .
he ties his donkeys to the best grapevines .
his eyes are red from drinking wine .
“ zebulun will live near the sea .
“ issachar is like a donkey that has worked too hard .
he will see his land is pleasant
“ dan will rule his people
dan will be like a snake at the side of the road .
“ lord , i am waiting for your salvation .
“ a group of robbers will attack gad ,
“ asher ’ s land will grow much good food .
“ naphtali is like a deer running free ,
“ joseph is like a wild donkey ,
people attacked him and made life hard for him .
but he won the fight
the god of your father who helps you .
my parents had many good things happen to them .
“ benjamin is like a hungry wolf .
these are the twelve families of israel . and this is what their father said to them . he gave each son a blessing that was right for him .
that cave is in the field that was bought from the hittites . ”
after jacob finished talking to his sons , he lay down , put his feet back on the bed , and died .
when israel died , joseph was very sad . he hugged his father and cried over him and kissed him .
after the time of sadness was finished , joseph spoke to pharaoh ’ s officers and said , “ please tell this to pharaoh :
pharaoh answered , “ keep your promise . go and bury your father . ”
so joseph went to bury his father . all of pharaoh ’ s officials , personal advisors , and all the older leaders of egypt went with joseph .
so there was a large crowd of people with him . there was even a group of soldiers riding in chariots and some on horses .
they went to goren atad , east of the jordan river . there they had a long funeral service for israel , which continued for seven days .
so jacob ’ s sons did what their father told them .
after joseph buried his father , he and everyone in the group with him went back to egypt .
so the brothers sent this message to joseph : “ before your father died , he told us to give you a message .
his brothers went to him and bowed down in front of him . they said , “ we will be your servants . ”
then joseph said to them , “ don ’ t be afraid . i am not god ! i have no right to punish you .
joseph continued to live in egypt with his father ’ s family . he died when he was 110 years old .
during joseph ’ s life ephraim had children and grandchildren . and his son manasseh had a son named makir . joseph lived to see makir ’ s children .
joseph died in egypt when he was 110 years old . doctors prepared his body for burial and put the body in a coffin in egypt .
this is the message that was given to habakkuk the prophet .
lord , i continue to ask for help . when will you listen to me ? i cried to you about the violence , but you did nothing !
people are stealing things and hurting others . they are arguing and fighting . why do you make me look at these terrible things ?
the babylonians will scare the other people . they will do what they want to do and go where they want to go .
then they will leave like the wind and go on to fight against other places . the only thing the babylonians worship is their own strength . ”
lord , you are the one who lives forever !
your eyes are too good to look at evil .
you made people like fish in the sea .
the enemy catches all of them with hooks and nets .
his net helps him live like the rich
will he continue to take riches with his net ?
i will stand like a guard and watch .
the lord answered me , “ write down what i show you . write it clearly on a sign so that the message will be easy to read .
this message can not help those who refuse to listen to it , but those who are good will live because they believe it .
you planned shameful things , and that will bring shame to your own family . you have done wrong , and it will cost you your life .
the stones of the walls will cry out against you . even the wooden rafters in your own house will prove that you are wrong .
“ look at them ! they kill people to build their city and do wicked things to make their walled city strong .
but the lord all-powerful has decided that a fire will destroy everything that those people worked to build . all their work will be for nothing .
then people everywhere will know about the glory of the lord . this news will spread just as water spreads out into the sea .
but the lord is in his holy temple , so the whole earth should be silent in his presence and show him respect .
the prayer of habakkuk the prophet .
lord , i have heard the news about you .
god is coming from teman .
rays of light shine from his hand , a bright , shining light .
the sickness went before him ,
he stood and judged the earth .
i saw that the cities of cushan were in trouble
lord , were you angry at the rivers ?
even then you showed your rainbow .
the mountains saw you and shook .
the sun and the moon lost their brightness .
in anger you walked on the earth
you came to save your people
you used moses ’ walking stick
but you marched your horses
my whole body shook when i heard the story .
figs might not grow on the fig trees ,
but i will still be glad in the lord
the lord god gives me my strength .
this is what the lord all-powerful said , “ the people say it is not yet the right time to build the lord ’ s temple . ”
again haggai received a message from the lord . haggai spoke this message :
now the lord all-powerful says , ‘ think about what is happening .
the lord all-powerful said , “ think about what you are doing .
that is why the sky holds back its dew and why the earth holds back its crops .
then haggai , the lord ’ s messenger , delivered this message to the people : “ the lord says , ‘ i am with you ! ’ ”
so they began this work on the 24th day of the sixth month in the second year darius was the king .
on the 21st day of the seventh month , this message from the lord came to haggai :
‘ all their silver really belongs to me ! and all the gold is mine ! ’ this is what the lord all-powerful said .
on the 24th day of the ninth month in the second year darius was king of persia , this message from the lord came to haggai the prophet :
“ the lord all-powerful commands you to ask the priests what the law says about these things :
then haggai said , “ whoever touches a dead body will become unclean . now if they touch anything else , will it also become unclean ? ”
“ ‘ think about what has happened to you . think about how things were before you began working on the lord ’ s temple .
another message from the lord came to haggai on the 24th day of the month . this is the message :
“ go to zerubbabel , the governor of judah and tell him that i will shake heaven and earth .
in the past god spoke to our people through the prophets . he spoke to them many times and in many different ways .
the son became much greater than the angels , and god gave him a name that is much greater than any of their names .
god never said this to any of the angels :
and then , when god presents his firstborn son to the world , he says ,
this is what god said about the angels :
but this is what he said about his son :
you love what is right and hate what is wrong .
these things will disappear , but you will stay .
you will fold them up like a coat ,
and god never said this to an angel :
all the angels are spirits who serve god and are sent to help those who will receive salvation .
so we must be more careful to follow what we were taught . we must be careful so that we will not be pulled away from the true way .
god did not choose angels to be the rulers over the new world that was coming . that future world is the world we have been talking about .
it is written some place in the scriptures ,
for a short time you made him lower than the angels .
you put everything under his control . ”
jesus became like these people and died so that he could free them . they were like slaves all their lives because of their fear of death .
clearly , it is not angels that jesus helps . he helps the people who are from abraham .
and now he can help those who are tempted . he is able to help because he himself suffered and was tempted .
every house is built by someone , but god built everything .
moses was faithful as a servant in god ’ s whole house . he told people what god would say in the future .
so it is just as the holy spirit says :
don ’ t be stubborn as you were in the past ,
for 40 years in the desert , your people saw what i did .
so i was angry with them .
so i was angry and made a promise :
so , brothers and sisters , be careful that none of you has the evil thoughts that cause so much doubt that you stop following the living god .
we have the honor of sharing in all that christ has if we continue until the end to have the sure faith we had in the beginning .
that ’ s why the spirit said ,
who were those who heard god ’ s voice and turned against him ? it was all the people moses led out of egypt .
and who was god angry with for 40 years ? he was angry with those who sinned . and their dead bodies were left in the desert .
so we see that they were not allowed to enter and have god ’ s rest , because they did not believe .
only we who believe it are able to enter god ’ s place of rest . as god said ,
but in the scripture above god said , “ they will never enter my place of rest . ”
this shows that the seventh-day rest for god ’ s people is still to come .
the high priest has his own weaknesses . so he is able to be gentle with those who do wrong out of ignorance .
he offers sacrifices for their sins , but he must also offer sacrifices for his own sins .
to be a high priest is an honor . but no one chooses himself for this work . that person must be chosen by god just as aaron was .
and in another part of the scriptures god says ,
jesus was the son of god , but he still suffered , and through his sufferings he learned to obey whatever god says .
this made him the perfect high priest , who provides the way for everyone who obeys him to be saved forever .
god made him high priest , just like melchizedek .
we have many things to tell you about this . but it is hard to explain because you have stopped trying to understand .
anyone who lives on milk is still a baby and is not able to understand much about living right .
but solid food is for people who have grown up . from their experience they have learned to see the difference between good and evil .
and that ’ s what we will do if god allows .
he said , “ i will surely bless you . i will give you many descendants . ”
abraham waited patiently for this to happen , and later he received what god promised .
these two things can not change : god can not lie when he says something , and he can not lie when he makes an oath .
this hope is like an anchor for us . it is strong and sure and keeps us safe . it goes behind the curtain .
jesus has already entered there and opened the way for us . he has become the high priest forever , just like melchizedek .
then abraham gave him a tenth of everything he had .
you can see that melchizedek was very great . abraham , our great ancestor , gave him a tenth of everything he won in battle .
and everyone knows that the more important person always blesses the less important person .
levi was not yet born , but he already existed in his ancestor abraham when melchizedek met him .
and when a different kind of priest comes , then the law must be changed too .
and these things become even clearer when we see that another priest has come who is like melchizedek .
this is what the scriptures say about him : “ you are a priest forever—the kind of priest melchizedek was . ”
the old rule is now ended because it was weak and worthless .
but christ became a priest with god ’ s oath . god said to him ,
so this means that jesus is the guarantee of a better agreement from god to his people .
also , when one of those other priests died , he could not continue being a priest . so there were many of those priests .
but jesus lives forever . he will never stop serving as a priest .
every high priest has the work of offering gifts and sacrifices to god . so our high priest must also offer something to god .
if there was nothing wrong with the first agreement , then there would be no need for a second agreement .
but god found something wrong with the people . he said ,
it will not be like the agreement
this is the new agreement i will give the people of israel .
never again will anyone have to teach their neighbors
and i will forgive the wrongs they have done ,
god called this a new agreement , so he has made the first agreement old . and anything that is old and useless is ready to disappear .
the first agreement had rules for worship and a place for worship here on earth .
behind the second curtain was a room called the most holy place .
everything in the tent was made ready in the way i have explained . then the priests went into the first room every day to do their worship duties .
the holy spirit uses those two separate rooms to teach us that the way into the most holy place was not open while the first room was still there .
when someone dies and leaves a will , there must be proof that the one who wrote the will is dead .
a will means nothing while the one who wrote it is still living . it can be used only after that person ’ s death .
that is why blood was needed to begin the first agreement between god and his people .
then he said , “ this is the blood that makes the agreement good—the agreement that god commanded you to follow . ”
in the same way , moses sprinkled the blood on the holy tent . he sprinkled the blood over everything used in worship .
the law says that almost everything must be made clean by blood . sins can not be forgiven without a blood sacrifice .
everyone must die once . then they are judged .
but that ’ s not what happens . their sacrifices make them remember their sins every year ,
because it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
so when christ came into the world he said ,
you are not pleased with the sacrifices of animals killed and burned
then i said , ‘ here i am , god .
every day the priests stand and do their religious service . again and again they offer the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins .
but christ offered only one sacrifice for sins , and that sacrifice is good for all time . then he sat down at the right side of god .
and now christ waits there for his enemies to be put under his power .
with one sacrifice christ made his people perfect forever . they are the ones who are being made holy .
the holy spirit also tells us about this . first he says ,
“ this is the agreement i will make
and after everything is forgiven , there is no more need for a sacrifice to pay for sins .
we enter through a new way that jesus opened for us . it is a living way that leads through the curtain—christ ’ s body .
and we have a great priest who rules the house of god .
we must hold on to the hope we have , never hesitating to tell people about it . we can trust god to do what he promised .
we should think about each other to see how we can encourage each other to show love and do good works .
if we decide to continue sinning after we have learned the truth , then there is no other sacrifice that will take away sins .
it is a terrible thing to face punishment from the living god .
remember the days when you first learned the truth . you had a hard struggle with much suffering , but you continued strong .
sometimes people said hateful things to you and mistreated you in public . and sometimes you helped others who were being treated that same way .
so don ’ t lose the courage that you had in the past . your courage will be rewarded richly .
you must be patient . after you have done what god wants , you will get what he promised you .
the person who is right with me
but we are not those who turn back and are lost . no , we are the people who have faith and are saved .
faith is what makes real the things we hope for . it is proof of what we can not see .
god was pleased with the people who lived a long time ago because they had faith like this .
without faith no one can please god . whoever comes to god must believe that he is real and that he rewards those who sincerely try to find him .
abraham was waiting for the city that has real foundations . he was waiting for the city that is planned and built by god .
when people accept something like that , they show they are waiting for a country that will be their own .
if they were thinking about the country they had left , they could have gone back .
isaac blessed the future of jacob and esau . he did that because he had faith .
some were laughed at and beaten . others were tied up and put in prison .
the world was not good enough for these great people . they had to wander in deserts and mountains , living in caves and holes in the ground .
god was pleased with all of them because of their faith . but not one of them received god ’ s great promise .
you are struggling against sin , but you have not had to give up your life for the cause .
you are children of god , and he speaks words of comfort to you . you have forgotten these words :
the lord disciplines everyone he loves ;
so , if you never receive the discipline that every child must have , you are not true children and don ’ t really belong to god .
you have become weak , so make yourselves strong again .
live in the right way so that you will be saved and your weakness will not cause you to be lost .
try to live in peace with everyone . and try to keep your lives free from sin . anyone whose life is not holy will never see the lord .
they did not want to hear the command : “ if anything , even an animal , touches the mountain , it must be killed with stones . ”
what they saw was so terrible that moses said , “ i am shaking with fear . ”
because our god is like a fire that can destroy us .
continue loving each other as brothers and sisters in christ .
always remember to help people by welcoming them into your home . some people have done that and have helped angels without knowing it .
keep your lives free from the love of money . and be satisfied with what you have . god has said ,
so we can feel sure and say ,
remember your leaders . they taught god ’ s message to you . remember how they lived and died , and copy their faith .
jesus christ is the same yesterday , today , and forever .
we have a sacrifice . and those priests who serve in the holy tent can not eat from the sacrifice we have .
so jesus also suffered outside the city . he died to make his people holy with his own blood .
so we should go to jesus outside the camp and accept the same shame that he had .
here on earth we don ’ t have a city that lasts forever . but we are waiting for the city that we will have in the future .
so through jesus we should never stop offering our sacrifice to god . that sacrifice is our praise , coming from lips that speak his name .
and don ’ t forget to do good and to share what you have with others , because sacrifices like these are very pleasing to god .
continue praying for us . we feel right about what we do , because we always try to do what is best .
and i beg you to pray that god will send me back to you soon . i want this more than anything else .
i want you to know that our brother timothy is out of prison . if he comes to me soon , we will both come to see you .
give my greetings to all your leaders and to all god ’ s people . all those from italy send you their greetings .
god ’ s grace be with you all .
so hosea married gomer daughter of diblaim . she became pregnant and gave birth to a son for hosea .
and at that time i will break israel ’ s bow at jezreel valley . ”
after gomer had finished nursing lo-ruhamah , she became pregnant again and gave birth to a son .
then the lord said , “ name him lo-ammi , because you are not my people , and i am not your god . ”
i will have no pity on her children because they are the children of prostitution .
“ so i , the lord , will speak romantic words to her . i will lead her into the desert and speak tender words .
this is what the lord says .
i will take the names of those false gods out of her mouth . then people will not use those names again .
and i will make you my bride forever . i will make you my bride with goodness and justice and with love and mercy .
i will make you my faithful bride . then you will really know the lord .
and at that time i will answer. ” this is what the lord says .
the earth will produce grain , wine , and oil ,
i will sow her many seeds on her land .
so i bought gomer back for 6 ounces of silver and 9 bushels of barley .
they are always cursing , lying , killing , stealing , and committing adultery . they murder one person after another .
no one should argue or blame another person . priests , my argument is with you !
you priests will fall in the daytime . and at night the prophet will also fall with you . i will also destroy your mother .
they became proud . they sinned more and more against me , so i will change their honor to shame .
“ the priests fed on the people ’ s sins . they wanted more and more of their sin offerings .
“ sexual sins , strong drink , and new wine ruin a person ’ s ability to think straight .
“ ephraim has joined his idols , so leave him alone .
ephraim has joined their drunkenness . let them continue to be prostitutes . let them be with their lovers .
they went to those gods for safety , and they have lost their ability to think . their altars will bring them shame .
“ priests , nation of israel , and people in the king ’ s family , listen to me . you have been judged guilty !
you have done many evil things , so i will punish you all .
i know ephraim . i know what israel has done . ephraim , right now you act like a prostitute . israel is dirty with sin .
israel ’ s pride is a witness against them , so israel and ephraim will stumble in their sin . but judah will also stumble with them .
they have not been faithful to the lord . their children are from some stranger . and now , he will destroy them and their land again .
“ blow the horn in gibeah .
the leaders of judah are like thieves trying to steal someone ’ s property ,
ephraim will be punished .
i will destroy ephraim as a moth eats a piece of cloth .
ephraim saw his sickness , and judah saw his wound ,
i will be like a lion to ephraim ,
i will go back to my place ,
“ come , let ’ s go back to the lord .
after two days he will bring us back to life .
let ’ s learn about the lord .
“ ephraim , what should i do with you ?
this is because i want faithful love ,
but the people broke the agreement as adam did .
gilead is a city of people who do evil—
the priests are like gangs of robbers
i have seen a terrible thing in the nation of israel .
judah , there is also a time of harvest for you .
“ i will heal israel !
they don ’ t believe that i will remember their crimes .
their evil makes their king happy .
a baker presses dough to make bread .
on our king ’ s day , the leaders get so drunk that they get sick .
the people make their secret plans .
they are all like hot ovens .
“ ephraim mixes with the nations .
strangers destroy ephraim ’ s strength ,
ephraim ’ s pride speaks against him .
so ephraim has become like a silly dove without understanding .
they go to those countries for help ,
it will be very bad for those who left me .
they never call to me from their hearts .
i trained them and made their arms strong ,
like a boomerang , they changed directions ,
they yell out at me , ‘ my god , we in israel know you ! ’
but israel refused the good things , so the enemy chases him .
“ israel was destroyed ;
ephraim went to his ‘ lovers . ’
yes , israel was taken to the nations ,
“ ephraim built more and more altars ,
even if i wrote 10,000 laws for ephraim ,
the israelites love sacrifices .
israel has built palaces for their kings ,
but the grain from those threshing floors will not provide enough food for israel . there will not be enough wine for israel .
the israelites will not stay in the lord ’ s land . ephraim will return to egypt . in assyria they will eat food that they should not eat .
they will not be able to celebrate the lord ’ s feasts or festivals .
the israelites have gone deep into ruin as in the time of gibeah . god will remember the israelites ’ sins , and he will punish them .
“ like a bird , ephraim ’ s glory will fly away . there will be no more pregnancies , no more births , and no more babies .
i can see that ephraim is leading his children into a trap . ephraim will lead his children out to the killer .
lord , give them what you will . give them a womb that loses babies and breasts that can not give milk .
all their evil is in gilgal ;
ephraim will be punished .
those people will not listen to my god ,
israel is like a vine
the people of israel tried to trick god ,
now the israelites say , “ we have no king . we don ’ t honor the lord . and his king can not do anything to us . ”
samaria ’ s false god will be destroyed . it will be like a piece of wood floating away on the water ’ s surface .
i will come to punish them . armies will come together against them and punish the israelites for both of their sins .
but you planted evil , and you harvested trouble . you ate the fruit of your lies , because you had trusted in your power and your soldiers .
the lord said , “ i loved israel when he was a child ,
but the more i called the israelites ,
“ but i was the one who taught ephraim to walk .
i led them with ropes ,
“ the israelites will not go back to egypt . the king of assyria will become their king , because they refused to turn back to god .
the sword will swing against their cities and kill their strong men . it will destroy their leaders .
“ my people expect me to come back . they will call to god above , but he will not help them . ”
“ ephraim , i don ’ t want to give you up .
i will not let my terrible anger win .
i , the lord , will roar like a lion ,
they will come from egypt ,
“ ephraim surrounded me with false gods .
the lord says , “ i have a complaint against israel . jacob must be punished for the bad things he did .
jacob wrestled with god ’ s angel and won . he cried and asked for a favor . that happened at bethel . there he spoke to us .
yes , yahweh is the god of the armies . his name is yahweh .
so come back to your god . be loyal to him . do the right thing , and always trust in your god !
“ jacob is a tricky merchant . he even cheats his friend ! even his scales lie .
i spoke to the prophets and gave them many visions . i gave the prophets many ways to teach my lessons to you .
“ jacob ran away to the land of aram . there israel worked for a wife . he kept sheep to get another wife .
but the lord used a prophet and brought israel out of egypt . he used a prophet and kept israel safe .
i knew you in the desert—i knew you in that dry land .
i gave food to the israelites , and they ate it . they became full and satisfied . they became proud , and then they forgot me .
“ that is why i will be like a lion to them . i will be like a leopard waiting by the road .
“ israel , i helped you , but you turned against me . so now i will destroy you .
i was angry , and i gave you a king . and when i became very angry , i took him away .
“ ephraim tried to hide his guilt .
his punishment will be like the pain of a woman giving birth .
“ i will save them from the grave .
israel grows among his brothers ,
israel , you fell and sinned against god . so come back to the lord your god .
think about what you will say , and come back to the lord . say to him ,
assyria will not save us .
i will be like the dew to israel .
his branches will grow ,
the people of israel will again live under my protection .
“ ephraim , i will have nothing more to do with idols .
a wise person understands these things ,
heaven and earth , listen ! this is what the lord says :
a bull knows its master ,
what good will it do to keep punishing you ? you will continue to rebel . your whole head and heart are already sick and aching .
you officers of sodom , listen to the lord ’ s message . you people of gomorrah , listen to god ’ s teaching .
when you people come to meet with me , you trample everything in my yard . who told you to do this ?
i hate your monthly meetings and councils . they have become like heavy weights to me , and i am tired of carrying them .
“ wash yourselves and make yourselves clean . stop doing the evil things i see you do . stop doing wrong .
“ if you listen to what i say , you will get the good things from this land .
but if you refuse to listen and rebel against me , your enemies will destroy you . ”
people use lye to clean silver . in the same way , i will clean away all your wrongs . i will remove all the impurities from you .
god is good and does what is right , so he will rescue zion and the people who come back to him .
but all the criminals and sinners will be destroyed . those who stopped following the lord will be removed .
in the future , you will be ashamed of the oak trees and special gardens you chose to worship ,
because you will be like an oak tree whose leaves are dying . you will be like a garden dying without water .
isaiah son of amoz received this message about judah and jerusalem .
in the last days the mountain of the lord ’ s temple
people from many places will go there and say ,
then god will act as judge to end arguments between nations .
family of jacob , let us follow the lord .
his land is full of gods that the people bow down to worship . they made those idols themselves .
the people have become worse and worse . they have become very low , and you leaders did nothing to lift them up !
you should be afraid of the lord ! go hide in the dirt and behind the rocks . hide from his glorious power !
proud people will stop being proud . they will bow down to the ground with shame , and only the lord will still stand high .
the lord all-powerful has a special day planned when he will punish the proud and boastful people . they will be brought down .
they might be like the tall cedar trees from lebanon or the great oak trees from bashan , but they will be cut down .
they might be like the tall mountains and high hills
or like the tall towers and high walls , but they will be brought down .
they might be like great ships from tarshish , filled with such wonderful cargo , but they will be brought down .
at that time those proud people will fall . they will bow low to the ground , and only the lord will stand high .
all the idols will be gone .
they will go down into cracks in the rocks and boulders because they are afraid of the lord and his glorious power as he stands to shake the earth .
stop trusting other people to save you . do not think too highly of them ; they are only humans who have not stopped breathing yet .
he will take away all the heroes and soldiers . he will take away all the judges , the prophets , the fortunetellers , and the elders .
he says , “ i will put young boys in charge of you . they will be your leaders .
the people will turn against each other . young people will not respect those who are older . the common people will not respect important leaders . ”
tell the good people who do what is right that good things will happen to them . they will receive a reward for what they do .
but it will be very bad for wicked people , because they , too , will get what they deserve . they will get what they did to others .
even children will defeat my people , and women will rule over them .
look , the lord is standing to judge his people .
the lord is ready to present his case against the elders and leaders of his people .
the lord will put sores on the heads of those women in zion . the lord will make their heads bald .
then the lord will take away everything they are proud of : the beautiful ankle bracelets , the necklaces that look like the sun and the moon ,
the earrings , bracelets , and veils ,
the scarves , the ankle chains , the cloth belts worn around their waists , the bottles of perfume , the charms ,
the signet rings , and the nose rings ,
the fine dresses , robes , veils , and purses ,
the mirrors , linen dresses , turbans , and long shawls .
your men will be killed with swords . your heroes will die in war .
it will be a shelter to protect the people from the heat of the sun and from all kinds of storms and rain .
now i will sing a song for my friend , my love song about his vineyard .
he dug and cleared the field
my friend said , “ you people living in jerusalem and you people of judah ,
what more could i do for my vineyard ?
“ now i will tell you
i will turn my vineyard into useless land .
the vineyard that belongs to the lord all-powerful is the house of israel . the grapevine , the plant he loves , is the man of judah .
i heard the lord all-powerful make this oath : “ i swear , all these houses will be destroyed . these big , fancy houses will be empty .
a ten-acre vineyard will make only a little wine , and many sacks of seed will grow only a little grain . ”
everyone , common people and leaders alike , will be humbled . those who are now so proud will bow their heads in shame .
the lord all-powerful will judge fairly , and people will honor him . they will respect the holy god when he brings justice .
then sheep will be able to go wherever they want and graze on the land that rich people once owned .
look at those people ! they pull their guilt and sins behind them like people pulling wagons with ropes .
they think they are so smart . they think they are very intelligent .
they are famous for drinking wine and are heroes known for mixing drinks .
and if you pay them enough money , they will forgive a criminal . but they will not let good people be judged fairly .
look ! god is giving a sign to the nations far away . he is raising a flag and whistling for them to come .
the enemy soldiers never get tired and stumble . they never get sleepy and fall asleep . their weapon belts are always ready . their sandal straps never break .
in the year that king uzziah died , i saw the lord sitting on a very high and wonderful throne . his long robe filled the temple .
the angels were calling to each other , “ holy , holy , holy is the lord all-powerful . his glory fills the whole earth . ”
the sound was so loud that it caused the frame around the door to shake , and the temple was filled with smoke .
then i heard the lord ’ s voice , saying , “ who can i send ? who will go for us ? ”
then i asked , “ lord , how long should i do this ? ”
the lord will make the people go far away , and there will be large areas of empty land in the country .
and made plans against you . they said ,
but the lord god says , “ their plan will not succeed . it will not happen
then the lord spoke to ahaz again
but ahaz said , “ i will not ask for a sign as proof . i will not test the lord . ”
but the lord will still show you this sign :
he will eat milk curds and honey
but before he is old enough to make that choice ,
they will settle in the deep valleys and in the caves , by the thornbushes and watering holes .
“ at that time someone might keep only one young cow and two sheep alive .
but there will be enough milk for them to eat milk curds . in fact , everyone left in the country will eat milk curds and honey .
there are now fields that have 1000 grapevines , and each grapevine is worth 1000 pieces of silver . but those fields will be covered with weeds and thorns .
that land will be wild and used only as a hunting ground where people go with bows and arrows .
i found some men who could be trusted to serve as witnesses : uriah the priest and zechariah son of jeberekiah . they watched me write those words .
the lord spoke to me again .
he said , “ these people refuse to accept the slow-moving waters of shiloah . they prefer rezin and remaliah ’ s son . ”
this water will be like a flash flood as it passes through judah . it will rise to judah ’ s throat and almost drown him .
all you nations , prepare for war .
make your plans for the fight .
the lord spoke to me with his great power and warned me not to be like these people . he said ,
the lord all-powerful is the one you should fear . he is the one you should respect . he is the one who should frighten you .
( many people will trip over this rock . they will fall and be broken . they will be caught in the trap . )
the lord has turned away from the family of jacob .
you should follow the teachings and the agreement . i swear , if you follow those other things , there is no future for you .
and when the captives turn their faces to the ground , there is only a depressing darkness closing in—the dark sadness of people forced to leave their country .
every boot that marched in battle and every uniform stained with blood will be destroyed and thrown into the fire .
the lord gave a command against jacob and someone in israel fell .
so all the people in ephraim , including the ruler in samaria , learned their lesson .
the lord found people to go up and fight against rezin . he stirred up rezin ’ s enemies .
the people did not stop sinning . they did not come to the lord all-powerful for help .
so the lord cut off israel ’ s head and tail . he took away the branch and the stalk in one day .
( the head means the elders and important leaders . the tail means the prophets who told lies . )
their guides are leading them the wrong way , so those who follow them will be destroyed .
the lord all-powerful was angry , so the land was burned . the people were fuel for the fire . no one showed any compassion to anyone else .
manasseh fought against ephraim , and ephraim fought against manasseh . then both of them turned on judah .
just look at those lawmakers who write evil laws and make life hard for the people .
they are not fair to the poor . they take away the rights of the poor and allow people to steal from widows and orphans .
the lord says , “ i will use assyria like a stick . in my anger i will use assyria to punish israel .
assyria says to himself , ‘ all of my officers are like kings !
the city of calno is no better than the city of carchemish . arpad is like hamath , and samaria is like damascus .
i defeated those evil kingdoms and now i control them . the idols those people worship are better than the idols of jerusalem and samaria .
i defeated samaria and her gods . i will also defeat jerusalem and the idols her people have made . ’ ”
and then spreads to burn up the tall trees and vineyards . finally , everything will be destroyed—even the people . assyria will be like a rotting log .
there will be a few trees left standing in the forest—so few that even a child could count them .
those who are left in jacob ’ s family will again follow the powerful god .
the lord god all-powerful really will destroy this land .
but after a short time my anger will stop . i will be satisfied that assyria has punished you enough . ”
cry out , bath gallim ! laishah , listen ! anathoth , answer me !
the people of madmenah are running away . the people of gebim are hiding .
this day the army will stop at nob and prepare to fight against mount zion , the hill of jerusalem .
god will cut down his enemies . like the tall trees of lebanon he will cut them down with an ax .
a small tree will begin to grow from the stump of jesse . that branch will grow from jesse ’ s roots .
he will find joy in obeying the lord .
then ephraim will not be jealous of judah , and judah will have no enemies left . and judah will not cause trouble for ephraim .
at that time you will say ,
god is the one who saves me .
you people will get your water from the spring of salvation .
at that time you will say ,
sing songs of praise about the lord ,
people of zion , shout about these things !
god showed isaiah son of amoz this message about babylon :
“ raise a flag on that mountain where nothing grows .
“ i have separated these men from the people ,
“ listen to that loud noise in the mountains .
they are coming from a faraway land .
people will lose their courage . fear will make them weak .
everyone will be afraid . they will stare at each other with shock on their faces . fear will grip them like the pains of a woman in childbirth .
the skies will be dark . the sun , the moon , and the stars will not shine .
there will be only a few people left . they will be as rare as pure gold .
in my anger i will shake the sky , and the earth will be moved from its place . ”
anyone caught by the enemy will be killed with a sword .
everything in their houses will be stolen . their wives will be raped , and their little children will be beaten to death while they watch .
babylon will be destroyed like the time god destroyed sodom and gomorrah .
in the past , you were slaves . people forced you to work hard . but the lord will take away the hard work you were forced to do .
at that time you will begin to sing this song about the king of babylon :
the lord breaks the scepter of evil rulers ;
in anger , the king of babylon beat the people .
but now , the whole country rests and is quiet .
you were an evil king ,
the place of death is excited
they will make fun of you , saying ,
your pride has been sent down to sheol .
you were like the morning star ,
you always told yourself ,
i will go up to the altar above the tops of the clouds .
but that did not happen .
people will come to look at your dead body .
the kings of other nations lie buried with honor ,
but you were thrown out of your grave
other kings have their own graves ,
prepare to kill his children ,
the lord all-powerful made this promise : “ this will happen exactly as i meant for it to happen . it will happen just the way i planned .
this is what i plan to do for this land . i will use my power to punish all those nations . ”
when the lord all-powerful makes a plan , no one can change it . when he raises his arm to punish , no one can stop him .
this message was given to me the year king ahaz died :
people near the city gates , cry !
but what will the messengers from that nation report about us ?
this is a message about moab :
the king ’ s family and the people of dibon go to the places of worship to cry .
everywhere in moab , on the housetops and in the streets ,
in heshbon and elealeh they are crying loudly .
my heart cries , full of sorrow for moab .
but nimrim brook is as dry as a desert .
so the people gather up everything they own
you can hear crying everywhere in moab—
the water of dimon is full of blood ,
the women of moab try to cross the river arnon .
they say , “ help us !
people from moab were forced to leave their homes .
then a new king will come .
we have heard that the people of moab
because of their pride , everyone in moab will mourn .
the fields of heshbon and the vines of sibmah no longer grow grapes .
i will cry with the people of jazer and sibmah ,
there will be no joy and happiness in the orchard .
so i will hum a sad song for moab and kir heres ,
the people of moab will go
the lord said these things about moab many times .
this is a message about damascus :
people will leave the cities of aroer .
the fort cities of ephraim will be destroyed .
“ at that time jacob ’ s wealth will all be gone .
then the people will look up to the one who made them . their eyes will see the holy one of israel .
they will not trust the great things they have made . they will not go to the special gardens and altars they made for false gods .
this will happen because you have forgotten the god who saves you . you have not remembered that god is your place of safety .
listen to all these people !
and like the waves ,
that night , the people will be frightened .
look at the land along the rivers of ethiopia where you can hear the buzzing of insect wings .
that land sends people down the nile river in reed boats .
like a flag on a hill ,
the lord god all-powerful says , “ i will give egypt to a hard master . a powerful king will rule over the people . ”
the water in the nile river will dry up and disappear .
all the rivers will smell very bad . the canals in egypt will be dry , and the water will be gone . all the water plants will rot .
those who make cloth from flax , who weave it into linen , will all be sad .
those who weave cloth will be broken , and those who work for money will be depressed .
the leaders of zoan have been fooled . the leaders of noph have believed lies , so they lead egypt the wrong way .
then israel , assyria , and egypt will join together and control the land . this will be a blessing for the land .
sargon was the king of assyria . he sent his military commander to fight against ashdod . the commander went there and captured the city .
then the lord said , “ my servant isaiah has gone without clothes or sandals for three years . this is a sign for egypt and ethiopia .
those who looked to ethiopia for help will be shattered . those who were amazed by egypt ’ s glory will be ashamed . ”
this is a message about the “ desert by the sea ” :
i was given a vision of the hard times to come .
i saw those terrible things , and now i am afraid .
i am worried and shaking with fear .
people are rushing around shouting their orders :
the lord said to me , “ go find someone to guard this city . he must report whatever he sees .
whether he sees a chariot and a team of horses or men riding donkeys or camels , he must listen carefully . ”
then one day the watchman called out ,
look ! i see a man in a chariot
this is a message about dumah :
this is a message about arabia :
they gave water to some thirsty travelers .
they were running from swords
only a few of the archers , the great soldiers of kedar , will be left alive. ” the lord , the god of israel , told me this .
this is a message about the valley of vision :
this city was so happy ,
all your officers ran away together ,
so i say , “ don ’ t look at me !
horse soldiers from elam took their bags of arrows and rode into battle . soldiers from kir rattled their shields .
your favorite valley was filled with chariots . horse soldiers were stationed in front of the city gates .
then the cover protecting judah was removed , and the people turned to the weapons they kept at the forest palace .
so the lord god all-powerful told the people to cry and mourn for their dead friends . he told them to shave their heads and wear mourning clothes .
but look , everyone was happy . the people rejoiced , saying ,
the lord god all-powerful told me to go to shebna , the palace manager ,
i will force you out of your position here . your new leader will take you away from your important job .
at that time i will call for my servant eliakim son of hilkiah .
he will be like a favorite chair in his father ’ s house . i will make him like a strong peg in a solid board .
this is a message about tyre :
you people living near the sea , mourn in silence .
they traveled the seas looking for grain .
sidon , you should be very sad ,
when egypt hears the news about tyre ,
you ships , try to escape to tarshish !
can this be that happy city that was founded so long ago ?
this city produced so many leaders .
it was the lord all-powerful .
ships from tarshish , go back home .
the lord raised his arm over the sea
he said , “ daughter sidon , you have been hurt badly ,
as for babylon , look at the land of the chaldeans !
so be sad , you ships from tarshish .
“ oh , woman who men forgot ,
look , the lord is destroying this land . he will clean out the land completely and force all the people to go far away .
everyone will be forced out of the land . all the wealth will be taken . this will happen because the lord commanded it .
the country will be empty and sad . the world will be empty and weak . the great leaders of the people in this land will become weak .
the grapevines are dying . the new wine is bad . people who were happy are now sad .
they have stopped showing their joy . the happy music from the drums and harps has ended .
they no longer sing as they drink their wine . the beer now tastes bitter to those who drink it .
“ total confusion ” is a good name for this city . the city has been destroyed . people can not enter the houses . the doors are blocked .
people still ask for wine in the marketplaces , but all the joy is gone . it was carried off with everything else .
all that is left is destruction . even the gates are crushed .
at harvest time , people knock olives from the trees .
those who are left will begin shouting louder than the ocean .
they will say , “ people in the east , praise the lord !
we hear songs of praise for god from every place on earth .
i see troubles for you people living in this land .
people will hear about the danger ,
there will be earthquakes ,
the sins of the world are very heavy ,
at that time the lord will judge
many people will be gathered together .
the lord will rule as king on mount zion in jerusalem .
lord , you are my god .
and you destroyed the city that was protected by strong walls .
that is why powerful nations will honor you .
you have been a safe place for poor people in trouble .
like the heat of summer in a dry land ,
but now there is a veil covering all nations and people . this veil is called “ death . ”
at that time people will say ,
the lord ’ s power is on this mountain ,
they will reach out their arms to escape
he will destroy their high walls and safe places .
at that time people will sing this song in judah :
open the gates for the good people to enter .
god , you give true peace
so trust the lord always ,
but he will destroy the proud city
then poor and humble people will walk on those ruins .
honesty is the path good people follow .
but , lord , we are waiting for your way of justice .
at night my soul longs to be with you ,
evil people will not learn to do good ,
lord , your arm is raised to punish them ,
lord , you have succeeded in doing everything we tried to do ,
lord , you are our god ,
those dead lords will not come to life .
lord , you have helped the nation you love .
lord , people remember you
lord , because of you we were in pain ,
but we struggled in pain for nothing .
but the lord says ,
my people , go into your rooms
look ! the lord is coming out from his place
at that time the lord will judge leviathan ,
at that time people will sing
“ i , the lord , will care for the vineyard .
i am not angry .
but if anyone comes to me for safety
in the future , jacob will take root firmly on his soil .
the vines will become dry , and the branches will break off . women will use them for firewood .
look , the lord has someone who is strong and brave .
the drunks of ephraim are proud of their beautiful crown ,
that city sits on a hill with a rich valley around it .
at that time the lord all-powerful will become the “ beautiful crown. ” he will be the “ wonderful crown of flowers ” for his people who are left .
then he will give wisdom to the judges who rule his people . he will give strength to the people who are in battles at the city gates .
every table is covered with vomit . there is not a clean place anywhere .
he speaks to us as though we were babies :
so god will use this strange way of talking , and he will use other languages to speak to these people .
so the lord ’ s words will be senseless sounds to them :
you leaders in jerusalem should listen to the lord ’ s message , but now you refuse to listen to him .
your agreement with death will be erased . your contract with sheol will not help you .
now don ’ t complain about these things . if you fight against them , you will only tighten the ropes around you .
listen closely to the message i am telling you .
does a farmer plow his field all the time ? no , he doesn ’ t work the soil all the time .
our god is using this to teach you a lesson . this example shows us that god is fair when he punishes his people .
this lesson comes from the lord all-powerful , who gives wonderful advice . he is very wise .
god says , “ look at ariel , the city where david camped . keep on having your festivals , year after year .
but i will punish ariel . the city will be filled with sadness and crying , but it will always be my ariel .
“ i will put armies all around you , ariel . i will raise war towers against you .
there will be so many foreigners that they will be like dust . cruel people will be like the chaff blowing in the wind . then suddenly ,
the lord all-powerful will punish you with earthquakes , thunder , and loud noises . there will be storms , strong winds , and a burning , destructive fire .
many nations will fight against ariel . it will be a nightmare . armies will surround ariel and punish her .
be surprised and amazed !
the lord will make you sleepy .
this is the truth : after a very short time , lebanon will become rich farmland , and the farmland will be like thick forests .
the deaf will hear the words in the book . the blind will see through the darkness and fog .
the lord will make poor people happy . the poorest people will rejoice in the holy one of israel .
this will happen when the people who are mean and cruel have come to an end . it will happen when those who enjoy doing bad things are gone .
( they lie about good people . they try to trap people in court . they try to destroy innocent people . )
yes , when they see all their children ,
many of these people did not understand , so they did what was wrong . they complained , but now they will learn their lesson . ”
“ but i tell you , hiding in egypt will not help you . pharaoh will not be able to protect you .
your leaders have gone to zoan , and your representatives have gone to hanes .
this is a message about the negev animals :
that useless nation is egypt . egypt ’ s help is worth nothing , so i call egypt the “ do-nothing dragon . ”
these people are like children who refuse to obey . they lie and refuse to listen to the lord ’ s teachings .
stop seeing things that will really happen . get out of our way . stop telling us about the holy one of israel . ”
the holy one of israel says , “ you people have refused to accept this message from me . you depend on fighting and lies to help you .
you are guilty of these things . so you are like a tall wall with cracks in it . that wall will fall and break into small pieces .
every mountain and hill will have streams filled with water . these things will happen after many people are killed and the enemy ’ s towers are pulled down .
assyria will be frightened by the lord ’ s voice and the stick that will beat him .
and as the lord beats assyria , his people will keep the rhythm with their drums and harps .
people of israel , you should come back to the god you turned away from .
that is because when those things happen , people will reject the gold and silver idols you made when you sinned against me .
their place of safety will be destroyed . their leaders will be defeated , and they will abandon their flag .
listen to what i say ! a king should rule in a way that brings justice . leaders should make fair decisions when they lead the people .
then people would actually see what they look at . they would actually listen to what they hear .
people who are now confused would be able to understand . those who can not speak clearly now would be able to speak clearly and quickly .
fools would not be called great men . people would not respect men who make secret plans .
they use evil like a tool and plan ways to steal from the poor . they tell lies about the poor and keep them from being judged fairly .
but a good leader plans good things to do , and that will make him a leader over other leaders .
some of you women are calm now ; you feel safe . but you should stand and listen to the words i say .
beat your breasts in sorrow . cry because your fields are empty . your vineyards once gave grapes , but now they are empty .
this will continue until god gives us his spirit from above . then the desert will become rich farmland and the farmland will be like thick forests .
that is , what is now a desert will be filled with right decisions , and what is now a farmland will be filled with justice .
that justice will bring peace and safety forever .
my people will be safe in their homes and in their calm , peaceful fields .
but before this happens , the forest must fall and the city must be torn down .
some of you live away from the cities . you plant seeds by every stream and let your cattle and donkeys roam free . you will be very blessed .
lord , be kind to us .
your powerful voice makes people run away in fear .
the lord is very great . he lives in a very high place . he fills zion with justice and goodness .
jerusalem , you are rich with wisdom and knowledge of god . you are rich with salvation . you respect the lord , and that makes you rich .
but listen ! the messengers are crying outside . the messengers who bring peace are crying very hard .
the lord says , “ now , i will stand and show people how great and powerful i am .
people will be burned until their bones become lime . they will burn quickly like thorns and dry bushes .
“ you people in faraway lands , listen to what i have done . you people who are near me , learn about my power . ”
they will live safely in high places . they will be protected in high rock fortresses . they will always have food and water .
your eyes will see the king in his beauty . you will see the great land .
no one living there will say , “ i am sick , ” because everyone living there has had their guilt removed .
the lord is angry with all the nations and their armies . he will destroy them all and put them to death .
their bodies will be thrown outside . the stink will rise from the bodies , and the blood will flow down the mountains .
the lord says , “ this will happen when my sword in the sky is covered with blood . ”
this will happen because the lord has chosen a time for punishment . he has chosen a year when people must pay for the wrong they did to zion .
edom ’ s rivers will be like hot tar . edom ’ s ground will be like burning sulfur .
the free men and leaders will all be gone , and there will be nothing left for them to rule .
wild cats will live there with hyenas . wild goats will call to their friends . night animals will spend some time there and find a place to rest .
the dry desert will rejoice . the desert will be glad and blossom .
make the weak arms strong again . strengthen the weak knees .
then the eyes of the blind will be opened so that they can see , and the ears of the deaf will be opened so that they can hear .
during hezekiah ’ s 14th year as king , sennacherib king of assyria went to fight against all the strong cities of judah . sennacherib defeated those cities .
the commander told them , “ tell hezekiah this is what the great king , the king of assyria says :
then the commander , shouting loudly in hebrew , gave this warning to them all :
this is what the king says : don ’ t let hezekiah fool you ! he can not save you from my power .
none of the gods of these other places were able to save their land from me ! so why do you think the lord can save jerusalem from me ?
when king hezekiah ’ s officers came to isaiah ,
the commander heard that the king of assyria had left lachish . he found him at libnah , fighting against that city .
then the king of assyria got a report that said , “ king tirhakah of ethiopia is coming to fight you . ”
he told them , “ tell king hezekiah of judah these things :
you have heard what the kings of assyria did to all the other countries . we destroyed them completely . will you be saved ? no !
where is the king of hamath ? the king of arpad ? the king of the city of sepharvaim ? the kings of hena and ivvah ? ’ ”
he prayed to the lord :
it is true , lord . the kings of assyria did destroy all those nations .
“ so this is the lord ’ s message against sennacherib :
but who was it that you insulted and made fun of ?
you sent your officers to insult the lord .
i dug wells and drank water from new places .
‘ how could you say this , sennacherib ?
the people living there had no power .
i know all about your battles ;
yes , you were upset at me .
so the lord says this about the king of assyria :
he will go back the way he came .
i will protect this city and save it .
so king sennacherib of assyria went back to nineveh and stayed there .
hezekiah turned toward the wall that faced the temple and began praying to the lord .
“ lord , remember that i have faithfully served you with all my heart . i have done what you say is good. ” then hezekiah cried very hard .
then isaiah received this message from the lord :
i will save you and this city from the king of assyria . i will protect this city . ’ ”
then isaiah told hezekiah , “ crush figs together and put them on your sore . then you will get well . ”
hezekiah asked isaiah , “ what is the sign that proves i will get well and go to the lord ’ s temple ? ”
this is the sign from the lord to show you that he will do what he says :
this is the letter from hezekiah when he became well :
i thought i would live a full life .
so i said , “ i will not see the lord yah in the land of the living again .
my home , my shepherd ’ s tent , is being pulled down and taken from me .
all night i cried as loud as a lion ,
i cried like a bird
what can i say ?
lord , use this hard time to make my spirit live again .
look , my troubles are gone !
the dead can not praise you .
people who are alive , people like me ,
so i say , “ the lord saved me .
then isaiah the prophet went to king hezekiah and asked him , “ what did these men say ? where did they come from ? ”
so isaiah asked him , “ what did they see in your house ? ”
then isaiah said to hezekiah , “ listen to this message from the lord all-powerful :
the babylonians will take your own sons , and your sons will become officers in the palace of the king of babylon . ”
speak kindly to jerusalem and tell her ,
listen , there is someone shouting :
every valley must be filled .
then the glory of the lord will be shown to everyone .
a voice said , “ speak ! ”
when a wind from the lord blows on them ,
grass dies and flowers fall ,
zion , you have good news to tell .
the lord god is coming with power .
like a good shepherd , he takes care of his people .
who measured the oceans in the palm of his hand ?
who could know the lord ’ s mind ?
did the lord ask for anyone ’ s help ?
look , all the nations in the world are like one small drop in the bucket .
all the trees in lebanon are not enough
compared to god , all the nations of the world are nothing .
can you compare god to anything ?
no , but some people make statues from rock or wood ,
for the base he chooses special wood ,
surely you know the truth , don ’ t you ?
it is the lord who sits above the circle of the earth .
he takes away the power of rulers .
they are like plants that are planted in the ground .
the holy one says , “ can you compare me to anyone ?
look up to the skies .
people of jacob , this is true .
surely you know the truth .
he helps tired people be strong .
young men get tired and need to rest .
but those who trust in the lord will become strong again .
who woke up the man who is coming from the east ?
he chases armies and is never hurt .
who was able to make all this happen ?
people along the coast saw this ,
“ workers help each other . they encourage each other to be strong .
the lord says , “ you , israel , are my servant .
you were in a faraway country ,
don ’ t worry—i am with you .
look , some people are angry with you ,
you will look for the people who were against you ,
i am the lord your god ,
people of israel , descendants of jacob , you may be weak and worthless ,
look , i have made you like a new threshing board with many sharp teeth .
you will throw them into the air ,
“ the poor and needy look for water ,
i will make rivers flow on dry hills .
i will make trees grow in the desert .
i will do this so that people will see it and know who did it .
the lord , the king of jacob , says , “ come , present your arguments . show me your proof .
“ look , you false gods are worthless . you can not do anything . only some horrible fool would want to worship you . ”
“ i called someone in the north to come .
“ who told us about this before it happened
i , the lord , was the first one to tell zion about these things .
i looked at those false gods .
those gods are all less than nothing .
“ here is my servant ,
he will not cry out or shout
he will not break even a crushed reed .
he will not grow weak or give up
“ i , the lord , was right to call you .
you will make the blind able to see .
“ i am yahweh .
in the past , i told you what would happen ,
sing a new song to the lord ;
deserts and cities , villages of kedar ,
give glory to the lord .
the lord will go out like a strong soldier .
“ for a long time i have said nothing .
i will destroy the hills and mountains .
then i will lead the blind along a path they never knew
but some of them have left me .
“ deaf people , listen to me !
in all the world , no one is more blind than my servant .
my people see what they should do ,
the lord wants them to do what is right .
but look at his people .
will any of you pay attention to this warning ? will you ever learn to listen ?
bring to me all the people who are mine—the people who have my name . i made them for myself . i made them , and they are mine .
“ bring out the people who have eyes but are blind . bring out the people who have ears but are deaf .
i myself am the lord , and there is no other savior .
i am the lord your holy one . i made israel . i am your king . ”
the lord is making roads through the sea . he is making a path for his people , even through rough waters . the lord says ,
so don ’ t remember what happened in earlier times . don ’ t think about what happened a long time ago ,
i made them , and they will sing songs of praise to me .
“ jacob , you did not pray to me . israel , you became tired of me .
“ i , i am the one who wipes away all your sins . i do this to please myself . i will not remember your sins .
but you should remember me . let ’ s meet together and decide what is right . tell your story and prove that you are innocent .
your first father sinned , and your lawyers committed crimes against me .
i will make your temple leaders unfit to serve there . i will destroy jacob . bad things will happen to israel .
“ jacob , you are my servant . israel , i chose you . listen to me !
they will sprout like grass in the spring and grow like trees by streams of water .
who made these false gods ? who covered these useless statues ?
“ jacob , remember these things !
your sins were like a big cloud ,
skies , rejoice for what the lord has done .
the one who rescued you is the lord ,
he tells the deep waters , “ become dry !
he says to cyrus , “ you are my shepherd .
this is what the lord said to cyrus , his chosen king :
i will go in front of you
i will give you the wealth that is stored in secret places .
i do this for my servant , jacob .
i am the lord , the only god .
i am doing this so that everyone will know
i made the light and the darkness .
“ may the clouds in the skies above
the lord god is the holy one of israel . he created israel , and he says ,
i made the earth ,
i was right to give power to cyrus ,
the lord says , “ egypt and ethiopia are rich ,
you are the god people can not see .
many people make false gods ,
but israel will be saved by the lord .
the lord is god .
i have spoken openly , not in secret .
tell them to come to me . let them present their case and discuss these things . )
so all you people in faraway places , turn to me and be saved , because i am god , and there is no other .
they will say , ‘ goodness and strength come only from the lord . ’ ”
the lord will help the people of israel live right and praise their god .
the lord says , “ bel has fallen to the ground . nebo is kneeling before me .
but they all bowed down and fell to the ground . they couldn ’ t escape ; they were all carried away like prisoners .
“ can you compare me to anyone ? no one is equal to me . you can not understand everything about me . there is nothing like me .
“ sinners , change your heart and mind . think about this again . remember it and be strong .
remember what happened long ago . remember , i am god and there is no other god . there is no other like me .
“ listen to me , you stubborn people ! you are far from doing what is right .
but i am close to making things right . salvation will not be delayed much longer . i will bring salvation to zion and to my wonderful israel . ”
“ fall down and sit in the dirt , virgin daughter babylon .
men will see your naked body
“ my people say , ‘ god saves us .
“ so babylon , sit down and shut up .
“ i was angry with my people .
you said , ‘ i will live forever .
so now listen , you who love only pleasure !
these two things will happen to you :
you do bad things but still feel safe .
“ but disaster is coming your way .
you worked hard all your life
you have many advisors .
but they can not even save themselves .
that ’ s what will happen to those you have worked with ,
“ family of jacob , listen to me !
“ yes , you call yourselves citizens of the holy city ,
“ long ago i told you what would happen .
i did that because i knew you were stubborn .
so long ago i told you what would happen .
“ you heard what i said would happen .
this is something that is happening now , not long ago .
but even in the past you didn ’ t listen .
“ but i will be patient .
“ look , i will make you pure ,
i will do this for myself—for me !
“ jacob , listen to me !
i made the earth with my own hands .
“ all of you , come here and listen to me .
“ i told you that i would call him .
come here and listen to me !
the lord , the savior , the holy one of israel , says ,
if you had obeyed me ,
if you had obeyed me ,
my people , leave babylon !
they never got thirsty as he led them through the desert ,
but the lord also said ,
hear me , people by the sea .
he used me to speak for him .
he told me , “ israel , you are my servant .
i said , “ i worked hard for nothing .
the lord is the one who made me in my mother ’ s womb ,
and now he says , “ you are a very important servant to me .
the lord , the holy protector of israel , speaks to his servant .
this is what the lord says :
you will tell the prisoners ,
they will not be hungry or thirsty .
i will make a road for my people .
“ look ! people are coming to me from faraway places .
heavens and earth , be happy !
but now zion says , “ the lord has left me ;
but the lord says ,
i drew a picture of you on my hand .
your children will come back to you ,
look up ! look all around you !
“ you are destroyed and defeated now .
you were sad for the children you lost , but they will tell you ,
then you will say to yourself ,
this is what the lord god says :
kings will be their teachers .
if a strong soldier takes a prisoner ,
here is the lord ’ s answer :
those people hurt you ,
this is what the lord says :
i came home and found no one there .
i can make the skies dark .
the lord god gave me the ability to teach , so now i teach these sad people . every morning he wakes me and teaches me like a student .
the lord god helps me learn , and i have not turned against him . i will not stop following him .
“ my people , listen to me !
i will soon save you and show that i am fair .
look up to the heavens !
you people who understand goodness should listen to me .
they will be like old clothes eaten by moths .
wake up ! wake up !
you dried up the water that was in the deep sea .
the lord will save his people .
the lord says , “ i am the one who comforts you .
“ i , the lord , am the one who made you .
“ people in prison will soon be made free .
“ i am the lord your god ,
wake up ! wake up !
jerusalem had many people , but none of them became leaders for her . none of the children she raised became guides to lead her .
troubles came to you , jerusalem , in pairs : your land was destroyed and lies in ruins , and your people suffered from famine and war .
wake up ! wake up !
jerusalem , get up and shake off the dust !
the lord god says , “ first , my people went down to egypt and became slaves . then assyria made them slaves .
the city guards are shouting .
ruins of jerusalem , be happy again !
the lord showed his holy strength to all the nations .
you will leave babylon ,
the lord says , “ look , my servant will succeed in what he has to do , and he will be raised to a position of high honor .
it is true that many were shocked when they saw him . he was beaten so badly that he no longer looked like a man .
who really believed what we heard ? who saw in it the lord ’ s great power ?
we had all wandered away like sheep . we had gone our own way . and yet the lord put all our guilt on him .
after his suffering he will see the light , and he will be satisfied with what he experienced .
“ woman , be happy !
“ make your tent bigger .
because you will grow in all directions .
don ’ t be afraid !
your real husband is the one who made you .
“ like a woman whose husband has left her ,
“ for a short time i turned away from you ,
i was so angry that for a while i did not want to see you .
“ remember , in noah ’ s time i punished the world with the flood .
“ the mountains may disappear ,
“ you poor city !
the stones on top of the wall will be made from rubies .
i , the lord , will teach your children ,
you will be built on goodness .
i will never send anyone to attack you .
“ all you people who are thirsty , come !
why waste your money on something that is not real food ?
listen closely to what i say .
i made david a witness of my power for all nations .
there are nations in places you don ’ t know ,
so you should look for the lord
evil people should stop living evil lives .
the lord says , “ my thoughts are not like yours .
just as the heavens are higher than the earth ,
“ rain and snow fall from the sky
in the same way , my words leave my mouth ,
“ so you will go out from there with joy .
large cypress trees will grow where there were thornbushes .
i will bless those who refuse to do wrong and who obey the law about the sabbath . ”
the lord god said these things .
wild animals in the forest ,
the watchmen are all blind .
they are like hungry dogs .
they come and say ,
all the good people are gone ,
but peace will come too ,
“ come here , you children of witches .
you are children out of control , full of lies .
all you want is to worship false gods
you love to worship the smooth rocks in the rivers .
you make your bed on every hill
you hide the things that help you remember me
you use your oils and perfumes
all of them made you tired ,
you did not remember me .
i could tell about your ‘ good works ’ and all the ‘ religious ’ things you do ,
when you need help ,
clear the road ! clear the road !
god is high and lifted up .
i will not accuse my people forever .
israel ’ s evil greed made me angry ,
i have seen their way of life , but i will heal them .
i will teach them a new word : peace .
but evil people are like the angry ocean .
shout as loud as you can and don ’ t stop .
they still come every day to worship me ,
look , the lord ’ s power is enough to save you . he can hear you when you ask him for help .
it is your sins that separate you from your god . he turns away from you when he sees them .
that ’ s because your hands are covered with blood from the people you murdered . you tell lies and say evil things .
they can not be used for clothes , and you can not cover yourself with them .
all fairness and goodness is gone .
we are like people without eyes .
we are always complaining ;
that ’ s because we committed crimes against our god .
we rebelled against the lord
we pushed justice away .
he did not see anyone speak up for the people .
he put on the armor of goodness ,
he will give his enemies the punishment they deserve .
people from the west to the east will fear the lord
then a redeemer will come to zion
“ jerusalem , get up and shine !
darkness now covers the earth ,
then the nations will come to your light .
“ at that time you will see your people ,
herds of camels from midian and ephah
people will collect all the sheep from kedar and give them to you .
look at the people .
the faraway lands are waiting for me .
children from other lands will rebuild your walls .
your gates will always be open .
any nation or kingdom that does not serve you
all the great things of lebanon will be given to you .
in the past , people hurt you ,
“ people hated you .
nations will give you what you need ,
“ you now have copper ,
there will never again be news of violence in your country .
“ the sun will no longer be your light during the day .
your sun will never go down again .
“ all your people will be good .
the smallest family will become a large family group .
then the old cities that were destroyed will be rebuilt . those ancient ruins will be made new , as they were in the beginning .
then your enemies will come to care for your sheep , and their children will work in your fields and in your gardens .
their descendants will be known throughout the earth , and everyone will know their children . whoever sees them will know that the lord has blessed them .
the lord makes me very happy .
the earth causes plants to grow ,
then all nations will see your goodness .
you will be like a beautiful crown that the lord holds up ,
you will never again be called ‘ the people god left . ’
as a young man takes a bride and she belongs to him ,
jerusalem , i put guards on your walls .
don ’ t give him any rest until he rebuilds jerusalem
the lord made a promise and guaranteed it by his own power .
whoever gathers the food will eat it and praise the lord .
come through the gates !
listen , the lord is speaking
his people will be called “ the holy people , ”
who is this coming from edom ,
“ why are your clothes bright red ?
he answers , “ i walked in the winepress by myself .
i chose a time to punish people .
i looked around , but i saw no one to help me .
in my anger i trampled down the nations .
i will remember the kind things the lord has done ,
he said , “ these are my people .
the people had many troubles ,
but they turned against him
then they remembered what happened long ago .
he was by moses ’ side and led him with his wonderful hand .
he led the people through the deep sea .
like cattle going down to the valley ,
please , look down from the heavens .
look , you are our father !
lord , why are you pushing us away from you ?
your holy people had their land only a short time .
some people don ’ t follow you .
if you would tear open the skies
the mountains would burst into flames like burning bushes .
but you have done awesome things that we did not expect .
no one has ever heard of such a god .
you welcome people who enjoy doing good and who remember you
we are all dirty with sin .
we don ’ t call to you for help .
but , lord , you are our father .
lord , don ’ t continue to be angry with us !
your holy cities are as empty as the desert .
our ancestors worshiped you in our holy temple .
lord , will these things always keep you from helping ?
they keep doing things , right in front of me , that make me angry . they offer sacrifices and burn incense in their special gardens .
so this is what the lord god says :
my servants will shout for joy ,
your names will be like curses to my chosen servants . ”
the lord says , “ people now ask blessings from the earth .
“ i am creating a new heaven and a new earth .
my people will be happy and rejoice forever and ever
“ then i will rejoice with jerusalem .
in that city there will never be a baby who lives only a few days ,
“ in that city whoever builds a house will live there ;
never again will one person build a house
never again will a woman suffer childbirth
i will answer them before they call for help .
wolves and little lambs will eat together .
this is what the lord says :
i am the one who made all things .
some people kill bulls as a sacrifice ,
so i decided to use their own tricks .
you who obey the lord ’ s commands ,
in the same way , i will not cause pain without allowing something new to be born . ”
jerusalem and all her friends , be happy !
be happy that you will receive mercy
this is what the lord says :
i will comfort you like a mother comforting her child .
when you see these things , you will be happy .
look , the lord is coming with fire .
the lord will judge the people
i will also choose some of these people to be priests and levites. ” the lord himself said this .
greetings from james , a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ .
my brothers and sisters , you will have many kinds of trouble . but this gives you a reason to be very happy .
you know that when your faith is tested , you learn to be patient in suffering .
do any of you need wisdom ? ask god for it . he is generous and enjoys giving to everyone . so he will give you wisdom .
believers who are poor should be glad that god considers them so important .
believers who are rich should be glad when bad things happen that humble them . their riches won ’ t keep them from disappearing as quickly as wildflowers .
you are tempted by the evil things you want . your own desire leads you away and traps you .
your desire grows inside you until it results in sin . then the sin grows bigger and bigger and finally ends in death .
my dear brothers and sisters , don ’ t be fooled about this .
god decided to give us life through the true message he sent to us . he wanted us to be the most important of all that he created .
my dear brothers and sisters , always be more willing to listen than to speak . keep control of your anger .
anger does not help you live the way god wants .
do what god ’ s teaching says ; don ’ t just listen and do nothing . when you only sit and listen , you are fooling yourselves .
hearing god ’ s teaching and doing nothing is like looking at your face in the mirror
and doing nothing about what you saw . you go away and immediately forget how bad you looked .
my dear brothers and sisters , you are believers in our glorious lord jesus christ . so don ’ t treat some people better than others .
suppose someone comes into your meeting wearing very nice clothes and a gold ring . at the same time a poor person comes in wearing old , dirty clothes .
doesn ’ t this show that you think some people are more important than others ? you set yourselves up as judges—judges who make bad decisions .
and the rich are the ones who insult the wonderful name of christ , the name by which you are known .
but if you are treating one person as more important than another , you are sinning . you are guilty of breaking god ’ s law .
you will be judged by the law that makes people free . you should remember this in everything you say and do .
my brothers and sisters , if a person claims to have faith but does nothing , that faith is worth nothing . faith like that can not save anyone .
suppose a brother or sister in christ comes to you in need of clothes or something to eat .
it is the same with faith . if it is just faith and nothing more—if it doesn ’ t do anything—it is dead .
you believe there is one god . that ’ s good , but even the demons believe that ! and they shake with fear .
you fool ! faith that does nothing is worth nothing . do you want me to prove this to you ?
our father abraham was made right with god by what he did . he offered his son isaac to god on the altar .
so you see that abraham ’ s faith and what he did worked together . his faith was made perfect by what he did .
so you see that people are made right with god by what they do . they can not be made right by faith alone .
a person ’ s body that does not have a spirit is dead . it is the same with faith—faith that does nothing is dead !
we all make many mistakes . a person who never said anything wrong would be perfect . someone like that would be able to control their whole body too .
we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us . with these bits we can control their whole body .
it is the same with our tongue . it is a small part of the body , but it can boast about doing great things .
humans have control over every kind of wild animal , bird , reptile , and fish , and they have controlled all these things .
but no one can control the tongue . it is wild and evil , full of deadly poison .
we use our tongues to praise our lord and father , but then we curse people who were created in god ’ s likeness .
these praises and curses come from the same mouth . my brothers and sisters , this should not happen .
do good water and bad water flow from the same spring ? of course not .
if you are selfish and have bitter jealousy in your hearts , you have no reason to boast . your boasting is a lie that hides the truth .
where there is jealousy and selfishness , there will be confusion and every kind of evil .
people who work for peace in a peaceful way get the blessings that come from right living .
do you know where your fights and arguments come from ? they come from the selfish desires that make war inside you .
do you think the scriptures mean nothing ? the scriptures say , “ the spirit god made to live in us wants us only for himself . ”
but the kindness god shows is greater . as the scripture says , “ god is against the proud , but he is kind to the humble . ”
so give yourselves to god . stand against the devil , and he will run away from you .
be sad , be sorry , and cry ! change your laughter into crying . change your joy into sadness .
be humble before the lord , and he will make you great .
so you should say , “ if the lord wants , we will live and do this or that . ”
but now you are proud and boast about yourself . all such boasting is wrong .
if you fail to do what you know is right , you are sinning .
you rich people , listen ! cry and be very sad because much trouble will come to you .
your riches will rot and be worth nothing . your clothes will be eaten by moths .
you showed no mercy to good people . they were not against you , but you killed them .
you must be patient too . never stop hoping . the lord is coming soon .
brothers and sisters , follow the example of the prophets who spoke for the lord . they suffered many bad things , but they were patient .
are you having troubles ? you should pray . are you happy ? you should sing .
are you sick ? ask the elders of the church to come and rub oil on you in the name of the lord and pray for you .
then elijah prayed that it would rain . and the rain came down from the sky , and the land grew crops again .
my brothers and sisters , if anyone wanders away from the truth and someone helps that person come back ,
remember this : anyone who brings a sinner back from the wrong way will save that person from eternal death and cause many sins to be forgiven .
greetings from peter , an apostle of jesus christ .
i know the thought of that is exciting , even if you must suffer through different kinds of troubles for a short time now .
your faith has a goal , and you are reaching that goal—your salvation .
the prophets studied carefully and tried to learn about this salvation . they spoke about the grace that was coming to you .
so prepare your minds for service . with complete self-control put all your hope in the grace that will be yours when jesus christ comes .
be holy in everything you do , just as god is holy . he is the one who chose you .
in the scriptures god says , “ be holy , because i am holy . ”
you were bought with the precious blood of christ ’ s death . he was a pure and perfect sacrificial lamb .
christ was chosen before the world was made , but he was shown to the world in these last times for you .
but the word of the lord lasts forever . ”
like newborn babies hungry for milk , you should want the pure teaching that feeds your spirit . with it you can grow up and be saved .
you have already tasted the goodness of the lord .
so , that stone brings honor for you who believe . but for those who don ’ t believe he is
for them he is also
in the past you were not a special people ,
be willing to serve the people who have authority in this world . do this for the lord . obey the king , the highest authority .
and obey the leaders who are sent by the king . they are sent to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do good .
when you do good , you stop ignorant people from saying foolish things about you . this is what god wants .
live like free people , but don ’ t use your freedom as an excuse to do evil . live as those who are serving god .
show respect for all people . love your brothers and sisters in god ’ s family . respect god , and honor the king .
one of you might have to suffer even when you have done nothing wrong . if you think of god and bear the pain , this pleases god .
“ he never sinned ,
you were like sheep that went the wrong way . but now you have come back to the shepherd and protector of your lives .
your husbands will see the pure lives that you live with respect for god .
it is not fancy hair , gold jewelry , or fine clothes that should make you beautiful .
so all of you should live together in peace . try to understand each other . love each other like brothers and sisters . be kind and humble .
stop doing what is wrong , and do good .
the lord watches over those who do what is right ,
if you are always trying to do good , no one can really harm you .
but keep the lord christ holy in your hearts . always be ready to answer everyone who asks you to explain about the hope you have .
it is better to suffer for doing good than for doing wrong . yes , it is better if that is what god wants .
christ himself suffered when he died for you ,
and by the spirit he went and preached to the spirits in prison .
now he has gone into heaven . he is at god ’ s right side and rules over angels , authorities , and powers .
strengthen yourselves so that you will live your lives here on earth doing what god wants , not the evil things that people want to do .
the time is near when all things will end . so keep your minds clear , and control yourselves . this will help you in your prayers .
most important of all , love each other deeply , because love makes you willing to forgive many sins .
open your homes to each other and share your food without complaining .
but you should be happy that you are sharing in christ ’ s sufferings . you will be happy and full of joy when christ shows his glory .
you may suffer , but don ’ t let it be because you murder , steal , make trouble , or try to control other people ’ s lives .
but if you suffer because you are a “ christ-follower , ” don ’ t be ashamed . you should praise god for that name .
“ if it is hard for even a good person to be saved ,
don ’ t be like a ruler over those you are responsible for . but be good examples to them .
then when christ the ruling shepherd comes , you will get a crown—one that will be glorious and never lose its beauty .
so be humble under god ’ s powerful hand . then he will lift you up when the right time comes .
give all your worries to him , because he cares for you .
control yourselves and be careful ! the devil is your enemy , and he goes around like a roaring lion looking for someone to attack and eat .
all power is his forever . amen .
the church in babylon sends you greetings . they were chosen just as you were . mark , my son in christ , also sends his greetings .
give each other a special greeting of love when you meet .
greetings from simon peter , a servant and apostle of jesus christ .
grace and peace be given to you more and more , because now you know god and jesus our lord .
because you have these blessings , do all you can to add to your life these things : to your faith add goodness ; to your goodness add knowledge ;
to your knowledge add self-control ; to your self-control add patience ; to your patience add devotion to god ;
to your devotion add kindness toward your brothers and sisters in christ , and to this kindness add love .
and you will be given a very great welcome into the kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ , a kingdom that never ends .
you already know these things . you are very strong in the truth you have . but i am always going to help you remember them .
while i am still living here on earth , i think it is right for me to remind you of them .
i know that i must soon leave this body . our lord jesus christ has shown me that .
i will try my best to make sure you remember these things even after i am gone .
and we heard that voice . it came from heaven while we were with jesus on the holy mountain .
most important of all , you must understand this : no prophecy in the scriptures comes from the prophet ’ s own understanding .
no prophecy ever came from what some person wanted to say . but people were led by the holy spirit and spoke words from god .
but he saved lot , a good man who lived there . lot was greatly troubled by the morally bad lives of those evil people .
this good man lived with those evil people every day , and his good heart was hurt by the evil things he saw and heard .
they have made many people suffer . so they themselves will suffer . that is their pay for what they have done .
my friends , this is the second letter i have written to you . i wrote both letters to you to help your honest minds remember something .
then the world was flooded and destroyed with water .
everything will be destroyed in this way . so what kind of people should you be ? your lives should be holy and devoted to god .
but grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ . glory be to him , now and forever ! amen .
we write these things to you so that you can be full of joy with us .
we heard the true teaching from god . now we tell it to you : god is light , and in him there is no darkness .
if we say that we have no sin , we are fooling ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
if we say that we have not sinned , we are saying that god is a liar and that we don ’ t accept his true teaching .
jesus is the way our sins are taken away . and he is the way all people can have their sins taken away too .
if we obey what god has told us to do , then we are sure that we know him .
if we say we know god but do not obey his commands , we are lying . the truth is not in us .
but when we obey god ’ s teaching , his love is truly working in us . this is how we know that we are living in him .
if we say we live in god , we must live the way jesus lived .
those who love their brothers and sisters live in the light , and there is nothing in them that will make them do wrong .
i write to you , dear children ,
i write to you , fathers ,
i write to you , children ,
the world is passing away , and all the things that people want in the world are passing away . but whoever does what god wants will live forever .
you have the gift that the holy one gave you . so you all know the truth .
whoever does not believe in the son does not have the father , but whoever accepts the son has the father too .
and this is what the son promised us—eternal life .
i am writing this letter about those who are trying to lead you into the wrong way .
you know that christ always did what was right . so you know that all those who do what is right are god ’ s children .
he is pure , and everyone who has this hope in him keeps themselves pure like christ .
anyone who sins breaks god ’ s law . yes , sinning is the same as living against god ’ s law .
you know that christ came to take away people ’ s sins . there is no sin in christ .
so whoever lives in christ does not continue to sin . if they continue to sin , they have never really understood christ and have never known him .
this is the teaching you have heard from the beginning : we must love each other .
brothers and sisters , don ’ t be surprised when the people of this world hate you .
anyone who hates a fellow believer is a murderer . and you know that no murderer has eternal life .
my dear friends , if we don ’ t feel that we are doing wrong , we can be without fear when we come to god .
and god gives us what we ask for . we receive it because we obey god ’ s commands and do what pleases him .
this is what god commands : that we believe in his son jesus christ , and that we love each other as he commanded .
and they belong to the world , so what they say is from the world too . and the world listens to what they say .
anyone who does not love does not know god , because god is love .
this is how god showed his love to us : he sent his only son into the world to give us life through him .
true love is god ’ s love for us , not our love for god . he sent his son as the way to take away our sins .
that is how much god loved us , dear friends ! so we also must love each other .
we know that we live in god and god lives in us . we know this because he gave us his spirit .
we have seen that the father sent his son to be the savior of the world , and this is what we tell people now .
so we know the love that god has for us , and we trust that love .
we love because god first loved us .
god gave us this command : if we love god , we must also love each other as brothers and sisters .
the people who believe that jesus is the messiah are god ’ s children . anyone who loves the father also loves the father ’ s children .
how do we know that we love god ’ s children ? we know because we love god and we obey his commands .
loving god means obeying his commands . and god ’ s commands are not too hard for us ,
because everyone who is a child of god has the power to win against the world .
so there are three witnesses that tell us about jesus :
the spirit , the water , and the blood . these three witnesses agree .
this is what god told us : god has given us eternal life , and this life is in his son .
whoever has the son has life , but whoever does not have the son of god does not have life .
i write this letter to you who believe in the son of god . i write so that you will know that you have eternal life now .
he listens to us every time we ask him . so we know that he gives us whatever we ask from him .
doing wrong is always sin . but there is sin that does not lead to eternal death .
we know that we belong to god , but the evil one controls the whole world .
so , dear children , keep yourselves away from false gods .
greetings from the elder .
we love you because of the truth—the truth that lives in us . that truth will be with us forever .
grace , mercy , and peace will be with us from god the father and from his son , jesus christ , as we live in truth and love .
be careful ! don ’ t lose the reward we have worked for . be careful so that you will receive all of that reward .
if you do , you are helping them with their evil work .
the children of your sister who was chosen by god send you their love .
greetings from the elder .
it always gives me the greatest joy when i hear that my children are following the way of truth .
my dear friend , it is good that you continue to help the believers . they are people you don ’ t even know .
they told the church about the love you have . please help them to continue their trip . help them in a way that will please god .
they went on their trip to serve christ . they did not accept any help from people who are not believers .
so we should help them . when we help them , we share with their work for the truth .
i wrote a letter to the church , but diotrephes will not listen to what we say . he always wants to be the leader .
i have many things i want to tell you . but i don ’ t want to use pen and ink .
i hope to visit you soon . then we can be together and talk .
peace to you . the friends here with me send their love . please give our love to each one of the friends there .
the lord began to speak to jeremiah in the 13th year that josiah , son of amon , was king of the nation of judah .
the lord ’ s message came to me :
“ before i made you in your mother ’ s womb ,
then i said , “ but , lord god , i don ’ t know how to speak . i am only a boy . ”
but the lord said to me ,
don ’ t be afraid of anyone .
then the lord reached out with his hand and touched my mouth . he said to me ,
today i have put you in charge of nations and kingdoms .
the lord ’ s message came to me : “ jeremiah , what do you see ? ”
the lord said to me , “ you have seen very well , and i am watching to make sure that my message to you comes true . ”
the lord ’ s message came to me again : “ jeremiah , what do you see ? ”
the lord said to me , “ something terrible will come from the north .
in a short time i will call all the people in the northern kingdoms . ”
and i will announce judgment against my people ,
“ as for you , jeremiah , get ready .
as for me , today i will make you like a strong city ,
all those people will fight against you ,
the lord ’ s message came to me :
“ jeremiah , go and speak to the people of jerusalem . tell them that this is what the lord says :
the people of israel were a holy gift to the lord .
family of jacob , hear the lord ’ s message .
this is what the lord says :
your ancestors did not say ,
“ i brought you into a good land ,
“ the priests did not ask ,
the lord says , “ so now i will accuse you again ,
go across the sea to the islands of kittim .
has any nation ever stopped worshiping their old gods
“ skies , be shocked at what happened !
“ my people have done two evil things .
“ israel is not a slave , is he ?
like a lion the enemy has roared at israel .
people from memphis and tahpanhes
this trouble is your own fault .
people of judah , think about this :
you have done wrong ,
“ judah , long ago you broke free from me ,
judah , i planted you like a special vine .
even if you wash yourself with lye ,
“ judah , how can you say to me ,
you are like a wild donkey that lives in the desert .
judah , stop chasing after idols !
“ a thief is ashamed
they say to pieces of wood ,
but where are the idols you made for yourselves ?
“ why do you argue with me ?
“ i punished you people of judah ,
people of this generation ,
a young woman does not forget her jewelry .
“ judah , you have become so good at finding lovers .
you have blood on your hands !
but still , you say , ‘ i am innocent .
you go from one place to another looking for help ,
so you will eventually leave egypt too ,
“ if a man divorces his wife and she goes and marries someone else ,
“ look up to the bare hilltops , judah .
you sinned , so the rain has not come .
but didn ’ t you just call me ‘ father ’ ?
you also said , ‘ god will not always be angry with me .
the lord said to me , “ israel was not faithful to me , but she had a better excuse than unfaithful judah .
jeremiah , look toward the north and speak this message :
but you must recognize your sin .
then i will give you new rulers who will be faithful to me . they will lead you with knowledge and understanding .
in those days there will be many of you in the land. ” this message is from the lord .
this message is from the lord :
you can hear crying on the bare hills .
“ people of israel , you are unfaithful to me , but come back to me .
it was foolish to worship idols on the hills .
that terrible false god baal has eaten everything our fathers owned .
let us lie down in our shame .
this message is from the lord .
if you do these things , you will be able to use my name to make a promise .
this is what the lord says to the people of judah and to jerusalem :
become the lord ’ s people .
“ give this message to the people of judah :
raise the signal flag toward zion .
a lion has come out of his cave .
the lord is angry with us ,
the lord says , “ when this happens ,
at that time this message will be given
it is a stronger wind than that ,
look ! the enemy rises up like a cloud .
listen ! the voice of a messenger
“ report it to this nation .
the enemy has surrounded jerusalem
“ the way you lived and the things you did
my sadness and worry is making my stomach hurt .
how long must i see the war flags ?
the lord said , “ my people are foolish .
i looked at the earth .
i looked at the mountains ,
i looked , but there were no people .
i looked , and the good land had become a desert .
this is what the lord says :
so the people in the land will cry for the dead .
the people of judah will hear the sound
judah , you have been destroyed .
i hear a cry like a woman in labor ,
the people make promises and say , ‘ as the lord lives. ’ but they don ’ t really mean it ! ”
lord , i know that you want people
but i said to myself ,
so i will go to the leaders of judah .
so a lion from the forest will attack them .
god says , “ people of judah , why should i forgive you ?
they are like horses that have had plenty to eat and are ready to mate .
should i punish the people of judah for doing these things ? ”
“ go along the rows of judah ’ s grapevines .
the family of israel and the family of judah
“ those people lied about the lord .
the prophets are only empty wind .
the lord god all-powerful said these things :
family of israel , this message is from the lord .
their arrow bags are like open graves .
they will eat all the crops that you gathered .
this message is from the lord : “ but , judah , when these terrible days come , i will not fully destroy you .
“ tell this message to the family of jacob ,
surely you are afraid of me . ”
but the people of judah are stubborn .
the people of judah never say to themselves ,
you don ’ t have these blessings because you have done wrong .
there are evil men among my people .
their houses are full of lies ,
they have grown big and fat from the evil they have done .
should i punish the people of judah for doing these things ? ”
“ a terrible and shocking thing
the prophets tell lies .
“ run for your lives , people of benjamin !
jerusalem , you are like a beautiful meadow .
enemy shepherds will surround you
“ get ready to fight against jerusalem .
so get up ! we will attack the city at night !
this is what the lord all-powerful says :
as a well keeps its water fresh ,
listen to this warning , jerusalem ,
this is what the lord all-powerful says :
who can i speak to ?
but i am full of the lord ’ s anger ,
their houses will be given to others .
“ all the people of israel want more and more money .
they should bandage the wounds my people have suffered ,
they should be ashamed of the evil things they do ,
this is what the lord says :
i chose watchmen to watch over you .
so listen , all you nations ,
hear this , people of the earth :
“ why do you bring me incense from the country of sheba ?
so this is what the lord says :
this is what the lord says :
the soldiers carry bows and spears .
we have heard the news about that army ,
don ’ t go out into the fields .
my people , put on sackcloth
“ jeremiah , i want you to be
my people have turned against me ,
they are like a worker who tried to make silver pure .
my people will be called ‘ rejected silver . ’
this is the lord ’ s message to jeremiah :
“ jeremiah , stand at the gate of the lord ’ s house . teach this message at the gate :
if you change your lives and do good things , i will let you live in this place . you must be fair to each other .
if you obey me , i will let you live in this place . i gave this land to your ancestors for them to keep forever .
“ ‘ but you are trusting lies that are worthless .
i will throw you away from me just as i threw away all your brothers from ephraim . ’
i know you see what they are doing in the towns of judah . you can see what they are doing in the streets of the city of jerusalem .
i brought your ancestors out of egypt . i spoke to them , but i did not give them any commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices .
“ jeremiah , say this to the people of judah : ‘ this is what the lord says :
the people of judah went the wrong way .
i have listened to them very carefully ,
even the birds in the sky
“ ‘ you keep saying , “ we have the lord ’ s teachings . so we are wise ! ”
these “ wise people ” refused to listen to the lord ’ s teachings .
so i will give their wives to other men .
they should bandage the wounds my people have suffered ,
they should be ashamed of the evil things they do ,
“ ‘ i will take away their fruit and crops
“ they will say , ‘ why are we just sitting here ?
we hoped to have peace ,
from the land of the tribe of dan ,
“ people of judah , i am sending poisonous snakes to attack you .
god , i am very sad and afraid .
listen to my people .
and the people say ,
my people are hurt , so i am hurt .
surely there is some medicine in gilead .
if my head were filled with water ,
if only i had a place in the desert—
“ they use their tongues like a bow ;
“ watch your neighbors !
everyone lies to their neighbor .
one bad thing followed another ,
so the lord all-powerful says ,
the people of judah have tongues as sharp as arrows .
should i punish the people of judah for doing these things ? ”
i , jeremiah , will cry for the mountains .
the lord says , “ i will make the city of jerusalem a pile of garbage .
so the lord all-powerful , the god of israel , says , “ i will soon make the people of judah eat bitter food and drink poisoned water .
this is what the lord all-powerful says :
“ the sound of loud crying is heard from zion :
now , women of judah , listen to the message from the lord .
“ death has climbed in through our windows
this is what you should say : “ the lord says ,
this is what the lord says :
but if someone wants to brag , then let them brag about this :
this is what the lord says : “ the time is coming when i will punish all those who are circumcised only in the body .
family of israel , listen to the lord !
this is what the lord says :
the customs of other people are worth nothing .
they make their idols beautiful with silver and gold .
the idols of the other nations are like
lord , there is no one like you .
everyone should respect you , king of all the nations .
all the people of the other nations are stupid and foolish .
they use silver from the city of tarshish
but the lord is the only true god .
the lord says , “ tell them this message :
god is the one who used his power and made the earth .
god causes the loud thunder ,
people are so stupid !
these idols are worth nothing .
but jacob ’ s god is not like the idols .
get everything you own and prepare to leave .
this is what the lord says :
i am hurt badly .
my tent is ruined .
the shepherds are stupid .
listen ! a loud noise !
lord , i know that our lives do not belong to us .
so correct us , lord !
if you are angry , then punish the other nations .
this is the message from the lord :
“ jeremiah , listen to the words of this agreement and tell them to the people living in jerusalem and the rest of judah .
tell them that this is what the lord , the god of israel , says : ‘ bad things will happen to anyone who does not obey this agreement .
the lord said to me , “ jeremiah , i know that the people of judah and the people living in jerusalem have made secret plans .
“ judah is the one i love , but why is she in my temple ?
the lord gave you a name .
no one from the city of anathoth will be left . no one will survive . i will punish them and cause something bad to happen to them . ”
lord , if i argue with you ,
you have put these wicked people here like plants with strong roots .
but you know my heart , lord .
how much longer will the land be dry ?
“ jeremiah , if running in a race against men makes you tired ,
these men are your own brothers .
“ i have abandoned my house .
my own people turned against me like a wild lion .
my own people have become like
many shepherds have ruined my vineyard .
they have turned it into an empty desert .
the empty hills are covered with soldiers
the people will plant wheat ,
so i bought a linen loincloth , just as the lord told me to do , and i put it around my waist .
then the message from the lord came to me a second time .
so i went to perath and hid the loincloth there , just as the lord told me to do .
many days later the lord said to me , “ now , jeremiah , go to perath . get the loincloth that i told you to hide there . ”
then the message from the lord came to me .
listen and pay attention .
honor the lord your god .
if you people of judah don ’ t listen to him ,
tell these things to the king and his wife ,
the cities in the negev are locked .
i will let your enemies become your rulers—
you might ask yourself ,
a black man can not change the color of his skin ,
“ i will force you to leave your homes .
this is what will happen to you .
jerusalem , i will pull your skirt up over your face .
i saw the terrible things you did .
this is the lord ’ s message to jeremiah about the drought :
“ the nation of judah cries for people who have died .
the leaders of the people send their servants to get water .
no one prepares the ground for crops .
even the mother deer in the field leaves her newborn baby alone ,
wild donkeys stand on the bare hills .
“ we know that this is our fault .
god , you are the hope of israel !
you seem like a man who has been attacked by surprise ,
then the lord said to me , “ jeremiah , don ’ t pray for good things to happen to the people of judah .
“ jeremiah , speak this message to the people of judah :
if i go into the country ,
lord , have you completely rejected the nation of judah ?
lord , we know that we are wicked .
for the good of your name , don ’ t push us away .
foreign idols don ’ t have the power to bring rain .
they might ask you , ‘ where will we go ? ’ tell them this is what the lord says :
i will send four kinds of destroyers against them . ’
i will make the people of judah
“ no one will feel sorry for you , city of jerusalem .
jerusalem , you left me . ”
i will separate the people of judah with my pitchfork .
many women will lose their husbands .
the enemy will attack with swords and kill the people .
mother , i am sorry
surely , lord , i have served you well .
“ jeremiah , you know that no one
the people of judah have many treasures .
people of judah , i will make you slaves of your enemies .
lord , you understand me .
your words came to me , and i ate them up .
i never sat with the crowd
i don ’ t understand why i still hurt .
then the lord said , “ jeremiah , if you change and come back to me ,
i will make you strong .
“ i will save you from these evil people .
the lord ’ s message came to me :
“ jeremiah , you must not get married . you must not have sons or daughters in this place . ”
this is what the lord says about the sons and daughters who are born in the land of judah and about their mothers and fathers :
i see everything they do . the people of judah can not hide the things they do . their sin is not hidden from me .
lord , you are my strength and my protection .
can people make real gods for themselves ?
“ so i will teach those who make idols .
“ the sins of judah are written where they can not be erased—
their children remember the altars
you will lose the land i gave you .
this is what the lord says :
they are like a bush in a desert where no one lives .
“ but those who trust in the lord will be blessed .
they will be strong like trees planted near a stream
“ nothing can hide its evil as well as the human mind .
but i am the lord ,
sometimes a bird will hatch an egg that it did not lay .
from the very beginning , our temple
lord , you are the hope of israel .
lord , if you heal me , i surely will be healed .
the people of judah continue to ask me questions .
lord , i did not run away from you .
please don ’ t make me afraid of you .
people are hurting me .
this is the message that came to jeremiah from the lord :
“ jeremiah , go down to the potter ’ s house . i will give you my message there . ”
so i went down to the potter ’ s house and saw him working with clay at the wheel .
then this message from the lord came to me :
there may come another time when i speak about a nation that i will build up or plant .
but if i see that nation doing evil things and not obeying me , i will think again about the good i had planned to do for them .
listen to what the lord says :
it is as strange as not finding snow on lebanon ’ s mountains
but my people have forgotten me .
so their land will become an empty desert ,
like a strong east wind , i will scatter my people .
lord , listen to me !
i have done only good to them .
so now make their children starve to death !
let them cry out in their houses ,
lord , you know about their plans to kill me .
go out to the valley of ben hinnom , near the front of the potsherd gate . i have a message i want you to announce there .
“ jeremiah , tell this to the people , and while they are watching , break the jar .
i will do this to these people and to this place . i will make this city like topheth. ’ this message is from the lord .
lord , you tricked me , and i certainly was fooled .
every time i speak , i shout .
sometimes i say to myself , “ i will forget about him .
i hear people whispering against me .
but the lord is with me .
lord all-powerful , you test good people .
sing to the lord !
curse the day that i was born !
curse the man who told my father the news that i was born .
let that man be like the cities the lord destroyed .
because he did not kill me
why did i have to come out of her body ?
then jeremiah answered pashhur and zephaniah . he said , “ tell king zedekiah ,
i will kill everything living in jerusalem , both people and animals . they will die from a terrible disease that will spread all through the city .
“ also tell the people of jerusalem , ‘ this is what the lord says : understand that i will let you choose to live or die .
“ say this to judah ’ s royal family : ‘ listen to the message from the lord .
family of david , this is what the lord says :
“ jerusalem , i am against you .
“ you will get the punishment you deserve .
the lord said , “ jeremiah , go down to the king ’ s palace . go to the king of judah and tell this message there :
this is what the lord says about the palace where the king of judah lives :
i will send men to destroy the palace ,
don ’ t cry for the king who has died .
jehoahaz will die in the place where the egyptians have taken him , and he will not see this land again . ”
“ it will be very bad for king jehoiakim .
“ jehoiakim , having a lot of cedar in your house
josiah helped poor and needy people ,
“ jehoiakim , your eyes look only for what benefits yourself .
so this is what the lord says to king jehoiakim son of josiah :
the people of jerusalem will bury jehoiakim like a donkey .
“ judah , go up to the mountains of lebanon and cry out .
“ judah , you felt safe , but i warned you .
judah , the punishment i give will come like a storm ,
“ king , you seem so safe in your palace of cedar .
jehoiachin , i will give you to king nebuchadnezzar of babylon and the babylonians . those are the people you are afraid of . they want to kill you .
i will throw you and your mother into another country where neither of you was born . you and your mother will die in that country .
jehoiachin , you will want to come back to your land , but you will never be allowed to come back . ”
jehoiachin is like a broken pot that someone threw away .
land , land , land of judah !
the lord says , “ write this down about jehoiachin :
this message is from the lord :
when he rules , judah will be saved ,
a message to the prophets :
the land of judah is full of people who commit adultery .
this message is from the lord :
i will stop giving my messages to them .
“ i saw the prophets of samaria doing wrong things .
i have even seen the prophets of jerusalem doing sinful things .
so this is what the lord all-powerful says about those jerusalem prophets :
this is what the lord all-powerful says :
some of the people hate the real messages from the lord ,
but none of these prophets has stood in the heavenly council .
now the punishment from the lord will come like a storm .
the lord ’ s anger will not stop
i did not send those prophets ,
if they had stood in my heavenly council ,
this message is from the lord .
someone might try to hide from me in some hiding place .
how long will this continue ? they think up lies and then they teach them to the people .
yes , the lord says , “ you must treat my message carefully , like a fire or like a hammer that can smash a rock . ”
this message is from the lord : “ so i am against the false prophets . they keep stealing my words from each other . ”
yes , the lord says , “ i am against the false prophets . they use their own words and pretend that it is a message from me .
this is what you will say to one another : ‘ what did the lord answer ? ’ or ‘ what did the lord say ? ’
and i will make you a disgrace forever . you will never forget your shame . ’ ”
the lord said to me , “ what do you see , jeremiah ? ”
then the message from the lord came to me .
this is the message that jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of judah and all the people of jerusalem :
so this is what the lord all-powerful says , “ you have not listened to my messages .
that whole area will be an empty desert . all these people will be slaves of the king of babylon for 70 years .
so i took the cup of wine from the lord ’ s hand . i went to those nations and i made them drink from the cup .
i also made all the arabs and all the kings of the land of uz drink from the cup .
then i made the people of edom , moab , and ammon drink from the cup .
i made all the kings of tyre and sidon drink from the cup .
i made all the kings of arabia drink from the cup . these kings live in the desert .
i made all the kings from zimri , elam , and media drink from the cup .
“ jeremiah , you will give them this message :
the noise spreads to all the people on earth .
this is what the lord all-powerful says :
shepherds , you should be leading the sheep .
there will be no place for the shepherds to hide .
i hear the shepherds shouting .
those peaceful pastures will be ruined
he is like an angry lion that has left his cave .
this message came from the lord during the first year that jehoiakim son of josiah was king of judah .
you will say to them , ‘ this is what the lord says : i gave my teachings to you . you must obey me and follow my teachings .
the priests , the prophets , and all the people heard jeremiah say all these words at the lord ’ s temple .
as for me , i am in your power . do to me what you think is good and right .
then some of the elders stood up and spoke to all the people .
but king jehoiakim sent elnathan son of acbor and some other men to egypt .
there was an important man named ahikam son of shaphan who supported jeremiah . he kept jeremiah from being killed by the priests and prophets .
a message from the lord came to jeremiah . it came during the fourth year that zedekiah son of josiah was king of judah .
now i have given all your countries to king nebuchadnezzar of babylon . he is my servant . i will make even the wild animals obey him .
but the false prophets are saying , ‘ you will never be slaves to the king of babylon . ’
“ but listen to what i have to say to you and to all the people .
jeremiah was wearing a yoke around his neck . the prophet hananiah took the yoke from jeremiah ’ s neck and broke it .
then the message from the lord came to jeremiah . this happened after hananiah had taken the yoke off jeremiah ’ s neck and had broken it .
hananiah died in the seventh month of that same year .
this is what the lord all-powerful , the god of the people of israel , says to all the people he sent into captivity from jerusalem to babylon :
“ build houses and live in them . settle in the land . plant gardens and eat the food you grow .
then you will call my name . you will come to me and pray to me , and i will listen to you .
you will search for me , and when you search for me with all your heart , you will find me .
you people might say , “ but the lord has given us prophets here in babylon . ”
“ you people are captives . i forced you to leave jerusalem and go to babylon . so listen to the message from the lord . ”
also give a message to shemaiah from the nehelam family .
now jeremiah is acting like a prophet . so why didn ’ t you arrest him ?
zephaniah the priest read the letter to jeremiah the prophet .
then this message from the lord came to jeremiah :
this is the message that came to jeremiah from the lord .
the lord spoke this message about the people of israel and judah .
this is what the lord said :
“ ask this question and consider it :
“ this is a very important time for jacob .
“ so jacob , my servant , don ’ t be afraid ! ”
people of israel and judah , i am with you . ”
this is what the lord says :
there is no one to care for your sores ,
you became friends with many nations ,
israel and judah , why are you still crying about your wound ?
those nations destroyed you ,
and i will bring your health back
this is what the lord says :
people in those places will sing songs of praise ,
jacob ’ s family will be like the family of israel long ago .
you will be my people ,
the lord was very angry !
the lord will be angry until he is through punishing them .
this is what the lord says :
from far away , the lord
israel , my bride , i will rebuild you .
you farmers of israel will plant vineyards again .
there will be a time when watchmen shout this message :
this is what the lord says :
remember , i will bring israel
they will come back crying ,
“ nations , listen to this message from the lord !
the lord will bring jacob back .
the people of israel will come to the top of zion ,
then the young women of israel will be happy and dance .
i will give the priests plenty of food .
this is what the lord says :
but the lord says , “ stop crying .
israel , there is hope for you . ”
i have heard ephraim crying :
i wandered away from you .
“ people of israel , repair the road signs .
“ people in all the towns of judah will live together in peace . farmers and those who move around with their flocks will live peacefully together in judah .
i will give rest and strength to those who are weak and tired . ”
after hearing that , i , jeremiah , woke up and looked around . my sleep was very pleasant .
“ people will not use this saying anymore :
no , people will die for their own sins . those who eat sour grapes will get the sour taste . ”
he makes the sun shine in the day ,
“ the descendants of israel will never stop being a nation .
the lord says , “ i will never reject the descendants of israel .
the measuring line will stretch from the corner gate straight to the hill of gareb and then turn to the place named goah .
while jeremiah was a prisoner , he said , “ this message from the lord came to me . this was the message :
i bought the field at anathoth from my cousin hanamel . i weighed out 17 shekels of silver for him .
then i took the sealed copy of the deed , which contained the demands and limits of my purchase , and the copy that was not sealed .
with all the people watching , i said to baruch ,
after i gave the deed to baruch son of neriah , i prayed to the lord :
“ lord god , with your great power you made the earth and the sky . there is nothing too hard for you to do .
you used powerful miracles and brought your people israel out of egypt . you used your own powerful hand to do this . your power was amazing !
“ you gave the israelites this land that you promised to give to their ancestors long ago . it is a very good land filled with many good things .
then this message from the lord came to jeremiah :
“ jeremiah , i am the lord . i am the god of every person on the earth . you know that nothing is impossible for me . ”
the people of israel and judah will be my people , and i will be their god .
while jeremiah was still locked up in the courtyard of the guards , the message from the lord came to him a second time :
“ the lord made the earth , and he keeps it safe . the lord is his name . he says ,
‘ judah , pray to me , and i will answer you . i will tell you important secrets . you have never heard these things before . ’
“ ‘ but then i will heal the people in that city . i will let them enjoy peace and safety .
i will make good things happen to judah and israel again and make them strong as in the past .
they sinned against me , but i will wash away that sin . they fought against me , but i will forgive them .
the lord says , “ someone from david ’ s family will always sit on the throne and rule the family of israel .
this message from the lord came to jeremiah .
jeremiah received this message from the lord :
so jeremiah told all this message to zedekiah in jerusalem .
but after that , the people who had slaves changed their minds . so they took the people they had set free and made them slaves again .
then this message from the lord came to jeremiah :
during the time when jehoiakim , son of king josiah , was king of judah , the lord spoke this message to jeremiah :
then i put some bowls full of wine and some cups in front of the recabite family . and i said to them , “ drink some wine . ”
so we have obeyed everything our ancestor jonadab commanded us . none of us ever drinks wine , and neither do our wives , sons , or daughters .
we never build houses to live in , we never own vineyards or fields , and we never plant crops .
we have lived in tents and have obeyed everything our ancestor jonadab commanded us .
then this message from the lord came to jeremiah :
the descendants of jonadab obeyed the commands that their ancestor gave them , but the people of judah have not obeyed me . ’
so the lord all-powerful , the god of israel , says : ‘ there will always be a descendant of jonadab son of recab to serve me . ’ ”
then jeremiah said to baruch , “ i can not go to the lord ’ s temple . i am not allowed to go there .
a man named micaiah heard all the messages from the lord that baruch read from the scroll . micaiah was the son of gemariah , the son of shaphan .
micaiah told them everything he had heard baruch read from the scroll .
then the officials said to baruch , “ sit down and read the scroll to us . ”
“ yes , ” baruch answered . “ jeremiah spoke , and i wrote down all the messages with ink on this scroll . ”
then the royal officials said to baruch , “ you and jeremiah must go and hide . don ’ t tell anyone where you are hiding . ”
then the royal officials put the scroll in the room of elishama the scribe . they went to king jehoiakim and told him all about the scroll .
elnathan , delaiah , and gemariah tried to talk king jehoiakim out of burning the scroll , but he would not listen to them .
king jehoiakim burned the scroll on which baruch had written all the words that jeremiah had spoken to him . then this message from the lord came to jeremiah :
“ get another scroll . write all the messages on it that were on the first scroll that king jehoiakim of judah burned .
nebuchadnezzar was the king of babylon . he appointed zedekiah son of josiah to be the king of judah in the place of jehoiachin son of jehoiakim .
but zedekiah , his servants , and the people of judah did not pay attention to the messages the lord had given to jeremiah the prophet .
at that time jeremiah had not yet been put into prison , so he was free to go anywhere he wanted .
this message from the lord came to jeremiah the prophet :
after that the army from babylon will come back here and attack jerusalem . then they will capture and burn it . ’
when the babylonian army left jerusalem to fight the army of the pharaoh of egypt ,
jeremiah wanted to travel from jerusalem to the land of benjamin . he wanted to be there for a division of some property that belonged to his family .
they put jeremiah into a cell under the house of jonathan . the cell was in a dungeon under the ground . jeremiah was there for a long time .
so king zedekiah said to the officials , “ jeremiah is in your control . i can not do anything to stop you . ”
the men pulled jeremiah up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern . and jeremiah stayed under guard in the temple yard .
but if you refuse to surrender to the army of babylon , the lord has shown me what will happen . this is what he has told me :
then zedekiah said to jeremiah , “ don ’ t tell anyone that i have been talking to you . if you do , you might die .
so jeremiah stayed under guard in the temple yard until the day jerusalem was captured .
and on the ninth day of the fourth month in zedekiah ’ s eleventh year , the wall of jerusalem was broken through .
there at the town of riblah , the king of babylon killed zedekiah ’ s sons and he killed all the royal officials of judah while zedekiah watched .
then nebuchadnezzar tore out zedekiah ’ s eyes . he put bronze chains on zedekiah and took him to babylon .
the army of babylon set fire to the king ’ s palace and the houses of the people of jerusalem . and they broke down the walls of jerusalem .
but commander nebuzaradan left behind some of the poor people of judah who owned nothing . nebuzaradan gave them vineyards and farmland in judah .
nebuchadnezzar also gave an order about jeremiah to commander nebuzaradan :
“ find jeremiah and take care of him . don ’ t hurt him . give him whatever he asks for . ”
while the guards were watching jeremiah in the temple yard , a message from the lord came to him . this was the message :
so jeremiah went to gedaliah son of ahikam at mizpah . he stayed with gedaliah among those who were left behind in the land of judah .
ishmael also killed all the men of judah who were with gedaliah at the town of mizpah . he also killed the babylonian soldiers who were there with gedaliah .
johanan son of kareah and all the army officers who were with him heard about all the evil things ishmael had done .
when the captives that ishmael had taken saw johanan and the army officers , they were very happy .
then all the captives who ishmael had taken from the town of mizpah ran to johanan son of kareah .
but ishmael and eight of his men escaped from johanan and ran away to the ammonites .
jeremiah , pray that the lord your god will tell us where we should go and what we should do . ”
at the end of ten days , the message from the lord came to jeremiah .
i will be kind to you , and the king of babylon will also treat you with mercy . he will bring you back to your land . ’
but you might say , ‘ we will not stay in judah. ’ if you say that , you will disobey the lord your god .
“ survivors of judah , the lord told you : ‘ don ’ t go to egypt. ’ i warn you right now ,
so jeremiah finished telling the people the message from the lord their god . he told them everything that the lord their god had sent him to tell them .
so johanan , the army officers , and all the people disobeyed the lord ’ s command . the lord had commanded them to stay in judah .
these people didn ’ t listen to the lord . so they all went to egypt to the town of tahpanhes .
in the town of tahpanhes , jeremiah received this message from the lord :
“ we will not listen to the message from the lord that you spoke to us .
then jeremiah spoke to all the men and women who told him these things .
“ this is what the lord , the god of israel , says to you :
these messages about different nations came to jeremiah the prophet from the lord .
“ get your large and small shields ready .
get the horses ready .
what do i see ?
“ fast men can not run away .
who is coming like the nile river ?
it is egypt that comes like the rising nile river .
horse soldiers , charge into battle .
“ but on that day , the lord god all-powerful will win .
“ egypt , go to gilead and get some medicine .
the nations will hear you crying .
this is the message the lord spoke to jeremiah the prophet about nebuchadnezzar coming to attack egypt .
“ announce this message in egypt .
egypt , your strong soldiers will be killed .
they will stumble again and again .
in their homelands , those soldiers will say ,
this message is from the king .
people of egypt , pack your things .
“ egypt is like a beautiful cow .
the hired soldiers in egypt ’ s army are like fat calves .
egypt is like a snake hissing
this is what the lord says :
egypt will be ashamed .
“ jacob , my servant , do not be afraid .
this is what the lord says .
this is the message from the lord that came to jeremiah the prophet about the philistines . this message came before pharaoh attacked the city of gaza .
this is what the lord says :
they will hear the sound of running horses ,
because the time has come to destroy all the philistines .
the people from gaza will be sad and shave their heads .
“ sword of the lord , you have not stopped .
but how can the sword of the lord rest ?
this message is about the country of moab . this is what the lord all-powerful , the god of the people of israel , says :
moab will not be praised again .
listen to the cries from horonaim .
moab will be destroyed .
moab ’ s people go up the path to luhith .
run away ! run for your lives !
“ you trust in the things you made and in your wealth ,
the destroyer will come against every town .
spread salt over the fields in moab .
bad things will happen to those who
“ moab has never known trouble .
this is what the lord says :
“ you can not say , ‘ we are good soldiers .
the enemy will attack moab .
“ the end of moab is near .
all you who live around moab should cry for that country .
“ you people living in dibon ,
“ you people living in aroer ,
“ moab will be ruined and filled with shame .
people on the high plain have been punished .
judgment has come to the towns
judgment has come to the towns
judgment has come to the towns
moab ’ s strength has been cut off .
“ the people of moab thought they were greater than the lord .
“ moab , you made fun of israel .
people in moab , leave your towns .
“ we have heard about moab ’ s pride .
the lord says , “ i know moab gets angry quickly and brags about himself ,
so i cry for moab .
i cry with the people of jazer for jazer .
joy and happiness are gone from the large vineyards of moab .
the lord says , “ look ! an eagle is diving down from the sky .
the towns of moab will be captured .
the nation of moab will be destroyed ,
this is what the lord says :
people will be afraid and run away ,
“ people have run from the powerful enemy .
it will be bad for you , moab .
moab ’ s people will be taken away as captives .
this message is about the ammonites . this is what the lord says :
the lord says , “ the time will come in rabbah of ammon
“ people in heshbon , cry because the town of ai is destroyed !
you brag about your strength ,
but this is what the lord god all-powerful says :
“ the ammonites will be taken away as captives . but the time will come when i will bring the ammonites back. ” this message is from the lord .
this message is about edom . this is what the lord all-powerful says :
you people living in dedan , run away and hide ,
“ workers pick grapes from grapevines ,
but i will take everything from esau .
no one will be left to care for his children .
i heard a message from the lord :
edom , i will make you become unimportant .
edom , you made other nations afraid ,
“ edom will be destroyed .
edom will be destroyed like sodom and gomorrah and the towns around them .
so listen to what the lord has planned to do to the people of edom .
at the sound of edom ’ s fall , the earth will shake .
just as an eagle flies high to see the animal it will attack ,
this message is about the city of damascus :
the city of damascus has become weak .
“ damascus is a happy city .
so the young men will die in the public squares of that city .
“ i will set the walls of damascus on fire .
this message is about the tribe of kedar and the rulers of hazor . king nebuchadnezzar of babylon defeated them . this is what the lord says :
their tents and flocks will be taken away .
“ there is a nation that feels so safe and secure
“ their camels are there to be taken in battle .
“ hazor will become a home for wild dogs , an empty desert forever .
early in the time when zedekiah was king of judah , jeremiah the prophet received a message from the lord about the nation of elam .
the lord all-powerful says ,
i will bring the four winds against elam .
i will break elam to pieces while their enemies are watching .
i will show elam that i am in control ,
“ but in the future i will make good things happen to elam . ”
this is the message the lord spoke through the prophet jeremiah about babylon and its people .
“ announce this to all nations !
a nation from the north will attack babylon .
the lord says , “ at that time
they will ask how to go to zion .
“ my people have been like lost sheep .
they were attacked by all who saw them .
“ run away from babylon .
i will bring many nations together from the north .
the enemy will take all the wealth from the chaldeans .
“ babylon , you are excited and happy .
now your mother will be very ashamed .
the lord will show his anger ,
“ prepare for war against babylon .
soldiers around babylon , shout the cry of victory !
don ’ t let the people from babylon plant their crops .
“ israel is like a flock of sheep that was scattered all over the country .
so this is what the lord all-powerful , the god of israel , says :
“ ‘ i will bring israel back to his own fields .
the lord says , “ at that time people will try hard to find israel ’ s guilt ,
the lord says , “ attack the country of merathaim !
“ the noise of battle can be heard all over the country .
babylon , i set a trap for you ,
the lord has opened up his storeroom
“ come against babylon from far away .
kill all the young men in babylon .
people are running out of babylon .
“ call for the archers .
babylon ’ s young men will be killed in the streets .
“ babylon , you are too proud ,
proud babylon will stumble and fall ,
this is what the lord all-powerful says :
but god will get them back .
sword , kill the priests of babylon .
sword , kill the horses and chariots of babylon .
sword , strike the waters of babylon .
babylon will never again be filled with people .
god completely destroyed sodom and gomorrah
“ look ! there are people coming from the north .
their armies have bows and spears .
the king of babylon heard about those armies ,
“ sometimes a lion will come
listen to what the lord has planned
i will send foreigners to winnow babylon ,
the babylonian soldiers will not get to use their bows and arrows .
babylon ’ s soldiers will be killed in the land of the chaldeans .
the lord all-powerful did not leave israel and judah alone , like a widow .
run away from babylon .
babylon was like a golden cup in the lord ’ s hand .
but babylon will suddenly fall and be broken .
we tried to heal babylon ,
the lord got even for us .
lift up a flag against the walls of babylon .
babylon , you live near much water .
the lord all-powerful used his name to make this promise :
god used his great power and made the earth .
when he thunders , the waters in the skies roar .
but people are so stupid .
those idols are worthless .
but god , who is jacob ’ s portion , is not like those worthless statues .
the lord says , “ babylon , you are my club .
i used you to smash horse and rider .
i used you to smash men and women .
i used you to smash shepherds and flocks .
but i will repay babylonia and all the babylonians for all the evil things they did to zion .
people will not take stones from babylon to use as the foundation of a building .
“ lift up the war flag in the land !
get the nations ready for battle against her .
the land shakes and moves as if it is in pain .
babylon ’ s soldiers have stopped fighting .
one messenger follows another .
the places where people cross the rivers have been captured .
this is what the lord all-powerful , the god of the people of israel , says :
“ king nebuchadnezzar of babylon destroyed us in the past .
babylon did terrible things to hurt us .
so this is what the lord says :
babylon will become a pile of ruined buildings ,
“ the people of babylon are like roaring young lions .
they are acting like powerful lions .
“ babylon will be like sheep , rams , and goats waiting to be killed .
“ sheshach will be defeated .
the sea will rise over babylon .
babylon will be like a dry , desert land .
i will punish the false god bel in babylon .
come out of the city of babylon , my people .
“ don ’ t be sad , my people .
the time will surely come when i will punish the false gods of babylon ,
then heaven and earth and all that is in them
“ babylon killed people from israel .
you people escaped the swords .
“ we people of judah are ashamed .
the lord says , “ the time is coming ,
babylon might grow until she touches the sky .
“ we can hear people crying in babylon .
the lord will destroy babylon very soon .
the army will come and destroy babylon .
i will make babylon ’ s wise men
this is what the lord all-powerful says :
jeremiah had written on a scroll all the terrible things that would happen to babylon . he had written all these things about babylon .
jeremiah said to seraiah , “ seraiah , go to babylon . be sure to read this message so that all the people can hear you .
after you finish reading this scroll , tie a stone to it and throw it into the euphrates river .
zedekiah did evil things , just as king jehoiakim had done . the lord did not like zedekiah doing those evil things .
terrible things happened to the people of jerusalem and judah because the lord was angry with them . finally , he threw them out of his presence .
the city of jerusalem was surrounded by the army of babylon until the eleventh year that zedekiah was king .
but the babylonian army chased king zedekiah and caught him on the plains of jericho . all of zedekiah ’ s soldiers ran away .
nebuzaradan burned the lord ’ s temple , the king ’ s palace , and every important building in jerusalem , as well as all the houses .
all the babylonian soldiers that were with the commander broke down the walls around jerusalem .
but nebuzaradan left some of the poorest people behind in the land . he left them to work in the vineyards and the fields .
there were 96 pomegranates on the sides of the pillars . all together , there were 100 pomegranates above the net design that went around the pillars .
this is how many people nebuchadnezzar carried into captivity :
in nebuchadnezzar ’ s 18th year as king of babylon , 832 people were taken from jerusalem .
in nebuchadnezzar ’ s 23rd year as king , nebuzaradan took 745 people of judah into captivity . nebuzaradan was the commander of the king ’ s special guards .
evil merodach spoke kindly to jehoiachin . he gave jehoiachin a place of honor higher than the other kings who were with him in babylon .
so jehoiachin took his prison clothes off . for the rest of his life , he ate regularly at the king ’ s table .
every day the king of babylon paid jehoiachin enough to take care of his needs until the day jehoiachin died .
job had seven sons and three daughters .
he owned 7000 sheep , 3000 camels , 1000 oxen , and 500 female donkeys . he had many servants . he was the richest man in the east .
job ’ s sons took turns having dinner parties in their homes , and they invited their sisters .
then the day came for the angels to meet with the lord . even satan was there with them .
the lord said to satan , “ where have you been ? ”
satan answered the lord , “ but job has a good reason to respect you .
but if you were to destroy everything he has , i promise you that he would curse you to your face . ”
the lord said to satan , “ all right , do whatever you want with anything that he has , but don ’ t hurt job himself . ”
one day job ’ s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine at the oldest brother ’ s house .
a messenger came to job and said , “ we were plowing the fields with the oxen and the donkeys were eating grass nearby ,
even after all this , job did not sin . he did not accuse god of doing anything wrong .
then another day came for the angels to meet with the lord . satan joined them for this meeting with the lord .
the lord said to satan , “ where have you been ? ”
satan answered , “ skin for skin ! a man will give everything he has to protect himself .
i swear , if you attack his flesh and bones , he will curse you to your face ! ”
so the lord said to satan , “ all right , job is in your hands , but you are not allowed to kill him . ”
job sat on the pile of ashes where he was mourning and used a piece of broken pottery to scrape his sores .
his wife said to him , “ are you still holding on to your faith ? why don ’ t you just curse god and die ! ”
then job opened his mouth and cursed the day he was born .
“ i wish the day i was born would be lost forever .
i wish that day had remained dark .
i wish that bitter day had remained as dark as death ,
i wish the darkness had carried away that night ,
i wish that night had produced nothing
some magicians think they can wake leviathan .
let that day ’ s morning star be dark .
i wish it had stopped me from being born
why didn ’ t i die when i was born ?
why did my mother hold me on her knees ?
if i had died when i was born ,
with the kings and their advisors
i wish i were buried with rulers
why wasn ’ t i a child who died at birth
there the wicked stop causing trouble ,
even prisoners find relief there ;
everyone—from the greatest to the least important—will be there ,
“ why must a suffering person continue to live ?
such people want to die , but death does not come .
they would be happy to find their grave .
but god keeps their future a secret
when it is time to eat , all i can do is sigh with sadness , not joy .
i was afraid something terrible would happen ,
i can not calm down or relax .
eliphaz from teman answered :
“ i must say something .
job , you have taught many people .
your words helped those who were ready to fall .
but now trouble comes to you ,
can you think of any innocent person who was ever destroyed ?
yes , i have seen people whose lives were cut short ,
they lost the breath god gave them .
they were like roaring lions ,
like a lioness that can not find prey .
“ i happened to hear a message .
like a bad dream in the night ,
a spirit passed by my face .
the spirit stood still ,
‘ a person can not be more right than god .
look , god can not even trust his heavenly servants .
so surely people are worse !
from dawn to sunset people are destroyed .
the ropes of their tent are pulled up ,
“ job , call out if you want , and see if anyone answers !
a fool ’ s anger will kill him .
i saw a fool who thought he was safe ,
there was no one to help his children .
hungry people ate all his crops ,
bad times don ’ t come up from the dirt .
but people are born to have trouble ,
if i were you , i would turn to god
people can not understand the wonderful things god does .
he sends rain all over the earth
he raises up the humble
he spoils the plans of even the smartest people
he catches those who think they are wise in their own clever traps
daylight will be like darkness for them .
god saves the poor from the hurtful words of the wicked .
so the poor have hope ;
“ you are fortunate when god corrects you .
god might injure you , but he will bandage those wounds .
he will save you again and again .
god will save you from death
people might say bad things about you with their sharp tongues .
you will laugh at destruction and famine .
it is as if you have a peace treaty
you will live in peace because your tent is safe .
you will have many children .
you will be like the wheat that grows until harvest time .
“ we have studied this and know it is true .
“ i wish my suffering could be weighed
they would be heavier than all the sand of the sea !
god all-powerful has shot me with his arrows .
even a wild donkey does not complain when it has grass to eat .
food without salt does not taste good ,
i refuse to touch that kind of food ;
“ i wish i could have what i ask for .
i wish he would crush me—
then i would be comforted by this one thing :
“ with my strength gone , i have no hope to go on living .
i am not strong like a rock .
i don ’ t have the power to help myself ,
“ friends should be loyal to you in times of trouble ,
but i can not depend on you , my brothers .
in the winter , it is choked with ice and melting snow .
but when the weather is hot and dry ,
it twists and turns along the way
traders from tema search for it .
they are sure they can find water ,
now , you are like those streams .
but have i ever asked you to help me ?
no , and i never said , ‘ save me from my enemies ! ’
“ so now , teach me , and i will be quiet .
honest words are powerful ,
do you plan to criticize me ?
are you the kind of people
now , look me in the face ,
you need to start over and stop being so unfair !
i am not lying .
“ people have a hard struggle on earth .
they are like a slave looking for cool shade
month after frustrating month has gone by .
when i lie down , i think ,
my skin is covered with worms and scabs .
“ my days pass by faster than a weaver ’ s shuttle ,
god , remember , my life is like a breath .
those who see me now will never see me again .
just as clouds that come and go ,
they don ’ t come back to their old homes .
“ so i will not be quiet !
am i one of your enemies ?
my bed should bring me comfort .
but when i lie down , you scare me with dreams ;
so i would rather be choked to death
i hate my life—i give up .
god , why are people so important to you ?
why do you visit them every morning
you never look away from me
you are always watching us !
why don ’ t you just pardon me for doing wrong ?
then bildad from shuah answered :
“ how long will you talk like that ?
god is always fair .
if your children sinned against god , he punished them .
but now , look to god
if you are pure and good ,
then you will have a lot more
“ ask those who are now old .
it seems as though we were born yesterday .
maybe the old people can tell you something .
“ can papyrus grow tall on a dry land ?
no , they will dry up before harvest .
people who forget god are like that .
they have put their trust in something weak .
when they lean against it ,
such people are like a vine that gets plenty of water and sunshine ,
its roots spread among the rocks ,
but if you move it , it will die ,
everything might have been going well ,
god does not support evil people ,
so perhaps you might laugh again .
maybe your enemies will be humiliated
“ of course , i know that this is true .
anyone who chose to argue with him
god is so wise and powerful that
when god is angry , he moves mountains before they know what happened .
he can shake the earth ,
with one command he can stop the sun from rising .
he alone made the skies ,
“ god made the bear , orion , and the pleiades .
he does things too marvelous for people to understand .
when he passes by , i can not see him .
if he takes something away , no one can stop him .
god will not hold back his anger .
so i can not argue with god .
i am innocent , but i can not give him an answer .
even if i called and he answered ,
he would just send storms to crush me .
he would not let me catch my breath again .
i can not defeat god .
i am innocent , but anything i say makes me seem guilty .
i am innocent , but i don ’ t know what to think .
so i say , ‘ does it make any difference ?
is it god who laughs when a disaster kills innocent people ?
is it god who keeps the leaders from seeing when an evil person takes control ?
“ my days are passing faster than a runner .
they go by as quickly as papyrus boats ,
“ i could say , ‘ i will not complain .
but the suffering still frightens me .
i will be found guilty ,
even if i scrubbed my hands with soap
god would still push me into the slime pit ,
god is not a human like me , so i can not argue with him .
i wish there were someone who could listen to both sides ,
i wish someone could take away the threat of god ’ s punishment .
then i could say what i want without being afraid of him .
“ i hate my own life , so i will complain freely .
i will say to god , ‘ don ’ t just say i am guilty !
do you enjoy hurting me ?
do you have human eyes ?
is your life as short as ours ?
you look for my wrong
you know i am innocent ,
your hands made me and shaped my body .
remember , you molded me like clay .
you poured me out like milk .
you put me together with bones and muscles ,
you gave me life and were very kind to me .
but this is what you hid in your heart .
if i sinned , you would be watching me
if i sin , i am guilty
if i have any success and feel proud ,
you bring witness after witness
so why did you let me be born ?
i wish i had never lived .
my life is almost finished .
i am going soon to the land of no return ,
that land of darkest night , of shadows and confusion ,
then zophar from naamah answered job and said ,
“ this flood of words should be answered !
do you think we don ’ t have
you say to god ,
i wish god would answer you
he could tell you the secret of wisdom .
“ do you think you really understand god ?
that knowledge is higher than the heavens
it is greater than the earth
“ if god decides to arrest you and take you to court ,
god knows who is worthless .
a wild donkey can not give birth to a man ,
prepare your heart to serve only god .
put away the sin that you still hold on to .
if you will do that , you could look to god without shame .
then you can forget your troubles ,
your life will be brighter than the sunshine at noon .
you will feel safe because there is hope .
you will lie down without fear of anyone .
evil people might look for help ,
then job answered them :
“ i ’ m sure you think you are
but my mind is as good as yours .
“ my friends laugh at me now .
those who have no troubles make fun of those who do .
but robbers ’ tents are not bothered .
“ but ask the animals , and they will teach you .
or speak to the earth , and it will teach you .
every animal that lives and everyone who breathes—
but just as the tongue tastes food ,
people say , ‘ wisdom is to be found in those who are old .
but wisdom and power belong to god .
anything god tears down can not be rebuilt .
if he holds back the rain , the earth will dry up .
god is strong and always wins .
he strips advisors of their wisdom
he strips kings of their authority
he strips priests of their power
he makes trusted advisors be silent .
he brings disgrace to important people .
he exposes even the darkest secrets .
god makes nations great ,
he makes their leaders foolish .
they are like someone feeling their way in the dark .
“ i have seen all this before .
i know as much as you do .
but i don ’ t want to argue with you .
but you men try to cover up your ignorance with lies .
i wish you would just be quiet .
“ now , listen to my argument .
will you speak lies for god ?
are you trying to defend god against me ?
if god checked you very closely ,
you know that god would criticize you
god ’ s majesty frightens you .
the wise sayings you quote are worthless .
“ be quiet and let me talk !
i will put myself in danger
i will continue to trust god even if he kills me .
and if he lets me live , it will be because i had the confidence to speak .
listen carefully to what i say .
i am ready now to defend myself .
if anyone can prove i am wrong ,
“ god , just give me two things ,
then call to me , and i will answer you .
how many sins have i committed ?
god , why do you avoid me
are you trying to scare me ?
you have a list of terrible charges against me .
you have put chains on my feet .
so i am becoming weaker and weaker ,
“ we are all human beings .
our life is like a flower that grows quickly and then dies away .
god , do you need to keep an eye on something so small ?
“ no one can make something clean from something so dirty .
the length of our life has been decided .
so stop watching us ; leave us alone ,
“ there is always hope for a tree .
its roots might grow old in the ground
but with water , it will grow again .
but when a man dies ,
like a lake that goes dry
so people lose their lives ,
“ i wish you would hide me in my grave .
if a man dies , will he live again ?
god , you would call me ,
you would still watch every step i take ,
it would be as if you had sealed my sins in a bag .
“ mountains fall and crumble away .
water flowing over stones wears them down .
if their sons are honored , they will never know it .
they only feel the pain in their bodies ,
then eliphaz from teman answered job :
“ if you were really wise ,
do you think a wise man would use empty words
if you had your way ,
what you say clearly shows your sin .
i don ’ t need to prove to you that you are wrong .
“ do you think you were the first person ever to be born ?
did you listen to god ’ s secret plans ?
we know as much as you do !
the old , gray-haired men agree with us .
god tries to comfort you , but that is not enough for you .
why will you not understand ?
you are expressing your anger against god
“ people can not really be pure .
god does not even trust his angels .
people are even worse .
“ listen to me , and i will explain it to you .
i will tell you what wise men would say ,
these are important people in our country !
and they said that an evil man suffers all his life .
every noise scares him .
an evil man has no hope of escaping the darkness .
he wanders from place to place , looking for food .
he lives in fear , with worry and suffering threatening him
that is because that evil man shook his fist at god , refusing to obey .
like a soldier with a thick , strong shield
he might be rich and fat ,
but his town will be ruined ;
he will not be rich for long .
he will not escape the darkness .
that evil man should not fool himself by trusting in worthless things ,
he will die before his time ,
he will be like a vine that loses its grapes before they ripen .
that is because people without god have nothing .
they are always thinking of ways to do evil and cause trouble .
“ i have heard all these things before .
your long speeches never end !
i also could say the same things you say ,
but i would say things to encourage you
“ nothing i say makes my pain go away .
god , you surely took away my strength .
you have made me thin and weak ,
“ god attacks me ;
people have crowded around me .
god has given me to evil people .
i was enjoying a quiet , peaceful life ,
with his archers all around me ,
again and again he attacks me .
“ i am very sad , so i wear this sackcloth .
my face is red from crying .
i was never cruel to anyone ,
“ earth , don ’ t hide the wrong things that were done to me .
even now there is someone in heaven who will speak for me .
my friend speaks for me ,
he speaks to god for me ,
“ in only a few years
my spirit is broken ;
people stand around me and laugh at me .
“ god , give me some support .
you have closed my friends ’ minds ,
you know what people say :
god has made my name a bad word to everyone .
my eyes are almost blind from my grief .
good people wonder how this could happen .
but those who do right will continue to do what is right .
“ but come on , all of you , and try to prove me wrong .
my life is passing away , and my plans are destroyed .
“ i might hope for the grave to be my new home .
i might say to the grave , ‘ you are my father , ’
but you can ’ t really call that hope , can you ?
will hope go down with me to the place of death ?
then bildad from shuah answered :
“ when will you stop talking ?
why do you think we are stupid ,
your anger is hurting no one but you .
“ yes , the light of those who are evil will go out .
the light in their houses will become dark .
their steps , once strong and fast , become weak .
their own feet lead them into a net .
a trap catches them by the heel ,
a rope is hidden on the ground to trip them .
on every side terrors frighten them .
disaster is hungry for them .
diseases will eat away their skin .
they will be taken away from the safety of their tents
nothing will be left in their tents ,
their roots below will dry up ,
people on earth will not remember them .
they will be forced from light into darkness .
they will leave behind no children , no descendants .
people in the west will be shocked at what happened to them .
this is what will happen to the homes of those who are evil .
“ how long will you hurt me
you have insulted me ten times now .
even if i have sinned ,
you want me to look bad to make yourselves look good .
i want you to know it was god who did this .
i shout , ‘ he hurt me ! ’ but get no answer .
god has blocked my way to keep me from getting through .
he took away my honor .
he hits me on every side until i am worn out .
his anger burns against me .
he sends his army to attack me .
“ god has made my brothers hate me .
my relatives have left me .
my servant girls and visitors in my home
i call for my servant , but he does not answer .
my wife hates the smell of my breath .
even little children make fun of me .
all my close friends hate me .
“ i am so thin , my skin hangs loose on my bones .
“ pity me , my friends , pity me ,
why do you persecute me as god does ?
“ i wish someone would write down everything i say .
i wish they were carved with an iron tool into lead
i know that there is someone to defend me and that he lives !
after i leave my body and my skin has been destroyed ,
i will see him with my own eyes .
“ maybe you will say , ‘ how can we push job a little harder
but you need to worry about your own punishment .
then zophar from naamah answered :
“ you upset me , so i must answer you .
you insulted me with your answers !
“ you know that the joy of the wicked does not last long .
maybe an evil man ’ s pride will reach up to the sky ,
but he will be gone forever like his own body waste .
like a dream , he will fly away , never to be found .
those who knew him before will not see him again .
his children will have to give back what he took from the poor .
when he was young , his bones were strong ,
“ evil tastes sweet in his mouth .
he hates to let it go
but that evil will turn sour in his stomach .
the evil man will spit out the riches he has swallowed .
what he drank will be like a snake ’ s poison ;
he will never again enjoy so much wealth—
he will be forced to give back his profits .
because he hurt the poor and left them with nothing .
“ the evil man is never satisfied .
after filling himself , there is nothing left .
even while he has plenty , he will be pressed down with trouble .
if he does get all he wants ,
maybe he will run away from an iron sword ,
it will go through his body
all his treasures will be lost in darkness .
heaven will prove that he is guilty .
his house and everything in it will be carried away
that is what god will do to those who are evil .
“ listen to what i say .
be patient while i speak .
“ my complaint is not against people .
look at me and be shocked .
when i think about what happened to me ,
why do evil people live long lives ?
they watch their children grow up
their homes are safe and free from fear .
their bulls never fail to mate .
they send their children out to play like lambs .
they sing and dance to the sound of harps and flutes .
evil people enjoy success during their lives
they say to god , ‘ leave us alone !
and they say , ‘ who is god all-powerful ?
“ of course , evil people don ’ t make their own success .
but how often does god blow out their light ?
does god blow them away , as the wind blows straw
but you say , ‘ god is saving their punishment for their children . ’
let them see their own punishment .
when their life is finished and they are dead ,
“ no one can teach god anything he doesn ’ t already know .
one person dies after living a full and successful life ,
with a body that was well fed
but another person dies after a hard life that has made them bitter ,
in the end , both of these people will lie together in the dirt .
“ but i know what you are thinking ,
you might say , ‘ show me a good man ’ s house .
“ surely you have talked with travelers .
evil people are spared when disaster comes .
no one criticizes them to their faces for how they lived .
when they are carried to the grave ,
so even the soil in the valley will be pleasant for them ,
“ so your empty words are no comfort to me .
then eliphaz from teman answered :
“ does god need our help ?
does your living right benefit him ?
why does god blame and punish you ?
no , it is because you sin so much .
maybe to guarantee loans you took things from people for no reason .
maybe you failed to give water or food
you have a lot of farmland ,
but maybe you sent widows away without giving them anything .
that is why traps are all around you ,
that is why it is so dark you can not see ,
“ god lives in the highest part of heaven
but you might say , ‘ what does god know ?
thick clouds hide us from his eyes ,
“ job , you are walking on the old path
they were destroyed before it was their time to die .
they told god , ‘ leave us alone ! ’
and it was god who filled their houses with good things .
those who do what is right are happy to see them destroyed .
‘ surely our enemies are destroyed !
“ now , job , give yourself to god and make peace with him .
if you return to god all-powerful , you will be restored .
think of your gold as nothing but dirt .
and let god all-powerful be your gold .
then you will enjoy god all-powerful ,
when you pray , he will hear you .
if you decide to do something , it will be successful .
when people are brought down and you ask god to help them ,
even those who are guilty will be forgiven .
“ i am still complaining today .
i wish i knew where to find him .
i would present my case to him .
he could give his response , and i would understand .
would god use his power against me ?
since i am an honest man , he would let me tell my story .
“ if i go to the east , god is not there .
when he is working in the north , i don ’ t see him .
but god knows me .
i have always lived the way god wants .
i always obey his commands .
“ but god never changes ,
he will do to me what he planned ,
that is why i am terrified to stand before him .
the fear of god has made me lose my courage .
what has happened to me is like a dark cloud over my face .
“ why doesn ’ t god all-powerful set times for judgment ?
“ people move property markers to get more of their neighbor ’ s land .
they steal a donkey that belongs to an orphan .
they take a nursing baby from its mother .
they force the poor to move out of their way
“ the poor are like wild donkeys that go out to the desert to find food .
they have to work in the fields , harvesting grain .
they must sleep all night without clothes .
they are soaked with rain in the mountains .
they have no clothes , so they work naked .
they press out olive oil
in the city you can hear the sad sounds of dying people .
“ some people rebel against the light .
a murderer gets up at dawn and kills poor , helpless people .
a man who commits adultery waits for the night to come .
when it is dark , evil people go out and break into houses .
the darkest night is their morning .
“ you say , ‘ evil people are taken away like things carried away in a flood .
as hot , dry weather melts away the winter snows ,
their own mothers will forget them .
these evil people hurt women who have no children to protect them ,
by his power god removes the powerful .
they might feel safe and secure ,
they might be successful for a while , but then they will be gone .
“ i swear these things are true !
then bildad from shuah answered :
“ god is the ruler .
no one can count his stars .
how can anyone claim to be right before god ?
in god ’ s eyes even the moon is not pure and bright ;
people are much less pure .
“ bildad , what a great help you are to this tired , weary man !
you have given such wonderful advice to this foolish man !
who helped you say these things ?
“ the ghosts and their neighbors
but god can see clearly into that place of death .
god stretched the northern sky over empty space .
he fills the thick clouds with water .
he covers the face of the full moon .
he drew the horizon on the ocean ,
the foundations that hold up the sky
with his own power god calmed the sea .
his breath made the skies clear .
these are only a few of the amazing things god has done .
job continued his answer :
“ god all-powerful has been unfair to me ;
as long as i have life in me ,
i will not be a hypocrite .
you will never hear me say you men are right !
i will hold on to my innocence and never let go !
may my enemies be punished like those who are evil .
what hope do people without god have when it is time to die ,
when they have troubles and cry out for help ,
it will be too late for them to enjoy talking with god all-powerful .
“ i will teach you about god ’ s power .
but you have seen it all with your own eyes .
“ here is what god has planned for those who are evil .
they may have many children , but all of them will be killed in war .
all those who are left will die ,
evil people collect silver as easily as dirt .
but their piles of clothes will be worn by those who have lived right .
evil people might build houses , but they will not last long .
they might be rich when they go to bed ,
terrible fears will come over them like a flood ,
the east wind will carry them away , and they will be gone .
they may try to run away from the power of the storm ,
it will make a sound like clapping hands as they run away .
“ there are mines where people get silver
iron is dug out of the ground ,
miners carry lights deep into caves
far from where people live , they dig deep into the ground ,
food grows on the ground above .
in the rocks there are sapphires
wild birds know nothing about the way to these places .
wild animals have never been there .
miners dig the hardest rocks .
they cut tunnels through the rocks
they even find places where rivers begin .
“ but where can anyone find wisdom ?
people don ’ t know where wisdom is .
the deep ocean says , ‘ it ’ s not here with me . ’
you can not buy wisdom with even the purest gold .
you can not buy it with gold from ophir
wisdom is worth more than gold or crystal .
it is far more valuable than coral and jasper ,
the topaz from ethiopia can not match its value ,
“ so where does wisdom come from ?
wisdom is hidden from every living thing on earth .
death and destruction say ,
“ only god knows the way to wisdom .
he can see to the very ends of the earth .
god gave the wind its power .
he decided where to send the rain
he looked at wisdom and discussed it .
then he said to humans ,
job continued to speak :
“ i wish my life could be the same as it was a few months ago ,
god ’ s light shined above me ,
i wish for the days when i was successful ,
god all-powerful was still with me then ,
life was so good that i washed my feet in cream
“ those were the days when i went to the city gate
when the young men saw me coming , they stepped out of my way .
the leaders of the people stopped talking
even the most important leaders were quiet ,
all who heard me said good things about me .
because i helped the poor when they cried out .
people who were dying asked god to bless me .
right living was my clothing .
i was like eyes for the blind ,
i was like a father to the poor .
i stopped evil people from abusing their power
“ i always thought i would live a long life ,
i was like a healthy plant with roots that have plenty of water
i thought each new day would bring more honor
“ in the past people listened to me .
when i finished speaking , they had nothing more to say .
they waited for my words as they would for rain .
i smiled at them , and they could hardly believe it .
i was their leader and made decisions about their future .
“ but now men younger than i make fun of me—
their fathers are still too weak to be of any use to me .
they are starving with nothing to eat ,
they pull up salt plants in the desert
they are forced away from other people ,
they must live in the dry riverbeds ,
they howl in the bushes
they are a bunch of worthless people without names ,
“ now their sons sing songs to make fun of me .
they hate me and stay far away from me ,
god has taken the string from my bow and made me weak ,
they attack me on my right side .
they guard the road so that i can not escape .
they break a hole in the wall and come rushing through it ,
i am shaking with fear .
“ now my life is almost gone , and soon i will die .
all my bones ache at night .
god grabbed the collar of my coat
he threw me into the mud ,
“ god , i cry out to you for help , but you don ’ t answer .
you have become cruel to me ;
you let the strong wind blow me away .
i know you will lead me to my death ,
“ surely no one would attack a man who is already ruined ,
god , you know that i cried for those who were in trouble .
but when i hoped for good , trouble came instead .
i constantly feel upset .
i am always sad and depressed , without any relief .
making sad sounds like the wild dogs ,
my skin is burned and peeling away .
my harp is tuned to play songs of sorrow .
“ i made an agreement with my eyes
what does god above have for us ?
he sends trouble to the wicked
god is the one who knows what i do
“ i have not lied to anyone .
if god would use accurate scales ,
if i ever stepped off the right path ,
then let others eat what i planted .
“ if i have desired another woman
then let my wife serve someone else ,
to do such a thing would be shameful ,
such sin is like a fire that burns until it destroys everything .
“ if i refused to be fair to my slaves
then what will i do when i must face god ?
the one who made me in my mother ’ s womb also made them .
“ i have never refused to help the poor .
i have never been selfish with my food .
all my life i have been like a father to orphans
whenever i found people suffering because they didn ’ t have clothes
i always gave them something to wear .
i never threatened an orphan ,
if i ever did that , may my arm be pulled from its socket
but i didn ’ t do any of these bad things .
“ i have never trusted in riches .
i have been wealthy ,
i have never worshiped the bright sun
i was never foolish enough
this is also a sin that must be punished .
“ i have never been happy
i have never let my mouth sin by cursing my enemies
the people in my house know that
i always invited strangers into my home
i have not tried to hide my sins as some people do .
i was never so afraid of what people might say or of making enemies
“ how i wish someone would listen to me !
i would wear it around my neck .
then i could explain everything i have done .
“ i did not use my land in a wrong way .
i always paid the workers for the food i got from the land .
if i ever did any of these bad things ,
then job ’ s three friends gave up trying to answer him , because he was so sure that he was innocent .
elihu was also angry with job ’ s three friends because they could not answer him , and yet they still considered him guilty of doing wrong .
elihu was the youngest one there , so he had waited until everyone finished talking .
but when he saw that job ’ s three friends had nothing more to say , his anger forced him to speak .
so here ’ s what elihu son of barakel the buzite said :
i thought to myself , ‘ older people should speak first .
but it is the spirit in people , the breath from god all-powerful ,
old men are not the only wise people .
“ so please listen to me ,
i waited patiently while you men talked .
i listened carefully to what you said .
you men can not say that you have found wisdom .
job was arguing with you , not me ,
“ job , these men lost the argument .
i waited for them to answer you .
so now i will give you my answer .
i have so much to say
i feel like a jar of wine that has never been opened .
i must speak so that i will feel better .
i will treat you the same as i would treat anyone else .
i can not treat one person better than another .
“ now , job , listen to me .
i am ready to speak .
my heart is honest , so my words are sincere .
god ’ s spirit made me .
listen to me and answer if you can .
you and i are the same before god .
don ’ t be afraid of me .
“ but , job , i heard what you said .
‘ i am pure and innocent ;
but god found an excuse to attack me .
he put chains on my feet
“ but you are wrong about this , and i will prove it to you .
you are arguing with god !
but maybe god does explain what he does
he may speak in a dream , or in a vision at night ,
he may whisper something in their ear ,
god warns people to stop them from doing wrong
he does this to save them from death .
“ or those who are sick in bed might be suffering punishment from god .
they feel so bad they can not eat .
their bodies might waste away until they become thin
they might be close to death ,
but maybe one of god ’ s thousands of angels is watching over them ,
maybe the angel will be kind and say to god ,
then that person ’ s body will become young and strong again .
he will pray and god will answer .
he will tell everyone , ‘ i sinned .
god saved me from going down to the place of death .
“ god does all these things for people again and again .
he wants them to be saved from death
“ job , pay attention and listen to me .
but if you have an answer , go ahead and speak .
but if you have nothing to say , then listen to me .
then elihu continued his speech :
“ listen to what i say , you wise men .
your tongue tastes the food it touches ,
so let us test these arguments and decide for ourselves what is right .
job says , ‘ i am innocent ,
i am right , but i am judged to be a liar .
“ would anyone but job say such things ?
he is a friend of evil people .
i know this because he says ,
“ you men can understand , so listen to me .
he pays us back for what we have done .
the truth is that god does no wrong .
no one chose god to be in charge of the earth .
if god decided to take away his spirit
then everything on earth would die .
“ if you men are wise ,
can someone be a ruler if he hates justice ?
god is the one who says to kings , ‘ you are worthless ! ’
he does not respect leaders more than other people .
any of us can die suddenly , in the middle of the night .
“ god watches what people do .
there is no place dark enough
god does not need to set a time
he does not have to ask questions when people do wrong ,
when he learns what people have done ,
he will punish them for the evil they have done ,
he will do this because they rebelled against him
they hurt the poor and made them cry to god for help .
but if god decides not to help them ,
he keeps the wicked from ruling
“ a person should say to god ,
show me the sins i am not able to see .
job , you want god to reward you ,
a wise person would listen to me .
‘ job talks like an ignorant person .
i think job should be punished even more ,
he adds rebellion to his other sins .
elihu continued talking and said ,
“ job , it is not fair for you to say ,
because you also ask him ,
“ job , i want to answer you and your friends here with you .
look up at the sky .
if you sin , it does not hurt god .
and if you are good , that does not help god .
job , the good and bad things you do
“ if people are being hurt , they cry out
but they forget to say , ‘ where is god , the one who made me ?
he is the one who makes us smarter than any animal on earth
“ or if evil people ask god for help , he will not answer them ,
god will not listen to their worthless begging .
so , job , god will not listen to you
“ job thinks that god does not punish evil
so he continues his worthless talking .
elihu continued talking and said ,
“ be patient with me a little longer .
i will share my knowledge with everyone .
job , i am telling the truth .
“ god is very powerful , but he does not hate people .
he will not let evil people live .
he watches over those who live right .
so if people are punished ,
and god will tell them what they did ,
he will force them to listen to his warning .
if they serve and obey him , he will make them successful
but if they refuse to obey him , they will be destroyed .
“ people who don ’ t care about god are always bitter .
they will die while they are still young ,
god saves those who suffer by using their suffering .
“ in fact , god wants to help you out of your troubles .
but you are full of this talk about guilt , judgment , and justice !
job , don ’ t let your anger fill you with doubt about god .
do you think your wealth will keep you out of trouble ?
don ’ t be like those who wish darkness would come and hide them .
job , don ’ t let your suffering cause you to choose evil .
“ look , god ’ s power makes him great !
no one can tell him what to do .
remember to praise him for what he has done ,
everyone can see what he has done ,
yes , god is great , but we can not understand his greatness .
“ god takes up water from the earth
so the clouds pour out the water ,
no one can understand how he spreads the clouds out
look , he spreads lightning all over the sky
he uses them to control the nations
he grabs the lightning with his hands ,
the thunder warns that a storm is coming .
“ the thunder and lightning frighten me ;
listen to god ’ s thundering voice !
he sends his lightning to flash across the whole sky .
after the flashes of lightning you can hear his roaring voice .
god ’ s thundering voice is amazing !
he says to the snow ,
god does this to stop everyone ’ s work
the animals run into their dens and stay there .
whirlwinds come from the south .
god ’ s breath makes ice
he fills the clouds with water
he orders the clouds to be blown all around the earth .
he causes the clouds to punish people with floods
“ job , stop for a minute and listen .
do you know how god controls the clouds ?
do you know how the clouds hang in the sky ?
all you know is that you sweat , your clothes stick to you ,
can you help god spread out the sky
“ job , tell us what we should say to god !
i would not tell god that i wanted to talk to him .
a person can not look at the sun .
in the same way god ’ s golden glory shines from the holy mountain .
we have seen that god all-powerful really is all powerful !
that is why people fear and respect him .
then the lord spoke to job from a whirlwind and said ,
“ who is this ignorant person
prepare yourself for an attack !
“ where were you when i made the earth ?
and who decided how big the earth should be ?
what is the earth resting on ?
when the morning stars sang together
“ who closed the flood gates
who covered it with clouds
i set the limits for the sea
i said to the sea , ‘ you can come this far , but no farther .
“ did you ever in your life command the morning to begin
did you ever tell the morning light to grab the earth
the morning light makes the hills
evil people don ’ t like the daylight .
“ have you ever gone to the deepest parts of the sea ?
has anyone shown you the gates to the world of the dead ?
do you really understand how big the earth is ?
“ where does light come from ?
can you take them back to where they belong ?
surely you know these things , since you are so old and wise .
“ have you ever gone into the storerooms
i save them there for times of trouble ,
have you ever gone to the place where the sun comes up ,
who dug ditches in the sky for the heavy rain ?
who makes it rain even in desert places
the rain gives that dry empty land all the water it needs ,
does the rain have a father ?
does ice have a mother ?
that ’ s when the water freezes as hard as a rock .
“ can you tie up the pleiades ?
can you bring out the other constellations at the right times ?
do you know the laws that control the sky ?
“ can you shout at the clouds
can you give a command to the lightning ?
“ who makes people wise ?
who is wise enough to count the clouds
the rain makes the dust become mud ,
“ do you find food for the lions ?
no , they hide in their caves
who feeds the ravens when their babies cry out to god
“ do you know when the mountain goats are born ?
do you know how many months they must carry their babies ?
these animals lie down , they feel their birth pains ,
their babies grow strong out in the wild .
“ who let the wild donkeys go free ?
i let the wild donkey have the desert for a home .
they are happy to be away from the noise of the city .
they live in the mountains .
“ will a wild bull agree to serve you ?
will he let you put ropes on him
a wild bull is very strong ,
can you trust him to gather your grain
“ an ostrich gets excited and flaps its wings , but it can not fly .
an ostrich lays her eggs on the ground
the ostrich forgets that someone might step on her eggs
an ostrich leaves her little babies .
that ’ s because i did not give wisdom to the ostrich .
but when the ostrich gets up to run , she laughs at the horse and its rider ,
“ did you give the horse its strength ?
did you make it able to jump like a locust
a horse is happy to be so strong .
it laughs at fear ; nothing makes it afraid !
the soldier ’ s quiver shakes on the horse ’ s side .
the horse gets very excited and races over the ground .
when the trumpet sounds , it snorts , ‘ hurray ! ’
“ did you teach the hawk how to spread its wings and fly south ?
are you the one who told the eagle to fly high into the sky ?
it lives high on a peak at the top of a cliff .
from there it looks far into the distance ,
the eagles gather around dead bodies ,
then the lord said to job ,
“ you wanted to argue with god all-powerful .
then job answered the lord :
“ i am not worthy to speak !
i spoke once , but i will not speak again .
then the lord spoke to job again from the storm :
“ are you trying to show that i am unfair ?
are your arms as strong as mine ?
if so , you can be proud
if you are as powerful as god , then show your anger !
yes , just look at the proud and make them humble .
bury them all in the dirt .
if you can do any of these things , then even i will praise you .
“ look at the behemoth .
but he has great strength in his body .
his tail stands strong like a cedar tree .
his bones are as strong as bronze .
the behemoth is the most amazing animal i made ,
he eats the grass that grows on the hills
he lies under the lotus plants .
the lotus plants hide him in their shade .
if the river floods , the behemoth will not run away .
no one can blind his eyes and capture him .
“ can you catch leviathan with a fishhook ?
can you put a rope through his nose
will he beg you to let him go free ?
will he make an agreement with you
will you play with leviathan as you would play with a bird ?
will fishermen try to buy him from you ?
can you throw spears into his skin or head ?
“ if you ever lay a hand on leviathan , you will never do it again !
do you think you can defeat him ?
no one is brave enough to wake him up
i owe nothing to anyone .
“ i will tell you about leviathan ’ s legs ,
no one can pierce his skin .
no one can force him to open his jaws .
his back has rows of shields
they are so close to each other
the shields are joined to each other .
when leviathan sneezes , it is like lightning flashing out .
burning torches come from his mouth .
smoke pours from his nose
his breath sets coals on fire ,
his neck is very powerful .
there is no soft spot in his skin .
his heart is like a rock ; he has no fear .
when he gets up , even the strongest people are afraid .
swords , spears , and darts only bounce off when they hit him .
he breaks iron as easily as straw .
arrows don ’ t make him run away .
when a wood club hits him , it feels to him like a piece of straw .
the skin on his belly is like sharp pieces of broken pottery .
he stirs up the water like a boiling pot .
when he swims , he leaves a sparkling path behind him .
no animal on earth is like him .
he looks down on the proudest of creatures .
then job answered the lord :
“ i know you can do everything .
you asked , ‘ who is this ignorant person saying these foolish things ? ’
“ you said to me , ‘ listen , and i will speak .
in the past i heard about you ,
and i am ashamed of myself .
so eliphaz from teman , bildad from shuah , and zophar from naamah obeyed the lord . then the lord answered job ’ s prayer .
job prayed for his friends , and the lord made job successful again . the lord gave him twice as much as he had before .
the lord blessed job with even more than he had in the beginning . job got 14,000 sheep , 6000 camels , 2000 oxen , and 1000 female donkeys .
he also got seven sons and three daughters .
he named the first daughter jemimah and the second daughter keziah . he named the third daughter keren happuch .
so job lived for 140 years more . he lived to see his children , his grandchildren , his great-grandchildren , and his great-great-grandchildren .
job lived to be a very old man who had lived a good , long life .
joel son of pethuel received this message from the lord :
leaders , listen to this message !
you will tell these things to your children ,
what the cutting locust has left ,
drunks , wake up and cry !
a powerful nation came to attack my land .
it destroyed my grapevine .
cry like a young woman crying
priests , servants of the lord , cry
the fields are ruined .
be sad , farmers !
the vines have become dry ,
priests , put on sackcloth and cry loudly .
be sad because the lord ’ s special day is near . at that time punishment will come like an attack from god all-powerful .
our food is gone . joy and happiness are gone from the temple of our god .
the animals are hungry and groaning . the herds of cattle wander around confused because they have no grass to eat . the sheep are dying .
lord , i am calling to you for help . fire has changed our green fields into a desert . flames have burned all the trees in the field .
wild animals also need your help . the streams are dry—there is no water ! fire has changed our green fields into a desert .
blow the trumpet on zion .
it will be a dark , gloomy day .
the army will destroy the land like a burning fire .
they look like horses .
before this army , people shake with fear .
the soldiers run fast .
they don ’ t trip each other .
they run to the city .
before them , earth and sky shake .
the lord calls loudly to his army .
this is the lord ’ s message :
who knows , maybe he will change his mind
blow the trumpet at zion .
bring the people together .
let the priests , the lord ’ s servants ,
then the lord cared very much about his land .
the lord spoke to his people .
no , i will force the people from the north to leave your land
land , don ’ t be afraid .
animals of the field , don ’ t be afraid .
so be happy , people of zion .
the threshing floors will be filled with wheat ,
“ i , the lord , sent my army against you .
then you will have plenty to eat .
you will know that i am with israel .
in those days i will pour out my spirit
i will work wonders in the sky and on the earth .
the sun will be changed into darkness ,
and everyone who trusts in the lord will be saved .
“ yes , at that time i will bring back the people of judah and jerusalem from captivity .
they threw lots for my people . they sold boys to buy a prostitute , and they sold girls to buy wine to drink .
you took my silver and gold . you took my precious treasures and put them in your temples .
“ you sold the people of judah and jerusalem to the greeks . that way you could take them far from their land .
you sent my people to that faraway place , but i will bring them back . and i will punish you for what you did .
i will sell your sons and daughters to the people of judah . then they will sell them to the faraway sabeans. ” this is what the lord said .
announce this among the nations :
beat your plows into swords .
all you nations , hurry !
wake up , nations !
there are many , many people in the valley of decision .
the sun and the moon will become dark .
the lord god will shout from zion .
“ then you will know that i am the lord your god .
“ on that day the mountains will drip with sweet wine .
egypt will be empty .
but there will always be people living in judah .
those people killed my people ,
before the world began , the word was there . the word was with god , and the word was god .
he was there with god in the beginning .
everything was made through him , and nothing was made without him .
in him there was life , and that life was a light for the people of the world .
the light shines in the darkness , and the darkness has not defeated it .
there was a man named john , who was sent by god .
he came to tell people about the light . through him all people could hear about the light and believe .
john was not the light . but he came to tell people about the light .
the true light was coming into the world . this is the true light that gives light to all people .
the word was already in the world . the world was made through him , but the world did not know him .
he came to the world that was his own . and his own people did not accept him .
but some people did accept him . they believed in him , and he gave them the right to become children of god .
yes , the word was full of grace and truth , and from him we all received one blessing after another .
that is , the law was given to us through moses , but grace and truth came through jesus christ .
the jewish leaders in jerusalem sent some priests and levites to john to ask him , “ who are you ? ” he told them the truth .
without any hesitation he said openly and plainly , “ i am not the messiah . ”
they asked him , “ then who are you ? are you elijah ? ”
john told them the words of the prophet isaiah :
these jews were sent from the pharisees .
john answered , “ i baptize people with water . but there is someone here with you that you don ’ t know .
he is the one who is coming later . i am not good enough to be the slave who unties the strings on his sandals . ”
these things all happened at bethany on the other side of the jordan river . this is where john was baptizing people .
the next day john saw jesus coming toward him and said , “ look , the lamb of god . he takes away the sins of the world !
i did not know who he was . but i came baptizing people with water so that israel could know that he is the messiah . ”
the next day john was there again and had two of his followers with him .
he saw jesus walking by and said , “ look , the lamb of god ! ”
the two followers heard him say this , so they followed jesus .
jesus turned and saw the two men following him . he asked , “ what do you want ? ”
these men followed jesus after they had heard about him from john . one of them was andrew , the brother of simon peter .
the next day jesus decided to go to galilee . he met philip and said to him , “ follow me . ”
philip was from the town of bethsaida , the same as andrew and peter .
but nathanael said to philip , “ nazareth ! can anything good come from nazareth ? ”
jesus saw nathanael coming toward him and said , “ this man coming is a true israelite , one you can trust . ”
nathanael asked , “ how do you know me ? ”
then nathanael said , “ teacher , you are the son of god . you are the king of israel . ”
two days later there was a wedding in the town of cana in galilee , and jesus ’ mother was there .
jesus and his followers were also invited .
at the wedding there was not enough wine , so jesus ’ mother said to him , “ they have no more wine . ”
jesus answered , “ dear woman , why are you telling me this ? it is not yet time for me to begin my work . ”
his mother said to the servants , “ do what he tells you . ”
there were six large stone waterpots there that were used by the jews in their washing ceremonies . each one held about 20 or 30 gallons .
jesus said to the servants , “ fill the waterpots with water. ” so they filled them to the top .
then he said to them , “ now dip out some water and take it to the man in charge of the feast . ”
then jesus went to the town of capernaum . his mother and brothers and his followers went with him . they all stayed there a few days .
it was almost time for the jewish passover , so jesus went to jerusalem .
when this happened , his followers remembered what was written in the scriptures :
some jews said to jesus , “ show us a miracle as a sign from god . prove that you have the right to do these things . ”
jesus answered , “ destroy this temple and i will build it again in three days . ”
they answered , “ people worked 46 years to build this temple ! do you really believe you can build it again in three days ? ”
but the temple jesus meant was his own body .
after he was raised from death , his followers remembered that he had said this . so they believed the scriptures , and they believed the words jesus said .
jesus was in jerusalem for the passover festival . many people believed in him because they saw the miraculous signs he did .
but jesus did not trust them , because he knew how all people think .
he did not need anyone to tell him what a person was like . he already knew .
there was a man named nicodemus , one of the pharisees . he was an important jewish leader .
jesus answered , “ i assure you , everyone must be born again . anyone who is not born again can not be in god ’ s kingdom . ”
the only life people get from their human parents is physical . but the new life that the spirit gives a person is spiritual .
don ’ t be surprised that i told you , ‘ you must be born again . ’
nicodemus asked , “ how is all this possible ? ”
jesus said , “ you are an important teacher of israel , and you still don ’ t understand these things ?
the only one who has ever gone up to heaven is the one who came down from heaven—the son of man .
“ moses lifted up the snake in the desert . it is the same with the son of man . he must be lifted up too .
then everyone who believes in him can have eternal life . ”
god sent his son into the world . he did not send him to judge the world guilty , but to save the world through him .
everyone who does evil hates the light . they will not come to the light , because the light will show all the bad things they have done .
but anyone who follows the true way comes to the light . then the light will show that whatever they have done was done through god .
after this , jesus and his followers went into the area of judea . there he stayed with his followers and baptized people .
john was also baptizing people in aenon , a place near salim with plenty of water . people were going there to be baptized .
this was before john was put in prison .
some of john ’ s followers had an argument with another jew about religious washing .
john answered , “ a person can receive only what god gives .
you yourselves heard me say , ‘ i am not the messiah . i am only the one god sent to prepare the way for him . ’
he must become more and more important , and i must become less important .
he tells what he has seen and heard , but people don ’ t accept what he says .
whoever accepts what he says has given proof that god speaks the truth .
god sent him , and he tells people what god says . god gives him the spirit fully .
the father loves the son and has given him power over everything .
jesus learned that the pharisees had heard the report that he was making and baptizing more followers than john .
( but really , jesus himself did not baptize anyone ; his followers baptized people for him . )
so he left judea and went back to galilee .
on the way to galilee , he had to go through the country of samaria .
in samaria jesus came to the town called sychar , which is near the field that jacob gave to his son joseph .
jacob ’ s well was there . jesus was tired from his long trip , so he sat down beside the well . it was about noon .
a samaritan woman came to the well to get some water , and jesus said to her , “ please give me a drink . ”
this happened while his followers were in town buying some food .
the woman said , “ sir , where will you get that living water ? the well is very deep , and you have nothing to get water with .
jesus answered , “ everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again .
jesus told her , “ go get your husband and come back . ”
the woman answered , “ but i have no husband . ”
that ’ s because , although you have had five husbands , the man you live with now is not your husband . that much was the truth . ”
the woman said , “ sir , i can see that you are a prophet .
our fathers worshiped on this mountain . but you jews say that jerusalem is the place where people must worship . ”
you samaritans worship something you don ’ t understand . we jews understand what we worship , since salvation comes from the jews .
god is spirit . so the people who worship him must worship in spirit and truth . ”
then jesus said , “ he is talking to you now—i am the messiah . ”
then the woman left her water jar and went back to town . she told the people there ,
“ a man told me everything i have ever done . come see him . maybe he is the messiah . ”
so the people left the town and went to see jesus .
while the woman was in town , jesus ’ followers were begging him , “ teacher , eat something ! ”
but jesus answered , “ i have food to eat that you know nothing about . ”
so the followers asked themselves , “ did someone already bring him some food ? ”
it is true when we say , ‘ one person plants , but another person harvests the crop . ’
i sent you to harvest a crop that you did not work for . others did the work , and you get the profit from their work . ”
the samaritans went to jesus . they begged him to stay with them . so he stayed there two days .
many more people became believers because of the things he said .
two days later jesus left and went to galilee .
( jesus had said before that a prophet is not respected in his own country . )
when he arrived in galilee , the people there welcomed him . they had been at the passover festival in jerusalem and had seen everything he did there .
jesus said to him , “ you people must see miraculous signs and wonders before you will believe in me . ”
the king ’ s official said , “ sir , come before my little son dies . ”
jesus answered , “ go . your son will live . ”
on the way home , the man ’ s servants came and met him . they said , “ your son is well . ”
the man asked , “ what time did my son begin to get well ? ”
that was the second miraculous sign that jesus did after coming from judea to galilee .
later , jesus went to jerusalem for a special jewish festival .
in jerusalem there is a pool with five covered porches . in aramaic it is called bethzatha . this pool is near the sheep gate .
many sick people were lying on the porches beside the pool . some of them were blind , some were crippled , and some were paralyzed .
one of the men lying there had been sick for 38 years .
then jesus said , “ stand up ! pick up your mat and walk . ”
immediately the man was well . he picked up his mat and started walking .
but he answered , “ the man who made me well told me , ‘ pick up your mat and walk . ’ ”
they asked him , “ who is the man who told you to pick up your mat and walk ? ”
but the man who had been healed did not know who it was . there were many people there , and jesus had left .
then the man left and went back to the jews who questioned him . he told them that jesus was the one who made him well .
jesus was doing all this on the sabbath day . so these jews began trying to make him stop .
but he said to them , “ my father never stops working , and so i work too . ”
the father raises the dead and gives them life . in the same way , the son gives life to those he wants to .
“ also , the father judges no one . he has given the son power to do all the judging .
life comes from the father himself . so the father has also allowed the son to give life .
and the father has given him the power to judge all people because he is the son of man .
“ don ’ t be surprised at this . a time is coming when all people who are dead and in their graves will hear his voice .
“ if i tell people about myself , they can not be sure that what i say is true .
but there is someone else who tells people about me , and i know that what he says about me is true .
“ you sent men to john , and he told you what is true .
i don ’ t need anyone to tell people about me , but i remind you of what john said so that you can be saved .
john was like a lamp that burned and gave light , and you were happy to enjoy his light for a while .
and the father who sent me has given proof about me himself . but you have never heard his voice . you have never seen what he looks like .
the father ’ s teaching does not live in you , because you don ’ t believe in the one the father sent .
you carefully study the scriptures . you think that they give you eternal life . these same scriptures tell about me !
but you refuse to come to me to have that life .
“ i don ’ t want praise from you or any other human .
but i know you—i know that you have no love for god .
you like to have praise from each other . but you never try to get the praise that comes from the only god . so how can you believe ?
if you really believed moses , you would believe me , because he wrote about me .
but you don ’ t believe what he wrote , so you can ’ t believe what i say . ”
later , jesus went across lake galilee ( also known as lake tiberias ) .
a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the miraculous signs he did in healing the sick .
jesus went up on the side of the hill and sat there with his followers .
it was almost the time for the jewish passover festival .
he asked philip this question to test him . jesus already knew what he planned to do .
philip answered , “ we would all have to work a month to buy enough bread for each person here to have only a little piece ! ”
another follower there was andrew , the brother of simon peter . andrew said ,
“ here is a boy with five loaves of barley bread and two little fish . but that is not enough for so many people . ”
jesus said , “ tell everyone to sit down. ” this was a place with a lot of grass , and about 5000 men sat down there .
the people saw this miraculous sign that jesus did and said , “ he must be the prophet who is coming into the world . ”
jesus knew that the people planned to come get him and make him their king . so he left and went into the hills alone .
that evening jesus ’ followers went down to the lake .
it was dark now , and jesus had not yet come back to them . they got into a boat and started going across the lake to capernaum .
the wind was blowing very hard . the waves on the lake were becoming bigger .
but he said to them , “ don ’ t be afraid . it ’ s me . ”
when he said this , they were glad to take him into the boat . and then the boat reached the shore at the place they wanted to go .
the people saw that jesus and his followers were not there now . so they got into the boats and went to capernaum to find jesus .
the people found jesus on the other side of the lake . they asked him , “ teacher , when did you come here ? ”
the people asked jesus , “ what does god want us to do ? ”
jesus answered , “ the work god wants you to do is this : to believe in the one he sent . ”
our ancestors were given manna to eat in the desert . as the scriptures say , ‘ he gave them bread from heaven to eat . ’ ”
god ’ s bread is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world . ”
the people said , “ sir , from now on give us bread like that . ”
i told you before that you have seen me , and still you don ’ t believe .
the father gives me my people . every one of them will come to me . i will always accept them .
i came down from heaven to do what god wants , not what i want .
some jews began to complain about jesus because he said , “ i am the bread that comes down from heaven . ”
but jesus said , “ stop complaining to each other .
“ i can assure you that anyone who believes has eternal life .
i am the bread that gives life .
your ancestors ate the manna god gave them in the desert , but it didn ’ t keep them from dying .
here is the bread that comes down from heaven . whoever eats this bread will never die .
then the jews began to argue among themselves . they said , “ how can this man give us his body to eat ? ”
those who eat my body and drink my blood have eternal life . i will raise them up on the last day .
my body is true food , and my blood is true drink .
those who eat my body and drink my blood live in me , and i live in them .
“ the father sent me . he lives , and i live because of him . so everyone who eats me will live because of me .
jesus said all this while he was teaching in the synagogue in the city of capernaum .
when jesus ’ followers heard this , many of them said , “ this teaching is hard . who can accept it ? ”
jesus already knew that his followers were complaining about this . so he said , “ is this teaching a problem for you ?
then what will you think when you see the son of man going up to where he came from ?
jesus said , “ that is why i said , ‘ anyone the father does not help to come to me can not come . ’ ”
after jesus said these things , many of his followers left and stopped following him .
jesus asked the twelve apostles , “ do you want to leave too ? ”
simon peter answered him , “ lord , where would we go ? you have the words that give eternal life .
we believe in you . we know that you are the holy one from god . ”
then jesus answered , “ i chose all twelve of you . but one of you is a devil . ”
after this , jesus traveled around the country of galilee . he did not want to travel in judea , because the jewish leaders there wanted to kill him .
it was time for the jewish festival of shelters .
jesus ’ brothers said this because even they did not believe in him .
jesus said to them , “ the right time for me has not yet come , but any time is right for you to go .
the world can not hate you . but the world hates me , because i tell the people in the world that they do evil things .
so you go to the festival . i will not go now , because the right time for me has not yet come . ”
after jesus said this , he stayed in galilee .
so his brothers left to go to the festival . after they left , jesus went too , but he did not let people see him .
at the festival the jewish leaders were looking for him . they said , “ where is that man ? ”
but no one was brave enough to talk about him openly . they were afraid of the jewish leaders .
when the festival was about half finished , jesus went to the temple area and began to teach .
the jewish leaders were amazed and said , “ how did this man learn so much ? he never had the kind of teaching we had ! ”
jesus answered , “ what i teach is not my own . my teaching comes from the one who sent me .
people who really want to do what god wants will know that my teaching comes from god . they will know that this teaching is not my own .
the people answered , “ a demon is making you crazy ! we are not trying to kill you . ”
jesus said to them , “ i did one miracle on a sabbath day , and you were all surprised .
stop judging by the way things look . be fair and judge by what is really right . ”
then some of the people who lived in jerusalem said , “ this is the man they are trying to kill .
but when the real messiah comes , no one will know where he comes from . and we know where this man ’ s home is . ”
i know him because i am from him . he is the one who sent me . ”
the pharisees heard what the people were saying about jesus . so the leading priests and the pharisees sent some temple police to arrest him .
then jesus said , “ i will be with you a little while longer . then i will go back to the one who sent me .
you will look for me , but you will not find me . and you can not come where i am . ”
if anyone believes in me , rivers of living water will flow out from their heart . that is what the scriptures say . ”
when the people heard the things that jesus said , some of them said , “ this man really is the prophet . ”
other people said , “ he is the messiah . ”
so the people did not agree with each other about jesus .
some of the people wanted to arrest him . but no one tried to do it .
the temple police went back to the leading priests and the pharisees . the priests and the pharisees asked , “ why didn ’ t you bring jesus ? ”
the temple police answered , “ we have never heard anyone say such amazing things ! ”
the pharisees answered , “ so he has fooled you too !
you don ’ t see any of the leaders or any of us pharisees believing in him , do you ?
but those people out there know nothing about the law . they are under god ’ s curse ! ”
but nicodemus was there in that group . he was the one who had gone to see jesus before . he said ,
“ our law will not let us judge anyone without first hearing them and finding out what they have done . ”
the jewish leaders answered , “ you must be from galilee too ! study the scriptures . you will find nothing about a prophet coming from galilee . ”
then they all left and went home .
jesus went to the mount of olives .
early in the morning he went back to the temple area . the people all came to him , and he sat and taught them .
they said to jesus , “ teacher , this woman was caught in the act of adultery .
the law of moses commands us to stone to death any such woman . what do you say we should do ? ”
then jesus stooped down again and wrote on the ground .
he looked up again and said to her , “ where did they all go ? did no one judge you guilty ? ”
she answered , “ no one , sir . ”
you judge me the way people judge other people . i don ’ t judge anyone .
but if i judge , my judging is true , because when i judge i am not alone . the father who sent me is with me .
your own law says that when two witnesses say the same thing , you must accept what they say .
i am one of the witnesses who speaks about myself . and the father who sent me is my other witness . ”
the people asked , “ where is your father ? ”
they asked , “ then who are you ? ”
they did not understand who he was talking about . he was telling them about the father .
the one who sent me is with me . i always do what pleases him . so he has not left me alone . ”
while he was saying these things , many people believed in him .
so jesus said to the jews who believed in him , “ if you continue to accept and obey my teaching , you are really my followers .
you will know the truth , and the truth will make you free . ”
they answered , “ we are abraham ’ s descendants . and we have never been slaves . so why do you say that we will be free ? ”
jesus said , “ the truth is , everyone who sins is a slave—a slave to sin .
a slave does not stay with a family forever . but a son belongs to the family forever .
so if the son makes you free , you are really free .
i know you are abraham ’ s descendants . but you want to kill me , because you don ’ t want to accept my teaching .
i am telling you what my father has shown me . but you do what your father has told you . ”
they said , “ our father is abraham . ”
i am someone who has told you the truth i heard from god . but you are trying to kill me . abraham did nothing like that .
so you are doing what your own father did . ”
you don ’ t understand the things i say , because you can not accept my teaching .
“ i am telling you the truth , and that ’ s why you don ’ t believe me .
can any of you prove that i am guilty of sin ? if i tell the truth , why don ’ t you believe me ?
whoever belongs to god accepts what he says . but you don ’ t accept what god says , because you don ’ t belong to god . ”
jesus answered , “ i have no demon in me . i give honor to my father , but you give no honor to me .
i am not trying to get honor for myself . there is one who wants this honor for me . he is the judge .
i promise you , whoever continues to obey my teaching will never die . ”
do you think you are greater than our father abraham ? he died , and so did the prophets . who do you think you are ? ”
your father abraham was very happy that he would see the day when i came . he saw that day and was happy . ”
the jews said to jesus , “ what ? how can you say you have seen abraham ? you are not even 50 years old ! ”
jesus answered , “ the fact is , before abraham was born , i am . ”
when he said this , they picked up stones to throw at him . but jesus hid , and then he left the temple area .
while jesus was walking , he saw a man who had been blind since the time he was born .
while i am in the world , i am the light of the world . ”
after jesus said this , he spit on the dirt , made some mud and put it on the man ’ s eyes .
his neighbors and some others who had seen him begging said , “ look ! is this the same man who always sits and begs ? ”
they asked , “ what happened ? how did you get your sight ? ”
they asked him , “ where is this man ? ”
then the people brought the man to the pharisees .
the day jesus had made mud and healed the man ’ s eyes was a sabbath day .
so the pharisees asked the man , “ how did you get your sight ? ”
some of the pharisees said , “ that man does not obey the law about the sabbath day . so he is not from god . ”
they asked the man again , “ since it was your eyes he healed , what do you say about him ? ”
the jewish leaders still did not believe that this really happened to the man—that he was blind and was now healed . but later they sent for his parents .
they asked them , “ is this your son ? you say he was born blind . so how can he see ? ”
his parents answered , “ we know that this man is our son . and we know that he was born blind .
that is why his parents said , “ he is old enough . ask him . ”
they asked , “ what did he do to you ? how did he heal your eyes ? ”
at this they shouted insults at him and said , “ you are his follower , not us ! we are followers of moses .
we know that god spoke to moses . but we don ’ t even know where this man comes from ! ”
the man answered , “ this is really strange ! you don ’ t know where he comes from , but he healed my eyes .
we all know that god does not listen to sinners , but he will listen to anyone who worships and obeys him .
this is the first time we have ever heard of anyone healing the eyes of someone born blind .
this man must be from god . if he were not from god , he could not do anything like this . ”
when jesus heard that they had forced the man to leave , he found him and asked him , “ do you believe in the son of man ? ”
the man said , “ tell me who he is , sir , so i can believe in him . ”
jesus said to him , “ you have already seen him . the son of man is the one talking with you now . ”
the man answered , “ yes , i believe , lord ! ” then he bowed and worshiped jesus .
some of the pharisees were near jesus . they heard him say this . they asked , “ what ? are you saying that we are blind too ? ”
but the man who takes care of the sheep enters through the gate . he is the shepherd .
he brings all of his sheep out . then he goes ahead of them and leads them . the sheep follow him , because they know his voice .
but sheep will never follow someone they don ’ t know . they will run away from him , because they don ’ t know his voice . ”
jesus told the people this story , but they did not understand what it meant .
so jesus said again , “ i assure you , i am the gate for the sheep .
all those who came before me were thieves and robbers . the sheep did not listen to them .
a thief comes to steal , kill , and destroy . but i came to give life—life that is full and good .
“ i am the good shepherd , and the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep .
the man runs away because he is only a paid worker . he does not really care for the sheep .
the father loves me because i give my life . i give my life so that i can get it back again .
again the jews were divided over what jesus was saying .
many of them said , “ a demon has come into him and made him crazy . why listen to him ? ”
it was winter , and the time came for the festival of dedication at jerusalem .
jesus was in the temple area at solomon ’ s porch .
but you do not believe , because you are not my sheep .
my sheep listen to my voice . i know them , and they follow me .
i give my sheep eternal life . they will never die , and no one can take them out of my hand .
my father is the one who gave them to me , and he is greater than all . no one can steal my sheep out of his hand .
the father and i are one . ”
again the jews there picked up stones to kill jesus .
jesus answered , “ it is written in your law that god said , ‘ i said you are gods . ’
this scripture called those people gods—the people who received god ’ s message . and scripture is always true .
if i don ’ t do what my father does , then don ’ t believe what i say .
they tried to get jesus again , but he escaped from them .
then he went back across the jordan river to the place where john began his work of baptizing people . jesus stayed there ,
and many people came to him . they said , “ john never did any miraculous signs , but everything john said about this man is true . ”
and many people there believed in jesus .
there was a man named lazarus who was sick . he lived in the town of bethany , where mary and her sister martha lived .
so mary and martha sent someone to tell jesus , “ lord , your dear friend lazarus is sick . ”
jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus .
so when he heard that lazarus was sick , he stayed where he was two more days
and then said to his followers , “ we should go back to judea . ”
but whoever walks at night will stumble because there is no light . ”
then jesus said , “ our friend lazarus is now sleeping , but i am going there to wake him . ”
the followers answered , “ but , lord , if he can sleep , he will get well . ”
they thought jesus meant that lazarus was literally sleeping , but he really meant that lazarus was dead .
so then jesus said plainly , “ lazarus is dead .
and i am glad i was not there . i am happy for you because now you will believe in me . we will go to him now . ”
then thomas , the one called “ twin , ” said to the other followers , “ we will go too . we will die there with jesus . ”
jesus arrived in bethany and found that lazarus had already been dead and in the tomb for four days .
bethany was about two miles from jerusalem .
many jews had come to see martha and mary . they came to comfort them about their brother lazarus .
when martha heard that jesus was coming , she went out to greet him . but mary stayed home .
martha said to jesus , “ lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died .
but i know that even now god will give you anything you ask . ”
jesus said , “ your brother will rise and be alive again . ”
martha answered , “ i know that he will rise to live again at the time of the resurrection on the last day . ”
jesus said to her , “ i am the resurrection . i am life . everyone who believes in me will have life , even if they die .
and everyone who lives and believes in me will never really die . martha , do you believe this ? ”
when mary heard this , she stood up and went quickly to jesus .
he had not yet come into the village . he was still at the place where martha met him .
when jesus saw mary crying and the people with her crying too , he was very upset and deeply troubled .
he asked , “ where did you put him ? ”
and the jews said , “ look ! he loved lazarus very much ! ”
but some of them said , “ jesus healed the eyes of the blind man . why didn ’ t he help lazarus and stop him from dying ? ”
again feeling very upset , jesus came to the tomb . it was a cave with a large stone covering the entrance .
he said , “ move the stone away . ”
then jesus said to her , “ remember what i told you ? i said that if you believed , you would see god ’ s divine greatness . ”
so they moved the stone away from the entrance . then jesus looked up and said , “ father , i thank you that you heard me .
after jesus said this he called in a loud voice , “ lazarus , come out ! ”
the dead man came out . his hands and feet were wrapped with pieces of cloth . he had a handkerchief covering his face .
there were many jews who came to visit mary . when they saw what jesus did , many of them believed in him .
but some of them went to the pharisees and told them what jesus did .
if we let him continue doing these things , everyone will believe in him . then the romans will come and take away our temple and our nation . ”
one of the men there was caiaphas . he was the high priest that year . he said , “ you people know nothing !
it is better for one man to die for the people than for the whole nation to be destroyed . but you don ’ t realize this . ”
caiaphas did not think of this himself . as that year ’ s high priest , he was really prophesying that jesus would die for the jewish people .
that day the jewish leaders began planning to kill jesus .
six days before the passover festival , jesus went to bethany . that is where lazarus lived , the man jesus raised from death .
there they had a dinner for jesus . martha served the food , and lazarus was one of the people eating with jesus .
judas iscariot , one of jesus ’ followers , was there—the one who would later hand jesus over to his enemies . judas said ,
jesus answered , “ don ’ t stop her . it was right for her to save this perfume for today—the day for me to be prepared for burial .
you will always have those who are poor with you . but you will not always have me . ”
so the leading priests made plans to kill lazarus too .
because of him , many jews were leaving them and believing in jesus . that is why they wanted to kill lazarus too .
the next day the people in jerusalem heard that jesus was coming there . these were the crowds of people who had come to the passover festival .
they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet jesus . they shouted ,
jesus found a donkey and rode on it , as the scriptures say ,
“ do not be afraid , people of zion !
that ’ s why so many people went out to meet him—because they had heard about this miraculous sign he did .
so the pharisees said to each other , “ look ! our plan is not working . the people are all following him ! ”
there were some greeks there too . these were some of the people who went to jerusalem to worship at the passover festival .
they went to philip , who was from bethsaida in galilee . they said , “ sir , we want to meet jesus . ”
philip went and told andrew . then andrew and philip went and told jesus .
jesus said to them , “ the time has come for the son of man to receive his glory .
whoever serves me must follow me . my servants must be with me everywhere i am . my father will give honor to anyone who serves me .
father , do what will bring you glory ! ”
the people standing there heard the voice . they said it was thunder .
jesus said , “ that voice was for you and not for me .
now is the time for the world to be judged . now the ruler of this world will be thrown out .
i will be lifted up from the earth . when that happens , i will draw all people to myself . ”
jesus said this to show how he would die .
the people saw all these miraculous signs jesus did , but they still did not believe in him .
this was to give full meaning to what isaiah the prophet said :
this is why the people could not believe . because isaiah also said ,
“ god made the people blind .
isaiah said this because he saw jesus ’ divine greatness . so he spoke about him .
they loved praise from people more than praise from god .
then jesus said loudly , “ everyone who believes in me is really believing in the one who sent me .
everyone who sees me is really seeing the one who sent me .
i came into this world as a light . i came so that everyone who believes in me will not stay in darkness .
that is because what i taught was not from myself . the father who sent me told me what to say and what to teach .
and i know that whatever he says to do will bring eternal life . so the things i say are exactly what the father told me to say . ”
so while they were eating , jesus stood up and took off his robe . he got a towel and wrapped it around his waist .
then he poured water into a bowl and began to wash the followers ’ feet . he dried their feet with the towel that was wrapped around his waist .
he came to simon peter . but peter said to him , “ lord , you should not wash my feet . ”
jesus answered , “ you don ’ t know what i am doing now . but later you will understand . ”
peter said , “ no ! you will never wash my feet . ”
simon peter said , “ lord , after you wash my feet , wash my hands and my head too ! ”
jesus knew who would hand him over to his enemies . that is why he said , “ not all of you are clean . ”
you call me ‘ teacher. ’ and you call me ‘ lord. ’ and this is right , because that is what i am .
i am your lord and teacher . but i washed your feet . so you also should wash each other ’ s feet .
i did this as an example for you . so you should serve each other just as i served you .
believe me , servants are not greater than their master . those who are sent to do something are not greater than the one who sent them .
if you know these things , great blessings will be yours if you do them .
i am telling you this now before it happens . then when it happens , you will believe that i am .
i assure you , whoever accepts the person i send also accepts me . and whoever accepts me also accepts the one who sent me . ”
his followers all looked at each other . they did not understand who jesus was talking about .
one of the followers was next to jesus and was leaning close to him . this was the one jesus loved very much .
simon peter made signs to this follower to ask jesus who he was talking about .
that follower leaned closer to jesus and asked , “ lord , who is it ? ”
when judas took the bread , satan entered him . jesus said to judas , “ what you will do—do it quickly ! ”
no one at the table understood why jesus said this to judas .
judas ate the bread jesus gave him . then he immediately went out . it was night .
if god receives glory through him , he will give glory to the son through himself . and that will happen very soon . ”
“ i give you a new command : love each other . you must love each other just as i loved you .
all people will know that you are my followers if you love each other . ”
simon peter asked jesus , “ lord , where are you going ? ”
peter asked , “ lord , why can ’ t i follow you now ? i am ready to die for you ! ”
jesus said , “ don ’ t be troubled . trust in god , and trust in me .
you know the way to the place where i am going . ”
thomas said , “ lord , we don ’ t know where you are going , so how can we know the way ? ”
jesus answered , “ i am the way , the truth , and the life . the only way to the father is through me .
if you really knew me , you would know my father too . but now you know the father . you have seen him . ”
philip said to him , “ lord , show us the father . that is all we need . ”
believe me when i say that i am in the father and the father is in me . or believe because of the miracles i have done .
and if you ask for anything in my name , i will do it for you . then the father ’ s glory will be shown through the son .
if you ask me for anything in my name , i will do it .
“ if you love me , you will do what i command .
i will ask the father , and he will give you another helper to be with you forever .
“ i will not leave you all alone like orphans . i will come back to you .
in a very short time the people in the world will not see me anymore . but you will see me . you will live because i live .
on that day you will know that i am in the father . you will know that you are in me and i am in you .
then judas ( not judas iscariot ) said , “ lord , how will you make yourself known to us , but not to the world ? ”
“ i have told you all these things while i am with you .
i have told you this now , before it happens . then when it happens , you will believe .
“ i will not talk with you much longer . the ruler of this world is coming . he has no power over me .
but the world must know that i love the father . so i do exactly what the father told me to do .
jesus said , “ i am the true vine , and my father is the gardener .
he cuts off every branch of mine that does not produce fruit . he also trims every branch that produces fruit to prepare it to produce even more .
you have already been prepared to produce more fruit by the teaching i have given you .
show that you are my followers by producing much fruit . this will bring honor to my father .
“ i have loved you as the father has loved me . now continue in my love .
i have told you these things so that you can have the true happiness that i have . i want you to be completely happy .
this is what i command you : love each other as i have loved you .
the greatest love people can show is to die for their friends .
you are my friends if you do what i tell you to do .
this is my command : love each other .
“ if the world hates you , remember that they hated me first .
they will do to you whatever they did to me , because you belong to me . they don ’ t know the one who sent me .
“ whoever hates me also hates my father .
but this happened to make clear the full meaning of what is written in their law : ‘ they hated me for no reason . ’
and you will tell people about me too , because you have been with me from the beginning .
“ i have told you all this so that you won ’ t lose your faith when you face troubles .
they will do this because they have not known the father , and they have not known me .
i have told you all this now to prepare you . so when the time comes for these things to happen , you will remember that i warned you .
now i am going back to the one who sent me . and none of you asks me , ‘ where are you going ? ’
but you are filled with sadness because i have told you all this .
he will prove that they are guilty of sin , because they don ’ t believe in me .
and he will show them how wrong their judgment is , because their leader has already been condemned .
“ i have so much more to tell you , but it is too much for you to accept now .
the spirit of truth will bring glory to me by telling you what he receives from me .
all that the father has is mine . that is why i said that the spirit will tell you what he receives from me .
“ after a short time you won ’ t see me . then after another short time you will see me again . ”
they also asked , “ what does he mean by ‘ a short time ’ ? we don ’ t understand what he is saying . ”
the father himself loves you because you have loved me . and he loves you because you have believed that i came from god .
i came from the father into the world . now i am leaving the world and going back to the father . ”
then his followers said , “ you are already speaking plainly to us . you are not using words that hide the meaning .
jesus said , “ so now you believe ?
you gave the son power over all people so that he could give eternal life to all those you have given to him .
and this is eternal life : that people can know you , the only true god , and that they can know jesus christ , the one you sent .
i finished the work you gave me to do . i brought you glory on earth .
and now , father , give me glory with you . give me the glory i had with you before the world was made .
now they know that everything i have came from you .
i told them the words you gave me , and they accepted them . they realized the fact that i came from you and believed that you sent me .
all i have is yours , and all you have is mine . and my glory is seen in them .
“ i am not asking you to take them out of the world . but i am asking that you keep them safe from the evil one .
they don ’ t belong to the world , just as i don ’ t belong to the world .
make them ready for your service through your truth . your teaching is truth .
i have sent them into the world , just as you sent me into the world .
i am making myself completely ready to serve you . i do this for them , so that they also might be fully qualified for your service .
“ i pray not only for these followers but also for those who will believe in me because of their teaching .
when jesus finished praying , he left with his followers and went across the kidron valley . he went into a garden there , his followers still with him .
judas , the one responsible for handing jesus over , knew where this place was . he knew because jesus often met there with his followers .
jesus already knew everything that would happen to him . so he went out and asked them , “ who are you looking for ? ”
they answered , “ jesus from nazareth . ”
when jesus said , “ i am jesus , ” the men moved back and fell to the ground .
he asked them again , “ who are you looking for ? ”
jesus said , “ i told you that i am jesus . so if you are looking for me , let these other men go free . ”
this was to show the truth of what jesus said earlier : “ i have not lost anyone you gave me . ”
jesus said to peter , “ put your sword back in its place ! i must drink from the cup the father has given me . ”
then the soldiers with their commander and the jewish guards arrested jesus . they tied him
and brought him to annas , the father-in-law of caiaphas . caiaphas was the high priest that year .
he was also the one who had told the other jewish leaders that it would be better if one man died for all the people .
but peter waited outside near the door . the follower who knew the high priest came back outside and spoke to the gatekeeper . then he brought peter inside .
the girl at the gate said to peter , “ are you also one of the followers of that man ? ”
it was cold , so the servants and guards had built a fire . they were standing around it , warming themselves , and peter was standing with them .
the high priest asked jesus questions about his followers and what he taught them .
so why do you question me ? ask the people who heard my teaching . they know what i said . ”
so annas sent jesus to caiaphas the high priest . he was still tied .
but again peter said , “ no , i was not with him ! ” as soon as he said this , a rooster crowed .
so pilate went outside to them and asked , “ what do you say this man has done wrong ? ”
they answered , “ he is a bad man . that is why we brought him to you . ”
pilate said to them , “ you take him yourselves and judge him by your own law . ”
( this was to show the truth of what jesus said about how he would die . )
then pilate went back inside the palace . he called for jesus and asked him , “ are you the king of the jews ? ”
jesus said , “ is that your own question , or did other people tell you about me ? ”
pilate said , “ so you are a king . ”
they shouted back , “ no , not him ! let barabbas go free ! ” ( barabbas was a rebel . )
then pilate ordered that jesus be taken away and whipped .
the soldiers made a crown from thorny branches and put it on his head . then they put a purple robe around him .
they kept coming up to him and saying , “ hail to the king of the jews ! ” and they hit him in the face .
then jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . pilate said to the jews , “ here is the man ! ”
when the leading priests and the jewish guards saw jesus they shouted , “ kill him on a cross ! kill him on a cross ! ”
the jewish leaders answered , “ we have a law that says he must die , because he said he is the son of god . ”
when pilate heard this , he was more afraid .
so he went back inside the palace and asked jesus , “ where are you from ? ” but jesus did not answer him .
pilate said , “ you refuse to speak to me ? remember , i have the power to make you free or to kill you on a cross . ”
it was now almost noon on preparation day of passover week . pilate said to the jews , “ here is your king ! ”
they shouted , “ take him away ! take him away ! kill him on a cross ! ”
so pilate handed jesus over to them to be killed on a cross .
he carried his own cross to a place called “ the place of the skull. ” ( in aramaic the name of this place is “ golgotha . ” )
pilate told them to write a sign and put it on the cross . the sign said , “ jesus of nazareth , the king of the jews . ”
pilate answered , “ i will not change what i have written . ”
jesus ’ mother stood near his cross . her sister was also standing there with mary the wife of clopas , and mary magdalene .
then he said to the follower , “ here is your mother. ” so after that , this follower took jesus ’ mother to live in his home .
later , jesus knew that everything had been done . to make the scriptures come true he said , “ i am thirsty . ”
when he tasted the wine , he said , “ it is finished. ” then he bowed his head and died .
so the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men on the crosses beside jesus .
but when the soldiers came close to jesus , they saw that he was already dead . so they did not break his legs .
but one of the soldiers stuck his spear into jesus ’ side . immediately blood and water came out .
these things happened to give full meaning to the scriptures that said , “ none of his bones will be broken ”
and “ people will look at the one they stabbed . ”
these two men took jesus ’ body and wrapped it in pieces of linen cloth with the spices . ( this is how the jews bury people . )
the men put jesus in that tomb because it was near , and the jews were preparing to start their sabbath day .
so peter and the other follower started going to the tomb .
they were both running , but the other follower ran faster than peter and reached the tomb first .
he bent down and looked in . he saw the pieces of linen cloth lying there , but he did not go in .
then simon peter finally reached the tomb and went in . he saw the pieces of linen lying there .
he also saw the cloth that had been around jesus ’ head . it was folded up and laid in a different place from the pieces of linen .
then the other follower went in—the one who had reached the tomb first . he saw what had happened and believed .
( these followers did not yet understand from the scriptures that jesus must rise from death . )
then the followers went back home .
but mary stood outside the tomb , crying . while she was crying , she bent down and looked inside the tomb .
the angels asked mary , “ woman , why are you crying ? ”
when mary said this , she turned around and saw jesus standing there . but she did not know that it was jesus .
he asked her , “ woman , why are you crying ? who are you looking for ? ”
jesus said to her , “ mary . ”
mary magdalene went to the followers and told them , “ i saw the lord ! ” and she told them what he had said to her .
as soon as he said this , he showed them his hands and his side . when the followers saw the lord , they were very happy .
then he breathed on them and said , “ receive the holy spirit .
thomas ( called didymus ) was one of the twelve , but he was not with the other followers when jesus came .
thomas said to jesus , “ my lord and my god ! ”
jesus said to him , “ you believe because you see me . great blessings belong to the people who believe without seeing me ! ”
jesus did many other miraculous signs that his followers saw , which are not written in this book .
later , jesus appeared again to his followers by lake galilee . this is how it happened :
simon peter said , “ i am going out to fish . ”
early the next morning jesus stood on the shore . but the followers did not know it was jesus .
then he said to them , “ friends , have you caught any fish ? ”
then jesus said , “ bring some of the fish that you caught . ”
jesus walked over to get the bread and gave it to them . he also gave them the fish .
this was now the third time jesus appeared to his followers after he was raised from death .
again jesus said to him , “ simon , son of john , do you love me ? ”
a third time jesus said , “ simon , son of john , do you love me ? ”
( jesus said this to show how peter would die to give glory to god . ) then he said to peter , “ follow me ! ”
when peter saw him behind them , he asked jesus , “ lord , what about him ? ”
jesus answered , “ maybe i want him to live until i come . that should not matter to you . you follow me ! ”
the lord spoke to jonah son of amittai :
then the men said to each other , “ we should throw lots to find out why this is happening to us . ”
jonah said to them , “ i am a hebrew . i worship the lord , the god of heaven , who made the land and the sea . ”
so the men threw jonah into the sea . the storm stopped , and the sea became calm .
when the men saw this , they began to fear and respect the lord . they offered a sacrifice and made special promises to the lord .
while jonah was in the stomach of the fish , he prayed to the lord his god . he said ,
“ i was in very bad trouble .
“ you threw me into the sea .
then i thought , ‘ now i must go where you can not see me , ’
“ the seawater closed over me .
i was at the bottom of the sea ,
“ my soul gave up all hope ,
“ some people worship useless idols ,
i will give sacrifices to you ,
then the lord spoke to the fish , and it vomited jonah out of its stomach onto the dry land .
then the lord spoke to jonah again and said ,
“ go to that big city nineveh , and say what i tell you . ”
so jonah obeyed the lord and went to nineveh . it was a very large city . a person had to walk for three days to travel through it .
jonah went to the center of the city and began speaking to the people . he said , “ after 40 days , nineveh will be destroyed ! ”
the king wrote a special message and sent it throughout the city :
who knows ? maybe god will stop being angry and change his mind , and we will not be punished .
jonah was not happy that god saved the city . jonah became angry .
so now , lord , just kill me . it is better for me to die than to live . ”
then the lord said , “ do you think it is right for you to be angry ? ”
the next morning , god sent a worm to eat part of the plant . the worm began eating the plant , and the plant died .
but god said to jonah , “ do you think it is right for you to be angry just because this plant died ? ”
moses was the lord ’ s servant , and joshua son of nun was moses ’ helper . after moses died , the lord spoke to joshua and said ,
i promised moses that i would give you this land , so i will give you all the land wherever you go .
so joshua gave orders to the leaders of the people :
then joshua said to the tribes of reuben , gad , and half the tribe of manasseh ,
then the people answered joshua , “ we will do whatever you command us to do . we will go wherever you tell us to go .
then anyone who refuses to obey your commands or turns against you will be killed . just be strong and brave ! ”
but someone told the king of jericho , “ last night some men from israel came to look for weaknesses in our country . ”
rahab had hidden the two men , but she said , “ they did come here , but i didn ’ t know where they came from .
the two men were ready to sleep for the night , but rahab went to the roof to talk to them .
rahab ’ s house was built into the city wall , so she used a rope to let the men down through a window .
we are making this agreement with you . but if you tell anyone about what we are doing , we will be free from this agreement . ”
they said to him , “ the lord really has given us all the land . all the people in that country are afraid of us . ”
early the next morning , joshua and all the israelites got up and left acacia . they traveled to the jordan river and camped there before they crossed it .
after three days the leaders went through the camp .
they gave orders to the people : “ when you see the levite priests carrying the box of the agreement of the lord your god , follow them .
then joshua told the people , “ make yourselves pure . tomorrow the lord will do amazing things among us . ”
then joshua said to the israelites , “ come and listen to the words of the lord your god .
the box of the agreement of the lord of the whole world will go before you as you cross the jordan river .
now choose twelve men , one from each of the twelve tribes of israel .
the priests carried the box of the agreement , and the people left the place they had camped . the people started going across the jordan river .
after all the people had crossed the jordan river , the lord said to joshua ,
“ choose twelve men , one from each tribe .
so joshua chose one man from each tribe . then he called the twelve men together .
these rocks will be a sign for you . in the future , your children will ask you , ‘ what do these rocks mean ? ’
after the people finished crossing the river , the priests carried the lord ’ s holy box to the front of the people .
about 40,000 soldiers , prepared for war , passed before the lord . they were marching toward the plains of jericho .
that day the lord made joshua a great man to all the israelites . from that time on , they respected joshua just as they had moses .
then the lord said to joshua ,
“ command the priests carrying the box that holds the agreement to come out of the river . ”
so joshua commanded the priests , “ come out of the jordan river . ”
the people crossed the jordan river on the tenth day of the first month and camped at gilgal , east of jericho .
they carried with them the twelve rocks that they had taken from the jordan river , and joshua set them up at gilgal .
then joshua told the israelites , “ in the future your children will ask you , ‘ what do these rocks mean ? ’
tell them , ‘ these rocks help us remember the way the people of israel crossed the jordan river on dry land . ’
at that time the lord said to joshua , “ make knives from flint rocks and circumcise the men of israel . ”
so joshua made knives from flint rocks and circumcised the men of israel at gibeath haaraloth .
joshua finished circumcising all the men . the people camped at that place until all the men were healed .
the israelites celebrated passover while they were camped at gilgal on the plains of jericho . this was on the evening of the 14th day of the month .
the day after passover , the people ate food that grew in that land . they ate bread made without yeast and roasted grain .
the commander of the lord ’ s army answered , “ take off your sandals . the place where you are standing is holy. ” so joshua obeyed him .
march around the city with your army once every day for six days .
early the next morning joshua got up , and the priests carried the lord ’ s holy box again .
all the things made from silver , gold , bronze , and iron belong to the lord . they must be put in the lord ’ s treasury . ”
at that time joshua made this important promise . he said ,
so the lord was with joshua , and joshua became famous throughout the whole country .
i promise by my life , lord ! there is nothing i can say now . israel has surrendered to the enemy .
the lord said to joshua , “ why are you down there with your face on the ground ? stand up !
early the next morning , joshua led out all the israelites . each tribe came forward to stand before the lord , and he chose the tribe of judah .
achan answered , “ it is true ! i sinned against the lord , the god of israel . this is what i did :
so joshua sent some men to the tent . they ran to the tent and found the things hidden there . the silver was under the coat .
the men brought the things out of the tent and took them to joshua and all the israelites . they threw them on the ground before the lord .
so joshua led his whole army toward ai . then joshua chose 30,000 of his best fighting men and sent them out at night .
then you should come out of your hiding place and take control of the city . the lord your god will give you the power to win .
early the next morning joshua gathered the men together . then joshua and the leaders of israel led the men to ai .
then joshua chose about 5000 men . he sent these men to hide in the area west of the city , between bethel and ai .
joshua and all the men of israel let the army of ai push them back . joshua and his men began running east toward the desert .
the people in the city began to shout and started to chase them . all the people left the city .
all the men of ai and bethel chased the army of israel . the city was left open—no one stayed to protect the city .
but the king of ai was left alive . joshua ’ s men brought him to joshua .
all the people of ai died that day ; there were 12,000 men and women .
the israelites kept the animals and other things from the city for themselves . this is what the lord said they could do when he gave joshua the commands .
then joshua burned the city of ai . that city became an empty pile of rocks . it is still like that today .
then joshua built an altar for the lord , the god of israel . he built the altar on mount ebal .
there joshua copied onto the stones the law moses had written down . this was for all the people of israel to see .
all these kings came together and made plans to fight against joshua and the israelites .
the people from the city of gibeon heard about the way joshua had defeated jericho and ai .
the men put old sandals on their feet and wore old clothes . they found some old bread that was dry and moldy .
then they went to the camp of the israelites . this camp was near gilgal .
the hivite men said to joshua , “ we are your servants . ”
“ look at our bread . when we left home , it was warm and fresh . but now you can see that it is dry and old .
joshua agreed to make peace with them . he agreed to let them live . the leaders of israel agreed with this promise of joshua .
three days later the israelites learned that these men lived very near their camp .
now we are your servants . you can do whatever you think is right . ”
so the gibeonites became slaves , but joshua let them live . he did not allow the israelites to kill them .
“ come with me and help me attack gibeon . gibeon has made a peace agreement with joshua and the israelites . ”
so joshua marched out of gilgal with his whole army . his best fighting men were with him .
joshua and his army marched all night to gibeon , so it was a complete surprise when he attacked them .
on that day the lord gave israel the victory against the amorites . joshua stood before all the israelites and said to the lord :
after this , joshua and his army went back to the camp at gilgal .
but during the fight , the five kings ran away . they hid in a cave near makkedah ,
but someone found them hiding in that cave . joshua learned about this .
he said , “ cover the entrance to the cave with large rocks . put some men there to guard the cave .
joshua said , “ move the rocks that are covering the entrance to the cave . bring the five kings to me . ”
so joshua ’ s men brought the five kings out of the cave—the kings of jerusalem , hebron , jarmuth , lachish , and eglon .
then joshua killed the five kings and hanged their bodies on five trees . he left them hanging in the trees until evening .
then joshua and all the israelites traveled from makkedah to libnah and attacked that city .
then joshua and all the israelites left libnah and went to lachish . joshua and his army camped around that city and attacked it .
king horam of gezer came to help lachish , but joshua also defeated him and his army . no one was left alive .
then joshua and all the israelites traveled from lachish to eglon . they camped around eglon and attacked it .
that day they captured the city and killed everyone in the city . this was the same thing they had done to lachish .
then joshua and all the israelites traveled from eglon to hebron and attacked it .
then joshua and all the israelites went back to debir and attacked it .
joshua captured all the cities from kadesh barnea to gaza . he captured all the cities from goshen to gibeon .
then joshua and all the israelites returned to their camp at gilgal .
all these kings met together at the small river of merom . they joined their armies together into one camp and made plans for the battle against israel .
so joshua and his whole army surprised the enemy and attacked them at the river of merom .
joshua did what the lord said to do ; he cut the legs of their horses and burned their chariots .
then joshua went back and captured the city of hazor and killed its king . ( hazor was the leader of all the kingdoms that fought against israel . )
the army of israel killed everyone in that city and completely destroyed all the people . there was nothing left alive . then they burned the city .
joshua captured all these cities and killed all their kings . he completely destroyed everything in these cities—just as moses , the lord ’ s servant , had commanded .
joshua fought against them for many years .
there were no anakites left living in the land of israel . the only anakites who were left alive were in gaza , gath , and ashdod .
they also defeated king og of bashan . og was from the rephaites . he ruled the land in ashtaroth and edrei .
the king of jericho ,
the king of jerusalem ,
the king of jarmuth ,
the king of eglon ,
the king of debir ,
the king of hormah ,
the king of libnah ,
the king of makkedah ,
the king of tappuah ,
the king of aphek ,
the king of madon ,
the king of shimron meron ,
the king of taanach ,
the king of kedesh ,
the king of dor at mount dor ,
and the king of tirzah .
you have not yet taken the land of geshur or the land of the philistines .
you have not yet defeated the area of the gebalites . and also there is the area of lebanon east of baal gad below mount hermon to lebo hamath .
now divide the land among the nine tribes and half the tribe of manasseh . ”
the israelites did not force out the people of geshur and maacah . they still live among the israelites today .
moses had given each family group from the tribe of reuben some land . this is the land they received :
the land continued to heshbon . it included all the towns on the plain . those towns were dibon , bamoth baal , beth baal meon ,
jahaz , kedemoth , mephaath ,
kiriathaim , sibmah , zereth shahar on the hill in the valley ,
beth peor , the hills of pisgah , and beth jeshimoth .
the israelites defeated balaam son of beor . ( balaam tried to use magic to tell the future . ) the israelites killed many people during the fighting .
this is the land moses gave to the tribe of gad . he gave this land to each tribe :
their land included the area from heshbon to ramath mizpah and betonim , from mahanaim to the land of debir ,
this is the land moses gave to half the tribe of manasseh . half of all the families in the tribe of manasseh got this land :
eleazar the priest , joshua son of nun , and the leaders of all the tribes of israel decided what land to give to the people .
the lord had told moses how to divide the land among the tribes of israel . the israelites divided the land the way the lord had commanded .
i am still as strong today as i was the day moses sent me out . i am as ready to fight as i was then .
joshua blessed caleb son of jephunneh . joshua gave him the city of hebron as his own .
in the past that city was called kiriath arba . it was named for the greatest man among the anakites—a man named arba .
the southern border of judah ’ s land started at the south end of the dead sea .
the border continued to azmon , the brook of egypt , and then to the mediterranean sea . all that land was on their southern border .
their eastern border was the shore of the dead sea to the area where the jordan river flowed into the sea .
the mediterranean sea was the western border . so the land of judah was inside these four borders . the families of judah lived in this area .
then caleb fought against the people living in debir . ( in the past , debir was also called kiriath sepher . )
caleb said , “ i will give my daughter in marriage to the man who attacks and conquers kiriath sepher . ”
othniel was the son of caleb ’ s brother kenaz . othniel defeated that city , so caleb gave his daughter acsah to othniel to be his wife .
the tribe of judah got the land that god promised them . each family group got part of the land .

nibshan , salt city , and en gedi . in all , there were six towns and all the fields around them .
then the border continued from bethel ( luz ) to the arkite border at ataroth .
so the people of manasseh and ephraim got their land . ( manasseh and ephraim were sons of joseph . )
this is the land that was given to the people of ephraim : their eastern border started at ataroth addar near upper beth horon .
and the western border started at micmethath . the border turned to the east to taanath shiloh and continued east to janoah .
then it went from janoah down to ataroth and to naarah . the border continued until it touched jericho and ended at the jordan river .
many of the border towns of ephraim were actually in manasseh ’ s borders , but the ephraimites got the towns and the fields around them .
the lands of manasseh were in the area between asher and micmethath . this is near shechem . the border went south to the en tappuah area .
the people of manasseh were not able to defeat those cities . so the canaanites continued to live there .
but the israelites grew strong . when this happened , they forced the canaanites to work for them . but they did not force them to leave that land .
but at this time there were still seven tribes of israel that had not yet received their land .
joshua threw lots for them in front of the lord at shiloh . in this way joshua divided the land and gave each tribe its part of the land .
then the border went south to luz ( bethel ) , then down to ataroth addar . ataroth addar is on the hill south of lower beth horon .
the southern border started near kiriath jearim and went to the river of nephtoah .
it continued to the northern part of beth arabah . then the border went down into the jordan valley .
the jordan river was the eastern border . so this was the land that was given to the tribe of benjamin . these were the borders on all sides .
each family got its land . these are their cities : jericho , beth hoglah , emek keziz ,
beth arabah , zemaraim , bethel ,
avvim , parah , ophrah ,
kephar ammoni , ophni , and geba . there were twelve cities and the fields around them .
the tribe of benjamin also got gibeon , ramah , beeroth ,
mizpah , kephirah , mozah ,
rekem , irpeel , taralah ,
then joshua gave all the families in the tribe of simeon their share of the land . the land they got was inside the area that belonged to judah .
this is the land that was given to that tribe : beersheba ( also called sheba ) , moladah ,
hazar shual , balah , ezem ,
eltolad , bethul , hormah ,
ziklag , beth marcaboth , hazar susah ,
beth lebaoth , and sharuhen . there were 13 towns and all the fields around them .
they also got the towns of ain , rimmon , ether , and ashan . there were four towns and all the fields around them .
then the border went west to maralah and just touched dabbesheth . then it went along the ravine near jokneam .
then the border turned to the east . it went from sarid to kisloth tabor . then it went on to daberath and to japhia .
then the border continued to the east to gath hepher and eth kazin . it ended at rimmon . then it turned and went to neah .
at neah the border turned again , went north to hannathon , and then continued to the valley of iphtah el .
so these are the towns and fields around them that were given to zebulun . each family in zebulun got its part of the land .
the fourth part of the land was given to the tribe of issachar . each family in that tribe got its part of the land .
this is the land that was given to that tribe : jezreel , kesulloth , shunem ,
hapharaim , shion , anaharath ,

remeth , en gannim , en haddah , and beth pazzez .
these cities and towns were part of the land that was given to the tribe of issachar . each family got its part of the land .
the fifth part of land was given to the tribe of asher . each family in that tribe got its part of the land .
this is the land that was given to that tribe : helkath , hali , beten , acshaph ,
allammelech , amad , and mishal .
then the border went to abdon , rehob , hammon , and kanah . it continued to the greater sidon area .
ummah , aphek , and rehob .
these cities and the fields around them were given to the tribe of asher . each family in that tribe got its share of the land .
the sixth part of land was given to the tribe of naphtali . each family in that tribe got its share of the land .
there were some very strong cities inside these borders . they were ziddim , zer , hammath , rakkath , kinnereth ,
adamah , ramah , hazor ,
kedesh , edrei , en hazor ,
iron , migdal el , horem , beth anath , and beth shemesh . in all , there were 19 towns and all the fields around them .
these cities and the fields around them were given to the tribe of naphtali . each family in that tribe got its land .
then land was given to the tribe of dan . each family in that tribe got its land .

elon , timnah , ekron ,

jehud , bene berak , gath rimmon ,
me jarkon , rakkon , and the area near joppa .
all these cities and fields around them were given to the tribe of dan . each family got its share of the land .
then the lord said to joshua :
“ through moses , i told you to choose some cities to be cities of safety .
anyone who kills someone accidentally can go to a city of safety to hide from the relatives who want to kill him .
you should stay in that city until the court has judged you and until the high priest dies . then you may go back to your hometown . ”
so the israelites obeyed this command from the lord and gave the levites these towns and the land around them for their animals :
the other kohath families were given ten towns in the areas that belonged to ephraim , dan , and half of manasseh .
the people from the merari family were given 12 towns . these towns came from the areas that belonged to reuben , gad , and zebulun .
so the israelites gave the levites these towns and the fields around them , just as the lord had told moses .
these are the names of the towns that were in the areas that belonged to judah and simeon .
the first choice of towns was given to the levites from the kohath family group .
but the fields and the small towns around the city of kiriath arba belonged to caleb son of jephunneh .
they also gave aaron ’ s descendants cities that belonged to the tribe of benjamin . these cities were gibeon , geba ,
anathoth , and almon . they gave them these four towns and some of the land near the towns for their animals .
the other people from the kohathite family groups were given towns that were in the areas that belonged to the tribe of ephraim . they got these towns :
the city of shechem from the hill country of ephraim ( which was a city of safety ) , gezer ,
kibzaim , and beth horon . in all , ephraim gave them four towns and some land around each town for their animals .
the tribe of dan gave them eltekeh , gibbethon ,
aijalon , and gath rimmon . in all , dan gave them four towns and some land around each town for their animals .
in all , the rest of the people from the kohath family groups got ten towns and some land around each town for their animals .
the gershon family groups were also from the tribe of levi . they got these towns :
the tribe of issachar gave them kishion , daberath ,
jarmuth , and en gannim . in all , issachar gave them four towns and some land around each town for their animals .
the tribe of asher gave them mishal , abdon ,
helkath , and rehob . in all , asher gave them four towns and some land around each town for their animals .
in all , the gershon family groups got 13 towns and some land around each town for their animals .
in all , the last family of levites , the merari family , got 12 towns .
each of these towns had some land in it for their animals . that was true for every town .
the lord kept every promise that he made to the israelites . there were no promises that he failed to keep . every promise came true .
then joshua called a meeting of all the people from the tribes of reuben , gad , and half the tribe of manasseh .
all this time you have supported all the other israelites . you carefully obeyed all the commands that the lord your god gave you .
then joshua said goodbye to them , and they left and went home .
they went to the place called geliloth , near the jordan river in the land of canaan . there they built a beautiful altar .
all the israelites became very angry with these three tribes . they met together and decided to fight against them .
they also sent ten of the leaders of the tribes there . there was one man from each family group of israel who was at shiloh .
so these eleven men went to gilead . they went to talk to the people of reuben , gad , and manasseh . the eleven men said to them ,
the people from the tribes of reuben , gad , and manasseh answered the eleven men . they said ,
“ so we decided to build this altar . but we did not plan to use it for burning offerings and sacrifices .
the people of reuben and gad named the altar “ proof that we believe the lord is god . ”
the lord gave israel peace from their enemies around them . he made israel safe . many years passed , and joshua became very old .
you have seen what the lord did to our enemies . he did this to help us . the lord your god fought for you .
“ you must be careful to obey every command written in the book of the law of moses . never turn away from that law .
you must continue to follow the lord your god . you have done this in the past , and you must continue to do it .
“ the lord helped you defeat many great and powerful nations . he forced them to leave . no nation has been able to defeat you .
with his help , one man from israel could defeat 1000 enemy soldiers , because the lord your god fights for you , as he promised .
so you must continue to love the lord your god .
but i refused to listen to balaam ’ s prayer . so he asked me to bless you , and i saved you from the enemy .
then the people answered , “ we will never stop following the lord . we will never serve other gods !
then the people said to joshua , “ no , we will serve the lord ! ”
then the people said to joshua , “ we will serve the lord our god . we will obey him . ”
so that day joshua made an agreement for the people . he made this agreement at the town called shechem . it became a law for them to follow .
then joshua told the people to go home . so everyone went back to his own land .
after that the lord ’ s servant joshua son of nun died . he was 110 years old .
joshua was buried on his own land at timnath serah , in the hill country of ephraim , north of mount gaash .
greetings from jude , a servant of jesus christ and a brother of james .
mercy , peace , and love be yours more and more .
enoch , the seventh descendant from adam , said this about these people : “ look , the lord is coming with thousands and thousands of his holy angels
dear friends , remember what the apostles of our lord jesus christ said would happen .
these are the people who divide you . they are not spiritual , because they don ’ t have the spirit .
but you , dear friends , use your most holy faith to build yourselves up even stronger . pray with the help of the holy spirit .
keep yourselves safe in god ’ s love , as you wait for the lord jesus christ in his mercy to give you eternal life .
help those who have doubts .
god is strong and can keep you from falling . he can bring you before his glory without any wrong in you and give you great joy .
the lord said to the israelites , “ the tribe of judah will go . i will let them take this land . ”
the lord helped the men of judah defeat the canaanites and the perizzites . they killed 10,000 men at the city of bezek .
in the city of bezek , they found the ruler of bezek and fought him , and they defeated the canaanites and the perizzites .
the men of judah fought against jerusalem and captured it . they used their swords to kill the people of jerusalem . then they burned the city .
later , they went down to fight against some more canaanites who lived in the hill country , in the negev , and in the western foothills .
the men of judah also captured the cities of gaza , ashkelon , and ekron and all the small towns around them .
the tribe of benjamin could not force the jebusites to leave jerusalem . so even today , the jebusites live with the people of benjamin in jerusalem .
the descendants of joseph went to fight against the city of bethel , and the lord was with them .
they sent some spies to the city of bethel ( which was then called luz ) .
he went to the land where the hittites lived and built a city . he named it luz , and that city is still called luz today .
the people of asher did not force the other people to leave the cities of acco , sidon , ahlab , aczib , helbah , aphek , and rehob .
the people of asher did not force those canaanites to leave their land , so the canaanites continued to live with them .
the land of the amorites was from scorpion pass to sela and up into the hill country past sela .
after the angel gave the israelites this message from the lord , the people cried loudly .
so they named the place bokim . there they offered sacrifices to the lord .
then joshua told the people to go home , so each tribe went to take their area of land .
joshua son of nun , the servant of the lord , died at the age of 110 years .
after that whole generation died , the next generation grew up . this new generation did not know about the lord or what he had done for the israelites .
so the israelites did something very evil before the lord . they began serving the false god baal .
the israelites stopped following the lord and began worshiping baal and ashtoreth .
then the lord chose leaders called judges . these leaders saved the israelites from the enemies who took their possessions .
i will use them to test the israelites . i will see if the israelites can keep the lord ’ s commands as their ancestors did . ”
the israelites lived with the canaanites , hittites , the amorites , perizzites , hivites , and jebusites .
the lord saw that the israelites did evil things . they forgot about the lord their god and served the false gods baal and asherah .
so the land was at peace for 40 years , until othniel son of kenaz died .
king eglon of moab ruled over the israelites for 18 years .
so ehud brought the gift to king eglon of moab . eglon was a very fat man .
after offering the gift , ehud left the palace with the men who had carried the gift .
ehud went to king eglon . the king was sitting all alone in the upper room of his palace .
then ehud went out of the private room , closed the doors to the upper room , and locked the king inside .
while the servants were waiting for the king , ehud had time to escape . he passed by the statues and went toward the place named seirah .
he said to the israelites , “ follow me ! the lord has helped us defeat our enemies , the moabites . ”
they killed about 10,000 strong and brave men from moab . not one moabite man escaped .
so on that day the israelites began to rule over the moabites , and there was peace in the land for 80 years .
after ehud died , the people again did what the lord said was wrong .
sisera had 900 iron chariots , and he was very cruel to the israelites for 20 years . so they cried to the lord for help .
there was a woman prophet named deborah . she was the wife of a man named lappidoth . she was judge of israel at that time .
someone told sisera that barak son of abinoam was at mount tabor .
so sisera gathered his 900 iron chariots and all the men with him , and they marched from the city of harosheth haggoyim to the kishon river .
on that day god defeated king jabin of canaan for the israelites .
so the israelites became stronger and stronger until they defeated king jabin of canaan . the israelites finally destroyed him .
on the day that the israelites defeated sisera , deborah and barak son of abinoam sang this song :
“ the men of israel prepared for battle .
“ listen , kings .
“ lord , in the past you came from seir .
the mountains shook before the lord , the god of mount sinai ,
“ in the days of shamgar son of anath ,
“ there were no soldiers in israel
“ god chose new leaders
“ my heart is with the commanders of israel .
“ pay attention you people riding on white donkeys ,
at the watering holes for the animals ,
“ wake up , wake up , deborah !
“ now , survivors , go to the leaders .
“ the men of ephraim came from the hill country of amalek .
the leaders of issachar were with deborah .
so why did you sit there against the walls of your sheep pens ?
the people of gilead stayed in their camps on the other side of the jordan river .
“ but the men of zebulun and naphtali risked their lives
the kings of canaan came to fight ,
the stars fought them from heaven .
the kishon river , that ancient river ,
the horses ’ hooves hammered the ground .
“ the angel of the lord said , ‘ curse the city of meroz .
jael was the wife of heber the kenite .
sisera asked for water .
then jael reached out and took a tent peg .
he sank down between jael ’ s feet .
“ there is sisera ’ s mother , looking out the window ,
“ her wisest servant girl answers her .
‘ i ’ m sure they won the war ,
“ may all your enemies die like this , lord !
again the israelites did what the lord said was wrong . so for seven years the lord allowed the midianites to defeat the israelites .
they did that because the midianites and amalekites from the east always came and destroyed their crops .
the israelites became very poor because of the midianites . so the israelites cried to the lord for help .
the midianites did all these bad things , so the israelites cried to the lord for help .
then gideon said to him , “ if you would , please give me some proof that you really are the lord .
but the lord said to gideon , “ calm down ! don ’ t be afraid ! you will not die ! ”
the spirit of the lord filled gideon . so gideon blew a trumpet to call the family of abiezer to follow him .
then gideon said to god , “ you said that you would help me save the israelites . give me proof .
that night god did that very thing . just the sheepskin was dry , but the ground around it was wet with dew .
so make an announcement to your men . tell them , ‘ anyone who is afraid may leave mount gilead and go back home . ’ ”
during the night the lord spoke to gideon and said , “ get up . i will let you defeat the midianite army . go down to their camp .
if you are afraid to go alone , take your servant purah with you . go into the camp of the midianites .
listen to what they are saying . after that you will not be afraid to attack them . ”
then gideon divided the 300 men into three groups . he gave each man a trumpet and an empty jar with a burning torch inside it .
gideon ’ s men stayed where they were . but inside the camp , the men of midian began shouting and running away .
then soldiers from the tribes of naphtali , asher , and all of manasseh were told to chase the midianites .
then gideon and his 300 men came to the jordan river and went across to the other side , but they were tired and hungry .
so gideon said to the men of penuel , “ after i win the victory , i will come back here and pull this tower down . ”
zebah and zalmunna , kings of the midianites , ran away . but gideon chased and caught them . gideon and his men defeated the enemy army .
then gideon son of joash returned from the battle . he and his men returned by going through a mountain pass called the pass of heres .
gideon took the elders of the city of succoth and beat them with thorns and briers from the desert .
gideon also pulled down the tower in the city of penuel and killed the men living in that city .
then gideon said to zebah and zalmunna , “ you killed some men on mount tabor . what were the men like ? ”
gideon son of joash went home .
gideon had 70 sons of his own . he had so many sons because he had many wives .
he had a slave woman who lived in the city of shechem . he had a son by her . he named that son abimelech .
as soon as gideon died , the israelites again were not faithful to god—they followed baal . they made baal berith their god .
the israelites did not remember the lord their god , who had saved them from all their enemies living around them .
the israelites were not loyal to the family of jerub-baal ( gideon ) , even though he had done many good things for them .
“ then the trees said to the fig tree , ‘ come and be our king . ’
“ but the fig tree answered , ‘ should i stop making my good , sweet fruit just to go and sway over the other trees ? ’
“ then the trees said to the vine , ‘ come and be our king . ’
“ finally , all the trees said to the thornbush , ‘ come and be our king . ’
but remember what my father did for you . he fought for you and risked his life when he saved you from the midianites .
but leaders of shechem and the house of millo , if you have not acted right , may abimelech destroy you . and may abimelech be destroyed too ! ”
after jotham had said this , he ran away and escaped to the city named beer . he stayed there because he was afraid of his brother abimelech .
abimelech ruled the israelites for three years .
zebul was the governor of the city of shechem . zebul heard what gaal son of ebed said , and he became very angry .
zebul sent messengers to abimelech in the city of arumah . this is the message :
so now you and your men should come tonight and hide in the fields outside the city .
when gaal saw the soldiers , he said to zebul , “ look , there are people coming down from the mountains . ”
so gaal led the leaders of shechem out to fight abimelech .
then abimelech returned to the city of arumah . zebul forced gaal and his brothers to leave the city of shechem .
the next day the people of shechem went out to the fields to work . abimelech found out about it .
abimelech and his group ran to a place near the gate to shechem . the other two groups ran out to the people in the fields and killed them .
abimelech heard that all the leaders of the tower of shechem had gathered together .
then abimelech and his men went to the city of thebez and captured that city .
abimelech and his men came to the tower to attack it . abimelech went up to the door of the tower to burn it .
the israelites saw that abimelech was dead , so they all went back home .
in that way god punished abimelech for all the bad things he had done . abimelech sinned against his own father by killing his 70 brothers .
god also punished the men of the city of shechem for the bad things they had done . so the things said by jotham son of gideon came true .
tola was a judge for the israelites for 23 years . then he died and was buried in the city of shamir .
jair died and was buried in the city of kamon .
so the lord became angry with the israelites and allowed the philistines and the ammonites to defeat them .
the ammonites then went across the jordan river to fight against the people of judah , benjamin , and ephraim . the ammonites brought many troubles to the israelites .
you cried to me when the people of sidon , the amalekites , and the midianites hurt you . i also saved you from those people .
but you left me and started worshiping other gods , so i refuse to save you again .
you like worshiping those gods , so go call to them for help . let them save you when you are in trouble . ”
but the israelites said to the lord , “ we have sinned . do whatever you want to do to us , but please save us today . ”
then the israelites threw away the foreign gods and began to worship the lord again . so he felt sorry for them when he saw them suffering .
the ammonites gathered together for war . their camp was in the area of gilead . the israelites gathered together . their camp was at the city of mizpah .
so jephthah went away because of his brothers and lived in the land of tob . in the land of tob , some rough men began to follow jephthah .
after a time the ammonites fought with the israelites .
the elders said to jephthah , “ come and be our leader so that we can fight the ammonites . ”
so the messengers of jephthah took this message back to jephthah . then jephthah sent the messengers to the king of the ammonites again .
they took this message :
when the israelites came out of the land of egypt , they went into the desert . they went to the red sea . then they went to kadesh .
the israelites got all the land of the amorites from the arnon river to the jabbok river . the land also went from the desert to the jordan river .
the king of the ammonites refused to listen to this message from jephthah .
jephthah made a promise to the lord . he said , “ if you will let me defeat the ammonites ,
then jephthah went to the land of the ammonites . he fought the ammonites , and the lord helped him defeat them .
every year the young women of israel would go out for four days to remember the daughter of jephthah from gilead and to cry for her .
jephthah was a judge for the israelites for six years . then jephthah from gilead died and was buried in his town in gilead .
after jephthah , a man named ibzan was a judge for the israelites . ibzan was from the city of bethlehem .
then ibzan died and was buried in the city of bethlehem .
then elon from the tribe of zebulun died and was buried in the city of aijalon in the land of zebulun .
after elon died , a man named abdon son of hillel was a judge for the israelites . abdon was from the city of pirathon .
abdon had 40 sons and 30 grandsons . they rode on 70 donkeys . abdon was a judge for the israelites for eight years .
again the people started doing what the lord said was wrong . so the lord allowed the philistines to rule over them for 40 years .
don ’ t drink any wine or any other strong drink . don ’ t eat any food that is unclean ,
so the woman ran to tell her husband , “ the man is back ! the man who came to me the other day is here . ”
so manoah said , “ may what you say happen . tell me , what kind of life will the boy live ? what will he do ? ”
the angel of the lord said to manoah , “ your wife must do everything i told her .
the angel of the lord said , “ why do you ask my name ? it is too amazing for you to believe . ”
he finally understood that the man was really the angel of the lord . the angel of the lord did not appear to manoah and his wife again .
manoah said to his wife , “ we have seen god . surely we will die because of this . ”
so the woman had a boy . she named him samson . he grew and the lord blessed him .
samson went down to the city of timnah . he saw a young philistine woman there .
so samson went down to the city and talked to the philistine woman . she pleased him .
samson ’ s father went down to see the philistine woman . the custom was for the bridegroom to give a party . so samson gave a party .
when the philistines saw that he was having a party , they sent 30 men to be with him .
samson told them this riddle :
so before the sun went down on the seventh day of the party , the philistine men had the answer . they came to samson and said ,
so samson ’ s wife was given to his best man .
but samson said to him , “ now i have a good reason to hurt you philistines . no one will blame me now . ”
the philistines asked , “ who did this ? ”
samson attacked the philistines and killed many of them . then he went and stayed in a cave in a place named the rock of etam .
the philistines went to the land of judah and stopped near a place named lehi . their army camped there .
the men of the tribe of judah asked them , “ why have you philistines come here to fight us ? ”
then they said to samson , “ we have come to tie you up . we will give you to the philistines . ”
samson found a jawbone of a dead donkey and killed 1000 philistine men with it .
when samson finished speaking , he threw the jawbone down . so that place was named ramath lehi .
samson was a judge for the israelites for 20 years during the time of the philistines .
one day samson went to the city of gaza . he saw a prostitute there and went in to stay the night with her .
later , samson fell in love with a woman named delilah , who was from sorek valley .
so delilah said to samson , “ tell me why you are so strong . how could someone tie you up and make you helpless ? ”
then the rulers of the philistines brought seven fresh , new bowstrings to delilah , and she tied samson with the bowstrings .
she kept bothering samson day after day . he got so tired of her asking him about his secret that he felt like he was going to die .
but his hair began to grow again .
when the philistines saw samson , they praised their god . they said ,
there was a man named micah who lived in the hill country of ephraim .
micah had a temple for worshiping idols . he made an ephod and some house idols . then micah chose one of his sons to be his priest .
( at that time the israelites did not have a king , so everyone did what they thought was right . )
there was a young man who was a levite from the city of bethlehem in judah . he had been living among the tribe of judah .
micah asked him , “ where have you come from ? ”
the young levite agreed to live with micah . he became like one of micah ’ s own sons .
micah chose him to be his priest . so the young man became a priest and lived in micah ’ s house .
the young man told them what micah had done for him . “ micah hired me , ” he said . “ i am his priest . ”
so they said to him , “ please ask god if our search for a place to live will be successful . ”
the priest said to the five men , “ yes . go in peace . the lord will lead you on your way . ”
the five men went back to the cities of zorah and eshtaol . their relatives asked them , “ what did you learn ? ”
so 600 men from the tribe of dan left the cities of zorah and eshtaol . they were ready for war .
from there the 600 men traveled on to the hill country of ephraim . then they came to micah ’ s house .
so they stopped at micah ’ s house , where the young levite lived . they asked the young man how he was .
the 600 men from the tribe of dan stood at the entrance of the gate . they all had their weapons and were ready for war .
then the men of dan turned around and went on their way . micah knew that these men were too strong for him , so he went back home .
at that time the israelites did not have a king .
the levite got up to leave , but his father-in-law persuaded him to stay the night again .
the old man saw the traveler in the public square and asked , “ where are you going ? where did you come from ? ”
the levite said to her , “ get up ; let ’ s go. ” but there was no answer .
now , all you men of israel , speak up . give your decision about what we should do . ”
now this is what we will do to the city of gibeah . we will throw lots to let god show us who will lead the attack .
so all the men of israel gathered together at the city of gibeah , united together and in agreement as to what they were doing .
the tribes of israel sent men to the tribe of benjamin with this message : “ what about this terrible thing that some of your men have done ?
the people from the tribe of benjamin got 26,000 soldiers together who were trained for war . they also had 700 trained soldiers from the city of gibeah .
all the tribes of israel , except benjamin , gathered together 400,000 fighting men with swords . each one was a trained soldier .
the israelites went up to the city of bethel . at bethel they asked god , “ which tribe will be first to attack the tribe of benjamin ? ”
the next morning the israelites got up . they made a camp near the city of gibeah .
then the army of israel took their positions for battle against the army of benjamin at the city of gibeah .
then the army of israel came near the army of benjamin . this was the second day of the war .
the men of israel asked the lord a question . ( in those days god ’ s box of the agreement was there at bethel .
then the army of israel hid some men all around the city of gibeah .
the army of israel went to fight against the city of gibeah on the third day . they got ready for battle as they had done before .
the men of benjamin said , “ we are winning as before ! ”
so the people of benjamin saw that they were defeated .
the men who were hiding rushed into the city of gibeah . they spread out and killed everyone in the city with their swords .
so 18,000 brave and strong fighters from the army of benjamin were killed .
on that day 25,000 men of the army of benjamin were killed . all of them fought bravely with their swords .
but 600 men from benjamin ran into the desert to the place called the rock of rimmon and stayed there for four months .
the israelites went to the city of bethel . there they sat before god until evening . they cried loudly as they sat there .
early the next day , the israelites built an altar . they put burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to god on that altar .
then the israelites felt sorry for their relatives , the people of benjamin . they said , “ today , one tribe has been separated from israel .
the israelites counted everyone to see who was there and who was not . they found that no one from jabesh gilead was there .
the israelites felt sorry for the men of benjamin . they felt sorry for them because the lord had separated them from the other tribes of israel .
so the elders told the men of benjamin about their idea . they said , “ go and hide in the vineyards .
then the israelites went home . they went to their own land and tribe .
in those days the israelites did not have a king , so everyone did whatever they thought was right .
jerusalem once was a city full of people ,
she cries bitterly in the night .
judah suffered very much ,
the roads to zion are very sad ,
jerusalem ’ s enemies have won .
the beauty of daughter zion has gone away .
jerusalem sinned very badly .
jerusalem ’ s skirts were dirty .
the enemy stretched out his hand .
all the people of jerusalem are groaning .
all you who pass by on the road , you don ’ t seem to care .
the lord sent fire from above
“ my sins were tied up like a yoke .
“ the lord rejected all my powerful men
“ i cry about all these things .
zion spread out her hands .
now jerusalem says , “ i refused to listen to the lord ,
i called out to my lovers ,
“ look at me , lord . i am in distress !
“ listen to me , i am groaning .
“ look how evil my enemies are !
look how the lord has covered daughter zion
the lord destroyed the houses of jacob .
he was angry , and he destroyed
he bent his bow like an enemy .
the lord has become like an enemy .
he pulled up his own tent
he rejected his altar ,
the lord planned to destroy
jerusalem ’ s gates have sunk into the ground .
the elders of zion sit on the ground .
my eyes are worn out with tears ,
they ask their mothers ,
my dear jerusalem , what can i say about you ?
your prophets saw visions for you ,
those who pass by on the road
all your enemies laugh at you .
the lord did what he planned to do .
cry out with all your heart to the lord !
get up throughout the night and cry for help .
look at us , lord !
young men and old men
you invited terror to come to me from all around .
i am a man who has seen much trouble .
he led and brought me
he turned his hand against me .
he wore out my flesh and skin .
he built up bitterness and trouble against me .
he put me in the dark ,
he shut me in , so i could not get out .
even when i cry out and ask for help ,
he has blocked up my path with stones .
he is like a bear about to attack me ,
he led me off my path .
he made his bow ready .
he shot me in the stomach
i have become a joke to all my people .
he gave me this poison to drink .
he pushed my teeth into rocky ground .
i thought i would never have peace again .
i said to myself , “ i no longer have any hope
remember , i am very sad ,
i remember well all my troubles ,
but then i think about this ,
we are still alive because
every morning he shows it in new ways !
i say to myself , “ the lord is my god ,
the lord is good to those who wait for him .
it is good to wait quietly
it is good for a man to wear his yoke
he should sit alone and be quiet
he should bow down to the lord .
he should turn his cheek to the one who hits him
when he punishes , he also has mercy .
he does not enjoy causing people pain .
he does not like any prisoner on earth
he does not like anyone to be unfair to another person .
the lord does not like anyone to cheat another person .
no one can say something and make it happen ,
no one alive can complain
let us check and see what we have done .
let us lift up our hearts and our hands
let us say to him , “ we have sinned and have been stubborn .
you wrapped yourself with anger .
you wrapped yourself in a cloud
you made us like garbage and dirt
we have been frightened .
my eyes flow with streams of tears .
my eyes will flow without stopping .
i will continue to cry
my eyes make me sad , when i see
they threw me alive into a pit
water came up over my head .
lord , i called your name
you heard my voice .
you came to me on the day that i called out to you .
lord , you have seen my trouble .
you have seen how my enemies have hurt me .
you heard them insult me , lord .
the words and the thoughts of my enemies
when they sit down and when they stand up .
give them back what they deserve , lord .
chase them in anger and destroy them .
see how the gold has grown dark ,
the precious people of zion
even a wild dog feeds her babies .
those who ate rich food
the sin of the daughter of my people was very great .
some of the men of judah were dedicated to god in a special way .
but now their faces are blacker than soot .
it was better for those who were killed by the sword
the lord used all of his anger .
the kings of the earth could not believe what had happened .
this happened because the prophets
the prophets and priests walked around
people shouted , “ go away !
the lord himself destroyed them .
we have worn out our eyes looking for help ,
our enemies hunted us all the time .
the men who chased us
the king was very important to us .
be happy , people of edom .
your punishment is complete , zion .
remember , lord , what happened to us .
our land has been turned over to strangers .
we have become orphans .
we have to buy the water that we drink .
we are forced to wear a yoke on our necks .
we made an agreement with egypt .
our ancestors sinned against you , and now they are dead .
slaves have become our rulers .
we risk our lives to get food .
our skin is hot like an oven .
the enemy raped the women of zion .
the enemy hanged our princes .
the enemy made our young men grind grain at the mill .
the elders no longer sit at the gates of the city .
we have no more joy in our hearts .
the crown has fallen from our head .
for this reason , our hearts have become sick ,
mount zion is a wasteland .
but you rule forever , lord .
you seem to have forgotten us forever .
bring us back to you , lord .
you were very angry with us .
so the lord called out to moses from inside the meeting tent and said ,
you must remove the skin from that animal and then cut the animal into pieces .
aaron ’ s sons , the priests , will put the fire on the altar and arrange the wood on the fire .
they will lay the pieces of the animal , including the head and fat , on top of the burning wood .
“ if you offer a sheep or a goat as a burnt offering , it must be a male that has nothing wrong with it .
“ if you offer a bird as a burnt offering to the lord , that bird must be a dove or a young pigeon .
he will remove the bird ’ s tail and inner parts and throw them onto the pile of ashes east of the altar .
the rest of that grain offering will belong to aaron and his sons . this gift to the lord is very holy .
if you bring a grain offering cooked in a baking pan , it must be made from fine flour without yeast and mixed with oil .
you must break it into pieces and pour oil over it . it is a grain offering .
if you bring a grain offering cooked in a frying pan , it must be made from fine flour mixed with oil .
the rest of that grain offering will belong to aaron and his sons . this gift to the lord is very holy .
you must put oil and frankincense on it . it is a grain offering .
if you bring a lamb as an offering to the lord ,
then the priest will take that part to the altar to be burned up as food , a gift to the lord .
“ if the offering is a goat , you must bring it before the lord .
then the priest will bring that food as a sweet-smelling gift to the lord . the fat belongs to the lord .
this rule will continue forever through all your generations . wherever you live , you must never eat fat or blood . ”
the lord spoke to moses and said ,
“ tell the israelites this : a person might sin without meaning to and do something that the lord commanded should not be done . for example :
then the anointed priest must get some of the blood from the bull and take it into the meeting tent .
he must put his finger in the blood and sprinkle the blood seven times before the lord in front of the curtain of the most holy place .
then the priest must take all the fat from the bull of the sin offering . he must take the fat that is on and around the inner parts .
the priest must lift up these things and burn them on the altar for burnt offerings , just as he does for the fellowship offering .
the anointed priest must get some of the bull ’ s blood and take it into the meeting tent .
he must put his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times in front of the curtain before the lord .
then he must take all the fat from the animal and bring it to the altar .
if he learns about his sin , he must bring a male goat that has nothing wrong with it as his offering .
if you learn about that sin , you must bring a female goat that has nothing wrong with it as your sin offering .
you must put your hand on the animal ’ s head and kill it at the place for the burnt offering .
“ if you bring a lamb as your sin offering , then you must bring a female lamb that has nothing wrong with it .
you must put your hand on the animal ’ s head and kill it as a sin offering in the place where people kill the burnt offering .
if you are guilty of any of these things , you must confess whatever you did wrong .
the lord gave this command to moses for the people :
you are guilty , and you must pay the guilt offering to the lord . ”
the lord told moses these rules for the people :
you must also bring a ram to the lord that has nothing wrong with it ( or the same amount in silver ) to the priest .
the lord said to moses ,
then he must take off the special clothes and put on the other clothes and carry the ashes outside the camp to a special place that is pure .
that fire must always be kept burning on the altar . it must never be allowed to stop burning .
“ this is the law for the grain offering : the sons of aaron will bring it to the front of the altar as an offering to the lord .
the lord said to moses ,
every grain offering that a priest gives must be completely burned . it must not be eaten . ”
the lord said to moses ,
the priest who offers the sin offering must eat it . but he must eat it in a holy place , in the courtyard around the meeting tent .
touching the meat of the sin offering makes a person or a thing holy .
“ any male in a priest ’ s family may eat the sin offering . it is very holy .
“ these are the rules for the guilt offering , which is very holy :
“ the priest must offer all the fat from the guilt offering . he must offer the fat tail and the fat that covers the inner parts .
he must bring these things to the altar as a gift to the lord . it is a guilt offering .
“ any male in a priest ’ s family may eat the guilt offering . it is very holy , so it must be eaten in a holy place .
the guilt offering is like the sin offering . the same rules are for both offerings . the priest who does the sacrificing will get the meat for food .
he will also get the skin from the burnt offering .
“ this is the law of the sacrifice of fellowship offerings that you bring to the lord :
you must also bring loaves of bread made with yeast to go with your fellowship offering .
if any meat from this sacrifice is still left over on the third day , it must be burned in the fire .
but anyone who is unclean and eats the meat from the fellowship offerings that was offered to the lord must be separated from their people .
the lord said to moses ,
“ tell the israelites : you must not eat any fat from your cattle , sheep , or goats .
you may use the fat from any animal that has died by itself or was torn by other animals , but you must never eat it .
whoever eats the fat from an animal that was offered as a gift to the lord must be separated from their people .
“ no matter where you live , you must never eat blood from any bird or any animal .
anyone who eats blood must be separated from their people . ”
the lord said to moses ,
“ tell the israelites : if you bring a fellowship offering to the lord , you must present that gift to the lord yourself .
the priest will burn the fat on the altar , but the breast of the animal will belong to aaron and his sons .
you must also give the right thigh from the fellowship offering as a gift to the priest .
that part of the fellowship offering will belong to the priest who carries the blood and fat to the altar .
the lord commanded the israelites to give those parts to the priests once they have been anointed . that will be their share from the israelites forever .
these are the laws about burnt offerings , grain offerings , sin offerings , guilt offerings , fellowship offerings , and offerings for when the priests are appointed .
the lord gave these laws to moses on mount sinai when he commanded the israelites to bring their offerings to the lord in the desert of sinai .
the lord said to moses ,
then gather the people together at the entrance of the meeting tent . ”
moses did what the lord commanded him . the people met together at the entrance of the meeting tent .
then moses said to them , “ this is what the lord has commanded must be done . ”
moses brought aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water .
moses put the judgment pouch on aaron and put the urim and thummim inside its pocket .
then moses took the anointing oil and sprinkled it on the holy tent and on everything in it . in this way he made them holy .
he poured some of the anointing oil on aaron ’ s head to make him holy .
then moses brought out the bull of the sin offering . aaron and his sons put their hands on the bull ’ s head .
then moses brought the ram of the burnt offering . aaron and his sons put their hands on the ram ’ s head .
then moses killed the ram . he sprinkled the blood around on the altar .
then he put all of it in the hands of aaron and his sons . moses lifted these pieces to show he was offering them before the lord .
if any of the meat or bread is left , burn it .
the ceremony for appointing the priests will last for seven days . you must not leave the entrance of the meeting tent until that time is finished .
everything we did today was what the lord commanded us to do in order to make you pure .
so aaron and his sons did everything that the lord had commanded moses .
on the eighth day , moses called for aaron and his sons and the elders of israel .
so all the people came to the meeting tent . they all brought the things that moses had commanded . all the people stood before the lord .
moses said , “ you must do what the lord commanded . then the glory of the lord will appear to you . ”
so aaron went to the altar . he killed the bull for the sin offering . this sin offering was for himself .
then aaron burned the meat and skin on a fire outside the camp .
next , aaron killed the animal for the burnt offering . his sons brought the blood to him , and he sprinkled the blood around on the altar .
aaron ’ s sons gave the pieces and head of the burnt offering to aaron , and he burned them on the altar .
he also washed the inner parts and the legs of the burnt offering and burned them on the altar .
he brought the burnt offering and offered it , just as the lord had commanded .
he brought the grain offering to the altar . he took a handful of the grain and put it on the altar beside that morning ’ s daily sacrifice .
aaron ’ s sons put these fat parts on the breasts of the bull and the ram . aaron burned them on the altar .
he lifted the breasts and the gift of the right thigh to show he was offering them before the lord , just as moses had commanded .
moses and aaron went into the meeting tent . they came out and blessed the people . then the glory of the lord appeared to all the people .
so fire came from the lord and destroyed nadab and abihu , and they died there in front of the lord .
so mishael and elzaphan obeyed moses . they carried the bodies of nadab and abihu outside the camp . nadab and abihu were still wearing their special woven shirts .
then the lord said to aaron ,
you must be able to clearly tell the difference between what is holy and what is not holy , between what is clean and what is unclean .
and you must teach the people about all the laws that the lord gave them through moses . ”
the portion of food for you and your sons will come from the special gifts to the lord , so you must eat that food in a holy place .
when moses heard this , he agreed .
the lord said to moses and aaron ,
“ tell the israelites : these are the animals you can eat :
don ’ t eat the meat from these animals . don ’ t even touch their dead bodies ! they are unclean for you .
“ you may eat everything that lives in the sea or in a river that has fins and scales .
it is a sickening thought for you to touch anything that lives in the water and does not have fins and scales .
kites , all kinds of falcons ,
all kinds of black birds ,
ostriches , nighthawks , sea gulls , all kinds of hawks ,
owls , cormorants , great owls ,
water hens , pelicans , carrion vultures ,
storks , all kinds of herons , hoopoes , and bats .
“ don ’ t eat insects that have wings and crawl . even the thought of eating them should make you sick !
but you may eat insects if they have legs with joints above their feet so that they can jump .
you may also eat all kinds of locusts , all kinds of winged locusts , all kinds of crickets , and all kinds of grasshoppers .
“ but stay away from all the other insects that have wings and crawl .
they will make you unclean . if you touch the dead bodies of these insects , you will become unclean until evening .
if you pick up one of these dead insects , you must wash your clothes . you will be unclean until evening .
“ these small animals are unclean for you : moles , mice , all kinds of great lizards ,
geckos , crocodiles , lizards , sand reptiles , and chameleons .
whoever touches their dead bodies will be unclean until evening .
if any of these unclean animals dies and falls into a clay dish , anything in the dish will become unclean . and you must break the dish .
if water from the unclean clay dish touches any food , that food will become unclean . any drink in the unclean dish will become unclean .
if any part of a dead , unclean animal falls on seed that is to be planted , that seed is still clean .
but if you put water on some seed and if any part of a dead , unclean animal falls on those seeds , they are unclean for you .
“ also , if an animal which you use for food dies , whoever touches its dead body will be unclean until evening .
“ you must treat all the crawling animals that live on the dirt as disgusting things that you must not eat .
don ’ t let them make you filthy . you must not become unclean ,
because i am the lord your god . i am holy , so you should keep yourselves holy . don ’ t make yourselves unclean with these crawling things .
these are the rules about all the tame animals , birds , all the animals in the sea , and all the animals that crawl on the ground .
these rules will help the people know which animals are unclean and which animals they are allowed to eat and which ones they can not eat .
the lord said to moses ,
“ tell the israelites :
the baby boy must be circumcised on the eighth day .
the lord said to moses and aaron ,
the priest must look , and if the rash has spread , he must announce that the person is unclean . the disease is leprosy .
“ whoever has leprosy must be brought to the priest .
but if the skin is raw , that person is not clean .
when the priest sees the raw skin , he must announce that the person is unclean . the raw skin is not clean . it is leprosy .
“ if the raw skin changes and becomes white , the person must come to the priest .
“ someone might get a boil on their skin that heals over .
if the spot spreads on the skin , the priest must announce that the person is unclean ; it is an infection .
“ someone might get an infection on the scalp or beard .
if the disease does not seem deeper than the skin , but there is no dark hair in it , the priest must separate that person for seven days .
the person must shave . but the diseased area should not be shaved . the priest must separate that person for seven more days .
but if the disease spreads on the skin after the person has become clean ,
“ if anyone has white spots on the skin ,
“ a man might begin to lose the hair on his head . it is only baldness , so he is clean .
a man might lose hair from the sides of his head . he is clean . it is only another kind of baldness .
but if there is a red and white infection on his scalp , it is a skin disease .
a priest must look at him . if the swelling of the infection is red and white and looks like the leprosy on other parts of his body ,
then he has leprosy on his scalp . the person is unclean . the priest must announce that he is unclean .
they are unclean the whole time that they have the infection . they are unclean and must live outside the camp .
if the mildew is green or red , it must be shown to the priest .
the priest must look at it and put it in a separate place for seven days .
he must order the people to wash it . then he must separate the clothing for seven more days .
but the mildew might come back to that piece of leather or cloth . if that happens , the mildew is spreading , and the object must be burned .
but if the mildew did not come back after washing , that piece of leather or cloth is clean , whether the cloth was woven or knitted . ”
these are the rules for mildew on pieces of leather or cloth , whether the cloth is woven or knitted .
the lord said to moses ,
“ these are the rules for people who have had a skin disease and have been made well . these rules are for making them clean .
the priest must go to them outside the camp and look to see if the skin disease is healed .
then the priest must order one bird to be killed in a clay bowl over running water .
the priest will also take some of the oil and pour it into his own left palm .
“ then the priest must offer the sin offering to make that person pure . after that he will kill the animal for the burnt offering .
the priest will take the lamb for the guilt offering and the oil , and he will lift them up to show they were offered before the lord .
he will also pour some of this oil into his own left palm .
he will use the finger of his right hand to sprinkle some of the oil that is in his left palm seven times before the lord .
“ then the priest must offer one of the doves or young pigeons . ( he must offer whichever the person can afford . )
the lord also said to moses and aaron ,
the person who owns that house must come and tell the priest , ‘ i see something like mildew in my house . ’
he must go out of the house and lock the house for seven days .
“ on the seventh day the priest must come back and check the house . if the mildew has spread on the walls of the house ,
then new stones must be put in the walls , and the walls must be covered with new plaster .
“ maybe someone took away the old stones and plaster and put in new stones and plaster . and maybe mildew again appears in that house .
the house must be torn down . all the stones , plaster , and pieces of wood must be taken to the special unclean place outside the city .
anyone who goes into that house will be unclean until evening .
anyone who eats in that house or lies down in there must wash their clothes .
he will kill one bird in a clay bowl over running water .
in this way he will use these things to make the house clean .
these are the rules for any infection of leprosy ,
for mildew on pieces of cloth or in a house .
these are the rules for swellings , rashes , or bright spots on the skin .
these rules teach when something is clean and when something is unclean . these are the rules about these kinds of disease .
the lord also said to moses and aaron ,
“ say to the israelites : whoever has a genital discharge is unclean .
the person is unclean whether the discharge continues to flow or whether it stops .
“ if a man with a discharge lies on a bed , that bed becomes unclean . everything he sits on will become unclean .
if you touch that bed , you must wash your clothes and bathe in water . you will be unclean until evening .
if you sit on anything that he sat on , you must wash your clothes and bathe in water . you will be unclean until evening .
if you touch him , you must wash your clothes and bathe in water . you will be unclean until evening .
if he spits on you , you must wash your clothes and bathe in water . you will be unclean until evening .
if that man sits on a saddle , it will become unclean .
if you touch or carry anything that was under him , you will be unclean until evening .
if he touches you , you must wash your clothes and bathe in water . you will be unclean until evening .
“ if a man has a flow of semen , he must bathe his whole body in water . he will be unclean until evening .
if the semen is on any clothing or leather , that clothing or leather must be washed with water . it will be unclean until evening .
everything she lies on during her monthly time of bleeding will be unclean . and everything she sits on during that time will be unclean .
whoever touches her bed must wash their clothes and bathe in water . they will be unclean until evening .
whoever touches anything she has sat on must wash their clothes and bathe in water . they will be unclean until evening .
it doesn ’ t matter if they touched the woman ’ s bed or if they touched something she sat on , they will be unclean until evening .
whoever touches these things will be unclean until evening . they must wash their own clothes and bathe in water .
after the woman ’ s discharge stops , she must wait seven days . after that she will be clean .
then on the eighth day , she must bring two doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the meeting tent .
these are the rules for anyone with a discharge from the body . these rules are for men who become unclean from a flow of semen .
two of aaron ’ s sons died while offering incense to the lord . after that time , the lord spoke to moses .
“ before aaron enters the most holy place , he will offer a bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering .
“ from the whole community of israel , aaron will accept two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering .
then he will offer the bull for the sin offering . this sin offering is for himself . he will do this to purify himself and his family .
“ then aaron will take the two goats and bring them before the lord at the doorway of the meeting tent .
aaron will throw lots for the two goats . one lot will be for the lord . the other lot will be for azazel .
“ then aaron will offer the goat chosen by the lot for the lord . aaron will make this goat a sin offering .
then he will burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar .
“ the man who led the goat to azazel must wash his clothes and his whole body with water . after that he may come into the camp .
then the man who burns them must wash his clothes and bathe his whole body with water . after that he may come into the camp .
because on this day , the priest will do this to make you pure and wash away your sins . then you will be clean to the lord .
you must humble yourselves because this day is a very important day of rest for you . this law will continue forever .
and make the most holy place , the meeting tent , and the altar pure . he will also make the priests and all the people pure .
that law will continue forever . once every year you will purify the israelites from all their sins . ”
the lord said to moses ,
“ speak to aaron and to his sons , and to all the israelites . tell them this is what the lord has commanded :
any one of you israelites might kill a bull , a lamb , or a goat . you might be in the camp or outside the camp .
in this way you will stop being unfaithful to me by offering sacrifices to your ‘ goat gods. ’ this law will continue forever .
“ tell the people : any citizen of israel , traveler , or foreigner living among you might want to offer a burnt offering or some other sacrifice .
“ i will turn against those who eat blood whether they are citizens of israel or foreigners living among you , i will separate them from their people .
that is why i am telling you israelites and the foreigners living among you that you must not eat blood .
if you don ’ t wash your clothes and bathe your whole body , you will be responsible for your guilt . ”
the lord said to moses ,
“ tell the israelites : i am the lord your god .
you must obey my rules and follow my laws . be sure to follow my rules because i am the lord your god .
you must obey my rules and my laws , because whoever obeys them will live . i am the lord .
“ you must never have sexual relations with your close relatives . i am the lord .
“ you must never have sexual relations with your father or mother . she is your mother , so you must not have sexual relations with her .
“ if your father and his wife have a daughter , she is your sister . you must not have sexual relations with her .
“ you must not have sexual relations with your father ’ s sister . she is your father ’ s close relative .
you must not have sexual relations with your mother ’ s sister . she is your mother ’ s close relative .
“ you must not have sexual relations with your daughter-in-law . she is your son ’ s wife , so you must not have sexual relations with her .
“ you must not have sexual relations with your brother ’ s wife . that would be like having sexual relations with your brother .
“ you must not go near a woman to have sexual relations with her during her monthly time of bleeding . she is unclean during this time .
“ you must not have sexual relations with your neighbor ’ s wife . this will only make you filthy .
“ men , you must not have sexual relations with another man as with a woman . that is a terrible sin !
they made the land filthy . now the land is sick of those things , and it will vomit out the people who live there .
those who lived in the land before you have done all these terrible things . so the land became filthy .
whoever does any of these terrible sins must be separated from their people !
the lord said to moses ,
“ tell all the israelites : i am the lord your god . i am holy , so you must be holy .
“ each of you must honor your mother and father and keep my special days of rest . i am the lord your god !
“ do not worship idols . do not make statues of gods for yourselves . i am the lord your god .
“ when you offer a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to the lord , you must offer it in the right way so that you will be accepted .
you must not eat any of that sacrifice on the third day . it will be unclean , and it will not be accepted .
“ you must not steal . you must not cheat people . you must not lie to each other .
“ you must not cheat or rob your neighbor . you must not hold a hired worker ’ s salary overnight until morning .
forget about the wrong things people do to you . don ’ t try to get even . love your neighbor as yourself . i am the lord .
the man must bring his guilt offering to the lord at the entrance of the meeting tent . he must bring a ram for a guilt offering .
in the fourth year , the fruit from that tree will belong to the lord , a holy offering of praise to him .
“ you must not eat any meat with blood still in it .
you must not cut your body as a way to remember the dead . you must not make any tattoo marks on yourselves . i am the lord .
“ you must not work on my special days of rest . you must honor my holy place . i am the lord .
“ do not go to mediums or wizards for advice—they will only make you unclean . i am the lord your god .
“ show honor to old people . stand up when they come into the room . and show respect to your leaders . i am the lord .
“ do not do bad things to foreigners living in your country .
“ you must be fair when you judge people , and you must be fair when you measure and weigh things .
“ you must remember all my laws and rules . and you must obey them . i am the lord . ”
the lord said to moses ,
maybe the common people will ignore them . maybe they will not kill those who gave their children to molech .
“ be special . make yourselves holy , because i am the lord your god .
remember and obey my laws . i am the lord . and i have made you my special people .
“ whoever curses their father or mother must be put to death . they cursed their father or mother , so they are responsible for their own death !
“ if a man has sexual relations with an animal , both the man and the animal must be put to death .
i have separated you from other nations to be my own special people . so you must be holy because i am the lord , and i am holy .
but a priest must not make himself unclean if the dead person was only one of his slaves .
“ priests must not shave their heads bald . they must not shave off the edges of their beards . they must not make any cuts in their bodies .
“ the high priest must marry a woman who is a virgin .
in this way people will show respect for his children . i , the lord , have separated the high priest for his special work . ”
the lord said to moses ,
“ tell aaron : if any of your descendants have anything wrong with them , they must not carry the special bread to god .
men with broken feet or hands ,
men with bent backs , men who are dwarfs , men who are cross-eyed , men with rashes or bad skin diseases , and men with crushed testicles .
he is from the family of priests , so he can eat the holy bread . he can also eat the very holy bread .
so moses told these things to aaron , aaron ’ s sons , and all the israelites .
the lord god said to moses ,
he will be clean only after the sun goes down . then he can eat the holy food because it is his share .
a priest ’ s daughter might marry a man who is not a priest . if she does that , she can not eat any of the holy offerings .
“ whoever eats some of the holy food by mistake must give the priest the price of that food and add another one-fifth of the price as a fine .
“ the israelites will bring offerings to the lord . these offerings become holy , so the priests must not let them be used in a wrong way .
the lord god said to moses ,
the lord said to moses ,
but you must not kill the animal and its mother on the same day . this rule is the same for cattle and sheep .
you must eat the whole animal that day . you must not leave any of the meat for the next morning . i am the lord .
“ remember my commands , and obey them . i am the lord .
show respect for my holy name . i must be very special to the israelites . i , the lord , have made you my special people .
i brought you out of egypt in order to be your god . i am the lord . ”
the lord said to moses ,
“ tell the israelites : you will announce the lord ’ s chosen festivals as holy meetings . these are my special festivals .
“ these are the lord ’ s chosen festivals . you will announce the holy meetings at the times chosen for them .
the lord ’ s passover is on the 14th day of the first month just before dark .
“ the lord ’ s festival of unleavened bread is on the 15th day of the same month . you will eat unleavened bread for seven days .
on the first day of this festival , you will have a special meeting . you must not do any work on that day .
the lord said to moses ,
“ from that sunday morning ( the day you bring the sheaf to be presented to god ) , count seven weeks .
on the sunday following the seventh week ( that is , 50 days later ) , you will bring a new grain offering to the lord .
you will also offer one male goat for a sin offering and two one-year-old male lambs as a fellowship offering .
on that same day you will call a holy meeting . you must not do any work . this law continues forever in all your homes .
again the lord said to moses ,
you must not do any work . you must bring an offering as a gift to the lord . ”
the lord said to moses ,
“ anyone who refuses to fast on this day must be separated from their people .
if anyone does any work on this day , i will destroy that person from among the people .
you must not do any work at all . this is a law that continues forever for you , wherever you live .
again the lord said to moses ,
“ tell the israelites : on the 15th day of the seventh month is the festival of shelters . this festival to the lord will continue for seven days .
there will be a holy meeting on the first day . you must not do any work .
you will celebrate this festival to the lord for seven days each year . this law will continue forever . you will celebrate this festival in the seventh month .
you will live in temporary shelters for seven days . all the people born in israel will live in them .
so moses told the israelites about all the special meetings to honor the lord .
the lord said to moses ,
“ command the israelites to bring to you pure oil from crushed olives . that oil is for the lamps that must burn without stopping .
aaron must always keep the lamps burning on the lampstand of pure gold before the lord .
“ take fine flour and bake twelve loaves with it . use 16 cups of flour for each loaf .
put them in two rows on the golden table before the lord . six loaves will be in each row .
put pure frankincense on each row . this will help the lord remember the gift .
every sabbath day aaron will put the bread in order before the lord . this must be done forever . this agreement with the israelites will continue forever .
there was a son of an israelite woman and an egyptian father . he was walking among the israelites , and he started fighting in camp .
the people held him as a prisoner and waited for the lord ’ s command to be made clear to them .
then the lord said to moses ,
you must tell the israelites : anyone who curses their god must be punished .
“ and whoever kills another person must be put to death .
whoever kills an animal that belongs to another person must give another animal to take its place .
“ and whoever causes an injury to their neighbor must be given the same kind of injury :
whoever kills an animal must pay for the animal . but whoever kills another person must be put to death .
“ the law will be the same for foreigners and for people from your own country . this is because i am the lord your god . ”
the lord spoke to moses at mount sinai . he said ,
you will plant seed in your field for six years . you will trim your vineyards for six years and bring in its fruits .
and there will be enough food for your cattle and other animals to eat .
that year is jubilee . it will be a holy time for you . you will eat the crops that come from the field .
in the year of jubilee , you will go back to your own property .
“ don ’ t cheat your neighbors when you sell your land to them . don ’ t cheat one another when you buy or sell land .
you must not cheat each other . you must honor your god . i am the lord your god .
“ remember my laws and rules . obey them and you will live safely in your country .
and the land will produce good crops for you . then you will have plenty of food , and you will live safely on the land .
i will order my blessing to come to you during the sixth year . the land will continue growing crops for three years .
“ the land really belongs to me , so you can not sell it permanently . you are only foreigners and travelers living on my land with me .
people might sell their land , but the family will always get their land back .
if someone in your country becomes very poor and must sell their property , a close relative must come and buy it back .
if there is not a close relative to buy back the land , the person might get enough money to buy it back .
“ but about the cities of the levites : the levites can buy back at any time their houses in the cities that belong to them .
also , the fields and pastures around the levite cities can not be sold . they belong to the levites forever .
“ if anyone from your own country becomes too poor to support themselves , you must let them live with you like a visitor .
don ’ t charge them any interest on money you might loan to them . respect your god and let those from your own country live with you .
don ’ t charge them interest on any money you lend them . and don ’ t try to make a profit from the food you sell them .
i am the lord your god . i brought you out of the land of egypt to give the land of canaan to you and to become your god .
“ if anyone from your own country becomes so poor that they must sell themselves to you , don ’ t make them work like slaves .
they will be like hired workers and visitors with you until the year of jubilee .
then they can leave you , take their children , and go back to their family . they can go back to the property of their ancestors ,
because they are my servants . i brought them out of slavery in egypt . they must not become slaves again .
you must not be a cruel master to them . you must respect your god .
“ about your men and women slaves : you may get men and women slaves from the other nations around you .
also , you may get children as slaves if they come from the families of the foreigners living in your land . these child slaves will belong to you .
these people have the right to be bought back and become free . someone from their own country can buy them back .
if only a few years are left until the year of jubilee , the one who was sold must pay a small part of the original price .
but that person will live like a hired worker with the foreigner every year . don ’ t let the foreigner be a cruel master over that person .
this is because the israelites are my servants . they are the servants who i brought out of slavery in egypt . i am the lord your god !
“ remember my special days of rest and honor my holy place . i am the lord .
“ remember my laws and commands , and obey them .
“ you will chase your enemies and defeat them . you will kill them with your swords .
five of you will chase 100 men , and 100 of you will chase 10,000 men . you will defeat your enemies and kill them with your sword .
“ then i will turn to you . i will let you have many children . i will keep my agreement with you .
also , i will place my holy tent among you . i will not turn away from you .
i will walk with you and be your god . and you will be my people .
“ but if you don ’ t obey me and all my commands , bad things will happen to you .
if you refuse to obey my laws and commands , you have broken my agreement .
“ after these things , if you still don ’ t obey me , i will punish you seven times more for your sins .
and i will also destroy the great cities that make you proud . the skies will not give rain , and the earth will not produce crops .
you will work hard , but it will not help . your land will not give any crops , and your trees will not grow their fruit .
“ if you don ’ t learn your lesson after all this , and if you still turn against me ,
then i will also turn against you . i—yes , i myself—will punish you seven times for your sins .
“ if you still refuse to listen to me , and if you still turn against me ,
then i will really show my anger ! i—yes , i myself—will punish you seven times for your sins .
you will become so hungry that you will eat the bodies of your sons and daughters .
i will destroy your cities . i will make your holy places empty . i will stop smelling your offerings .
i will make your land empty . and your enemies who come to live there will be shocked at it .
during the time that the land is empty , it will get the time of rest that you did not give it while you lived there .
they will run as if someone is chasing them with a sword . they will fall over each other—even when no one is chasing them .
you will be lost in other nations . you will disappear in the land of your enemies .
so the survivors will rot away in their sin in their enemies ’ countries . they will rot away in their sins just as their ancestors did .
the lord said to moses ,
“ tell the israelites : you might promise to give someone to the lord as a servant . the priest must set a price for that person .
the price for a man from 20 to 60 years old is 50 shekels of silver . ( you must use the official measure for the silver . )
the price for a woman who is 20 to 60 years old is 30 shekels .
the price for a man from 5 to 20 years old is 20 shekels . for a woman the price is 10 shekels .
the price for a boy from one month to five years old is 5 shekels . for a girl , the price is 3 shekels .
the price for a man who is 60 years old or older is 15 shekels . the price for a woman is 10 shekels .
if you want to buy back the animal , then you must add one-fifth to the price .
but if you want to get the house back , you must add one-fifth to the price . then you will get the house back .
if you give your field to god during the year of jubilee , then its value will be whatever the priest decides .
if you want to buy the field back , you must add one-fifth to that price . then you will get the field back .
if you don ’ t buy the field back and the land is sold to someone else , you can not get the land back .
“ if you dedicate a field to the lord that you had bought , and it is not a part of your family ’ s property ,
then the priest must count the years to the year of jubilee and decide the price for the land . then that land will belong to the lord .
at the year of jubilee , the land will go to the family that originally owned the land .
“ you must use the official measure in paying these prices . the shekel by that measure weighs 20 gerahs .
if this gift is a person , that person can not be bought back . that person must be killed .
“ a tenth of all crops belongs to the lord . this means the crops from fields and the fruit from trees—a tenth belongs to the lord .
so if you want to get back your tenth , you must add one-fifth to its price and then buy it back .
“ the priests will take every tenth animal from a person ’ s cattle or sheep . every tenth animal will belong to the lord .
these are the commands that the lord gave moses at mount sinai for the israelites .
what they have written agrees with what we learned from the people who saw those events from the beginning . they also served god by telling people his message .
i studied it all carefully from the beginning . then i decided to write it down for you in an organized way .
i did this so that you can be sure that what you have been taught is true .
zechariah and elizabeth were both good people who pleased god . they did everything the lord commanded , always following his instructions completely .
but they had no children . elizabeth could not have a baby , and both of them were very old .
zechariah was serving as a priest before god for his group . it was his group ’ s time to serve .
there was a large crowd outside praying at the time the incense was offered .
then , on the right side of the incense table , an angel of the lord came and stood before zechariah .
when he saw the angel , zechariah was upset and very afraid .
you will be very happy , and many others will share your joy over his birth .
“ john will help many people of israel return to the lord their god .
outside , the people were still waiting for zechariah . they were surprised that he was staying so long in the temple .
when his time of service was finished , he went home .
later , zechariah ’ s wife elizabeth became pregnant . so she did not go out of her house for five months . she said ,
“ look what the lord has done for me ! he decided to help me . now people will stop thinking there is something wrong with me . ”
the angel came to her and said , “ greetings ! the lord is with you ; you are very special to him . ”
but mary was very confused about what the angel said . she wondered , “ what does this mean ? ”
the angel said to her , “ don ’ t be afraid , mary , because god is very pleased with you .
listen ! you will become pregnant and have a baby boy . you will name him jesus .
he will be great . people will call him the son of the most high god , and the lord god will make him king like his ancestor david .
he will rule over the people of jacob forever ; his kingdom will never end . ”
mary said to the angel , “ how will this happen ? i am still a virgin . ”
god can do anything ! ”
mary said , “ i am the lord ’ s servant . let this thing you have said happen to me ! ” then the angel went away .
mary got up and went quickly to a town in the hill country of judea .
she went into zechariah ’ s house and greeted elizabeth .
when elizabeth heard mary ’ s greeting , the unborn baby inside her jumped , and she was filled with the holy spirit .
in a loud voice she said to mary , “ god has blessed you more than any other woman . and god has blessed the baby you will have .
you are the mother of my lord , and you have come to me ! why has something so good happened to me ?
when i heard your voice , the baby inside me jumped with joy .
great blessings are yours because you believed what the lord said to you ! you believed this would happen . ”
i am very happy because god is my savior .
i am not important ,
yes , the powerful one has done great things for me .
he reached out his arm and showed his power .
he brought down rulers from their thrones
he filled the hungry with good things ,
god has helped israel—the people he chose to serve him .
he has done what he promised to our ancestors ,
mary stayed with elizabeth for about three months and then went home .
when it was time for elizabeth to give birth , she had a boy .
her neighbors and relatives heard that the lord was very good to her , and they were happy for her .
when the baby was eight days old , they came to circumcise him . they wanted to name him zechariah because this was his father ’ s name .
but his mother said , “ no , he will be named john . ”
the people said to elizabeth , “ but no one in your family has that name . ”
then they made signs to his father , “ what would you like to name him ? ”
zechariah asked for something to write on . then he wrote , “ his name is john. ” everyone was surprised .
then zechariah could talk again , and he began praising god .
and all their neighbors were afraid . in all the hill country of judea , people continued talking about these things .
then zechariah , john ’ s father , was filled with the holy spirit and told the people a message from god :
“ praise to the lord god of israel .
he has given us a powerful savior
this is what he promised
he will save us from our enemies
god said he would show mercy to our fathers ,
this was the promise he made to our father abraham ,
a promise to free us from the power of our enemies ,
in a way that is holy and right for as long as we live .
“ now you , little boy , will be called a prophet of the most high god .
you will make his people understand that they will be saved
“ with the loving mercy of our god ,
it will bring light to those who live in darkness , in the fear of death .
this was the first counting of all the people while quirinius was governor of syria .
everyone traveled to their own hometowns to have their name put on the list .
joseph registered with mary because she was engaged to marry him . ( she was now pregnant . )
while joseph and mary were in bethlehem , the time came for her to have the baby .
that night , some shepherds were out in the fields near bethlehem watching their sheep .
an angel of the lord appeared to them , and the glory of the lord was shining around them . the shepherds were very afraid .
the angel said to them , “ don ’ t be afraid . i have some very good news for you—news that will make everyone happy .
today your savior was born in david ’ s town . he is the messiah , the lord .
this is how you will know him : you will find a baby wrapped in pieces of cloth and lying in a feeding box . ”
then a huge army of angels from heaven joined the first angel , and they were all praising god , saying ,
“ praise god in heaven ,
so they went running and found mary and joseph . and there was the baby , lying in the feeding box .
when they saw the baby , they told what the angels said about this child .
everyone was surprised when they heard what the shepherds told them .
mary continued to think about these things , trying to understand them .
the holy spirit told him that he would not die before he saw the messiah from the lord .
simeon took the baby in his arms and thanked god :
“ now , lord , you can let me , your servant , die in peace as you said .
i have seen with my own eyes how you will save your people .
now all people can see your plan .
he is a light to show your way to the other nations .
jesus ’ father and mother were amazed at what simeon said about him .
so the secret thoughts of many will be made known . and the things that happen will be painful for you—like a sword cutting through your heart . ”
joseph and mary finished doing all the things that the law of the lord commanded . then they went home to nazareth , their own town in galilee .
the little boy jesus was developing into a mature young man , full of wisdom . god was blessing him .
every year jesus ’ parents went to jerusalem for the passover festival .
when jesus was twelve years old , they went to the festival as usual .
when the festival was over , they went home , but jesus stayed in jerusalem . his parents did not know about it .
they traveled for a whole day thinking that jesus was with them in the group . they began looking for him among their family and close friends ,
but they did not find him . so they went back to jerusalem to look for him there .
after three days they found him . jesus was sitting in the temple area with the religious teachers , listening and asking them questions .
everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and wise answers .
but they did not understand the meaning of what he said to them .
jesus went with them to nazareth and obeyed them . his mother was still thinking about all these things .
as jesus grew taller , he continued to grow in wisdom . god was pleased with him and so were the people who knew him .
it was the 15th year of the rule of tiberius caesar . these men were under caesar :
this is like the words written in the book of isaiah the prophet :
every valley will be filled ,
the ax is now ready to cut down the trees . every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire . ”
the people asked john , “ what should we do ? ”
he answered , “ if you have two shirts , share with someone who does not have one . if you have food , share that too . ”
even the tax collectors came to john . they wanted to be baptized . they said to him , “ teacher , what should we do ? ”
he told them , “ don ’ t take more taxes from people than you have been ordered to collect . ”
the soldiers asked him , “ what about us ? what should we do ? ”
everyone was hoping for the messiah to come , and they wondered about john . they thought , “ maybe he is the messiah . ”
john said many other things like this to encourage the people to change , and he told them the good news .
so herod added another bad thing to all his other wrongs : he put john in jail .
when all the people were being baptized , jesus came and was baptized too . and while he was praying , the sky opened ,
when jesus began to teach , he was about 30 years old . people thought that jesus was joseph ’ s son .
eli was the son of matthat .
joseph was the son of mattathias .
naggai was the son of maath .
joda was the son of joanan .
neri was the son of melchi .
er was the son of joshua .
levi was the son of simeon .
eliakim was the son of melea .
david was the son of jesse .
nahshon was the son of amminadab .
judah was the son of jacob .
nahor was the son of serug .
shelah was the son of cainan .
lamech was the son of methuselah .
cainan was the son of enos .
now filled with the holy spirit , jesus returned from the jordan river . and then the spirit led him into the desert .
there the devil tempted jesus for 40 days . jesus ate nothing during this time , and when it was finished , he was very hungry .
the devil said to him , “ if you are the son of god , tell this rock to become bread . ”
jesus answered , “ the scriptures say ,
then the devil took jesus and in a moment of time showed him all the kingdoms of the world .
i will give it all to you , if you will only worship me . ”
jesus answered , “ the scriptures say ,
it is also written ,
jesus answered , “ but the scriptures also say , ‘ you must not test the lord your god . ’ ”
the devil finished tempting jesus in every way and went away to wait until a better time .
jesus went back to galilee with the power of the spirit . stories about him spread all over the area around galilee .
he began to teach in the synagogues , and everyone praised him .
the book of isaiah the prophet was given to him . he opened the book and found the place where this is written :
“ the spirit of the lord is on me .
and to announce that the time has come for the lord to show his kindness . ”
jesus closed the book , gave it back to the helper , and sat down . as everyone in the synagogue watched him closely ,
he began to speak to them . he said , “ while you heard me reading these words just now , they were coming true ! ”
then he said , “ the truth is , a prophet is not accepted in his own hometown .
when the people in the synagogue heard this , they were very angry .
but he walked through the middle of the crowd and went away .
jesus went to capernaum , a city in galilee . on the sabbath day he taught the people .
they were amazed at his teaching because he spoke with authority .
in the synagogue there was a man who had an evil spirit from the devil inside him . the man shouted loudly ,
and so the news about jesus spread to every place in the whole area .
he stood very close to her and ordered the sickness to go away . the sickness left her , and she got up and began serving them .
then jesus told the good news in the synagogues in judea .
as jesus stood beside lake galilee , a crowd of people pushed to get closer to him and to hear the teachings of god .
jesus saw two boats at the shore of the lake . the fishermen were washing their nets .
the fishermen put their nets into the water . their nets were filled with so many fish that they began to break .
james and john , the sons of zebedee , were amazed too . ( james and john worked together with simon . )
the men brought their boats to the shore . they left everything and followed jesus .
jesus said , “ i want to heal you . be healed ! ” then he touched the man , and immediately the leprosy disappeared .
but the news about jesus spread more and more . many people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses .
jesus often went away to other places to be alone so that he could pray .
jesus saw how much faith they had and said to the sick man , “ friend , your sins are forgiven . ”
but jesus knew what they were thinking and said , “ why do you have these questions in your minds ?
the man immediately stood up in front of everyone . he picked up his mat and walked home , praising god .
levi got up , left everything , and followed jesus .
then levi gave a big dinner at his house for jesus . at the table there were many tax collectors and some other people too .
jesus answered them , “ it is the sick people who need a doctor , not those who are healthy .
i have not come to ask good people to change . i have come to ask sinners to change the way they live . ”
but the time will come when the groom will be taken away from them . then his friends will fast . ”
you always put new wine into new wineskins .
no one who drinks old wine wants new wine . they say , ‘ the old wine is just fine . ’ ”
some pharisees said , “ why are you doing that ? it is against the law of moses to do that on the sabbath day . ”
jesus answered , “ you have read about what david did when he and the people with him were hungry .
then jesus said to the pharisees , “ the son of man is lord over the sabbath day . ”
on another sabbath day jesus went into the synagogue and taught the people . a man with a crippled right hand was there .
a few days later , jesus went out to a mountain to pray . he stayed there all night praying to god .
the next morning he called his followers . he chose twelve of them and called them apostles . these are the ones he chose :
simon ( jesus named him peter ) ,
judas , the son of james ,
they all came to hear jesus teach and to be healed of their sicknesses . he healed the people who were troubled by evil spirits .
everyone was trying to touch him , because power was coming out from him . jesus healed them all .
jesus looked at his followers and said ,
great blessings belong to you who are hungry now .
“ but how bad it will be for you rich people ,
how bad it will be for you people who are full now ,
“ how bad it is when everyone says nothing but good about you . just look at the false prophets . their ancestors always said good things about them .
“ but i say to you people who are listening to me , love your enemies . do good to those who hate you .
ask god to bless the people who ask for bad things to happen to you . pray for the people who are mean to you .
give to everyone who asks you for something . when someone takes something that is yours , don ’ t ask for it back .
do for others what you want them to do for you .
“ if you love only those who love you , should you get any special praise for doing that ? no , even sinners love those who love them !
if you do good only to those who do good to you , should you get any special praise for doing that ? no , even sinners do that !
give love and mercy the same as your father gives love and mercy .
jesus told them this story : “ can a blind man lead another blind man ? no . both of them will fall into a ditch .
students are not better than their teacher . but when they have been fully taught , they will be like their teacher .
“ a good tree does not produce bad fruit . and a bad tree does not produce good fruit .
“ why do you call me , ‘ lord , lord , ’ but you don ’ t do what i say ?
the people who come to me , who listen to my teachings and obey them—i will show you what they are like :
jesus finished saying all these things to the people . then he went into capernaum .
in capernaum there was an army officer . he had a servant who was very sick ; he was near death . the officer loved the servant very much .
the men went to jesus . they begged jesus to help the officer . they said , “ this officer is worthy to have your help .
he loves our people and he built the synagogue for us . ”
that is why i did not come to you myself . you need only to give the order , and my servant will be healed .
the group that was sent to jesus went back to the house . there they found that the servant was healed .
the next day jesus and his followers went to a town called nain . a big crowd was traveling with them .
when the lord saw the woman , he felt very sorry for her and said , “ don ’ t cry . ”
then the boy sat up and began to talk , and jesus gave him back to his mother .
this news about jesus spread all over judea and to all the other places around there .
john ’ s followers told him about all these things . john called for two of his followers .
he sent them to the lord to ask , “ are you the one we heard was coming , or should we wait for someone else ? ”
right then jesus healed many people of their sicknesses and diseases . he healed those who had evil spirits and made many who were blind able to see again .
great blessings belong to those who don ’ t have a problem accepting me . ”
so what did you go out to see ? a prophet ? yes , john is a prophet . but i tell you , he is more than that .
this scripture was written about him :
i tell you , no one ever born is greater than john . but even the least important person in god ’ s kingdom is greater than john . ”
but the pharisees and experts in the law refused to accept god ’ s plan for themselves ; they did not let john baptize them . )
“ what shall i say about the people of this time ? what can i compare them to ? what are they like ?
they are like children sitting in the marketplace . one group of children calls to the other children and says ,
john the baptizer came and did not eat the usual food or drink wine . and you say , ‘ he has a demon inside him . ’
but wisdom is shown to be right by those who accept it . ”
one of the pharisees asked jesus to eat with him . jesus went into the pharisee ’ s house and took a place at the table .
in response , jesus said to the pharisee , “ simon , i have something to say to you . ”
simon answered , “ i think it would be the one who owed him the most money . ”
you did not greet me with a kiss , but she has been kissing my feet since i came in .
you did not honor me with oil for my head , but she rubbed my feet with her sweet-smelling oil .
then jesus said to her , “ your sins are forgiven . ”
the people sitting at the table began to think to themselves , “ who does this man think he is ? how can he forgive sins ? ”
jesus said to the woman , “ because you believed , you are saved from your sins . go in peace . ”
a large crowd came together . people came to jesus from every town , and he told them this story :
other seed fell on rock . it began to grow but then died because it had no water .
some other seed fell among thorny weeds . this seed grew , but later the weeds stopped the plants from growing .
the rest of the seed fell on good ground . this seed grew and made 100 times more grain . ”
jesus ’ followers asked him , “ what does this story mean ? ”
“ this is what the story means : the seed is god ’ s teaching .
everything that is hidden will become clear . every secret thing will be made known , and everyone will see it .
jesus ’ mother and brothers came to visit him . but they could not get close to him , because there were so many people .
someone said to jesus , “ your mother and your brothers are standing outside . they want to see you . ”
jesus answered them , “ my mother and my brothers are those who listen to god ’ s teaching and obey it . ”
one day jesus and his followers got into a boat . he said to them , “ come with me across the lake. ” and so they started across .
while they were sailing , jesus slept . a big storm blew across the lake , and the boat began to fill with water . they were in danger .
the followers went to jesus and woke him . they said , “ master ! master ! we will drown ! ”
he said to his followers , “ where is your faith ? ”
jesus and his followers sailed on across the lake . they sailed to the area where the gerasene people live , across from galilee .
jesus asked him , “ what is your name ? ”
the demons begged jesus not to send them into the bottomless pit .
the men who were caring for the pigs ran away and told the story in the fields and in the town .
the men who saw these things happen told the others all about how jesus made the man well .
all those who lived in the area around gerasa asked jesus to go away because they were afraid .
the man he had healed begged to go with him . but jesus sent him away , saying ,
“ go back home and tell people what god did for you . ”
when jesus went back to galilee , the people welcomed him . everyone was waiting for him .
a woman was there who had been bleeding for twelve years . she had spent all her money on doctors , but no doctor was able to heal her .
the woman came behind jesus and touched the bottom of his coat . at that moment , her bleeding stopped .
then jesus said , “ who touched me ? ”
but jesus said , “ someone touched me . i felt power go out from me . ”
jesus said to her , “ my daughter , you are made well because you believed . go in peace . ”
jesus heard this and said to jairus , “ don ’ t be afraid ! just believe and your daughter will be well . ”
jesus went to the house . he let only peter , john , james , and the girl ’ s father and mother go inside with him .
the people laughed at him , because they knew that the girl was dead .
but jesus held her hand and called to her , “ little girl , stand up ! ”
her spirit came back into her , and she stood up immediately . jesus said , “ give her something to eat . ”
the girl ’ s parents were amazed . he told them not to tell anyone about what happened .
jesus called his twelve apostles together . he gave them power to heal sicknesses and power to force demons out of people .
he sent them to tell about god ’ s kingdom and to heal the sick .
when you go into a house , stay there until it is time to leave .
if the people in the town will not welcome you , go outside the town and shake the dust off your feet as a warning to them . ”
so the apostles went out . they traveled through all the towns . they told the good news and healed people everywhere .
herod the ruler heard about all these things that were happening . he was confused because some people said , “ john the baptizer has risen from death . ”
others said , “ elijah has come to us. ” and some others said , “ one of the prophets from long ago has risen from death . ”
but jesus said to the apostles , “ you give them something to eat . ”
( there were about 5000 men there . )
so the followers did this and everyone sat down .
one time jesus was praying alone . his followers came together there , and he asked them , “ who do the people say i am ? ”
then jesus said to his followers , “ and who do you say i am ? ”
jesus warned them not to tell anyone .
any of you who try to save the life you have will lose it . but you who give up your life for me will save it .
it is worth nothing for you to have the whole world if you yourself are destroyed or lost .
believe me when i say that some of you people standing here will see god ’ s kingdom before you die . ”
about eight days after jesus said these things , he took peter , john , and james and went up on a mountain to pray .
while jesus was praying , his face began to change . his clothes became shining white .
then two men were there , talking with him . they were moses and elijah .
they also looked bright and glorious . they were talking with jesus about his death that would happen in jerusalem .
peter and the others were asleep . but they woke up and saw the glory of jesus . they also saw the two men who were standing with him .
while peter was saying these things , a cloud came all around them . peter , john , and james were afraid when the cloud covered them .
a voice came from the cloud and said , “ this is my son . he is the one i have chosen . obey him . ”
the next day , jesus , peter , john , and james came down from the mountain . a large group of people met jesus .
a man in the group shouted to him , “ teacher , please come and look at my son . he is the only child i have .
i begged your followers to make the evil spirit leave my son , but they could not do it . ”
all the people were amazed at the great power of god .
“ don ’ t forget what i will tell you now : the son of man will soon be handed over to the control of other men . ”
jesus ’ followers began to have an argument about which one of them was the greatest .
jesus knew what they were thinking , so he took a little child and stood the child beside him .
jesus said to him , “ don ’ t stop him . whoever is not against you is for you . ”
the time was coming near when jesus would leave and go back to heaven . he decided to go to jerusalem .
he sent some men ahead of him . they went into a town in samaria to make everything ready for him .
but the people there would not welcome jesus because he was going toward jerusalem .
but jesus turned and criticized them for saying this .
then he and his followers went to another town .
they were all traveling along the road . someone said to jesus , “ i will follow you anywhere you go . ”
jesus said to another man , “ follow me ! ”
but jesus said to him , “ let the people who are dead bury their own dead . you must go and tell about god ’ s kingdom . ”
another man said , “ i will follow you , lord , but first let me go and say goodbye to my family . ”
jesus said , “ anyone who begins to plow a field but looks back is not prepared for god ’ s kingdom . ”
“ you can go now . but listen ! i am sending you , and you will be like sheep among wolves .
don ’ t carry any money , a bag , or sandals . don ’ t stop to talk with people on the road .
before you go into a house , say , ‘ peace be with this home . ’
“ if you go into a town and the people welcome you , eat the food they give you .
heal the sick people who live there , and tell them , ‘ god ’ s kingdom is now very near you ! ’
“ but if you go into a town and the people don ’ t welcome you , then go out into the streets of that town and say ,
‘ even the dirt from your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you . but remember that god ’ s kingdom is coming soon . ’
i tell you , on the judgment day it will be worse for the people of that town than for the people of sodom .
but on the judgment day it will be worse for you than for tyre and sidon .
and you , capernaum , will you be lifted up to heaven ? no , you will be thrown down to the place of death !
jesus said to them , “ i saw satan falling like lightning from the sky .
then an expert in the law stood up to test jesus . he said , “ teacher , what must i do to get eternal life ? ”
jesus said to him , “ what is written in the law ? what do you understand from it ? ”
jesus said , “ your answer is right . do this and you will have eternal life . ”
but the man wanted to show that the way he was living was right . so he said to jesus , “ but who is my neighbor ? ”
then jesus said , “ which one of these three men do you think was really a neighbor to the man who was hurt by the robbers ? ”
the teacher of the law answered , “ the one who helped him . ”
while jesus and his followers were traveling , he went into a town , and a woman named martha let him stay at her house .
she had a sister named mary . mary was sitting at jesus ’ feet and listening to him teach .
but the lord answered her , “ martha , martha , you are getting worried and upset about too many things .
only one thing is important . mary has made the right choice , and it will never be taken away from her . ”
jesus said to the followers , “ this is how you should pray :
give us the food we need for each day .
yes , whoever continues to ask will receive . whoever continues to look will find . and whoever continues to knock will have the door opened for them .
do any of you have a son ? what would you do if your son asked you for a fish ? would any father give him a snake ?
or , if he asked for an egg , would you give him a scorpion ? of course not !
but some of the people said , “ he uses the power of satan to force demons out of people . satan is the ruler of demons . ”
some others there wanted to test jesus . they asked him to do a miracle as a sign from god .
so if satan is fighting against himself , how will his kingdom survive ? you say that i use the power of satan to force out demons .
but i use the power of god to force out demons . this shows that god ’ s kingdom has now come to you .
“ when a strong man with many weapons guards his own house , the things in his house are safe .
“ whoever is not with me is against me . and anyone who does not work with me is working against me .
when it comes back , it finds that home all neat and clean .
but jesus said , “ the people who hear the teaching of god and obey it—they are the ones who have god ’ s blessing . ”
so be careful ! don ’ t let the light in you become darkness .
after jesus had finished speaking , a pharisee asked jesus to eat with him . so he went and took a place at the table .
but the pharisee was surprised when he saw that jesus did not wash his hands first before the meal .
you are foolish ! the same one who made what is outside also made what is inside .
so pay attention to what is inside . give to the people who need help . then you will be fully clean .
it will be bad for you , because you are like hidden graves . people walk on them without knowing it . ”
it will be bad for you , because you build tombs for the prophets . but these are the same prophets your ancestors killed !
and now you show all people that you agree with what your ancestors did . they killed the prophets , and you build tombs for the prophets !
“ so you people who live now will be punished for the deaths of all the prophets who were killed since the beginning of the world .
they were trying to find a way to catch jesus saying something wrong .
everything that is hidden will be shown , and everything that is secret will be made known .
“ when birds are sold , five small birds cost only two pennies . but god does not forget any of them .
yes , god even knows how many hairs you have on your head . don ’ t be afraid . you are worth much more than many birds .
“ whoever says something against the son of man can be forgiven . but whoever speaks against the holy spirit will not be forgiven .
“ when men bring you into the synagogues before the leaders and other important men , don ’ t worry about what you will say .
the holy spirit will teach you at that time what you should say . ”
but jesus said to him , “ who said i should be your judge or decide how to divide your father ’ s things between you two ? ”
then jesus said to them , “ be careful and guard against all kinds of greed . people do not get life from the many things they own . ”
then jesus used this story : “ there was a rich man who had some land . his land grew a very good crop of food .
he thought to himself , ‘ what will i do ? i have no place to keep all my crops . ’
“ this is how it will be for anyone who saves things only for himself . to god that person is not rich . ”
life is more important than food , and the body is more important than what you put on it .
none of you can add any time to your life by worrying about it .
and if you can ’ t do the little things , why worry about the big things ?
“ so don ’ t always think about what you will eat or what you will drink . don ’ t worry about it .
that ’ s what all those people who don ’ t know god are always thinking about . but your father knows that you need these things .
what you should be thinking about is god ’ s kingdom . then he will give you all these other things you need .
“ don ’ t fear , little flock . your father wants to share his kingdom with you .
your heart will be where your treasure is .
“ be ready ! be fully dressed and have your lights shining .
“ what would a homeowner do if he knew when a thief was coming ? you know he would not let the thief break in .
so you also must be ready , because the son of man will come at a time when you don ’ t expect him ! ”
peter said , “ lord , did you tell this story for us or for all people ? ”
when the master comes and finds him doing the work he gave him , it will be a day of blessing for that servant !
i can tell you without a doubt , the master will choose that servant to take care of everything he owns .
jesus continued speaking : “ i came to bring fire to the world . i wish it were already burning !
there is a kind of baptism that i must suffer through . i feel very troubled until it is finished .
do you think i came to give peace to the world ? no , i came to divide the world !
from now on , a family of five will be divided , three against two , and two against three .
a father and son will be divided :
when you feel the wind begin to blow from the south , you say , ‘ it will be a hot day. ’ and you are right .
you hypocrites ! you can understand the weather . why don ’ t you understand what is happening now ?
“ why can ’ t you decide for yourselves what is right ?
i tell you , you will not get out of there until you have paid every cent you owe . ”
jesus answered , “ do you think this happened to those people because they were more sinful than all other people from galilee ?
no , they were not . but if you don ’ t decide now to change your lives , you will all be destroyed like those people !
and what about those 18 people who died when the tower of siloam fell on them ? do you think they were more sinful than everyone else in jerusalem ?
they were not . but i tell you if you don ’ t decide now to change your lives , you will all be destroyed too ! ”
maybe the tree will have fruit on it next year . if it still does not produce , then you can cut it down . ’ ”
jesus taught in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day .
when jesus saw her , he called to her , “ woman , you have been made free from your sickness ! ”
he laid his hands on her , and immediately she was able to stand up straight . she began praising god .
the lord answered , “ you people are hypocrites ! all of you untie your work animals and lead them to drink water every day—even on the sabbath day .
when jesus said this , all those who were criticizing him felt ashamed of themselves . and all the people were happy for the wonderful things he was doing .
then jesus said , “ what is god ’ s kingdom like ? what can i compare it to ?
jesus said again , “ what can i compare god ’ s kingdom with ?
it is like yeast that a woman mixes into a big bowl of flour to make bread . the yeast makes all the dough rise . ”
jesus was teaching in every town and village . he continued to travel toward jerusalem .
someone said to him , “ lord , how many people will be saved ? only a few ? ”
then you will say , ‘ we ate and drank with you . you taught in the streets of our town . ’
people will come from the east , west , north , and south . they will sit down at the table in god ’ s kingdom .
just then some pharisees came to jesus and said , “ go away from here and hide . herod wants to kill you ! ”
after that i must go , because all prophets should die in jerusalem .
on a sabbath day , jesus went to the home of a leading pharisee to eat with him . the people there were all watching him very closely .
a man with a bad disease was there in front of him .
jesus said to the pharisees and experts in the law , “ is it right or wrong to heal on the sabbath day ? ”
but they would not answer his question . so he took the man and healed him . then he sent the man away .
the pharisees and teachers of the law could say nothing against what he said .
then jesus noticed that some of the guests were choosing the best places to sit . so he told this story :
“ when someone invites you to a wedding , don ’ t sit in the most important seat . they may have invited someone more important than you .
everyone who makes themselves important will be made humble . but everyone who makes themselves humble will be made important . ”
instead , when you give a feast , invite the poor , the crippled , and the blind .
jesus said to him , “ a man gave a big dinner . he invited many people .
when it was time to eat , he sent his servant to tell the guests , ‘ come . the food is ready . ’
another man said , ‘ i have just bought five pairs of work animals ; i must go and try them out . please excuse me . ’
a third man said , ‘ i just got married ; i can ’ t come . ’
i tell you , not one of those people i invited first will eat any of this food i prepared . ’ ”
many people were traveling with jesus . he said to them ,
whoever will not carry the cross that is given to them when they follow me can not be my follower .
they would say , ‘ this man began to build , but he was not able to finish . ’
“ it is the same for each of you . you must leave everything you have to follow me . if not , you can not be my follower .
“ salt is a good thing . but if the salt loses its salty taste , you can ’ t make it salty again .
it is worth nothing . you can ’ t even use it as dirt or dung . people just throw it away .
many tax collectors and sinners came to listen to jesus .
then the pharisees and the teachers of the law began to complain , “ look , this man welcomes sinners and even eats with them ! ”
then jesus told them this story :
and when you find it , you will be very happy . you will carry it
home , go to your friends and neighbors and say to them , ‘ be happy with me because i found my lost sheep ! ’
in the same way , it ’ s a happy time for the angels of god when one sinner decides to change . ”
then jesus said , “ there was a man who had two sons .
after he spent everything he had , there was a terrible famine throughout the country . he was hungry and needed money .
so he went and got a job with one of the people who lived there . the man sent him into the fields to feed pigs .
he was so hungry that he wanted to eat the food the pigs were eating . but no one gave him anything .
i will leave and go to my father . i will say to him : father , i have sinned against god and have done wrong to you .
i am no longer worthy to be called your son . but let me be like one of your hired workers . ’
so he left and went to his father .
and bring our best calf and kill it so that we can celebrate with plenty to eat .
“ the older son had been out in the field . when he came near the house , he heard the sound of music and dancing .
so he called to one of the servant boys and asked , ‘ what does all this mean ? ’
“ the older son was angry and would not go in to the party . so his father went out and begged him to come in .
but then this son of yours comes home after wasting your money on prostitutes , and you kill the best calf for him ! ’
“ his father said to him , ‘ oh , my son , you are always with me , and everything i have is yours .
whoever can be trusted with small things can also be trusted with big things . whoever is dishonest in little things will be dishonest in big things too .
if you can not be trusted with worldly riches , you will not be trusted with the true riches .
and if you can not be trusted with the things that belong to someone else , you will not be given anything of your own .
the pharisees were listening to all these things . they criticized jesus because they all loved money .
but even the smallest part of a letter in the law can not be changed . it would be easier for heaven and earth to pass away .
there was also a very poor man named lazarus . lazarus ’ body was covered with sores . he was often put by the rich man ’ s gate .
lazarus wanted only to eat the scraps of food left on the floor under the rich man ’ s table . and the dogs came and licked his sores .
“ later , lazarus died . the angels took him and placed him in the arms of abraham . the rich man also died and was buried .
he was sent to the place of death and was in great pain . he saw abraham far away with lazarus in his arms .
“ the rich man said , ‘ then please , father abraham , send lazarus to my father ’ s house on earth .
i have five brothers . he could warn my brothers so that they will not come to this place of pain . ’
“ but abraham said , ‘ they have the law of moses and the writings of the prophets to read ; let them learn from that . ’
jesus said to his followers , “ things will surely happen that will make people sin . but it will be very bad for anyone who makes this happen .
even if they do something wrong to you seven times in one day , but they say they are sorry each time , you should forgive them . ”
the apostles said to the lord , “ give us more faith ! ”
the servant should not get any special thanks for doing his job . he is only doing what his master told him to do .
jesus was traveling to jerusalem . he went from galilee to samaria .
he came into a small town , and ten men met him there . they did not come close to him , because they all had leprosy .
but the men shouted , “ jesus ! master ! please help us ! ”
when jesus saw the men , he said , “ go and show yourselves to the priests . ”
when one of them saw that he was healed , he went back to jesus . he praised god loudly .
he bowed down at jesus ’ feet and thanked him . ( he was a samaritan . )
jesus said , “ ten men were healed ; where are the other nine ?
this man is not even one of our people . is he the only one who came back to give praise to god ? ”
then jesus said to the man , “ stand up ! you can go . you were healed because you believed . ”
some of the pharisees asked jesus , “ when will god ’ s kingdom come ? ”
“ when the son of man comes again , you will know it . on that day he will shine like lightning flashes across the sky .
but first , the son of man must suffer many things . the people of today will refuse to accept him .
“ when the son of man comes again , it will be the same as it was when noah lived .
people were eating , drinking , and getting married even on the day when noah entered the boat . then the flood came and killed them all .
they were doing these things even on the day when lot left town . then fire and sulfur rained down from the sky and killed them all .
this is exactly how it will be when the son of man comes again .
remember what happened to lot ’ s wife !
“ whoever tries to keep the life they have will lose it . but whoever gives up their life will save it .
that night there may be two people sleeping in one room . one will be taken and the other will be left .
there may be two women working together . one will be taken and the other will be left . ”
the followers asked jesus , “ where will this be , lord ? ”
then jesus taught the followers that they should always pray and never lose hope . he used this story to teach them :
“ once there was a judge in a town . he did not care about god . he also did not care what people thought about him .
the lord said , “ listen , there is meaning in what the bad judge said .
god ’ s people shout to him night and day , and he will always give them what is right . he will not be slow to answer them .
there were some people who thought they were very good and looked down on everyone else . jesus used this story to teach them :
“ one time there was a pharisee and a tax collector . one day they both went to the temple to pray .
i fast twice a week , and i give a tenth of everything i get ! ’
the truth is , you must accept god ’ s kingdom like a little child accepts things , or you will never enter it . ”
a religious leader asked jesus , “ good teacher , what must i do to get eternal life ? ”
jesus said to him , “ why do you call me good ? only god is good .
but the leader said , “ i have obeyed all these commands since i was a boy . ”
when jesus saw that the man was sad , he said , “ it will be very hard for rich people to enter god ’ s kingdom .
it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter god ’ s kingdom . ”
when the people heard this , they said , “ then who can be saved ? ”
jesus answered , “ god can do things that are not possible for people to do . ”
peter said , “ look , we left everything we had and followed you . ”
jesus said , “ i can promise that everyone who has left their home , wife , brothers , parents , or children for god ’ s kingdom
he will be handed over to the foreigners , who will laugh at him , insult him , and spit on him .
they will beat him with whips and then kill him . but on the third day after his death , he will rise to life again . ”
the apostles tried to understand this , but they could not ; the meaning was hidden from them .
jesus came near the city of jericho . there was a blind man sitting beside the road . he was begging people for money .
when he heard the people coming down the road , he asked , “ what is happening ? ”
they told him , “ jesus , the one from nazareth , is coming here . ”
the blind man was excited and said , “ jesus , son of david , please help me ! ”
jesus stopped there and said , “ bring that man to me ! ” when he came close , jesus asked him ,
“ what do you want me to do for you ? ”
jesus said to him , “ you can see now . you are healed because you believed . ”
then the man was able to see . he followed jesus , thanking god . everyone who saw this praised god for what happened .
jesus was going through the city of jericho .
in jericho there was a man named zacchaeus . he was a wealthy , very important tax collector .
he wanted to see who jesus was . there were many others who wanted to see jesus too . zacchaeus was too short to see above the people .
so he ran to a place where he knew jesus would come . then he climbed a sycamore tree so he could see him .
zacchaeus hurried and came down . he was happy to have jesus in his house .
everyone saw this . they began to complain , “ look at the kind of man jesus is staying with . zacchaeus is a sinner ! ”
the son of man came to find lost people and save them . ”
the first servant came and said , ‘ sir , i earned ten bags of money with the one bag you gave me . ’
“ the second servant said , ‘ sir , with your one bag of money i earned five bags . ’
the king said to this servant , ‘ you can rule over five cities . ’
“ the men said to the king , ‘ but sir , that servant already has ten bags of money . ’
after jesus said these things , he continued traveling toward jerusalem .
he came near bethphage and bethany , towns near the hill called the mount of olives . he sent out two of his followers .
if anyone asks you why you are taking the donkey , you should say , ‘ the master needs it . ’ ”
the two followers went into town . they found the donkey exactly like jesus told them .
they untied it , but its owners came out . they said to the followers , “ why are you untying our donkey ? ”
the followers answered , “ the master needs it . ”
so the followers brought the donkey to jesus . they put their coats on its back . then they put jesus on the donkey .
he rode along the road toward jerusalem . the followers spread their coats on the road before him .
some of the pharisees said to jesus , “ teacher , tell your followers not to say these things . ”
but jesus answered , “ i tell you , if my followers didn ’ t say them , these stones would shout them . ”
jesus came near jerusalem . looking at the city , he began to cry for it
and said , “ i wish you knew today what would bring you peace . but it is hidden from you now .
a time is coming when your enemies will build a wall around you and hold you in on all sides .
jesus went into the temple area . he began to throw out the people who were selling things there .
but they did not know how they could do it , because everyone was listening to him . the people were very interested in what jesus said .
they said , “ tell us what authority you have to do these things . who gave you this authority ? ”
jesus answered , “ i will ask you a question too . tell me :
when john baptized people , did his authority come from god or was it only from other people ? ”
so they answered , “ we don ’ t know the answer . ”
so jesus said to them , “ then i will not tell you who gave me the authority to do these things . ”
so the man sent another servant . they beat this servant too and showed no respect for him . they sent the servant away with nothing .
so the man sent a third servant to the farmers . they hurt this servant badly and threw him out .
so the farmers threw the son out of the vineyard and killed him .
he will come and kill those farmers . then he will lease the land to some other farmers . ”
but jesus looked into their eyes and said , “ then what does this verse mean :
everyone who falls on that stone will be broken . if that stone falls on you , it will crush you ! ”
tell us , is it right for us to pay taxes to caesar or not ? ”
but jesus knew that these men were trying to trick him . he said to them ,
“ show me a silver coin . whose name and picture are on it ? ”
he said to them , “ then give to caesar what belongs to caesar , and give to god what belongs to god . ”
some sadducees came to jesus . ( sadducees believe that people will not rise from death . ) they asked him ,
one time there were seven brothers . the first brother married a woman but died . he had no children .
then the second brother married the woman , and he died .
and the third brother married the woman , and he died . the same thing happened with all the other brothers . they all died and had no children .
the woman was the last to die .
but all seven brothers married her . so when people rise from death , whose wife will this woman be ? ”
jesus said to the sadducees , “ on earth , people marry each other .
some people will be worthy to be raised from death and live again after this life . in that life they will not marry .
in that life people are like angels and can not die . they are children of god , because they have been raised from death .
so they were not still dead , because he is the god only of living people . yes , to god they are all still living . ”
some of the teachers of the law said , “ teacher , your answer was very good . ”
no one was brave enough to ask him another question .
then jesus said , “ why do people say that the messiah is the son of david ?
in the book of psalms , david himself says ,
and i will put your enemies under your power . ’
david calls the messiah ‘ lord. ’ so how can the messiah also be david ’ s son ? ”
while all the people were listening to jesus , he said to his followers ,
but they cheat widows and take their homes . then they try to make themselves look good by saying long prayers . god will punish them very much . ”
jesus looked up and saw some rich people putting their gifts to god into the temple collection box .
then he saw a poor widow put two small copper coins into the box .
he said , “ this poor widow gave only two small coins . but the truth is , she gave more than all those rich people .
some followers asked jesus , “ teacher , when will these things happen ? what will show us that it is time for these things to happen ? ”
when you hear about wars and riots , don ’ t be afraid . these things must happen first . then the end will come later . ”
then jesus said to them , “ nations will fight against other nations . kingdoms will fight against other kingdoms .
but this will give you an opportunity to tell about me .
decide now not to worry about what you will say .
i will give you the wisdom to say things that none of your enemies can answer .
even your parents , brothers , relatives , and friends will turn against you . they will have some of you killed .
everyone will hate you because you follow me .
but none of these things can really harm you .
you will save yourselves by continuing strong in your faith through all these things .
“ you will see armies all around jerusalem . then you will know that the time for its destruction has come .
the prophets wrote many things about the time when god will punish his people . the time i am talking about is when all these things must happen .
they will be afraid and worried about what will happen to the world . everything in the sky will be changed .
then people will see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
when these things begin to happen , stand up tall and don ’ t be afraid . know that it is almost time for god to free you ! ”
then jesus told this story : “ look at all the trees . the fig tree is a good example .
when it turns green , you know that summer is very near .
in the same way , when you see all these things happening , you will know that god ’ s kingdom is very near .
“ i assure you that all these things will happen while some of the people of this time are still living .
the whole world , earth and sky , will be destroyed , but my words will last forever .
it will come as a surprise to everyone on earth .
during the day jesus taught the people in the temple area . at night he went out of the city and stayed all night on the mount of olives .
every morning all the people got up early to go listen to jesus at the temple .
it was almost time for the jewish festival of unleavened bread , called the passover .
one of jesus ’ twelve apostles was named judas iscariot . satan entered him ,
the priests were very happy about this . they promised to give judas money for doing this .
the day of unleavened bread came . this was the day when the jews always killed the lambs for the passover .
jesus said to peter and john , “ go and prepare the passover meal for us to eat . ”
they said to him , “ where do you want us to prepare the meal ? ”
“ when you go into the city , you will see a man carrying a jar of water . follow him . he will go into a house .
tell the owner of the house , ‘ the teacher asks that you please show us the room where he and his followers can eat the passover meal . ’
then the owner will show you a large room upstairs that is ready for us . prepare the meal there . ”
so peter and john left . everything happened the way jesus said . so they prepared the passover meal .
the time came for them to eat the passover meal . jesus and the apostles were together at the table .
jesus said to them , “ i wanted very much to eat this passover meal with you before i die .
i will never eat another passover meal until it is given its full meaning in god ’ s kingdom . ”
then jesus took a cup of wine . he gave thanks to god for it and said , “ take this cup and give it to everyone here .
i will never drink wine again until god ’ s kingdom comes . ”
jesus said , “ but here on this table is the hand of the one who will hand me over to my enemies .
then the apostles asked each other , “ which one of us would do that ? ”
later , the apostles began to argue about which one of them was the most important .
“ you men have stayed with me through many struggles .
so i give you authority to rule with me in the kingdom the father has given me .
you will eat and drink at my table in that kingdom . you will sit on thrones and judge the twelve tribes of israel .
“ satan has asked to test you men like a farmer tests his wheat . o simon , simon ,
i have prayed that you will not lose your faith ! help your brothers be stronger when you come back to me . ”
but peter said to jesus , “ lord , i am ready to go to jail with you . i will even die with you ! ”
then jesus said to the apostles , “ remember when i sent you out without money , a bag , or sandals ? did you need anything ? ”
the followers said , “ look , lord , here are two swords . ”
then jesus went about 50 steps away from them . he knelt down and prayed ,
then an angel from heaven came to help him .
jesus was full of pain ; he struggled hard in prayer . sweat dripped from his face like drops of blood falling to the ground .
when he finished praying , he went to his followers . he found them asleep , worn out from their grieving .
jesus said to them , “ why are you sleeping ? get up and pray for strength against temptation . ”
but jesus said to him , “ judas , are you using the kiss of friendship to hand over the son of man to his enemies ? ”
the followers of jesus were standing there too . they saw what was happening and said to jesus , “ lord , should we use our swords ? ”
and one of them did use his sword . he cut off the right ear of the servant of the high priest .
jesus said , “ stop ! ” then he touched the servant ’ s ear and healed him .
they arrested jesus and took him away to the house of the high priest . peter followed jesus but stayed back at a distance .
the soldiers started a fire in the middle of the yard and sat together . peter sat with them .
but peter said this was not true . he said , “ lady , i don ’ t know him . ”
a short time later , someone else saw peter and said , “ you are also one of them . ”
but peter said , “ man , i don ’ t know what you are talking about ! ”
then peter went outside and cried bitterly .
the men guarding jesus made fun of him and beat him .
and they shouted all kinds of insults at him .
they said , “ if you are the messiah , then tell us that you are . ”
and if i ask you , you will not answer .
but beginning now , the son of man will sit at the right side of god all-powerful . ”
they all said , “ then are you the son of god ? ” jesus said to them , “ you are right in saying that i am . ”
they said , “ why do we need witnesses now ? we all heard what he said ! ”
then the whole group stood up and led jesus away to pilate .
pilate asked jesus , “ are you the king of the jews ? ”
pilate said to the leading priests and the people , “ i find nothing wrong with this man . ”
but they kept on saying , “ his teaching is causing trouble all over judea . he began in galilee , and now he is here ! ”
pilate heard this and asked if jesus was from galilee .
he learned that jesus was under herod ’ s authority . herod was in jerusalem at that time , so pilate sent jesus to him .
he asked him many questions , but jesus said nothing .
the leading priests and teachers of the law were standing there shouting things against jesus .
in the past pilate and herod had always been enemies . but on that day they became friends .
pilate called all the people together with the leading priests and the jewish leaders .
herod didn ’ t find him guilty either . he sent him back to us . look , he has done nothing bad enough for the death penalty .
so , after i punish him a little , i will let him go free . ”
but they all shouted , “ kill him ! let barabbas go free ! ”
( barabbas was a man who was in jail for starting a riot in the city and for murder . )
pilate wanted to let jesus go free . so again pilate told them that he would let him go .
but they shouted again , “ kill him ! kill him on a cross ! ”
but the people continued to shout . they demanded that jesus be killed on a cross . their shouting got so loud that
pilate decided to give them what they wanted .
a large crowd followed jesus . some of the women were sad and crying . they felt sorry for him .
but jesus turned and said to the women , “ women of jerusalem , don ’ t cry for me . cry for yourselves and for your children too .
then the people will say to the mountains , ‘ fall on us ! ’ they will say to the hills , ‘ cover us ! ’
if this can happen to someone who is good , what will happen to those who are guilty ? ”
there were also two criminals led out with jesus to be killed .
jesus said , “ father , forgive them . they don ’ t know what they are doing . ”
even the soldiers laughed at jesus and made fun of him . they came and offered him some sour wine .
they said , “ if you are the king of the jews , save yourself ! ”
( at the top of the cross these words were written : “ this is the king of the jews . ” )
but the other criminal stopped him . he said , “ you should fear god . all of us will die soon .
you and i are guilty . we deserve to die because we did wrong . but this man has done nothing wrong . ”
then he said , “ jesus , remember me when you begin ruling as king ! ”
then jesus said to him , “ i promise you , today you will be with me in paradise . ”
it was about noon , but it turned dark throughout the land until three o ’ clock in the afternoon ,
because the sun stopped shining . the curtain in the temple was torn into two pieces .
jesus shouted , “ father , i put my life in your hands ! ” after jesus said this , he died .
the army officer there saw what happened . he praised god , saying , “ i know this man was a good man ! ”
many people had come out of the city to see all this . when they saw it , they felt very sorry and left .
he went to pilate and asked for the body of jesus .
it was late on preparation day . when the sun went down , the sabbath day would begin .
the women who had come from galilee with jesus followed joseph . they saw the tomb . inside they saw where he put jesus ’ body .
then they left to prepare some sweet-smelling spices to put on the body .
very early sunday morning , the women came to the tomb where jesus ’ body was laid . they brought the sweet-smelling spices they had prepared .
they saw that the heavy stone that covered the entrance had been rolled away .
they went in , but they did not find the body of the lord jesus .
they did not understand this . while they were wondering about it , two men in shining clothes stood beside them .
jesus is not here . he has risen from death . do you remember what he said in galilee ?
then the women remembered what jesus had said .
the women left the tomb and went to the eleven apostles and the other followers . they told them everything that happened at the tomb .
these women were mary magdalene , joanna , mary , the mother of james , and some others . they told the apostles everything that happened .
but the apostles did not believe what they said . it sounded like nonsense .
that same day two of jesus ’ followers were going to a town named emmaus . it is about seven miles from jerusalem .
they were talking about everything that had happened .
while they were talking , discussing these things , jesus himself came near and walked with them .
( but the two men were not allowed to recognize jesus . )
he asked them , “ what ’ s this i hear you discussing with each other as you walk ? ”
the one named cleopas said , “ you must be the only person in jerusalem who doesn ’ t know what has just happened there . ”
jesus said , “ what are you talking about ? ”
but our leaders and the leading priests handed him over to be judged and killed . they nailed him to a cross .
we were hoping that he would be the one to free israel . but then all this happened .
but today some of our women told us an amazing thing . early this morning they went to the tomb where the body of jesus was laid .
then jesus said to the two men , “ you are foolish and slow to realize what is true . you should believe everything the prophets said .
the prophets said the messiah must suffer these things before he begins his time of glory . ”
they came near the town of emmaus , and jesus acted as if he did not plan to stop there .
joining them at the supper table , jesus took some bread and gave thanks . then he broke some off and gave it to them .
just then the men were allowed to recognize him . but when they saw who he was , he disappeared .
said , “ the lord really has risen from death ! he appeared to simon . ”
then the two men told what had happened on the road . they talked about how they recognized jesus when he shared the bread with them .
this surprised the followers . they were afraid . they thought they were seeing a ghost .
but jesus said , “ why are you troubled ? why do you doubt what you see ?
after jesus told them this , he showed them his hands and his feet .
they gave him a piece of cooked fish .
while the followers watched , he took the fish and ate it .
then jesus helped the followers understand these scriptures about him .
jesus said to them , “ it is written that the messiah would be killed and rise from death on the third day .
remember that i will send you the one my father promised . stay in the city until you are given that power from heaven . ”
jesus led his followers out of jerusalem almost to bethany . he raised his hands and blessed his followers .
while he was blessing them , he was separated from them and carried into heaven .
they worshiped him and went back to jerusalem very happy .
they stayed at the temple all the time , praising god .
this is a message from the lord to israel . god used malachi to tell this message to the people .
the lord said , “ i love you people . ”
and i did not accept esau . i destroyed his hill country . his country was destroyed , and now only wild dogs live there . ”
the people of edom might say , “ we were destroyed , but we will go back and rebuild our cities . ”
you people saw these things , and you said , “ the lord is great , even outside of israel ! ”
“ you bring unclean bread to my altar .
“ priests , this rule is for you .
the lord will remove them from judah ’ s family . they might bring gifts to the lord all-powerful—but it will not help .
then the lord will accept the gifts from judah and jerusalem . it will be as it was in the past—as the time long ago .
“ i am the lord , and i don ’ t change . you are jacob ’ s children , and you have not been completely destroyed .
“ people should not steal things from god , but you stole things from me .
in this way your whole nation has stolen things from me , so bad things are happening to you . ”
i will not let pests destroy your crops . all your grapevines will produce grapes. ” this is what the lord all-powerful said .
“ people from other nations will be good to you . you will have a wonderful country. ” this is what the lord all-powerful said .
the lord says , “ you said cruel things to me . ”
we think proud people are happy . evil people succeed . they do evil things to test god ’ s patience , and god does not punish them . ”
“ look , i will send elijah the prophet to you . he will come before that great and terrible time of judgment from the lord .
the good news about jesus the messiah , the son of god , begins
with what the prophet isaiah said would happen . he wrote :
“ there is someone shouting in the desert :
john wore clothes made from camel ’ s hair and a leather belt around his waist . he ate locusts and wild honey .
i baptize you with water , but the one who is coming will baptize you with the holy spirit . ”
about that time jesus came from the town of nazareth in galilee to the place where john was . john baptized jesus in the jordan river .
as jesus was coming up out of the water , he saw the sky torn open . the spirit came down on him like a dove .
a voice came from heaven and said , “ you are my son , the one i love . i am very pleased with you . ”
then the spirit sent jesus into the desert alone .
he was there for 40 days , being tempted by satan . during this time he was out among the wild animals . then angels came and helped him .
after john was put in prison , jesus went into galilee and told people the good news from god .
so they immediately left their nets and followed jesus .
jesus and his followers went to capernaum . on the sabbath day , jesus went into the synagogue and taught the people .
they were amazed at his teaching . he did not teach like their teachers of the law . he taught like someone with authority .
while jesus was in the synagogue , a man was there who had an evil spirit inside him . the man shouted ,
“ jesus of nazareth ! what do you want with us ? did you come to destroy us ? i know who you are—god ’ s holy one ! ”
jesus , his voice full of warning , said , “ be quiet , and come out of him ! ”
the evil spirit made the man shake . then the spirit made a loud noise and came out of him .
so the news about jesus spread quickly everywhere in the area of galilee .
jesus and the followers left the synagogue . they all went with james and john to the home of simon and andrew .
simon ’ s mother-in-law was very sick . she was in bed and had a fever . the people there told jesus about her .
that night , after the sun went down , the people brought to jesus many who were sick . they also brought those who had demons inside them .
everyone in the town gathered at the door of that house .
later , simon and his friends went to look for jesus .
they found him and said , “ everyone is looking for you ! ”
so jesus traveled everywhere in galilee . he spoke in the synagogues , and he forced demons out of people .
these last words made jesus angry . but he touched him and said , “ i want to heal you . be healed ! ”
immediately the leprosy disappeared , and the man was healed .
jesus told the man to go , but he gave him a strong warning :
a few days later , jesus came back to capernaum . the news spread that he was back home .
some people brought a paralyzed man to see him . he was being carried by four of them .
when jesus saw how much faith they had , he said to the paralyzed man , “ young man , your sins are forgiven . ”
some of the teachers of the law were sitting there . they saw what jesus did , and they said to themselves ,
“ why does this man say things like that ? what an insult to god ! no one but god can forgive sins . ”
jesus knew immediately what these teachers of the law were thinking . so he said to them , “ why do you have these questions in your minds ?
“ i tell you , stand up . take your mat and go home . ”
jesus went to the lake again , and many people followed him there . so jesus taught them .
but the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them . then they will fast .
on the sabbath day , jesus and his followers were walking through some grain fields . the followers picked some grain to eat .
some pharisees said to jesus , “ why are your followers doing this ? it is against the law to pick grain on the sabbath . ”
jesus answered , “ you have read what david did when he and the people with him were hungry and needed food .
then jesus said to the pharisees , “ the sabbath day was made to help people . people were not made to be ruled by the sabbath .
so the son of man is lord of every day , even the sabbath . ”
another time jesus went into the synagogue . in the synagogue there was a man with a crippled hand .
jesus said to the man with the crippled hand , “ stand up here so that everyone can see you . ”
then the pharisees left and made plans with the herodians about a way to kill jesus .
jesus went away with his followers to the lake . a large crowd of people from galilee followed them .
he had healed many of them , so all the sick people were pushing toward him to touch him .
but jesus gave the spirits a strong warning not to tell anyone who he was .
then jesus went up on a hill and invited those he wanted to go with him . so they joined him there .
he also wanted them to have the power to force demons out of people .
these are the names of the twelve men jesus chose :
james and his brother john , the sons of zebedee ( the ones jesus named boanerges , which means “ sons of thunder ” ) ,
judas iscariot ( the one who handed jesus over to his enemies ) .
then jesus went home , but again a large crowd gathered there . there were so many people that he and his followers could not eat .
his family heard about all these things . they went to get him because people said he was crazy .
so jesus called them together and talked to them using some stories . he said , “ satan will not force his own demons out of people .
a kingdom that fights against itself will not survive .
and a family that is divided will not survive .
if satan is against himself and is fighting against his own people , he will not survive . that would be the end of satan .
but anyone who speaks against the holy spirit will never be forgiven . they will always be guilty of that sin . ”
jesus said this because the teachers of the law had accused him of having an evil spirit inside him .
then jesus ’ mother and brothers came . they stood outside and sent someone in to tell him to come out .
many people were sitting around jesus . they said to him , “ your mother , your brothers , and your sisters are waiting for you outside . ”
jesus asked , “ who is my mother ? who are my brothers ? ”
then he looked at the people sitting around him and said , “ these people are my mother and my brothers !
my true brother and sister and mother are those who do what god wants . ”
jesus used stories to teach them many things . one of his lessons included this story :
“ listen ! a farmer went out to sow seed .
while he was scattering the seed , some of it fell by the road . the birds came and ate all that seed .
other seed fell on rocky ground , where there was not enough dirt . it grew quickly there because the soil was not deep .
but then the sun rose and the plants were burned . they died because they did not have deep roots .
some other seed fell among thorny weeds . the weeds grew and stopped the good plants from growing . so they did not make grain .
then jesus said , “ you people who hear me , listen ! ”
later , jesus was away from the people . the twelve apostles and his other followers asked him about the stories .
jesus said , “ only you can know the secret truth about god ’ s kingdom . but to those other people i tell everything by using stories .
i do this so that
then jesus said to the followers , “ do you understand this story ? if you don ’ t , how will you understand any story ?
the farmer is like someone who plants god ’ s teaching in people .
“ other people are like the seed planted on rocky ground . they hear the teaching , and they quickly and gladly accept it .
“ others are like the seed planted among the thorny weeds . they hear the teaching ,
everything that is hidden will be made clear . every secret thing will be made known .
you people who hear me , listen !
the people who have some understanding will receive more . but those who do not have much will lose even the small amount they have . ”
then jesus said , “ god ’ s kingdom is like a man who plants seed in the ground .
without any help the ground produces grain . first the plant grows , then the head , and then all the grain in the head .
when the grain is ready , the man cuts it . this is the harvest time . ”
then jesus said , “ what can i use to show you what god ’ s kingdom is like ? what story can i use to explain it ?
god ’ s kingdom is like a mustard seed , which is smaller than any other seed on earth that you can plant .
jesus used many stories like these to teach the people . he taught them all they could understand .
he always used stories to teach them . but when he was alone with his followers , jesus explained everything to them .
that day , at evening , jesus said to his followers , “ come with me across the lake . ”
so they left the crowd behind and went with jesus in the boat he was already in . there were also other boats that went with them .
a very bad wind came up on the lake . the waves were coming over the sides and into the boat , and it was almost full of water .
he said to his followers , “ why are you afraid ? do you still have no faith ? ”
they were very afraid and asked each other , “ what kind of man is this ? even the wind and the water obey him ! ”
jesus and his followers went across the lake to the area where the gerasene people lived .
he lived in the burial caves . no one could keep him tied up , even with chains .
many times people had put chains on his hands and feet , but he broke the chains . no one was strong enough to control him .
day and night he stayed around the burial caves and on the hills . he would scream and cut himself with rocks .
while jesus was still far away , the man saw him . he ran to jesus and bowed down before him .
then jesus asked the man , “ what is your name ? ”
the spirits inside the man begged jesus again and again not to send them out of that area .
a large herd of pigs was eating on a hill near there .
the evil spirits begged jesus , “ send us to the pigs . let us go into them . ”
then the people began to beg jesus to leave their area .
jesus was preparing to leave in the boat . the man who was now free from the demons begged to go with him .
so the man left and told the people in the ten towns about the great things jesus did for him . everyone was amazed .
jesus went back to the other side of the lake in the boat . there , a large crowd of people gathered around him on the shore .
a leader of the synagogue came . his name was jairus . he saw jesus and bowed down before him .
so jesus went with jairus . many people followed jesus . they were pushing very close around him .
there among the people was a woman who had been bleeding for the past twelve years .
the woman heard about jesus , so she followed him with the other people and touched his coat .
she thought , “ if i can just touch his clothes , that will be enough to heal me . ”
as soon as she touched his coat , her bleeding stopped . she felt that her body was healed from all the suffering .
jesus immediately felt power go out from him , so he stopped and turned around . “ who touched my clothes ? ” he asked .
the followers said to jesus , “ there are so many people pushing against you . but you ask , ‘ who touched me ? ’ ”
but jesus continued looking for the one who touched him .
he said to her , “ dear woman , you are made well because you believed . go in peace . you will not suffer anymore . ”
but jesus did not care what the men said . he said to the synagogue leader , “ don ’ t be afraid ; just believe . ”
jesus let only peter , james , and john the brother of james go with him .
they went to the synagogue leader ’ s house , where jesus saw many people crying loudly . there was a lot of confusion .
but everyone laughed at him .
the girl immediately stood up and began walking . ( she was twelve years old . ) the father and mother and the followers were amazed .
jesus gave the father and mother very strict orders not to tell people about this . then he told them to give the girl some food to eat .
jesus left and went back to his hometown . his followers went with him .
jesus was not able to do any miracles there except the healing of some sick people by laying his hands on them .
he was surprised that the people there had no faith . then he went to other villages in that area and taught .
jesus called his twelve apostles together . he sent them out in groups of two and gave them power over evil spirits .
this is what he told them : “ take nothing for your trip except a stick for walking . take no bread , no bag , and no money .
you can wear sandals , but don ’ t take extra clothes .
when you enter a house , stay there until you leave that town .
the apostles left and went to other places . they talked to the people and told them to change their hearts and lives .
they forced many demons out of people and put olive oil on many who were sick and healed them .
other people said , “ he is elijah . ”
herod heard these things about jesus . he said , “ i killed john by cutting off his head . now he has been raised from death ! ”
john told herod , “ it is not right for you to be married to your brother ’ s wife . ”
so herodias hated john . she wanted him dead , but she was not able to persuade herod to kill him .
the daughter of herodias came to the party and danced . when she danced , herod and the people eating with him were very pleased .
he promised her , “ anything you ask for i will give to you—even half of my kingdom . ”
the girl went to her mother and asked , “ what should i ask king herod to give me ? ”
king herod was very sad , but he didn ’ t want to break the promise he had made to her in front of his guests .
he brought the head back on a plate and gave it to the girl , and the girl gave it to her mother .
john ’ s followers heard about what happened , so they came and got john ’ s body and put it in a tomb .
the apostles jesus had sent out came back to him . they gathered around him and told him about all they had done and taught .
so jesus and his followers went away alone . they went in a boat to a place where no one lived .
so send the people away . they need to go to the farms and towns around here to buy some food to eat . ”
but jesus answered , “ you give them some food to eat . ”
jesus asked them , “ how many loaves of bread do you have now ? go and see . ”
then jesus said to them , “ tell everyone to sit in groups on the green grass . ”
so all the people sat in groups . there were about 50 or 100 people in each group .
they all ate until they were full .
after they finished eating , the followers filled twelve baskets with the pieces of bread and fish that were left .
there were about 5000 men there who ate .
after he said goodbye to them , he went up into the hills to pray .
that night , the boat was still in the middle of the lake . jesus was alone on the land .
but the followers saw jesus walking on the water . they thought he was a ghost , and they started screaming .
when he got into the boat with the followers , the wind stopped . the followers were completely amazed .
they could not believe what happened . it was like the miracle he did with the bread . they still didn ’ t understand what that meant .
jesus and his followers went across the lake and came to shore at gennesaret . they tied the boat there .
when they were out of the boat , the people there saw jesus . they knew who he was ,
so they ran to tell others throughout that area . they brought sick people on mats to every place jesus went .
some pharisees and some teachers of the law came from jerusalem and gathered around jesus .
they saw that some of his followers ate food with hands that were not clean , meaning that they did not wash their hands in a special way .
jesus answered , “ you are all hypocrites . isaiah was right when he wrote these words from god about you :
their worship of me is worthless .
you have stopped following god ’ s commands , preferring instead the man-made rules you got from others . ”
then he said , “ you show great skill in avoiding the commands of god so that you can follow your own teachings !
you are telling people that they do not have to do anything for their father or mother .
jesus called the people to him again . he said , “ everyone should listen to me and understand what i am saying .
there is nothing people can put in their mouth that will make them wrong . people are made wrong by what comes from inside them . ”
then jesus left the people and went into the house . the followers asked jesus about what he had told the people .
he said , “ do you still have trouble understanding ? surely you know that nothing that enters the mouth from the outside can make people unacceptable to god .
and jesus said , “ the things that make people wrong are the things that come from the inside .
all these bad things begin inside a person , in the mind : bad thoughts , sexual sins , stealing , murder ,
these evil things come from inside a person . and these are the things that make people unacceptable to god . ”
she was not a jew . she was born in phoenicia , an area in syria . she begged jesus to force the demon out of her daughter .
then he told her , “ that is a very good answer . you may go . the demon has left your daughter . ”
the woman went home and found her daughter lying on the bed . the demon was gone .
then jesus left the area around tyre and went through sidon . on his way to lake galilee he went through the area of the ten towns .
jesus looked up to the sky and with a loud sigh he said , “ ephphatha ! ” ( this means “ open ! ” )
as soon as jesus did this , the man was able to hear . he was able to use his tongue , and he began to speak clearly .
jesus told the people not to tell anyone about this . but the more he told them not to say anything , the more people they told .
another time there were many people with jesus . the people had nothing to eat . so he called his followers to him and said ,
“ i feel sorry for these people . they have been with me for three days , and now they have nothing to eat .
jesus ’ followers answered , “ but we are far away from any towns . where can we get enough bread to feed all these people ? ”
then jesus asked them , “ how many loaves of bread do you have ? ”
the followers also had a few small fish . jesus gave thanks for the fish and told them to give the fish to the people .
they all ate until they were full . then the followers filled seven baskets with the pieces of food that were left .
there were about 4000 men who ate . after they ate , jesus told them to go home .
then he went in a boat with his followers to the area of dalmanutha .
the pharisees came to jesus and asked him questions . they wanted to test him . so they asked him to do a miracle as a sign from god .
then jesus left them and went in the boat to the other side of the lake .
the followers had only one loaf of bread with them in the boat . they forgot to bring more bread .
jesus warned them , “ be careful ! guard against the yeast of the pharisees and the yeast of herod . ”
the followers discussed the meaning of this . they said , “ he said this because we have no bread . ”
i divided five loaves of bread for 5000 people . remember how many baskets you filled with pieces of food that were not eaten ? ”
“ and when i divided seven loaves of bread for 4000 people , how many baskets did you fill with the leftover pieces ? ”
then he said to them , “ you remember these things i did , but you still don ’ t understand ? ”
jesus and his followers came to bethsaida . some people brought a blind man to him and begged him to touch the man .
the man looked up and said , “ yes , i see people . they look like trees walking around . ”
jesus told him to go home . he said , “ don ’ t go into the town . ”
they answered , “ some people say you are john the baptizer . others say you are elijah . and others say you are one of the prophets . ”
then jesus asked , “ who do you say i am ? ”
jesus told the followers , “ don ’ t tell anyone who i am . ”
jesus told them everything that would happen . he did not keep anything secret .
it is worth nothing for you to have the whole world if you yourself are lost .
you could never pay enough to buy back your life .
his clothes became shining white—whiter than anyone on earth could make them .
then two men were there talking with jesus . they were elijah and moses .
peter did not know what to say , because he and the other two followers were so afraid .
the followers looked , but they saw only jesus there alone with them .
so the followers waited to say anything about what they saw . but they discussed among themselves what jesus meant about rising from death .
they asked him , “ why do the teachers of the law say that elijah must come first ? ”
when the people saw jesus , they were very surprised and ran to welcome him .
jesus asked , “ what are you arguing about with the teachers of the law ? ”
a man answered , “ teacher , i brought my son to you . he is controlled by an evil spirit that keeps him from talking .
jesus asked the boy ’ s father , “ how long has this been happening to him ? ”
jesus said to the father , “ why did you say ‘ if you can ’ ? all things are possible for the one who believes . ”
immediately the father shouted , “ i do believe . help me to believe more ! ”
but jesus took hold of his hand and helped him stand up .
jesus answered , “ that kind of spirit can be forced out only with prayer . ”
then jesus and his followers left there and went through galilee . jesus did not want the people to know where they were .
but the followers did not understand what he meant , and they were afraid to ask him .
but the followers did not answer , because their argument on the road was about which one of them was the greatest .
then jesus took a small child and stood the child in front of the followers . he held the child in his arms and said ,
“ whoever accepts children like these in my name is accepting me . and anyone who accepts me is also accepting the one who sent me . ”
jesus said , “ don ’ t stop him . whoever uses my name to do powerful things will not soon say bad things about me .
whoever is not against us is with us .
i can assure you that anyone who helps you by giving you a drink of water because you belong to the messiah will definitely get a reward .
the worms that eat the people in hell never die . the fire there is never stopped .
“ everyone will be salted with fire .
jesus answered , “ what did moses command you to do ? ”
the pharisees said , “ moses allowed a man to divorce his wife by writing a certificate of divorce . ”
jesus said , “ moses wrote that command for you because you refused to accept god ’ s teaching .
but when god made the world , ‘ he made people male and female . ’
‘ that is why a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife .
and the two people will become one. ’ so they are no longer two , but one .
god has joined them together , so no one should separate them . ”
later , when the followers and jesus were in the house , they asked him again about the question of divorce .
he said , “ whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman has sinned against his wife . he is guilty of adultery .
and the woman who divorces her husband and marries another man is also guilty of adultery . ”
the truth is , you must accept god ’ s kingdom like a little child accepts things , or you will never enter it . ”
then jesus held the children in his arms . he laid his hands on them and blessed them .
jesus answered , “ why do you call me good ? only god is good .
the man said , “ teacher , i have obeyed all these commands since i was a boy . ”
then jesus looked at his followers and said to them , “ it will be very hard for a rich person to enter god ’ s kingdom ! ”
the followers were amazed at what jesus said . but he said again , “ my children , it is very hard to enter god ’ s kingdom !
it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter god ’ s kingdom ! ”
the followers were even more amazed and said to each other , “ then who can be saved ? ”
jesus looked at them and said , “ that is something people can not do , but god can . he can do anything . ”
peter said to jesus , “ we left everything to follow you ! ”
then james and john , sons of zebedee , came to jesus and said , “ teacher , we want to ask you to do something for us . ”
jesus asked , “ what do you want me to do for you ? ”
the sons answered , “ yes , we can ! ”
but it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or my left . god has prepared those places for the ones he chooses . ”
when the other ten followers heard this , they were angry with james and john .
but it should not be that way with you . whoever wants to be your leader must be your servant .
whoever wants to be first must serve the rest of you like a slave .
he heard that jesus from nazareth was walking by . so he began shouting , “ jesus , son of david , please help me ! ”
many people criticized the blind man and told him to be quiet . but he shouted more and more , “ son of david , please help me ! ”
jesus stopped and said , “ tell him to come here . ”
the blind man stood up quickly . he left his coat there and went to jesus .
jesus asked the man , “ what do you want me to do for you ? ”
jesus said , “ go . you are healed because you believed. ” immediately the man was able to see again . he followed jesus down the road .
if anyone asks you why you are taking the donkey , tell them , ‘ the master needs it . he will send it back soon . ’ ”
the followers went into the town . they found a young donkey tied in the street near the door of a house , and they untied it .
some people were standing there and saw this . they asked , “ what are you doing ? why are you untying that donkey ? ”
the followers answered the way jesus told them , and the people let them take the donkey .
the followers brought the donkey to jesus . they put their coats on it , and jesus sat on it .
many people spread their coats on the road for jesus . others cut branches in the fields and spread the branches on the road .
some of them were walking ahead of jesus . others were walking behind him . everyone shouted ,
“ god bless the kingdom of our father david .
the next day , jesus was leaving bethany . he was hungry .
so jesus said to the tree , “ people will never eat fruit from you again. ” his followers heard him say this .
he refused to allow anyone to carry things through the temple area .
that night jesus and his followers left the city .
jesus answered , “ have faith in god .
so i tell you to ask for what you want in prayer . and if you believe that you have received those things , then they will be yours .
they said , “ tell us ! what authority do you have to do these things ? who gave you this authority ? ”
jesus answered , “ i will ask you a question . you answer my question . then i will tell you whose authority i use to do these things .
tell me : when john baptized people , did his authority come from god or was it only from other people ? answer me . ”
so the leaders answered jesus , “ we don ’ t know the answer . ”
“ later , it was time for the grapes to be picked . so the man sent a servant to the farmers to get his share of the grapes .
but the farmers grabbed the servant and beat him . they sent him away with nothing .
then the man sent another servant to the farmers . they hit this servant on the head , showing no respect for him .
so they took the son , threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him .
“ so what will the man who owns the vineyard do ? he will go and kill those farmers . then he will lease the land to others .
surely you have read this in the scriptures :
the lord did this ,
later , the jewish leaders sent some pharisees and some men from the group called herodians to jesus . they wanted to catch him saying something wrong .
then some sadducees came to jesus . ( sadducees believe that no one will rise from death . ) they asked him a question :
there were seven brothers . the first brother married but died . he had no children .
so the second brother married the woman . but he also died and had no children . the same thing happened with the third brother .
all seven brothers married the woman and died . none of the brothers had any children with her . and she was the last to die .
but all seven brothers had married her . so at the time when people rise from death , whose wife will she be ? ”
when people rise from death , there will be no marriage . people will not be married to each other . all people will be like angels in heaven .
so they were not still dead , because he is the god only of living people . you sadducees are so wrong ! ”
jesus answered , “ the most important command is this : ‘ people of israel , listen ! the lord our god is the only lord .
love the lord your god with all your heart , all your soul , all your mind , and all your strength . ’
the second most important command is this : ‘ love your neighbor the same as you love yourself. ’ these two commands are the most important . ”
jesus was teaching in the temple area . he asked , “ why do the teachers of the law say that the messiah is the son of david ?
with the help of the holy spirit , david himself says ,
david himself calls the messiah ‘ lord. ’ so how can the messiah be david ’ s son ? ” many people listened to jesus and were very pleased .
they love to have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets .
but they cheat widows and take their homes . then they try to make themselves look good by saying long prayers . god will punish them very much . ”
jesus sat near the temple collection box and watched as people put money into it . many rich people put in a lot of money .
then a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins , worth less than a penny .
jesus was leaving the temple area . one of his followers said to him , “ teacher , look how big those stones are ! what beautiful buildings ! ”
“ tell us when these things will happen . and what will show us it is time for them to happen ? ”
jesus said to them , “ be careful ! don ’ t let anyone fool you .
many people will come and use my name . they will say , ‘ i am the messiah , ’ and they will fool many people .
before the end comes , the good news must be told to all nations .
all people will hate you because you follow me . but those who remain faithful to the end will be saved .
if someone is in the field , they must not go back to get a coat .
“ during that time it will be hard for women who are pregnant or have small babies .
pray that these things will not happen in winter ,
false messiahs and false prophets will come and do miracles and wonders , trying to fool the people god has chosen , if that is possible .
so be careful . now i have warned you about all this before it happens .
“ during the days following that time of trouble ,
the stars will fall from the sky ,
the former treatise i made , o theophilus , concerning all that jesus began both to do and to teach ,
until the day in which he was received up , after that he had given commandment through the holy spirit unto the apostles whom he had chosen :
for john indeed baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized in the holy spirit not many days hence .
they therefore , when they were come together , asked him , saying , lord , dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to israel ?
and he said unto them , it is not for you to know times or seasons , which the father hath set within his own authority .
and when he had said these things , as they were looking , he was taken up ; and a cloud received him out of their sight .
and while they were looking stedfastly into heaven as he went , behold two men stood by them in white apparel ;
then returned they unto jerusalem from the mount called olivet , which is nigh unto jerusalem , a sabbath day ’ s journey off .
these all with one accord continued stedfastly in prayer , with the women , and mary the mother of jesus , and with his brethren .
for he was numbered among us , and received his portion in this ministry .
for it is written in the book of psalms ,
of the men therefore that have companied with us all the time that the lord jesus went in and went out among us ,
and they put forward two , joseph called barsabbas , who was surnamed justus , and matthias .
and they prayed , and said , thou , lord , who knowest the hearts of all men , show of these two the one whom thou hast chosen ,
to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which judas fell away , that he might go to his own place .
and they gave lots for them ; and the lot fell upon matthias ; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles .
and when the day of pentecost was now come , they were all together in one place .
and suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind , and it filled all the house where they were sitting .
and there appeared unto them tongues parting asunder , like as of fire ; and it sat upon each one of them .
and they were all filled with the holy spirit , and began to speak with other tongues , as the spirit gave them utterance .
now there were dwelling at jerusalem jews , devout men , from every nation under heaven .
and when this sound was heard , the multitude came together , and were confounded , because that every man heard them speaking in his own language .
and they were all amazed and marvelled , saying , behold , are not all these that speak galilaeans ?
and how hear we , every man in our own language wherein we were born ?
parthians and medes and elamites , and the dwellers in mesopotamia , in judaea and cappadocia , in pontus and asia ,
in phrygia and pamphylia , in egypt and the parts of libya about cyrene , and sojourners from rome , both jews and proselytes ,
cretans and arabians , we hear them speaking in our tongues the mighty works of god .
and they were all amazed , and were perplexed , saying one to another , what meaneth this ?
but others mocking said , they are filled with new wine .
for these are not drunken , as ye suppose ; seeing it is but the third hour of the day ;
but this is that which hath been spoken through the prophet joel :
and it shall be in the last days , saith god ,
yea and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days
and i will show wonders in the heaven above ,
the sun shall be turned into darkness ,
and it shall be , that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved .
him , being delivered up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god , ye by the hand of lawless men did crucify and slay :
whom god raised up , having loosed the pangs of death : because it was not possible that he should be holden of it .
for david saith concerning him ,
therefore my heart was glad , and my tongue rejoiced ;
because thou wilt not leave my soul unto hades ,
thou madest known unto me the ways of life ;
he foreseeing this spake of the resurrection of the christ , that neither was he left unto hades , nor did his flesh see corruption .
this jesus did god raise up , whereof we all are witnesses .
for david ascended not into the heavens : but he saith himself ,
till i make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet .
let all the house of israel therefore know assuredly , that god hath made him both lord and christ , this jesus whom ye crucified .
and with many other words he testified , and exhorted them , saying , save yourselves from this crooked generation .
they then that received his word were baptized : and there were added unto them in that day about three thousand souls .
and they continued stedfastly in the apostles ’ teaching and fellowship , in the breaking of bread and the prayers .
and fear came upon every soul : and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles .
and all that believed were together , and had all things common ;
and they sold their possessions and goods , and parted them to all , according as any man had need .
praising god , and having favor with all the people . and the lord added to them day by day those that were saved .
now peter and john were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer , being the ninth hour .
who seeing peter and john about to go into the temple , asked to receive an alms .
and peter , fastening his eyes upon him , with john , said , look on us .
and he gave heed unto them , expecting to receive something from them .
and he took him by the right hand , and raised him up : and immediately his feet and his ankle-bones received strength .
and leaping up , he stood , and began to walk ; and he entered with them into the temple , walking , and leaping , and praising god .
and all the people saw him walking and praising god :
and as he held peter and john , all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called solomon ’ s , greatly wondering .
but ye denied the holy and righteous one , and asked for a murderer to be granted unto you ,
and killed the prince of life ; whom god raised from the dead ; whereof we are witnesses .
and now , brethren , i know that in ignorance ye did it , as did also your rulers .
but the things which god foreshowed by the mouth of all the prophets , that his christ should suffer , he thus fulfilled .
and that he may send the christ who hath been appointed for you , even jesus :
and it shall be , that every soul that shall not hearken to that prophet , shall be utterly destroyed from among the people .
yea and all the prophets from samuel and them that followed after , as many as have spoken , they also told of these days .
unto you first god , having raised up his servant , sent him to bless you , in turning away every one of you from your iniquities .
and as they spake unto the people , the priests and the captain of the temple and the sadducees came upon them ,
being sore troubled because they taught the people , and proclaimed in jesus the resurrection from the dead .
and they laid hands on them , and put them in ward unto the morrow : for it was now eventide .
but many of them that heard the word believed ; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in jerusalem ;
and annas the high priest was there , and caiaphas , and john , and alexander , and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest .
and when they had set them in the midst , they inquired , by what power , or in what name , have ye done this ?
then peter , filled with the holy spirit , said unto them , ye rulers of the people , and elders ,
if we this day are examined concerning a good deed done to an impotent man , by what means this man is made whole ;
he is the stone which was set at nought of you the builders , which was made the head of the corner .
and in none other is there salvation : for neither is there any other name under heaven , that is given among men , wherein we must be saved .
and seeing the man that was healed standing with them , they could say nothing against it .
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
but that it spread no further among the people , let us threaten them , that they speak henceforth to no man in this name .
and they called them , and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus .
for we can not but speak the things which we saw and heard .
for the man was more than forty years old , on whom this miracle of healing was wrought .
and being let go , they came to their own company , and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto them .
who by the holy spirit , by the mouth of our father david thy servant , didst say ,
the kings of the earth set themselves in array ,
to do whatsoever thy hand and thy council foreordained to come to pass .
and now , lord , look upon their threatenings : and grant unto thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness ,
while thou stretchest forth thy hand to heal ; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy servant jesus .
and with great power gave the apostles their witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus : and great grace was upon them all .
and laid them at the apostles ’ feet : and distribution was made unto each , according as any one had need .
having a field , sold it , and brought the money and laid it at the apostles ’ feet .
but a certain man named ananias , with sapphira his wife , sold a possession ,
and ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost : and great fear came upon all that heard it .
and the young men arose and wrapped him round , and they carried him out and buried him .
and it was about the space of three hours after , when his wife , not knowing what was done , came in .
and peter answered unto her , tell me whether ye sold the land for so much . and she said , yea , for so much .
and great fear came upon the whole church , and upon all that heard these things .
and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people : and they were all with one accord in solomon ’ s porch .
but of the rest durst no man join himself to them : howbeit the people magnified them ;
and believers were the more added to the lord , multitudes both of men and women :
and laid hands on the apostles , and put them in public ward .
but an angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors , and brought them out , and said ,
go ye , and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life .
but the officers that came found them not in the prison ; and they returned , and told ,
now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words , they were much perplexed concerning them whereunto this would grow .
and there came one and told them , behold , the men whom ye put in the prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people .
then went the captain with the officers , and brought them , but without violence ; for they feared the people , lest they should be stoned .
and when they had brought them , they set them before the council . and the high priest asked them ,
but peter and the apostles answered and said , we must obey god rather than men .
the god of our fathers raised up jesus , whom ye slew , hanging him on a tree .
him did god exalt with his right hand to be a prince and a saviour , to give repentance to israel , and remission of sins .
and we are witnesses of these things ; and so is the holy spirit , whom god hath given to them that obey him .
but they , when they heard this , were cut to the heart , and were minded to slay them .
and he said unto them , ye men of israel , take heed to yourselves as touching these men , what ye are about to do .
but if it is of god , ye will not be able to overthrow them ; lest haply ye be found even to be fighting against god .
they therefore departed from the presence of the council , rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name .
and every day , in the temple and at home , they ceased not to teach and to preach jesus as the christ .
but we will continue stedfastly in prayer , and in the ministry of the word .
whom they set before the apostles : and when they had prayed , they laid their hands upon them .
and stephen , full of grace and power , wrought great wonders and signs among the people .
and they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake .
then they suborned men , who said , we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses , and against god .
and set up false witnesses , who said , this man ceaseth not to speak words against this holy place , and the law :
for we have heard him say , that this jesus of nazareth shall destroy this place , and shall change the customs which moses delivered unto us .
and all that sat in the council , fastening their eyes on him , saw his face as it had been the face of an angel .
and the high priest said , are these things so ?
and said unto him , get thee out of thy land , and from thy kindred , and come into the land which i shall show thee .
and the patriarchs , moved with jealousy against joseph , sold him into egypt : and god was with him ,
now there came a famine over all egypt and canaan , and great affliction : and our fathers found no sustenance .
but when jacob heard that there was grain in egypt , he sent forth our fathers the first time .
and at the second time joseph was made known to his brethren ; and joseph ’ s race became manifest unto pharaoh .
and joseph sent , and called to him jacob his father , and all his kindred , threescore and fifteen souls .
and jacob went down into egypt ; and he died , himself and our fathers ;
and they were carried over unto shechem , and laid in the tomb that abraham bought for a price in silver of the sons of hamor in shechem .
but as the time of the promise drew nigh which god vouchsafed unto abraham , the people grew and multiplied in egypt ,
till there arose another king over egypt , who knew not joseph .
the same dealt craftily with our race , and ill-treated our fathers , that they should cast out their babes to the end they might not live .
at which season moses was born , and was exceeding fair ; and he was nourished three months in his father ’ s house :
and when he was cast out , pharaoh ’ s daughter took him up , and nourished him for her own son .
and moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the egyptians ; and he was mighty in his words and works .
but when he was well-nigh forty years old , it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of israel .
and seeing one of them suffer wrong , he defended him , and avenged him that was oppressed , smiting the egyptian :
and he supposed that his brethren understood that god by his hand was giving them deliverance ; but they understood not .
but he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away , saying , who made thee a ruler and a judge over us ?
wouldest thou kill me , as thou killedst the egyptian yesterday ?
and moses fled at this saying , and became a sojourner in the land of midian , where he begat two sons .
and when forty years were fulfilled , an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sinai , in a flame of fire in a bush .
and when moses saw it , he wondered at the sight : and as he drew near to behold , there came a voice of the lord ,
i am the god of thy fathers , the god of abraham , and of isaac , and of jacob . and moses trembled , and durst not behold .
and the lord said unto him , loose the shoes from thy feet : for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground .
this man led them forth , having wrought wonders and signs in egypt , and in the red sea , and in the wilderness forty years .
this is that moses , who said unto the children of israel , a prophet shall god raise up unto you from among your brethren , like unto me .
to whom our fathers would not be obedient , but thrust him from them , and turned back in their hearts unto egypt ,
and they made a calf in those days , and brought a sacrifice unto the idol , and rejoiced in the works of their hands .
but god turned , and gave them up to serve the host of heaven ; as it is written in the book of the prophets ,
and ye took up the tabernacle of moloch ,
who found favor in the sight of god , and asked to find a habitation for the god of jacob .
but solomon built him a house .
howbeit the most high dwelleth not in houses made with hands ; as saith the prophet ,
the heaven is my throne ,
did not my hand make all these things ?
ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears , ye do always resist the holy spirit : as your fathers did , so do ye .
ye who received the law as it was ordained by angels , and kept it not .
now when they heard these things , they were cut to the heart , and they gnashed on him with their teeth .
and said , behold , i see the heavens opened , and the son of man standing on the right hand of god .
but they cried out with a loud voice , and stopped their ears , and rushed upon him with one accord ;
and they cast him out of the city , and stoned him : and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named saul .
and they stoned stephen , calling upon the lord , and saying , lord jesus , receive my spirit .
and saul was consenting unto his death .
and devout men buried stephen , and made great lamentation over him .
but saul laid waste the church , entering into every house , and dragging men and women committed them to prison .
they therefore that were scattered abroad went about preaching the word .
and philip went down to the city of samaria , and proclaimed unto them the christ .
and the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by philip , when they heard , and saw the signs which he did .
and there was much joy in that city .
to whom they all gave heed , from the least to the greatest , saying , this man is that power of god which is called great .
and they gave heed to him , because that of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries .
but when they believed philip preaching good tidings concerning the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
and simon also himself believed : and being baptized , he continued with philip ; and beholding signs and great miracles wrought , he was amazed .
now when the apostles that were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god , they sent unto them peter and john :
who , when they were come down , prayed for them , that they might receive the holy spirit :
for as yet it was fallen upon none of them : only they had been baptized into the name of the lord jesus .
then laid they their hands on them , and they received the holy spirit .
now when simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles ’ hands the holy spirit was given , he offered them money ,
saying , give me also this power , that on whomsoever i lay my hands , he may receive the holy spirit .
but peter said unto him , thy silver perish with thee , because thou hast thought to obtain the gift of god with money .
thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter : for thy heart is not right before god .
repent therefore of this thy wickedness , and pray the lord , if perhaps the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee .
for i see that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity .
and simon answered and said , pray ye for me to the lord , that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me .
they therefore , when they had testified and spoken the word of the lord , returned to jerusalem , and preached the gospel to many villages of the samaritans .
and he was returning and sitting in his chariot , and was reading the prophet isaiah .
and the spirit said unto philip , go near , and join thyself to this chariot .
and philip ran to him , and heard him reading isaiah the prophet , and said , understandest thou what thou readest ?
and he said , how can i , except some one shall guide me ? and he besought philip to come up and sit with him .
now the passage of the scripture which he was reading was this ,
in his humiliation his judgment was taken away :
and the eunuch answered philip , and said , i pray thee , of whom speaketh the prophet this ? of himself , or of some other ?
and philip opened his mouth , and beginning from this scripture , preached unto him jesus .
and he commanded the chariot to stand still : and they both went down into the water , both philip and the eunuch ; and he baptized him .
but philip was found at azotus : and passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities , till he came to caesarea .
but saul , yet breathing threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the lord , went unto the high priest ,
and as he journeyed , it came to pass that he drew nigh unto damascus : and suddenly there shone round about him a light out of heaven :
and he fell upon the earth , and heard a voice saying unto him , saul , saul , why persecutest thou me ?
and he said , who art thou , lord ? and he said , i am jesus whom thou persecutest :
but rise , and enter into the city , and it shall be told thee what thou must do .
and the men that journeyed with him stood speechless , hearing the voice , but beholding no man .
and he was three days without sight , and did neither eat nor drink .
and he hath seen a man named ananias coming in , and laying his hands on him , that he might receive his sight .
but ananias answered , lord , i have heard from many of this man , how much evil he did to thy saints at jerusalem :
and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call upon thy name .
for i will show him how many things he must suffer for my name ’ s sake .
and straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales , and he received his sight ; and he arose and was baptized ;
and he took food and was strengthened .
and straightway in the synagogues he proclaimed jesus , that he is the son of god .
but saul increased the more in strength , and confounded the jews that dwelt at damascus , proving that this is the christ .
and when many days were fulfilled , the jews took counsel together to kill him :
but their plot became known to saul . and they watched the gates also day and night that they might kill him :
but his disciples took him by night , and let him down through the wall , lowering him in a basket .
and he was with them going in and going out at jerusalem ,
preaching boldly in the name of the lord : and he spake and disputed against the grecian jews ; but they were seeking to kill him .
and when the brethren knew it , they brought him down to caesarea , and sent him forth to tarsus .
and it came to pass , as peter went throughout all parts , he came down also to the saints that dwelt at lydda .
and there he found a certain man named aeneas , who had kept his bed eight years ; for he was palsied .
and peter said unto him , aeneas , jesus christ healeth thee : arise , and make thy bed . and straightway he arose .
and all that dwelt at lydda and in sharon saw him , and they turned to the lord .
and he gave her his hand , and raised her up ; and calling the saints and widows , he presented her alive .
and it became known throughout all joppa : and many believed on the lord .
and it came to pass , that he abode many days in joppa with one simon a tanner .
now there was a certain man in caesarea , cornelius by name , a centurion of the band called the italian band ,
a devout man , and one that feared god with all his house , who gave much alms to the people , and prayed to god always .
and now send men to joppa , and fetch one simon , who is surnamed peter :
he lodgeth with one simon a tanner , whose house is by the sea side .
and when the angel that spake unto him was departed , he called two of his household-servants , and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually ;
and having rehearsed all things unto them , he sent them to joppa .
and he became hungry , and desired to eat : but while they made ready , he fell into a trance ;
and he beholdeth the heaven opened , and a certain vessel descending , as it were a great sheet , let down by four corners upon the earth :
wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts and creeping things of the earth and birds of the heaven .
and there came a voice to him , rise , peter ; kill and eat .
but peter said , not so , lord ; for i have never eaten anything that is common and unclean .
and a voice came unto him again the second time , what god hath cleansed , make not thou common .
and this was done thrice : and straightway the vessel was received up into heaven .
and called and asked whether simon , who was surnamed peter , were lodging there .
and while peter thought on the vision , the spirit said unto him , behold , three men seek thee .
but arise , and get thee down , and go with them , nothing doubting : for i have sent them .
and peter went down to the men , and said , behold , i am he whom ye seek : what is the cause wherefore ye are come ?
so he called them in and lodged them .
and on the morrow they entered into caesarea . and cornelius was waiting for them , having called together his kinsmen and his near friends .
and when it came to pass that peter entered , cornelius met him , and fell down at his feet , and worshipped him .
but peter raised him up , saying , stand up ; i myself also am a man .
and as he talked with him , he went in , and findeth many come together :
wherefore also i came without gainsaying , when i was sent for . i ask therefore with what intent ye sent for me .
and saith , cornelius , thy prayer is heard , and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of god .
and peter opened his mouth , and said ,
but in every nation he that feareth him , and worketh righteousness , is acceptable to him .
the word which he sent unto the children of israel , preaching good tidings of peace by jesus christ ( he is lord of all ) —
that saying ye yourselves know , which was published throughout all judaea , beginning from galilee , after the baptism which john preached ;
him god raised up the third day , and gave him to be made manifest ,
to him bear all the prophets witness , that through his name every one that believeth on him shall receive remission of sins .
while peter yet spake these words , the holy spirit fell on all them that heard the word .
for they heard them speak with tongues , and magnify god . then answered peter ,
can any man forbid the water , that these should not be baptized , who have received the holy spirit as well as we ?
and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of jesus christ . then prayed they him to tarry certain days .
now the apostles and the brethren that were in judaea heard that the gentiles also had received the word of god .
and when peter was come up to jerusalem , they that were of the circumcision contended with him ,
saying , thou wentest in to men uncircumcised , and didst eat with them .
but peter began , and expounded the matter unto them in order , saying ,
and i heard also a voice saying unto me , rise , peter ; kill and eat .
but i said , not so , lord : for nothing common or unclean hath ever entered into my mouth .
but a voice answered the second time out of heaven , what god hath cleansed , make not thou common .
and this was done thrice : and all were drawn up again into heaven .
and behold , forthwith three men stood before the house in which we were , having been sent from caesarea unto me .
who shall speak unto thee words , whereby thou shalt be saved , thou and all thy house .
and as i began to speak , the holy spirit fell on them , even as on us at the beginning .
and i remembered the word of the lord , how he said , john indeed baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized in the holy spirit .
and when they heard these things , they held their peace , and glorified god , saying , then to the gentiles also hath god granted repentance unto life .
and the hand of the lord was with them : and a great number that believed turned unto the lord .
and the report concerning them came to the ears of the church which was in jerusalem : and they sent forth barnabas as far as antioch :
for he was a good man , and full of the holy spirit and of faith : and much people was added unto the lord .
and he went forth to tarsus to seek for saul ;
now in these days there came down prophets from jerusalem unto antioch .
and the disciples , every man according to his ability , determined to send relief unto the brethren that dwelt in judaea :
which also they did , sending it to the elders by the hand of barnabas and saul .
now about that time herod the king put forth his hands to afflict certain of the church .
and he killed james the brother of john with the sword .
and when he saw that it pleased the jews , he proceeded to seize peter also . and those were the days of unleavened bread .
peter therefore was kept in the prison : but prayer was made earnestly of the church unto god for him .
and he went out , and followed ; and he knew not that it was true which was done by the angel , but thought he saw a vision .
and when he knocked at the door of the gate , a maid came to answer , named rhoda .
and when she knew peter ’ s voice , she opened not the gate for joy , but ran in , and told that peter stood before the gate .
and they said unto her , thou art mad . but she confidently affirmed that it was even so . and they said , it is his angel .
but peter continued knocking : and when they had opened , they saw him , and were amazed .
now as soon as it was day , there was no small stir among the soldiers , what was become of peter .
and upon a set day herod arrayed himself in royal apparel , and sat on the throne , and made an oration unto them .
and the people shouted , saying , the voice of a god , and not of a man .
but the word of god grew and multiplied .
and barnabas and saul returned from jerusalem , when they had fulfilled their ministration , taking with them john whose surname was mark .
and as they ministered to the lord , and fasted , the holy spirit said , separate me barnabas and saul for the work whereunto i have called them .
then , when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them , they sent them away .
so they , being sent forth by the holy spirit , went down to seleucia ; and from thence they sailed to cyprus .
and when they were at salamis , they proclaimed the word of god in the synagogues of the jews : and they had also john as their attendant .
and when they had gone through the whole island unto paphos , they found a certain sorcerer , a false prophet , a jew , whose name was bar-jesus ;
but elymas the sorcerer ( for so is his name by interpretation ) withstood them , seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith .
but saul , who is also called paul , filled with the holy spirit , fastened his eyes on him ,
then the proconsul , when he saw what was done , believed , being astonished at the teaching of the lord .
now paul and his company set sail from paphos , and came to perga in pamphylia : and john departed from them and returned to jerusalem .
but they , passing through from perga , came to antioch of pisidia ; and they went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and sat down .
and paul stood up , and beckoning with the hand said ,
and for about the time of forty years as a nursing-father bare he them in the wilderness .
and when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of canaan , he gave them their land for an inheritance , for about four hundred and fifty years :
and after these things he gave them judges until samuel the prophet .
of this man ’ s seed hath god according to promise brought unto israel a saviour , jesus ;
when john had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of israel .
brethren , children of the stock of abraham , and those among you that fear god , to us is the word of this salvation sent forth .
and though they found no cause of death in him , yet asked they of pilate that he should be slain .
and when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him , they took him down from the tree , and laid him in a tomb .
but god raised him from the dead :
and he was seen for many days of them that came up with him from galilee to jerusalem , who are now his witnesses unto the people .
and we bring you good tidings of the promise made unto the fathers ,
because he saith also in another psalm , thou wilt not give thy holy one to see corruption .
for david , after he had in his own generation served the counsel of god , fell asleep , and was laid unto his fathers , and saw corruption :
but he whom god raised up saw no corruption .
be it known unto you therefore , brethren , that through this man is proclaimed unto you remission of sins :
and by him every one that believeth is justified from all things , from which ye could not be justified by the law of moses .
beware therefore , lest that come upon you which is spoken in the prophets :
behold , ye despisers , and wonder , and perish ;
and as they went out , they besought that these words might be spoken to them the next sabbath .
and the next sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of god .
but when the jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with jealousy , and contradicted the things which were spoken by paul , and blasphemed .
for so hath the lord commanded us , saying ,
and as the gentiles heard this , they were glad , and glorified the word of god : and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed .
and the word of the lord was spread abroad throughout all the region .
but they shook off the dust of their feet against them , and came unto iconium .
and the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy spirit .
but the jews that were disobedient stirred up the souls of the gentiles , and made them evil affected against the brethren .
but the multitude of the city was divided ; and part held with the jews , and part with the apostles .
and when there was made an onset both of the gentiles and of the jews with their rulers , to treat them shamefully and to stone them ,
they became aware of it , and fled unto the cities of lycaonia , lystra and derbe , and the region round about :
and there they preached the gospel .
and at lystra there sat a certain man , impotent in his feet , a cripple from his mother ’ s womb , who never had walked .
the same heard paul speaking : who , fastening his eyes upon him , and seeing that he had faith to be made whole ,
said with a loud voice , stand upright on thy feet . and he leaped up and walked .
and they called barnabas , jupiter ; and paul , mercury , because he was the chief speaker .
and the priest of jupiter whose temple was before the city , brought oxen and garlands unto the gates , and would have done sacrifice with the multitudes .
but when the apostles , barnabas and paul , heard of it , they rent their garments , and sprang forth among the multitude , crying out
who in the generations gone by suffered all the nations to walk in their own ways .
and with these sayings scarce restrained they the multitudes from doing sacrifice unto them .
and when they had preached the gospel to that city , and had made many disciples , they returned to lystra , and to iconium , and to antioch ,
confirming the souls of the disciples , exhorting them to continue in the faith , and that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of god .
and they passed through pisidia , and came to pamphylia .
and when they had spoken the word in perga , they went down to attalia ;
and thence they sailed to antioch , from whence they had been committed to the grace of god for the work which they had fulfilled .
and they tarried no little time with the disciples .
and certain men came down from judaea and taught the brethren , saying , except ye be circumcised after the custom of moses , ye can not be saved .
and the apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider of this matter .
and when there had been much questioning , peter rose up , and said unto them ,
and god , who knoweth the heart , bare them witness , giving them the holy spirit , even as he did unto us ;
and he made no distinction between us and them , cleansing their hearts by faith .
but we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the lord jesus , in like manner as they .
and all the multitude kept silence ; and they hearkened unto barnabas and paul rehearsing what signs and wonders god had wrought among the gentiles through them .
and after they had held their peace , james answered , saying ,
symeon hath rehearsed how first god visited the gentiles , to take out of them a people for his name .
and to this agree the words of the prophets ; as it is written ,
after these things i will return ,
that the residue of men may seek after the lord ,
saith the lord , who maketh these things known from of old .
wherefore my judgment is , that we trouble not them that from among the gentiles turn to god ;
but that we write unto them , that they abstain from the pollutions of idols , and from fornication , and from what is strangled , and from blood .
for moses from generations of old hath in every city them that preach him , being read in the synagogues every sabbath .
forasmuch as we have heard that certain who went out from us have troubled you with words , subverting your souls ; to whom we gave no commandment ;
it seemed good unto us , having come to one accord , to choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul ,
men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ .
we have sent therefore judas and silas , who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of mouth .
for it seemed good to the holy spirit , and to us , to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things :
so they , when they were dismissed , came down to antioch ; and having gathered the multitude together , they delivered the epistle .
and when they had read it , they rejoiced for the consolation .
and judas and silas , being themselves also prophets , exhorted the brethren with many words , and confirmed them .
and after they had spent some time there , they were dismissed in peace from the brethren unto those that had sent them forth .
but paul and barnabas tarried in antioch , teaching and preaching the word of the lord , with many others also .
and barnabas was minded to take with them john also , who was called mark .
but paul thought not good to take with them him who withdrew from them from pamphylia , and went not with them to the work .
and there arose a sharp contention , so that they parted asunder one from the other , and barnabas took mark with him , and sailed away unto cyprus :
but paul chose silas , and went forth , being commended by the brethren to the grace of the lord .
and he went through syria and cilicia , confirming the churches .
the same was well reported of by the brethren that were at lystra and iconium .
so the churches were strengthened in the faith , and increased in number daily .
and they went through the region of phrygia and galatia , having been forbidden of the holy spirit to speak the word in asia ;
and when they were come over against mysia , they assayed to go into bithynia ; and the spirit of jesus suffered them not ;
and passing by mysia , they came down to troas .
and when he had seen the vision , straightway we sought to go forth into macedonia , concluding that god had called us to preach the gospel unto them .
setting sail therefore from troas , we made a straight course to samothrace , and the day following to neapolis ;
and when they had brought them unto the magistrates , they said , these men , being jews , do exceedingly trouble our city ,
and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to receive , or to observe , being romans .
and the multitude rose up together against them : and the magistrates rent their garments off them , and commanded to beat them with rods .
and when they had laid many stripes upon them , they cast them into prison , charging the jailor to keep them safely :
who , having received such a charge , cast them into the inner prison , and made their feet fast in the stocks .
but about midnight paul and silas were praying and singing hymns unto god , and the prisoners were listening to them ;
but paul cried with a loud voice , saying , do thyself no harm : for we are all here .
and he called for lights and sprang in , and , trembling for fear , fell down before paul and silas ,
and brought them out and said , sirs , what must i do to be saved ?
and they said , believe on the lord jesus , and thou shalt be saved , thou and thy house .
and they spake the word of the lord unto him , with all that were in his house .
and he took them the same hour of the night , and washed their stripes ; and was baptized , he and all his , immediately .
and he brought them up into his house , and set food before them , and rejoiced greatly , with all his house , having believed in god .
but when it was day , the magistrates sent the serjeants , saying , let those men go .
and the jailor reported the words to paul , saying , the magistrates have sent to let you go : now therefore come forth , and go in peace .
and the serjeants reported these words unto the magistrates : and they feared when they heard that they were romans ;
and they came and besought them ; and when they had brought them out , they asked them to go away from the city .
now when they had passed through amphipolis and apollonia , they came to thessalonica , where was a synagogue of the jews :
and paul , as his custom was , went in unto them , and for three sabbath days reasoned with them from the scriptures ,
whom jason hath received : and these all act contrary to the decrees of caesar , saying that there is another king , one jesus .
and they troubled the multitude and the rulers of the city , when they heard these things .
and when they had taken security from jason and the rest , they let them go .
and the brethren immediately sent away paul and silas by night unto beroea : who when they were come thither went into the synagogue of the jews .
many of them therefore believed ; also of the greek women of honorable estate , and of men , not a few .
and then immediately the brethren sent forth paul to go as far as to the sea : and silas and timothy abode there still .
now while paul waited for them at athens , his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld the city full of idols .
so he reasoned in the synagogue with the jews and the devout persons , and in the marketplace every day with them that met him .
for thou bringest certain strange things to our ears : we would know therefore what these things mean .
( now all the athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else , but either to tell or to hear some new thing . )
and paul stood in the midst of the areopagus , and said ,
the god that made the world and all things therein , he , being lord of heaven and earth , dwelleth not in temples made with hands ;
that they should seek god , if haply they might feel after him and find him , though he is not far from each one of us :
for in him we live , and move , and have our being ; as certain even of your own poets have said ,
the times of ignorance therefore god overlooked ; but now he commandeth men that they should all everywhere repent :
now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead , some mocked ; but others said , we will hear thee concerning this yet again .
thus paul went out from among them .
but certain men clave unto him , and believed : among whom also was dionysius the areopagite , and a woman named damaris , and others with them .
after these things he departed from athens , and came to corinth .
and because he was of the same trade , he abode with them , and they wrought ; for by their trade they were tentmakers .
and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath , and persuaded jews and greeks .
but when silas and timothy came down from macedonia , paul was constrained by the word , testifying to the jews that jesus was the christ .
and crispus , the ruler of the synagogue , believed in the lord with all his house ; and many of the corinthians hearing believed , and were baptized .
and the lord said unto paul in the night by a vision , be not afraid , but speak and hold not thy peace :
for i am with thee , and no man shall set on thee to harm thee : for i have much people in this city .
and he dwelt there a year and six months , teaching the word of god among them .
but when gallio was proconsul of achaia , the jews with one accord rose up against paul and brought him before the judgment-seat ,
saying , this man persuadeth men to worship god contrary to the law .
and he drove them from the judgment-seat .
and they all laid hold on sosthenes , the ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the judgment-seat . and gallio cared for none of these things .
and they came to ephesus , and he left them there : but he himself entered into the synagogue , and reasoned with the jews .
and when they asked him to abide a longer time , he consented not ;
but taking his leave of them , and saying , i will return again unto you if god will , he set sail from ephesus .
and when he had landed at caesarea , he went up and saluted the church , and went down to antioch .
and having spent some time there , he departed , and went through the region of galatia , and phrygia , in order , establishing all the disciples .
now a certain jew named apollos , an alexandrian by race , an eloquent man , came to ephesus ; and he was mighty in the scriptures .
for he powerfully confuted the jews , and that publicly , showing by the scriptures that jesus was the christ .
and it came to pass , that , while apollos was at corinth , paul having passed through the upper country came to ephesus , and found certain disciples :
and he said , into what then were ye baptized ? and they said , into john ’ s baptism .
and when they heard this , they were baptized into the name of the lord jesus .
and when paul had laid his hands upon them , the holy spirit came on them ; and they spake with tongues , and prophesied .
and they were in all about twelve men .
and he entered into the synagogue , and spake boldly for the space of three months , reasoning and persuading as to the things concerning the kingdom of god .
and this continued for the space of two years ; so that all they that dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord , both jews and greeks .
and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul :
insomuch that unto the sick were carried away from his body handkerchiefs or aprons , and the diseases departed from them , and the evil spirits went out .
and there were seven sons of one sceva , a jew , a chief priest , who did this .
and the evil spirit answered and said unto them , jesus i know , and paul i know ; but who are ye ?
many also of them that had believed came , confessing , and declaring their deeds .
so mightily grew the word of the lord and prevailed .
and having sent into macedonia two of them that ministered unto him , timothy and erastus , he himself stayed in asia for a while .
and about that time there arose no small stir concerning the way .
for a certain man named demetrius , a silversmith , who made silver shrines of diana , brought no little business unto the craftsmen ;
whom he gathered together , with the workmen of like occupation , and said , sirs , ye know that by this business we have our wealth .
and when they heard this they were filled with wrath , and cried out , saying , great is diana of the ephesians .
and when paul was minded to enter in unto the people , the disciples suffered him not .
and certain also of the asiarchs , being his friends , sent unto him and besought him not to adventure himself into the theatre .
some therefore cried one thing , and some another : for the assembly was in confusion ; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together .
but when they perceived that he was a jew , all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out , great is diana of the ephesians .
seeing then that these things can not be gainsaid , ye ought to be quiet , and to do nothing rash .
for ye have brought hither these men , who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess .
but if ye seek anything about other matters , it shall be settled in the regular assembly .
and when he had thus spoken , he dismissed the assembly .
and after the uproar ceased , paul having sent for the disciples and exhorted them , took leave of them , and departed to go into macedonia .
and when he had gone through those parts , and had given them much exhortation , he came into greece .
but these had gone before , and were waiting for us at troas .
and we sailed away from philippi after the days of unleavened bread , and came unto them to troas in five days ; where we tarried seven days .
and there were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered together .
and paul went down , and fell on him , and embracing him said , make ye no ado ; for his life is in him .
and they brought the lad alive , and were not a little comforted .
and when he met us at assos , we took him in , and came to mitylene .
and from miletus he sent to ephesus , and called to him the elders of the church .
and when they were come to him , he said unto them ,
serving the lord with all lowliness of mind , and with tears , and with trials which befell me by the plots of the jews ;
how i shrank not from declaring unto you anything that was profitable , and teaching you publicly , and from house to house ,
testifying both to jews and to greeks repentance toward god , and faith toward our lord jesus christ .
and now , behold , i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem , not knowing the things that shall befall me there :
save that the holy spirit testifieth unto me in every city , saying that bonds and afflictions abide me .
and now , behold , i know that ye all , among whom i went about preaching the kingdom , shall see my face no more .
wherefore i testify unto you this day , that i am pure from the blood of all men .
for i shrank not from declaring unto you the whole counsel of god .
i know that after my departing grievous wolves shall enter in among you , not sparing the flock ;
and from among your own selves shall men arise , speaking perverse things , to draw away the disciples after them .
wherefore watch ye , remembering that by the space of three years i ceased not to admonish every one night and day with tears .
i coveted no man ’ s silver , or gold , or apparel .
ye yourselves know that these hands ministered unto my necessities , and to them that were with me .
and when he had thus spoken , he kneeled down and prayed with them all .
and they all wept sore , and fell on paul ’ s neck and kissed him ,
and having found a ship crossing over unto phoenicia , we went aboard , and set sail .
and having found the disciples , we tarried there seven days : and these said to paul through the spirit , that he should not set foot in jerusalem .
and we went on board the ship , but they returned home again .
and when we had finished the voyage from tyre , we arrived at ptolemais ; and we saluted the brethren , and abode with them one day .
now this man had four virgin daughters , who prophesied .
and as we tarried there some days , there came down from judaea a certain prophet , named agabus .
and when we heard these things , both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to jerusalem .
and when he would not be persuaded , we ceased , saying , the will of the lord be done .
and after these days we took up our baggage and went up to jerusalem .
and when we were come to jerusalem , the brethren received us gladly .
and the day following paul went in with us unto james ; and all the elders were present .
and when he had saluted them , he rehearsed one by one the things which god had wrought among the gentiles through his ministry .
what is it therefore ? they will certainly hear that thou art come .
do therefore this that we say to thee : we have four men that have a vow on them ;
for they had before seen with him in the city trophimus the ephesian , whom they supposed that paul had brought into the temple .
and as they were seeking to kill him , tidings came up to the chief captain of the band , that all jerusalem was in confusion .
and when he came upon the stairs , so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the crowd ;
for the multitude of the people followed after , crying out , away with him .
art thou not then the egyptian , who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the assassins ?
brethren and fathers , hear ye the defence which i now make unto you .
and when they heard that he spake unto them in the hebrew language , they were the more quiet : and he saith ,
and i persecuted this way unto the death , binding and delivering into prisons both men and women .
and i fell unto the ground , and heard a voice saying unto me , saul , saul , why persecutest thou me ?
and i answered , who art thou , lord ? and he said unto me , i am jesus of nazareth , whom thou persecutest .
and they that were with me beheld indeed the light , but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me .
and when i could not see for the glory of that light , being led by the hand of them that were with me i came into damascus .
and one ananias , a devout man according to the law , well reported of by all the jews that dwelt there ,
came unto me , and standing by me said unto me , brother saul , receive thy sight . and in that very hour i looked up on him .
for thou shalt be a witness for him unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard .
and now why tarriest thou ? arise , and be baptized , and wash away thy sins , calling on his name .
and it came to pass , that , when i had returned to jerusalem , and while i prayed in the temple , i fell into a trance ,
and saw him saying unto me , make haste , and get thee quickly out of jerusalem ; because they will not receive of thee testimony concerning me .
and i said , lord , they themselves know that i imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee :
and when the blood of stephen thy witness was shed , i also was standing by , and consenting , and keeping the garments of them that slew him .
and he said unto me , depart : for i will send thee forth far hence unto the gentiles .
and as they cried out , and threw off their garments , and cast dust into the air ,
and the chief captain came and said unto him , tell me , art thou a roman ? and he said , yea .
and the chief captain answered , with a great sum obtained i this citizenship . and paul said , but i am a roman born .
and paul , looking stedfastly on the council , said , brethren , i have lived before god in all good conscience until this day .
and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth .
and they that stood by said , revilest thou god ’ s high priest ?
and when he had so said , there arose a dissension between the pharisees and sadducees ; and the assembly was divided .
for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection , neither angel , nor spirit ; but the pharisees confess both .
and they were more than forty that made this conspiracy .
but paul ’ s sister ’ s son heard of their lying in wait , and he came and entered into the castle and told paul .
and paul called unto him one of the centurions , and said , bring this young man unto the chief captain ; for he hath something to tell him .
and the chief captain took him by the hand , and going aside asked him privately , what is it that thou hast to tell me ?
so the chief captain let the young man go , charging him , tell no man that thou hast signified these things to me .
and he bade them provide beasts , that they might set paul thereon , and bring him safe unto felix the governor .
and he wrote a letter after this form :
claudius lysias unto the most excellent governor felix , greeting .
and desiring to know the cause wherefore they accused him , i brought him down unto their council :
whom i found to be accused about questions of their law , but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds .
so the soldiers , as it was commanded them , took paul and brought him by night to antipatris .
but on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him , and returned to the castle :
and they , when they came to caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor , presented paul also before him .
and when he had read it , he asked of what province he was ; and when he understood that he was of cilicia ,
i will hear thee fully , said he , when thine accusers also are come : and he commanded him to be kept in herod ’ s palace .
and after five days the high priest ananias came down with certain elders , and with an orator , one tertullus ; and they informed the governor against paul .
and when he was called , tertullus began to accuse him , saying ,
we accept it in all ways and in all places , most excellent felix , with all thankfulness .
but , that i be not further tedious unto thee , i entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words .
who moreover assayed to profane the temple : on whom also we laid hold :
from whom thou wilt be able , by examining him thyself , to take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him .
and the jews also joined in the charge , affirming that these things were so .
and when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak , paul answered ,
seeing that thou canst take knowledge that it is not more than twelve days since i went up to worship at jerusalem :
and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd , nor in the synagogues , nor in the city .
neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me .
having hope toward god , which these also themselves look for , that there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust .
herein i also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offence toward god and men always .
now after some years i came to bring alms to my nation , and offerings :
amidst which they found me purified in the temple , with no crowd , nor yet with tumult : but there were certain jews from asia—
who ought to have been here before thee , and to make accusation , if they had aught against me .
or else let these men themselves say what wrong-doing they found when i stood before the council ,
he hoped withal that money would be given him of paul : wherefore also he sent for him the oftener , and communed with him .
but when two years were fulfilled , felix was succeeded by porcius festus ; and desiring to gain favor with the jews , felix left paul in bonds .
festus therefore , having come into the province , after three days went up to jerusalem from caesarea .
and the chief priests and the principal men of the jews informed him against paul ; and they besought him ,
asking a favor against him , that he would send for him to jerusalem ; laying a plot to kill him on the way .
howbeit festus answered , that paul was kept in charge at caesarea , and that he himself was about to depart thither shortly .
while paul said in his defence , neither against the law of the jews , nor against the temple , nor against caesar , have i sinned at all .
then festus , when he had conferred with the council , answered , thou hast appealed unto caesar : unto caesar shalt thou go .
now when certain days were passed , agrippa the king and bernice arrived at caesarea , and saluted festus .
about whom , when i was at jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me , asking for sentence against him .
concerning whom , when the accusers stood up , they brought no charge of such evil things as i supposed ;
but had certain questions against him of their own religion , and of one jesus , who was dead , whom paul affirmed to be alive .
and i , being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things , asked whether he would go to jerusalem and there be judged of these matters .
but when paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor , i commanded him to be kept till i should send him to caesar .
and agrippa said unto festus , i also could wish to hear the man myself . to-morrow , saith he , thou shalt hear him .
but i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death : and as he himself appealed to the emperor i determined to send him .
for it seemeth to me unreasonable , in sending a prisoner , not withal to signify the charges against him .
and agrippa said unto paul , thou art permitted to speak for thyself . then paul stretched forth his hand , and made his defence :
especially because thou art expert in all customs and questions which are among the jews : wherefore i beseech thee to hear me patiently .
my manner of life then from my youth up , which was from the beginning among mine own nation and at jerusalem , know all the jews ;
having knowledge of me from the first , if they be willing to testify , that after the straitest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee .
and now i stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made of god unto our fathers ;
why is it judged incredible with you , if god doth raise the dead ?
i verily thought with myself that i ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth .
whereupon as i journeyed to damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests ,
and i said , who art thou , lord ? and the lord said , i am jesus whom thou persecutest .
delivering thee from the people , and from the gentiles , unto whom i send thee ,
wherefore , o king agrippa , i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision :
for this cause the jews seized me in the temple , and assayed to kill me .
how that the christ must suffer , and how that he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim light both to the people and to the gentiles .
and as he thus made his defence , festus saith with a loud voice , paul , thou art mad ; thy much learning is turning thee mad .
but paul saith , i am not mad , most excellent festus ; but speak forth words of truth and soberness .
king agrippa , believest thou the prophets ? i know that thou believest .
and agrippa said unto paul , with but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me a christian .
and the king rose up , and the governor , and bernice , and they that sat with them :
and when they had withdrawn , they spake one to another , saying , this man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds .
and agrippa said unto festus , this man might have been set at liberty , if he had not appealed unto caesar .
and when it was determined that we should sail for italy , they delivered paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named julius , of the augustan band .
and the next day we touched at sidon : and julius treated paul kindly , and gave him leave to go unto his friends and refresh himself .
and putting to sea from thence , we sailed under the lee of cyprus , because the winds were contrary .
and when we had sailed across the sea which is off cilicia and pamphylia , we came to myra , a city of lycia .
and there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sailing for italy ; and he put us therein .
and with difficulty coasting along it we came unto a certain place called fair havens ; nigh whereunto was the city of lasea .
and when much time was spent , and the voyage was now dangerous , because the fast was now already gone by , paul admonished them ,
but the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship , than to those things which were spoken by paul .
and when the south wind blew softly , supposing that they had obtained their purpose , they weighed anchor and sailed along crete , close in shore .
but after no long time there beat down from it a tempestuous wind , which is called euraquilo :
and when the ship was caught , and could not face the wind , we gave way to it , and were driven .
and running under the lee of a small island called cauda , we were able , with difficulty , to secure the boat :
and as we labored exceedingly with the storm , the next day they began to throw the freight overboard ;
and the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship .
and now i exhort you to be of good cheer ; for there shall be no loss of life among you , but only of the ship .
for there stood by me this night an angel of the god whose i am , whom also i serve ,
saying , fear not , paul ; thou must stand before caesar : and lo , god hath granted thee all them that sail with thee .
wherefore , sirs , be of good cheer : for i believe god , that it shall be even so as it hath been spoken unto me .
but we must be cast upon a certain island .
and they sounded , and found twenty fathoms ; and after a little space , they sounded again , and found fifteen fathoms .
and fearing lest haply we should be cast ashore on rocky ground , they let go four anchors from the stern , and wished for the day .
paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers , except these abide in the ship , ye can not be saved .
then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat , and let her fall off .
then were they all of good cheer , and themselves also took food .
and we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls .
and when they had eaten enough , they lightened the ship , throwing out the wheat into the sea .
and the soldiers ’ counsel was to kill the prisoners , lest any of them should swim out , and escape .
and when we were escaped , then we knew that the island was called melita .
howbeit he shook off the creature into the fire , and took no harm .
and when this was done , the rest also that had diseases in the island came , and were cured :
who also honored us with many honors ; and when we sailed , they put on board such things as we needed .
and after three months we set sail in a ship of alexandria which had wintered in the island , whose sign was the twin brothers .
and touching at syracuse , we tarried there three days .
where we found brethren , and were entreated to tarry with them seven days : and so we came to rome .
and when we entered into rome , paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him .
who , when they had examined me , desired to set me at liberty , because there was no cause of death in me .
but when the jews spake against it , i was constrained to appeal unto caesar ; not that i had aught whereof to accuse my nation .
for this cause therefore did i entreat you to see and to speak with me : for because of the hope of israel i am bound with this chain .
but we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest : for as concerning this sect , it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against .
and some believed the things which were spoken , and some disbelieved .
for this people ’ s heart is waxed gross ,
be it known therefore unto you , that this salvation of god is sent unto the gentiles : they will also hear .
and he abode two whole years in his own hired dwelling , and received all that went in unto him ,
preaching the kingdom of god , and teaching the things concerning the lord jesus christ with all boldness , none forbidding him .
but i will send a fire into the house of hazael , and it shall devour the palaces of ben-hadad .
but i will send a fire on the wall of gaza , and it shall devour the palaces thereof .
but i will send a fire on the wall of tyre , and it shall devour the palaces thereof .
but i will send a fire upon teman , and it shall devour the palaces of bozrah .
and their king shall go into captivity , he and his princes together , saith jehovah .
and i will cut off the judge from the midst thereof , and will slay all the princes thereof with him , saith jehovah .
but i will send a fire upon judah , and it shall devour the palaces of jerusalem .
also i brought you up out of the land of egypt , and led you forty years in the wilderness , to possess the land of the amorite .
but ye gave the nazirites wine to drink , and commanded the prophets , saying , prophesy not .
behold , i will press you in your place , as a cart presseth that is full of sheaves .
and flight shall perish from the swift ; and the strong shall not strengthen his force ; neither shall the mighty deliver himself ;
and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day , saith jehovah .
you only have i known of all the families of the earth : therefore i will visit upon you all your iniquities .
shall two walk together , except they have agreed ?
will a lion roar in the forest , when he hath no prey ? will a young lion cry out of his den , if he have taken nothing ?
shall the trumpet be blown in a city , and the people not be afraid ? shall evil befall a city , and jehovah hath not done it ?
surely the lord jehovah will do nothing , except he reveal his secret unto his servants the prophets .
the lion hath roared ; who will not fear ? the lord jehovah hath spoken ; who can but prophesy ?
for they know not to do right , saith jehovah , who store up violence and robbery in their palaces .
hear ye , and testify against the house of jacob , saith the lord jehovah , the god of hosts .
and i will smite the winter-house with the summer-house ; and the houses of ivory shall perish , and the great houses shall have an end , saith jehovah .
and ye shall go out at the breaches , every one straight before her ; and ye shall cast yourselves into harmon , saith jehovah .
come to beth-el , and transgress ; to gilgal , and multiply transgression ; and bring your sacrifices every morning , and your tithes every three days ;
so two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water , and were not satisfied : yet have ye not returned unto me , saith jehovah .
therefore thus will i do unto thee , o israel ; and because i will do this unto thee , prepare to meet thy god , o israel .
hear ye this word which i take up for a lamentation over you , o house of israel .
the virgin of israel is fallen ; she shall no more rise : she is cast down upon her land ; there is none to raise her up .
for thus saith jehovah unto the house of israel , seek ye me , and ye shall live ;
ye who turn justice to wormwood , and cast down righteousness to the earth ,
that bringeth sudden destruction upon the strong , so that destruction cometh upon the fortress .
they hate him that reproveth in the gate , and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly .
therefore he that is prudent shall keep silence in such a time ; for it is an evil time .
seek good , and not evil , that ye may live ; and so jehovah , the god of hosts , will be with you , as ye say .
and in all vineyards shall be wailing ; for i will pass through the midst of thee , saith jehovah .
woe unto you that desire the day of jehovah ! wherefore would ye have the day of jehovah ? it is darkness , and not light .
shall not the day of jehovah be darkness , and not light ? even very dark , and no brightness in it ?
i hate , i despise your feasts , and i will take no delight in your solemn assemblies .
yea , though ye offer me your burnt-offerings and meal-offerings , i will not accept them ; neither will i regard the peace-offerings of your fat beasts .
take thou away from me the noise of thy songs ; for i will not hear the melody of thy viols .
but let justice roll down as waters , and righteousness as a mighty stream .
did ye bring unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years , o house of israel ?
yea , ye have borne the tabernacle of your king and the shrine of your images , the star of your god , which ye made to yourselves .
therefore will i cause you to go into captivity beyond damascus , saith jehovah , whose name is the god of hosts .
—ye that put far away the evil day , and cause the seat of violence to come near ;
that sing idle songs to the sound of the viol ; that invent for themselves instruments of music , like david ;
that drink wine in bowls , and anoint themselves with the chief oils ; but they are not grieved for the affliction of joseph .
therefore shall they now go captive with the first that go captive ; and the revelry of them that stretched themselves shall pass away .
and it shall come to pass , if there remain ten men in one house , that they shall die .
for , behold , jehovah commandeth , and the great house shall be smitten with breaches , and the little house with clefts .
shall horses run upon the rock ? will one plow there with oxen ? that ye have turned justice into gall , and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood ;
ye that rejoice in a thing of nought , that say , have we not taken to us horns by our own strength ?
jehovah repented concerning this : it shall not be , saith jehovah .
then said i , o lord jehovah , cease , i beseech thee : how shall jacob stand ? for he is small .
jehovah repented concerning this : this also shall not be , saith the lord jehovah .
thus he showed me : and , behold , the lord stood beside a wall made by a plumb-line , with a plumb-line in his hand .
for thus amos saith , jeroboam shall die by the sword , and israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land .
also amaziah said unto amos , o thou seer , go , flee thou away into the land of judah , and there eat bread , and prophesy there :
but prophesy not again any more at beth-el ; for it is the king ’ s sanctuary , and it is a royal house .
and jehovah took me from following the flock , and jehovah said unto me , go , prophesy unto my people israel .
now therefore hear thou the word of jehovah : thou sayest , prophesy not against israel , and drop not thy word against the house of isaac ;
thus the lord jehovah showed me : and , behold , a basket of summer fruit .
hear this , o ye that would swallow up the needy , and cause the poor of the land to fail ,
that we may buy the poor for silver , and the needy for a pair of shoes , and sell the refuse of the wheat ?
jehovah hath sworn by the excellency of jacob , surely i will never forget any of their works .
in that day shall the fair virgins and the young men faint for thirst .
though they dig into sheol , thence shall my hand take them ; and though they climb up to heaven , thence will i bring them down .
all the sinners of my people shall die by the sword , who say , the evil shall not overtake nor meet us .
that they may possess the remnant of edom , and all the nations that are called by my name , saith jehovah that doeth this .
paul , an apostle of christ jesus through the will of god , and timothy our brother ,
to the saints and faithful brethren in christ that are at colossae : grace to you and peace from god our father .
we give thanks to god the father of our lord jesus christ , praying always for you ,
having heard of your faith in christ jesus , and of the love which ye have toward all the saints ,
because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens , whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel ,
even as ye learned of epaphras our beloved fellow-servant , who is a faithful minister of christ on our behalf ,
who also declared unto us your love in the spirit .
to walk worthily of the lord unto all pleasing , bearing fruit in every good work , and increasing in the knowledge of god ;
strengthened with all power , according to the might of his glory , unto all patience and longsuffering with joy ;
giving thanks unto the father , who made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light ;
who delivered us out of the power of darkness , and translated us into the kingdom of the son of his love ;
in whom we have our redemption , the forgiveness of our sins :
who is the image of the invisible god , the firstborn of all creation ;
and he is before all things , and in him all things consist .
for it was the good pleasure of the father that in him should all the fulness dwell ;
and you , being in time past alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works ,
yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death , to present you holy and without blemish and unreproveable before him :
whereof i was made a minister , according to the dispensation of god which was given me to you-ward , to fulfil the word of god ,
even the mystery which hath been hid for ages and generations : but now hath it been manifested to his saints ,
whom we proclaim , admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom , that we may present every man perfect in christ ;
whereunto i labor also , striving according to his working , which worketh in me mightily .
in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden .
this i say , that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech .
as therefore ye received christ jesus the lord , so walk in him ,
rooted and builded up in him , and established in your faith , even as ye were taught , abounding in thanksgiving .
for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily ,
and in him ye are made full , who is the head of all principality and power :
having been buried with him in baptism , wherein ye were also raised with him through faith in the working of god , who raised him from the dead .
having despoiled the principalities and the powers , he made a show of them openly , triumphing over them in it .
let no man therefore judge you in meat , or in drink , or in respect of a feast day or a new moon or a sabbath day :
which are a shadow of the things to come ; but the body is christ ’ s .
if ye died with christ from the rudiments of the world , why , as though living in the world , do ye subject yourselves to ordinances ,
handle not , nor taste , nor touch
( all which things are to perish with the using ) , after the precepts and doctrines of men ?
if then ye were raised together with christ , seek the things that are above , where christ is , seated on the right hand of god .
set your mind on the things that are above , not on the things that are upon the earth .
for ye died , and your life is hid with christ in god .
when christ , who is our life , shall be manifested , then shall ye also with him be manifested in glory .
put to death therefore your members which are upon the earth : fornication , uncleanness , passion , evil desire , and covetousness , which is idolatry ;
for which things ’ sake cometh the wrath of god upon the sons of disobedience :
wherein ye also once walked , when ye lived in these things ;
but now do ye also put them all away : anger , wrath , malice , railing , shameful speaking out of your mouth :
lie not one to another ; seeing that ye have put off the old man with his doings ,
and have put on the new man , that is being renewed unto knowledge after the image of him that created him :
where there can not be greek and jew , circumcision and uncircumcision , barbarian , scythian , bondman , freeman ; but christ is all , and in all .
put on therefore , as god ’ s elect , holy and beloved , a heart of compassion , kindness , lowliness , meekness , longsuffering ;
forbearing one another , and forgiving each other , if any man have a complaint against any ; even as the lord forgave you , so also do ye :
and above all these things put on love , which is the bond of perfectness .
and let the peace of christ rule in your hearts , to the which also ye were called in one body ; and be ye thankful .
and whatsoever ye do , in word or in deed , do all in the name of the lord jesus , giving thanks to god the father through him .
wives , be in subjection to your husbands , as is fitting in the lord .
husbands , love your wives , and be not bitter against them .
children , obey your parents in all things , for this is well-pleasing in the lord .
fathers , provoke not your children , that they be not discouraged .
whatsoever ye do , work heartily , as unto the lord , and not unto men ;
knowing that from the lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance : ye serve the lord christ .
for he that doeth wrong shall receive again for the wrong that he hath done : and there is no respect of persons .
masters , render unto your servants that which is just and equal ; knowing that ye also have a master in heaven .
continue stedfastly in prayer , watching therein with thanksgiving ;
that i may make it manifest , as i ought to speak .
walk in wisdom toward them that are without , redeeming the time .
let your speech be always with grace , seasoned with salt , that ye may know how ye ought to answer each one .
all my affairs shall tychicus make known unto you , the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-servant in the lord :
whom i have sent unto you for this very purpose , that ye may know our state , and that he may comfort your hearts ;
together with onesimus , the faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you . they shall make known unto you all things that are done here .
aristarchus my fellow-prisoner saluteth you , and mark , the cousin of barnabas ( touching whom ye received commandments ; if he come unto you , receive him ) ,
for i bear him witness , that he hath much labor for you , and for them in laodicea , and for them in hierapolis .
luke , the beloved physician , and demas salute you .
salute the brethren that are in laodicea , and nymphas , and the church that is in their house .
and say to archippus , take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the lord , that thou fulfil it .
the salutation of me paul with mine own hand . remember my bonds . grace be with you .
paul , and silvanus , and timothy , unto the church of the thessalonians in god the father and the lord jesus christ : grace to you and peace .
we give thanks to god always for you all , making mention of you in our prayers ;
remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our lord jesus christ , before our god and father ;
knowing , brethren beloved of god , your election ,
and ye became imitators of us , and of the lord , having received the word in much affliction , with joy of the holy spirit ;
so that ye became an ensample to all that believe in macedonia and in achaia .
and to wait for his son from heaven , whom he raised from the dead , even jesus , who delivereth us from the wrath to come .
for yourselves , brethren , know our entering in unto you , that it hath not been found vain :
for our exhortation is not of error , nor of uncleanness , nor in guile :
for neither at any time were we found using words of flattery , as ye know , nor a cloak of covetousness , god is witness ;
nor seeking glory of men , neither from you nor from others , when we might have claimed authority as apostles of christ .
but we were gentle in the midst of you , as when a nurse cherisheth her own children :
ye are witnesses , and god also , how holily and righteously and unblamably we behaved ourselves toward you that believe :
as ye know how we dealt with each one of you , as a father with his own children , exhorting you , and encouraging you , and testifying ,
to the end that ye should walk worthily of god , who calleth you into his own kingdom and glory .
who both killed the lord jesus and the prophets , and drove out us , and please not god , and are contrary to all men ;
because we would fain have come unto you , i paul once and again ; and satan hindered us .
for what is our hope , or joy , or crown of glorying ? are not even ye , before our lord jesus at his coming ?
for ye are our glory and our joy .
wherefore when we could no longer forbear , we thought it good to be left behind at athens alone ;
and sent timothy , our brother and god ’ s minister in the gospel of christ , to establish you , and to comfort you concerning your faith ;
that no man be moved by these afflictions ; for yourselves know that hereunto we are appointed .
for this cause , brethren , we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith :
for now we live , if ye stand fast in the lord .
for what thanksgiving can we render again unto god for you , for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our god ;
night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face , and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith ?
now may our god and father himself , and our lord jesus , direct our way unto you :
and the lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we also do toward you ;
to the end he may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before our god and father , at the coming of our lord jesus with all his saints .
for ye know what charge we gave you through the lord jesus .
for this is the will of god , even your sanctification , that ye abstain from fornication ;
that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor ,
not in the passion of lust , even as the gentiles who know not god ;
for god called us not for uncleanness , but in sanctification .
therefore he that rejecteth , rejecteth not man , but god , who giveth his holy spirit unto you .
but concerning love of the brethren ye have no need that one write unto you : for ye yourselves are taught of god to love one another ;
for indeed ye do it toward all the brethren that are in all macedonia . but we exhort you , brethren , that ye abound more and more ;
and that ye study to be quiet , and to do your own business , and to work with your hands , even as we charged you ;
that ye may walk becomingly toward them that are without , and may have need of nothing .
for if we believe that jesus died and rose again , even so them also that are fallen asleep in jesus will god bring with him .
wherefore comfort one another with these words .
but concerning the times and the seasons , brethren , ye have no need that aught be written unto you .
for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night .
but ye , brethren , are not in darkness , that that day should overtake you as a thief :
for ye are all sons of light , and sons of the day : we are not of the night , nor of darkness ;
so then let us not sleep , as do the rest , but let us watch and be sober .
for they that sleep sleep in the night ; and they that are drunken are drunken in the night .
for god appointed us not unto wrath , but unto the obtaining of salvation through our lord jesus christ ,
who died for us , that , whether we wake or sleep , we should live together with him .
wherefore exhort one another , and build each other up , even as also ye do .
but we beseech you , brethren , to know them that labor among you , and are over you in the lord , and admonish you ;
and to esteem them exceeding highly in love for their work ’ s sake . be at peace among yourselves .
and we exhort you , brethren , admonish the disorderly , encourage the faint-hearted , support the weak , be longsuffering toward all .
see that none render unto any one evil for evil ; but always follow after that which is good , one toward another , and toward all .
in everything give thanks : for this is the will of god in christ jesus to you-ward .
quench not the spirit ;
prove all things ; hold fast that which is good ;
abstain from every form of evil .
faithful is he that calleth you , who will also do it .
brethren , pray for us .
salute all the brethren with a holy kiss .
i adjure you by the lord that this epistle be read unto all the brethren .
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you .
paul , and silvanus , and timothy , unto the church of the thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ ;
grace to you and peace from god the father and the lord jesus christ .
so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of god for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which ye endure ;
if so be that it is a righteous thing with god to recompense affliction to them that afflict you ,
and to you that are afflicted rest with us , at the revelation of the lord jesus from heaven with the angels of his power in flaming fire ,
rendering vengeance to them that know not god , and to them that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus :
who shall suffer punishment , even eternal destruction from the face of the lord and from the glory of his might ,
now we beseech you , brethren , touching the coming of our lord jesus christ , and our gathering together unto him ;
remember ye not , that , when i was yet with you , i told you these things ?
and now ye know that which restraineth , to the end that he may be revealed in his own season .
for the mystery of lawlessness doth already work : only there is one that restraineth now , until he be taken out of the way .
even he , whose coming is according to the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders ,
and with all deceit of unrighteousness for them that perish ; because they received not the love of the truth , that they might be saved .
and for this cause god sendeth them a working of error , that they should believe a lie :
that they all might be judged who believed not the truth , but had pleasure in unrighteousness .
whereunto he called you through our gospel , to the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus christ .
so then , brethren , stand fast , and hold the traditions which ye were taught , whether by word , or by epistle of ours .
now our lord jesus christ himself , and god our father who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace ,
comfort your hearts and establish them in every good work and word .
finally , brethren , pray for us , that the word of the lord may run and be glorified , even as also it is with you ;
and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men ; for all have not faith .
but the lord is faithful , who shall establish you , and guard you from the evil one .
and we have confidence in the lord touching you , that ye both do and will do the things which we command .
and the lord direct your hearts into the love of god , and into the patience of christ .
for yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us : for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you ;
not because we have not the right , but to make ourselves an ensample unto you , that ye should imitate us .
for even when we were with you , this we commanded you , if any will not work , neither let him eat .
for we hear of some that walk among you disorderly , that work not at all , but are busybodies .
now them that are such we command and exhort in the lord jesus christ , that with quietness they work , and eat their own bread .
but ye , brethren , be not weary in well-doing .
and yet count him not as an enemy , but admonish him as a brother .
now the lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways . the lord be with you all .
the salutation of me paul with mine own hand , which is the token in every epistle : so i write .
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all .
paul , an apostle of christ jesus according to the commandment of god our saviour , and christ jesus our hope ;
unto timothy , my true child in faith : grace , mercy , peace , from god the father and christ jesus our lord .
as i exhorted thee to tarry at ephesus , when i was going into macedonia , that thou mightest charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine ,
neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies , which minister questionings , rather than a dispensation of god which is in faith ; so do i now .
but the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned :
from which things some having swerved have turned aside unto vain talking ;
desiring to be teachers of the law , though they understand neither what they say , nor whereof they confidently affirm .
but we know that the law is good , if a man use it lawfully ,
according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed god , which was committed to my trust .
i thank him that enabled me , even christ jesus our lord , for that he counted me faithful , appointing me to his service ;
though i was before a blasphemer , and a persecutor , and injurious : howbeit i obtained mercy , because i did it ignorantly in unbelief ;
and the grace of our lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in christ jesus .
faithful is the saying , and worthy of all acceptation , that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners ; of whom i am chief :
now unto the king eternal , immortal , invisible , the only god , be honor and glory for ever and ever . amen .
holding faith and a good conscience ; which some having thrust from them made shipwreck concerning the faith :
of whom is hymenaeus and alexander ; whom i delivered unto satan , that they might be taught not to blaspheme .
i exhort therefore , first of all , that supplications , prayers , intercessions , thanksgivings , be made for all men ;
for kings and all that are in high place ; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity .
this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our saviour ;
who would have all men to be saved , and come to the knowledge of the truth .
for there is one god , one mediator also between god and men , himself man , christ jesus ,
who gave himself a ransom for all ; the testimony to be borne in its own times ;
whereunto i was appointed a preacher and an apostle ( i speak the truth , i lie not ) , a teacher of the gentiles in faith and truth .
i desire therefore that the men pray in every place , lifting up holy hands , without wrath and disputing .
in like manner , that women adorn themselves in modest apparel , with shamefastness and sobriety ; not with braided hair , and gold or pearls or costly raiment ;
but ( which becometh women professing godliness ) through good works .
let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection .
but i permit not a woman to teach , nor to have dominion over a man , but to be in quietness .
for adam was first formed , then eve ;
and adam was not beguiled , but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression :
but she shall be saved through her child-bearing , if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety .
faithful is the saying , if a man seeketh the office of a bishop , he desireth a good work .
the bishop therefore must be without reproach , the husband of one wife , temperate , sober-minded , orderly , given to hospitality , apt to teach ;
no brawler , no striker ; but gentle , not contentious , no lover of money ;
one that ruleth well his own house , having his children in subjection with all gravity ;
( but if a man knoweth not how to rule his own house , how shall he take care of the church of god ? )
not a novice , lest being puffed up he fall into the condemnation of the devil .
moreover he must have good testimony from them that are without ; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil .
deacons in like manner must be grave , not double-tongued , not given to much wine , not greedy of filthy lucre ;
holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience .
and let these also first be proved ; then let them serve as deacons , if they be blameless .
women in like manner must be grave , not slanderers , temperate , faithful in all things .
let deacons be husbands of one wife , ruling their children and their own houses well .
for they that have served well as deacons gain to themselves a good standing , and great boldness in the faith which is in christ jesus .
these things write i unto thee , hoping to come unto thee shortly ;
and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness ;
but the spirit saith expressly , that in later times some shall fall away from the faith , giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons ,
through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies , branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron ;
forbidding to marry , and commanding to abstain from meats , which god created to be received with thanksgiving by them that believe and know the truth .
for every creature of god is good , and nothing is to be rejected , if it be received with thanksgiving :
for it is sanctified through the word of god and prayer .
but refuse profane and old wives ’ fables . and exercise thyself unto godliness :
faithful is the saying , and worthy of all acceptation .
these things command and teach .
till i come , give heed to reading , to exhortation , to teaching .
neglect not the gift that is in thee , which was given thee by prophecy , with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery .
be diligent in these things ; give thyself wholly to them ; that thy progress may be manifest unto all .
take heed to thyself , and to thy teaching . continue in these things ; for in doing this thou shalt save both thyself and them that hear thee .
rebuke not an elder , but exhort him as a father ; the younger men as brethren :
the elder women as mothers ; the younger as sisters , in all purity .
honor widows that are widows indeed .
now she that is a widow indeed , and desolate , hath her hope set on god , and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day .
but she that giveth herself to pleasure is dead while she liveth .
these things also command , that they may be without reproach .
but if any provideth not for his own , and specially his own household , he hath denied the faith , and is worse than an unbeliever .
let none be enrolled as a widow under threescore years old , having been the wife of one man ,
but younger widows refuse : for when they have waxed wanton against christ , they desire to marry ;
having condemnation , because they have rejected their first pledge .
i desire therefore that the younger widows marry , bear children , rule the household , give no occasion to the adversary for reviling :
for already some are turned aside after satan .
let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor , especially those who labor in the word and in teaching .
for the scripture saith , thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn . and , the laborer is worthy of his hire .
against an elder receive not an accusation , except at the mouth of two or three witnesses .
them that sin reprove in the sight of all , that the rest also may be in fear .
lay hands hastily on no man , neither be partaker of other men ’ s sins : keep thyself pure .
be no longer a drinker of water , but use a little wine for thy stomach ’ s sake and thine often infirmities .
some men ’ s sins are evident , going before unto judgment ; and some men also they follow after .
in like manner also there are good works that are evident ; and such as are otherwise can not be hid .
let as many as are servants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor , that the name of god and the doctrine be not blasphemed .
he is puffed up , knowing nothing , but doting about questionings and disputes of words , whereof cometh envy , strife , railings , evil surmisings ,
wranglings of men corrupted in mind and bereft of the truth , supposing that godliness is a way of gain .
but godliness with contentment is great gain :
for we brought nothing into the world , for neither can we carry anything out ;
but having food and covering we shall be therewith content .
but thou , o man of god , flee these things ; and follow after righteousness , godliness , faith , love , patience , meekness .
i charge thee in the sight of god , who giveth life to all things , and of christ jesus , who before pontius pilate witnessed the good confession ;
that thou keep the commandment , without spot , without reproach , until the appearing of our lord jesus christ :
which in its own times he shall show , who is the blessed and only potentate , the king of kings , and lord of lords ;
who only hath immortality , dwelling in light unapproachable ; whom no man hath seen , nor can see : to whom be honor and power eternal . amen .
that they do good , that they be rich in good works , that they be ready to distribute , willing to communicate ;
laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come , that they may lay hold on the life which is life indeed .
o timothy , guard that which is committed unto thee , turning away from the profane babblings and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called ;
which some professing have erred concerning the faith .
paul , an apostle of christ jesus through the will of god , according to the promise of the life which is in christ jesus ,
to timothy , my beloved child : grace , mercy , peace , from god the father and christ jesus our lord .
i thank god , whom i serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience , how unceasing is my remembrance of thee in my supplications , night and day
longing to see thee , remembering thy tears , that i may be filled with joy ;
for which cause i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god , which is in thee through the laying on of my hands .
for god gave us not a spirit of fearfulness ; but of power and love and discipline .
be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our lord , nor of me his prisoner : but suffer hardship with the gospel according to the power of god ;
but hath now been manifested by the appearing of our saviour christ jesus , who abolished death , and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel ,
whereunto i was appointed a preacher , and an apostle , and a teacher .
hold the pattern of sound words which thou hast heard from me , in faith and love which is in christ jesus .
that good thing which was committed unto thee guard through the holy spirit which dwelleth in us .
this thou knowest , that all that are in asia turned away from me ; of whom are phygelus and hermogenes .
the lord grant mercy unto the house of onesiphorus : for he oft refreshed me , and was not ashamed of my chain ;
but , when he was in rome , he sought me diligently , and found me
thou therefore , my child , be strengthened in the grace that is in christ jesus .
and the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses , the same commit thou to faithful men , who shall be able to teach others also .
suffer hardship with me , as a good soldier of christ jesus .
no soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of this life ; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier .
and if also a man contend in the games , he is not crowned , except he have contended lawfully .
the husbandman that laboreth must be the first to partake of the fruits .
consider what i say ; for the lord shall give thee understanding in all things .
remember jesus christ , risen from the dead , of the seed of david , according to my gospel :
wherein i suffer hardship unto bonds , as a malefactor ; but the word of god is not bound .
therefore i endure all things for the elect ’ s sake , that they also may obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory .
faithful is the saying : for if we died with him , we shall also live with him :
if we endure , we shall also reign with him : if we shall deny him , he also will deny us :
if we are faithless , he abideth faithful ; for he can not deny himself .
give diligence to present thyself approved unto god , a workman that needeth not to be ashamed , handling aright the word of truth .
but shun profane babblings : for they will proceed further in ungodliness ,
and their word will eat as doth a gangrene : of whom is hymenaeus and philetus ;
men who concerning the truth have erred , saying that the resurrection is past already , and overthrow the faith of some .
but flee youthful lusts , and follow after righteousness , faith , love , peace , with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart .
but foolish and ignorant questionings refuse , knowing that they gender strifes .
and the lord ’ s servant must not strive , but be gentle towards all , apt to teach , forbearing ,
in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves ; if peradventure god may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth ,
and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil , having been taken captive by him unto his will .
but know this , that in the last days grievous times shall come .
for men shall be lovers of self , lovers of money , boastful , haughty , railers , disobedient to parents , unthankful , unholy ,
without natural affection , implacable , slanderers , without self-control , fierce , no lovers of good ,
traitors , headstrong , puffed up , lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of god ;
holding a form of godliness , but having denied the power thereof : from these also turn away .
for of these are they that creep into houses , and take captive silly women laden with sins , led away by divers lusts ,
ever learning , and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth .
and even as jannes and jambres withstood moses , so do these also withstand the truth ; men corrupted in mind , reprobate concerning the faith .
but they shall proceed no further : for their folly shall be evident unto all men , as theirs also came to be .
but thou didst follow my teaching , conduct , purpose , faith , longsuffering , love , patience ,
yea , and all that would live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution .
but evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse , deceiving and being deceived .
but abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of , knowing of whom thou hast learned them ;
and that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus .
every scripture inspired of god is also profitable for teaching , for reproof , for correction , for instruction which is in righteousness :
that the man of god may be complete , furnished completely unto every good work .
preach the word ; be urgent in season , out of season ; reprove , rebuke , exhort , with all longsuffering and teaching .
for the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine ; but , having itching ears , will heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts ;
and will turn away their ears from the truth , and turn aside unto fables .
but be thou sober in all things , suffer hardship , do the work of an evangelist , fulfil thy ministry .
for i am already being offered , and the time of my departure is come .
i have fought the good fight , i have finished the course , i have kept the faith :
give diligence to come shortly unto me :
for demas forsook me , having loved this present world , and went to thessalonica ; crescens to galatia , titus to dalmatia .
only luke is with me . take mark , and bring him with thee ; for he is useful to me for ministering .
but tychicus i sent to ephesus .
the cloak that i left at troas with carpus , bring when thou comest , and the books , especially the parchments .
alexander the coppersmith did me much evil : the lord will render to him according to his works :
of whom do thou also beware ; for he greatly withstood our words .
at my first defence no one took my part , but all forsook me : may it not be laid to their account .
salute prisca and aquila , and the house of onesiphorus .
erastus remained at corinth : but trophimus i left at miletus sick .
give diligence to come before winter . eubulus saluteth thee , and pudens , and linus , and claudia , and all the brethren .
the lord be with thy spirit . grace be with you .
in the third year of the reign of jehoiakim king of judah came nebuchadnezzar king of babylon unto jerusalem , and besieged it .
now among these were , of the children of judah , daniel , hananiah , mishael , and azariah .
now god made daniel to find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs .
then said daniel to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over daniel , hananiah , mishael , and azariah :
prove thy servants , i beseech thee , ten days ; and let them give us pulse to eat , and water to drink .
so he hearkened unto them in this matter , and proved them ten days .
so the steward took away their dainties , and the wine that they should drink , and gave them pulse .
now as for these four youths , god gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom : and daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams .
and at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in , the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before nebuchadnezzar .
and daniel continued even unto the first year of king cyrus .
and in the second year of the reign of nebuchadnezzar , nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams ; and his spirit was troubled , and his sleep went from him .
and the king said unto them , i have dreamed a dream , and my spirit is troubled to know the dream .
they answered the second time and said , let the king tell his servants the dream , and we will show the interpretation .
the king answered and said , i know of a certainty that ye would gain time , because ye see the thing is gone from me .
for this cause the king was angry and very furious , and commanded to destroy all the wise men of babylon .
so the decree went forth , and the wise men were to be slain ; and they sought daniel and his companions to be slain .
and daniel went in , and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time , and he would show the king the interpretation .
then daniel went to his house , and made the thing known to hananiah , mishael , and azariah , his companions :
then was the secret revealed unto daniel in a vision of the night . then daniel blessed the god of heaven .
daniel answered and said , blessed be the name of god for ever and ever ; for wisdom and might are his .
he revealeth the deep and secret things ; he knoweth what is in the darkness , and the light dwelleth with him .
as for this image , its head was of fine gold , its breast and its arms of silver , its belly and its thighs of brass ,
its legs of iron , its feet part of iron , and part of clay .
this is the dream ; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king .
and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee ; and another third kingdom of brass , which shall bear rule over all the earth .
and as the toes of the feet were part of iron , and part of clay , so the kingdom shall be partly strong , and partly broken .
then the king nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face , and worshipped daniel , and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors unto him .
then the herald cried aloud , to you it is commanded , o peoples , nations , and languages ,
and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace .
wherefore at that time certain chaldeans came near , and brought accusation against the jews .
they answered and said to nebuchadnezzar the king , o king , live for ever .
and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth , shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace .
then nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring shadrach , meshach , and abed-nego . then they brought these men before the king .
shadrach , meshach , and abed-nego answered and said to the king , o nebuchadnezzar , we have no need to answer thee in this matter .
and he commanded certain mighty men that were in his army to bind shadrach , meshach , and abed-nego , and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace .
and these three men , shadrach , meshach , and abed-nego , fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
then the king promoted shadrach , meshach , and abed-nego in the province of babylon .
nebuchadnezzar the king , unto all the peoples , nations , and languages , that dwell in all the earth : peace be multiplied unto you .
it hath seemed good unto me to show the signs and wonders that the most high god hath wrought toward me .
how great are his signs ! and how mighty are his wonders ! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and his dominion is from generation to generation .
i , nebuchadnezzar , was at rest in my house , and flourishing in my palace .
i saw a dream which made me afraid ; and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me .
therefore made i a decree to bring in all the wise men of babylon before me , that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream .
the tree grew , and was strong , and the height thereof reached unto heaven , and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth .
i saw in the visions of my head upon my bed , and , behold , a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven .
let his heart be changed from man ’ s , and let a beast ’ s heart be given unto him ; and let seven times pass over him .
the tree that thou sawest , which grew , and was strong , whose height reached unto heaven , and the sight thereof to all the earth ;
this is the interpretation , o king , and it is the decree of the most high , which is come upon my lord the king :
all this came upon the king nebuchadnezzar .
at the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of babylon .
belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords , and drank wine before the thousand .
they drank wine , and praised the gods of gold , and of silver , of brass , of iron , of wood , and of stone .
then came in all the king ’ s wise men ; but they could not read the writing , nor make known to the king the interpretation .
then was king belshazzar greatly troubled , and his countenance was changed in him , and his lords were perplexed .
i have heard of thee , that the spirit of the gods is in thee , and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in thee .
o thou king , the most high god gave nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom , and greatness , and glory , and majesty :
and thou his son , o belshazzar , hast not humbled thy heart , though thou knewest all this ,
then was the part of the hand sent from before him , and this writing was inscribed .
and this is the writing that was inscribed : mene , mene , tekel , upharsin .
this is the interpretation of the thing : mene ; god hath numbered thy kingdom , and brought it to an end .
tekel ; thou art weighed in the balances , and art found wanting .
peres ; thy kingdom is divided , and given to the medes and persians .
in that night belshazzar the chaldean king was slain .
and darius the mede received the kingdom , being about threescore and two years old .
it pleased darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps , who should be throughout the whole kingdom ;
and over them three presidents , of whom daniel was one ; that these satraps might give account unto them , and that the king should have no damage .
then said these men , we shall not find any occasion against this daniel , except we find it against him concerning the law of his god .
then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king , and said thus unto him , king darius , live for ever .
wherefore king darius signed the writing and the interdict .
then these men assembled together , and found daniel making petition and supplication before his god .
then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fasting ; neither were instruments of music brought before him : and his sleep fled from him .
then the king arose very early in the morning , and went in haste unto the den of lions .
then said daniel unto the king , o king , live for ever .
then king darius wrote unto all the peoples , nations , and languages , that dwell in all the earth : peace be multiplied unto you .
he delivereth and rescueth , and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth , who hath delivered daniel from the power of the lions .
so this daniel prospered in the reign of darius , and in the reign of cyrus the persian .
daniel spake and said , i saw in my vision by night , and , behold , the four winds of heaven brake forth upon the great sea .
and four great beasts came up from the sea , diverse one from another .
and as for the rest of the beasts , their dominion was taken away : yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time .
as for me , daniel , my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
these great beasts , which are four , are four kings , that shall arise out of the earth .
but the saints of the most high shall receive the kingdom , and possess the kingdom for ever , even for ever and ever .
i beheld , and the same horn made war with the saints , and prevailed against them ;
until the ancient of days came , and judgment was given to the saints of the most high , and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom .
but the judgment shall be set , and they shall take away his dominion , to consume and to destroy it unto the end .
and he said unto me , unto two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings ; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed .
the ram which thou sawest , that had the two horns , they are the kings of media and persia .
and the rough he-goat is the king of greece : and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king .
in the first year of darius the son of ahasuerus , of the seed of the medes , who was made king over the realm of the chaldeans ,
and i set my face unto the lord god , to seek by prayer and supplications , with fasting and sackcloth and ashes .
we have sinned , and have dealt perversely , and have done wickedly , and have rebelled , even turning aside from thy precepts and from thine ordinances ;
o lord , to us belongeth confusion of face , to our kings , to our princes , and to our fathers , because we have sinned against thee .
to the lord our god belong mercies and forgiveness ; for we have rebelled against him ;
neither have we obeyed the voice of jehovah our god , to walk in his laws , which he set before us by his servants the prophets .
and he instructed me , and talked with me , and said , o daniel , i am now come forth to give thee wisdom and understanding .
in those days i , daniel , was mourning three whole weeks .
i ate no pleasant bread , neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth , neither did i anoint myself at all , till three whole weeks were fulfilled .
and in the four and twentieth day of the first month , as i was by the side of the great river , which is hiddekel ,
i lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and , behold , a man clothed in linen , whose loins were girded with pure gold of uphaz :
and , behold , a hand touched me , which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands .
now i am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days ; for the vision is yet for many days .
and when he had spoken unto me according to these words , i set my face toward the ground , and was dumb .
then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man , and he strengthened me .
and as for me , in the first year of darius the mede , i stood up to confirm and strengthen him .
and a mighty king shall stand up , that shall rule with great dominion , and do according to his will .
and he shall come into the realm of the king of the south , but he shall return into his own land .
and the multitude shall be lifted up , and his heart shall be exalted ; and he shall cast down tens of thousands , but he shall not prevail .
then he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land ; but he shall stumble and fall , and shall not be found .
and the overwhelming forces shall be overwhelmed from before him , and shall be broken ; yea , also the prince of the covenant .
and after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully ; for he shall come up , and shall become strong , with a small people .
yea , they that eat of his dainties shall destroy him , and his army shall overflow ; and many shall fall down slain .
at the time appointed he shall return , and come into the south ; but it shall not be in the latter time as it was in the former .
and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he pervert by flatteries ; but the people that know their god shall be strong , and do exploits .
now when they shall fall , they shall be helped with a little help ; but many shall join themselves unto them with flatteries .
neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers , nor the desire of women , nor regard any god ; for he shall magnify himself above all .
he shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries ; and the land of egypt shall not escape .
and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake , some to everlasting life , and some to shame and everlasting contempt .
and they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament ; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever .
and i heard , but i understood not : then said i , o my lord , what shall be the issue of these things ?
and he said , go thy way , daniel ; for the words are shut up and sealed till the time of the end .
blessed is he that waiteth , and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days .
but go thou thy way till the end be ; for thou shalt rest , and shalt stand in thy lot , at the end of the days .
it is eleven days ’ journey from horeb by the way of mount seir unto kadesh-barnea .
beyond the jordan , in the land of moab , began moses to declare this law , saying ,
jehovah our god spake unto us in horeb , saying , ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain :
and i spake unto you at that time , saying , i am not able to bear you myself alone :
jehovah your god hath multiplied you , and , behold , ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude .
jehovah , the god of your fathers , make you a thousand times as many as ye are , and bless you , as he hath promised you !
how can i myself alone bear your cumbrance , and your burden , and your strife ?
take you wise men , and understanding , and known , according to your tribes , and i will make them heads over you .
and ye answered me , and said , the thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do .
and i commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do .
and i said unto you , ye are come unto the hill-country of the amorites , which jehovah our god giveth unto us .
and the thing pleased me well ; and i took twelve men of you , one man for every tribe :
and they turned and went up into the hill-country , and came unto the valley of eshcol , and spied it out .
yet ye would not go up , but rebelled against the commandment of jehovah your god :
then i said unto you , dread not , neither be afraid of them .
jehovah your god who goeth before you , he will fight for you , according to all that he did for you in egypt before your eyes ,
yet in this thing ye did not believe jehovah your god ,
and jehovah heard the voice of your words , and was wroth , and sware , saying ,
surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see the good land , which i sware to give unto your fathers ,
also jehovah was angry with me for your sakes , saying , thou also shalt not go in thither :
joshua the son of nun , who standeth before thee , he shall go in thither : encourage thou him ; for he shall cause israel to inherit it .
but as for you , turn you , and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the red sea .
and ye returned and wept before jehovah ; but jehovah hearkened not to your voice , nor gave ear unto you .
so ye abode in kadesh many days , according unto the days that ye abode there .
and jehovah spake unto me , saying ,
ye have compassed this mountain long enough : turn you northward .
ye shall purchase food of them for money , that ye may eat ; and ye shall also buy water of them for money , that ye may drink .
so we passed by from our brethren the children of esau , that dwell in seir , from the way of the arabah from elath and from ezion-geber .
( the emim dwelt therein aforetime , a people great , and many , and tall , as the anakim :
these also are accounted rephaim , as the anakim ; but the moabites call them emim .
now rise up , and get you over the brook zered . and we went over the brook zered .
moreover the hand of jehovah was against them , to destroy them from the midst of the camp , until they were consumed .
so it came to pass , when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people ,
that jehovah spake unto me , saying ,
thou art this day to pass over ar , the border of moab :
( that also is accounted a land of rephaim : rephaim dwelt therein aforetime ; but the ammonites call them zamzummim ,
and i sent messengers out of the wilderness of kedemoth unto sihon king of heshbon with words of peace , saying ,
let me pass through thy land : i will go along by the highway , i will turn neither unto the right hand nor to the left .
then sihon came out against us , he and all his people , unto battle at jahaz .
and jehovah our god delivered him up before us ; and we smote him , and his sons , and all his people .
and we took all his cities at that time , and utterly destroyed every inhabited city , with the women and the little ones ; we left none remaining :
only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves , with the spoil of the cities which we had taken .
all these were cities fortified with high walls , gates , and bars ; besides the unwalled towns a great many .
and we utterly destroyed them , as we did unto sihon king of heshbon , utterly destroying every inhabited city , with the women and the little ones .
but all the cattle , and the spoil of the cities , we took for a prey unto ourselves .
( which hermon the sidonians call sirion , and the amorites call it senir ) ;
all the cities of the plain , and all gilead , and all bashan , unto salecah and edrei , cities of the kingdom of og in bashan .
and i gave gilead unto machir .
ye shall not fear them ; for jehovah your god , he it is that fighteth for you .
and i besought jehovah at that time , saying ,
let me go over , i pray thee , and see the good land that is beyond the jordan , that goodly mountain , and lebanon .
so we abode in the valley over against beth-peor .
but ye that did cleave unto jehovah your god are alive every one of you this day .
for what great nation is there , that hath a god so nigh unto them , as jehovah our god is whensoever we call upon him ?
and what great nation is there , that hath statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law , which i set before you this day ?
and he declared unto you his covenant , which he commanded you to perform , even the ten commandments ; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone .
and jehovah commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances , that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it .
lest ye corrupt yourselves , and make you a graven image in the form of any figure , the likeness of male or female ,
the likeness of any beast that is on the earth , the likeness of any winged bird that flieth in the heavens ,
the likeness of anything that creepeth on the ground , the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth ;
but i must die in this land , i must not go over the jordan ; but ye shall go over , and possess that good land .
for jehovah thy god is a devouring fire , a jealous god .
and jehovah will scatter you among the peoples , and ye shall be left few in number among the nations , whither jehovah shall lead you away .
did ever a people hear the voice of god speaking out of the midst of the fire , as thou hast heard , and live ?
unto thee it was showed , that thou mightest know that jehovah he is god ; there is none else besides him .
then moses set apart three cities beyond the jordan toward the sunrising ;
and this is the law which moses set before the children of israel :
these are the testimonies , and the statutes , and the ordinances , which moses spake unto the children of israel , when they came forth out of egypt ,
from aroer , which is on the edge of the valley of the arnon , even unto mount sion ( the same is hermon ) ,
and all the arabah beyond the jordan eastward , even unto the sea of the arabah , under the slopes of pisgah .
jehovah our god made a covenant with us in horeb .
jehovah made not this covenant with our fathers , but with us , even us , who are all of us here alive this day .
jehovah spake with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire
i am jehovah thy god , who brought thee out of the land of egypt , out of the house of bondage .
thou shalt have no other gods before me .
and showing lovingkindness unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments .
thou shalt not take the name of jehovah thy god in vain : for jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain .
observe the sabbath day , to keep it holy , as jehovah thy god commanded thee .
six days shalt thou labor , and do all thy work ;
thou shalt not kill .
neither shalt thou commit adultery .
neither shalt thou steal .
neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbor .
go say to them , return ye to your tents .
ye shall observe to do therefore as jehovah your god hath commanded you : ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
hear , o israel : jehovah our god is one jehovah :
and thou shalt love jehovah thy god with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy might .
and these words , which i command thee this day , shall be upon thy heart ;
and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand , and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes .
and thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house , and upon thy gates .
then beware lest thou forget jehovah , who brought thee forth out of the land of egypt , out of the house of bondage .
thou shalt fear jehovah thy god ; and him shalt thou serve , and shalt swear by his name .
ye shall not go after other gods , of the gods of the peoples that are round about you ;
ye shall not tempt jehovah your god , as ye tempted him in massah .
ye shall diligently keep the commandments of jehovah your god , and his testimonies , and his statutes , which he hath commanded thee .
to thrust out all thine enemies from before thee , as jehovah hath spoken .
then thou shalt say unto thy son , we were pharaoh ’ s bondmen in egypt : and jehovah brought us out of egypt with a mighty hand ;
and jehovah showed signs and wonders , great and sore , upon egypt , upon pharaoh , and upon all his house , before our eyes ;
and he brought us out from thence , that he might bring us in , to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers .
and it shall be righteousness unto us , if we observe to do all this commandment before jehovah our god , as he hath commanded us .
neither shalt thou make marriages with them ; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son , nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son .
thou shalt therefore keep the commandment , and the statutes , and the ordinances , which i command thee this day , to do them .
thou shalt be blessed above all peoples : there shall not be male or female barren among you , or among your cattle .
if thou shalt say in thy heart , these nations are more than i ; how can i dispossess them ?
thou shalt not be afraid of them : thou shalt well remember what jehovah thy god did unto pharaoh , and unto all egypt ;
moreover jehovah thy god will send the hornet among them , until they that are left , and hide themselves , perish from before thee .
thou shalt not be affrighted at them ; for jehovah thy god is in the midst of thee , a great god and a terrible .
but jehovah thy god will deliver them up before thee , and will discomfit them with a great discomfiture , until they be destroyed .
thy raiment waxed not old upon thee , neither did thy foot swell , these forty years .
and thou shalt consider in thy heart , that , as a man chasteneth his son , so jehovah thy god chasteneth thee .
and thou shalt keep the commandments of jehovah thy god , to walk in his ways , and to fear him .
for jehovah thy god bringeth thee into a good land , a land of brooks of water , of fountains and springs , flowing forth in valleys and hills ;
a land of wheat and barley , and vines and fig-trees and pomegranates ; a land of olive-trees and honey ;
and thou shalt eat and be full , and thou shalt bless jehovah thy god for the good land which he hath given thee .
beware lest thou forget jehovah thy god , in not keeping his commandments , and his ordinances , and his statutes , which i command thee this day :
lest , when thou hast eaten and art full , and hast built goodly houses , and dwelt therein ;
and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply , and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied , and all that thou hast is multiplied ;
and lest thou say in thy heart , my power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth .
as the nations that jehovah maketh to perish before you , so shall ye perish ; because ye would not hearken unto the voice of jehovah your god .
know therefore , that jehovah thy god giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness ; for thou art a stiffnecked people .
also in horeb ye provoked jehovah to wrath , and jehovah was angry with you to destroy you .
furthermore jehovah spake unto me , saying , i have seen this people , and , behold , it is a stiffnecked people :
and i took hold of the two tables , and cast them out of my two hands , and brake them before your eyes .
for i was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure , wherewith jehovah was wroth against you to destroy you . but jehovah hearkened unto me that time also .
and jehovah was very angry with aaron to destroy him : and i prayed for aaron also at the same time .
and at taberah , and at massah , and at kibroth-hattaavah , ye provoked jehovah to wrath .
ye have been rebellious against jehovah from the day that i knew you .
so i fell down before jehovah the forty days and forty nights that i fell down , because jehovah had said he would destroy you .
remember thy servants , abraham , isaac , and jacob ; look not unto the stubbornness of this people , nor to their wickedness , nor to their sin ,
yet they are thy people and thine inheritance , which thou broughtest out by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm .
and i will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou brakest , and thou shalt put them in the ark .
from thence they journeyed unto gudgodah ; and from gudgodah to jotbathah , a land of brooks of water .
wherefore levi hath no portion nor inheritance with his brethren ; jehovah is his inheritance , according as jehovah thy god spake unto him . )
to keep the commandments of jehovah , and his statutes , which i command thee this day for thy good ?
behold , unto jehovah thy god belongeth heaven and the heaven of heavens , the earth , with all that is therein .
circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart , and be no more stiffnecked .
he doth execute justice for the fatherless and widow , and loveth the sojourner , in giving him food and raiment .
love ye therefore the sojourner ; for ye were sojourners in the land of egypt .
thou shalt fear jehovah thy god ; him shalt thou serve ; and to him shalt thou cleave , and by his name shalt thou swear .
he is thy praise , and he is thy god , that hath done for thee these great and terrible things , which thine eyes have seen .
thy fathers went down into egypt with threescore and ten persons ; and now jehovah thy god hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude .
therefore thou shalt love jehovah thy god , and keep his charge , and his statutes , and his ordinances , and his commandments , alway .
and his signs , and his works , which he did in the midst of egypt unto pharaoh the king of egypt , and unto all his land ;
and what he did unto you in the wilderness , until ye came unto this place ;
but your eyes have seen all the great work of jehovah which he did .
but the land , whither ye go over to possess it , is a land of hills and valleys , and drinketh water of the rain of heaven ,
and i will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle , and thou shalt eat and be full .
take heed to yourselves , lest your heart be deceived , and ye turn aside , and serve other gods , and worship them ;
and thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house , and upon thy gates ;
then will jehovah drive out all these nations from before you , and ye shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves .
behold , i set before you this day a blessing and a curse :
the blessing , if ye shall hearken unto the commandments of jehovah your god , which i command you this day ;
and ye shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which i set before you this day .
ye shall not do so unto jehovah your god .
ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day , every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes ;
for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance , which jehovah thy god giveth thee .
take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest ;
only ye shall not eat the blood ; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water .
take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the levite as long as thou livest in thy land .
even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten , so thou shalt eat thereof : the unclean and the clean may eat thereof alike .
only be sure that thou eat not the blood : for the blood is the life ; and thou shalt not eat the life with the flesh .
thou shalt not eat it ; thou shalt pour it out upon the earth as water .
only thy holy things which thou hast , and thy vows , thou shalt take , and go unto the place which jehovah shall choose ;
what thing soever i command you , that shall ye observe to do : thou shalt not add thereto , nor diminish from it .
if there arise in the midst of thee a prophet , or a dreamer of dreams , and he give thee a sign or a wonder ,
thou shalt not consent unto him , nor hearken unto him ; neither shall thine eye pity him , neither shalt thou spare , neither shalt thou conceal him :
but thou shalt surely kill him ; thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
and all israel shall hear , and fear , and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is in the midst of thee .
if thou shalt hear tell concerning one of thy cities , which jehovah thy god giveth thee to dwell there , saying ,
ye are the children of jehovah your god : ye shall not cut yourselves , nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead .
thou shalt not eat any abominable thing .
these are the beasts which ye may eat : the ox , the sheep , and the goat ,
the hart , and the gazelle , and the roebuck , and the wild goat , and the pygarg , and the antelope , and the chamois .
and every beast that parteth the hoof , and hath the hoof cloven in two , and cheweth the cud , among the beasts , that may ye eat .
these ye may eat of all that are in the waters : whatsoever hath fins and scales may ye eat ;
and whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye shall not eat ; it is unclean unto you .
of all clean birds ye may eat .
but these are they of which ye shall not eat : the eagle , and the gier-eagle , and the ospray ,
and the glede , and the falcon , and the kite after its kind ,
and every raven after its kind ,
and the ostrich , and the night-hawk , and the sea-mew , and the hawk after its kind ,
the little owl , and the great owl , and the horned owl ,
and the pelican , and the vulture , and the cormorant ,
and the stork , and the heron after its kind , and the hoopoe , and the bat .
and all winged creeping things are unclean unto you : they shall not be eaten .
of all clean birds ye may eat .
thou shalt surely tithe all the increase of thy seed , that which cometh forth from the field year by year .
then shalt thou turn it into money , and bind up the money in thy hand , and shalt go unto the place which jehovah thy god shall choose :
and the levite that is within thy gates , thou shalt not forsake him ; for he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee .
at the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release .
of a foreigner thou mayest exact it : but whatsoever of thine is with thy brother thy hand shall release .
if only thou diligently hearken unto the voice of jehovah thy god , to observe to do all this commandment which i command thee this day .
but thou shalt surely open thy hand unto him , and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need in that which he wanteth .
and when thou lettest him go free from thee , thou shalt not let him go empty :
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of egypt , and jehovah thy god redeemed thee : therefore i command thee this thing to-day .
thou shalt eat it before jehovah thy god year by year in the place which jehovah shall choose , thou and thy household .
and if it have any blemish , as if it be lame or blind , any ill blemish whatsoever , thou shalt not sacrifice it unto jehovah thy god .
thou shalt eat it within thy gates : the unclean and the clean shall eat it alike , as the gazelle , and as the hart .
only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof ; thou shalt pour it out upon the ground as water .
thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates , which jehovah thy god giveth thee ;
six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread ; and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to jehovah thy god ; thou shalt do no work therein .
seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee : from the time thou beginnest to put the sickle to the standing grain shalt thou begin to number seven weeks .
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in egypt : and thou shalt observe and do these statutes .
thou shalt keep the feast of tabernacles seven days , after that thou hast gathered in from thy threshing-floor and from thy winepress :
every man shall give as he is able , according to the blessing of jehovah thy god which he hath given thee .
that which is altogether just shalt thou follow , that thou mayest live , and inherit the land which jehovah thy god giveth thee .
thou shalt not plant thee an asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of jehovah thy god , which thou shalt make thee .
neither shalt thou set thee up a pillar ; which jehovah thy god hateth .
and all the people shall hear , and fear , and do no more presumptuously .
neither shall he multiply wives to himself , that his heart turn not away : neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold .
and they shall have no inheritance among their brethren : jehovah is their inheritance , as he hath spoken unto them .
for jehovah thy god hath chosen him out of all thy tribes , to stand to minister in the name of jehovah , him and his sons for ever .
then he shall minister in the name of jehovah his god , as all his brethren the levites do , who stand there before jehovah .
they shall have like portions to eat , besides that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony .
when thou art come into the land which jehovah thy god giveth thee , thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations .
or a charmer , or a consulter with a familiar spirit , or a wizard , or a necromancer .
for whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto jehovah : and because of these abominations jehovah thy god doth drive them out from before thee .
thou shalt be perfect with jehovah thy god .
jehovah thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee , of thy brethren , like unto me ; unto him ye shall hearken ;
and jehovah said unto me , they have well said that which they have spoken .
and it shall come to pass , that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name , i will require it of him .
and if thou say in thy heart , how shall we know the word which jehovah hath not spoken ?
thou shalt set apart three cities for thee in the midst of thy land , which jehovah thy god giveth thee to possess it .
and this is the case of the manslayer , that shall flee thither and live : whoso killeth his neighbor unawares , and hated him not in time past ;
wherefore i command thee , saying , thou shalt set apart three cities for thee .
that innocent blood be not shed in the midst of thy land , which jehovah thy god giveth thee for an inheritance , and so blood be upon thee .
then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence , and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood , that he may die .
thine eye shall not pity him , but thou shalt put away the innocent blood from israel , that it may go well with thee .
if an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify against him of wrong-doing ,
then both the men , between whom the controversy is , shall stand before jehovah , before the priests and the judges that shall be in those days ;
and the judges shall make diligent inquisition : and , behold , if the witness be a false witness , and have testified falsely against his brother ;
then shall ye do unto him , as he had thought to do unto his brother : so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee .
and those that remain shall hear , and fear , and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of thee .
and thine eyes shall not pity ; life shall go for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot .
and it shall be , when ye draw nigh unto the battle , that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people ,
for jehovah your god is he that goeth with you , to fight for you against your enemies , to save you .
when thou drawest nigh unto a city to fight against it , then proclaim peace unto it .
and if it will make no peace with thee , but will make war against thee , then thou shalt besiege it :
and when jehovah thy god delivereth it into thy hand , thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword :
thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee , which are not of the cities of these nations .
but of the cities of these peoples , that jehovah thy god giveth thee for an inheritance , thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth ;
that they teach you not to do after all their abominations , which they have done unto their gods ; so would ye sin against jehovah your god .
then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth , and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain :
and they shall answer and say , our hands have not shed this blood , neither have our eyes seen it .
so shalt thou put away the innocent blood from the midst of thee , when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of jehovah .
when thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies , and jehovah thy god delivereth them into thy hands , and thou carriest them away captive ,
and seest among the captives a beautiful woman , and thou hast a desire unto her , and wouldest take her to thee to wife ;
then thou shalt bring her home to thy house ; and she shall shave her head , and pare her nails ;
and if a man have committed a sin worthy of death , and he be put to death , and thou hang him on a tree ;
thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together .
thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff , wool and linen together .
thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four borders of thy vesture , wherewith thou coverest thyself .
if any man take a wife , and go in unto her , and hate her ,
and the damsel ’ s father shall say unto the elders , i gave my daughter unto this man to wife , and he hateth her ;
and the elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him ;
but if this thing be true , that the tokens of virginity were not found in the damsel ;
if there be a damsel that is a virgin betrothed unto a husband , and a man find her in the city , and lie with her ;
for he found her in the field , the betrothed damsel cried , and there was none to save her .
a man shall not take his father ’ s wife , and shall not uncover his father ’ s skirt .
he that is wounded in the stones , or hath his privy member cut off , shall not enter into the assembly of jehovah .
a bastard shall not enter into the assembly of jehovah ; even to the tenth generation shall none of his enter into the assembly of jehovah .
nevertheless jehovah thy god would not hearken unto balaam ; but jehovah thy god turned the curse into a blessing unto thee , because jehovah thy god loved thee .
thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever .
thou shalt not abhor an edomite ; for he is thy brother : thou shalt not abhor an egyptian ; because thou wast a sojourner in his land .
the children of the third generation that are born unto them shall enter into the assembly of jehovah .
when thou goest forth in camp against thine enemies , then thou shalt keep thee from every evil thing .
thou shalt have a place also without the camp , whither thou shalt go forth abroad :
thou shalt not deliver unto his master a servant that is escaped from his master unto thee :
there shall be no prostitute of the daughters of israel , neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of israel .
thou shalt not lend upon interest to thy brother ; interest of money , interest of victuals , interest of anything that is lent upon interest .
but if thou shalt forbear to vow , it shall be no sin in thee .
and when she is departed out of his house , she may go and be another man ’ s wife .
no man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge ; for he taketh a man ’ s life to pledge .
remember what jehovah thy god did unto miriam , by the way as ye came forth out of egypt .
when thou dost lend thy neighbor any manner of loan , thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge .
thou shalt stand without , and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring forth the pledge without unto thee .
and if he be a poor man , thou shalt not sleep with his pledge ;
thou shalt not wrest the justice due to the sojourner , or to the fatherless , nor take the widow ’ s raiment to pledge ;
but thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in egypt , and jehovah thy god redeemed thee thence : therefore i command thee to do this thing .
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of egypt : therefore i command thee to do this thing .
thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the grain .
then the elders of his city shall call him , and speak unto him : and if he stand , and say , i like not to take her ;
and his name shall be called in israel , the house of him that hath his shoe loosed .
then thou shalt cut off her hand , thine eye shall have no pity .
thou shalt not have in thy bag diverse weights , a great and a small .
thou shalt not have in thy house diverse measures , a great and a small .
for all that do such things , even all that do unrighteously , are an abomination unto jehovah thy god .
remember what amalek did unto thee by the way as ye came forth out of egypt ;
and the priest shall take the basket out of thy hand , and set it down before the altar of jehovah thy god .
and the egyptians dealt ill with us , and afflicted us , and laid upon us hard bondage :
and he hath brought us into this place , and hath given us this land , a land flowing with milk and honey .
and moses and the elders of israel commanded the people , saying , keep all the commandment which i command you this day .
and there shalt thou build an altar unto jehovah thy god , an altar of stones : thou shalt lift up no iron tool upon them .
thou shalt build the altar of jehovah thy god of unhewn stones ; and thou shalt offer burnt-offerings thereon unto jehovah thy god :
and thou shalt sacrifice peace-offerings , and shalt eat there ; and thou shalt rejoice before jehovah thy god .
and thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly .
thou shalt therefore obey the voice of jehovah thy god , and do his commandments and his statutes , which i command thee this day .
and moses charged the people the same day , saying ,
and these shall stand upon mount ebal for the curse : reuben , gad , and asher , and zebulun , dan , and naphtali .
and the levites shall answer , and say unto all the men of israel with a loud voice ,
cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that removeth his neighbor ’ s landmark . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that wresteth the justice due to the sojourner , fatherless , and widow . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that lieth with his mother-in-law . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that smiteth his neighbor in secret . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that taketh a bribe to slay an innocent person . and all the people shall say , amen .
cursed be he that confirmeth not the words of this law to do them . and all the people shall say , amen .
and all these blessings shall come upon thee , and overtake thee , if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of jehovah thy god .
blessed shalt thou be in the city , and blessed shalt thou be in the field .
blessed shall be thy basket and thy kneading-trough .
blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in , and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out .
and all the peoples of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of jehovah ; and they shall be afraid of thee .
cursed shalt thou be in the city , and cursed shalt thou be in the field .
cursed shall be thy basket and thy kneading-trough .
cursed shall be the fruit of thy body , and the fruit of thy ground , the increase of thy cattle , and the young of thy flock .
cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in , and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out .
jehovah will make the pestilence cleave unto thee , until he have consumed thee from off the land , whither thou goest in to possess it .
and thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass , and the earth that is under thee shall be iron .
jehovah will make the rain of thy land powder and dust : from heaven shall it come down upon thee , until thou be destroyed .
jehovah will smite thee with madness , and with blindness , and with astonishment of heart ;
so that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see .
and thou shalt become an astonishment , a proverb , and a byword , among all the peoples whither jehovah shall lead thee away .
thou shalt carry much seed out into the field , and shalt gather little in ; for the locust shall consume it .
thou shalt plant vineyards and dress them , but thou shalt neither drink of the wine , nor gather the grapes ; for the worm shall eat them .
thou shalt have olive-trees throughout all thy borders , but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil ; for thine olive shall cast its fruit .
thou shalt beget sons and daughters , but they shall not be thine ; for they shall go into captivity .
all thy trees and the fruit of thy ground shall the locust possess .
the sojourner that is in the midst of thee shall mount up above thee higher and higher ; and thou shalt come down lower and lower .
he shall lend to thee , and thou shalt not lend to him : he shall be the head , and thou shalt be the tail .
and they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder , and upon thy seed for ever .
because thou servedst not jehovah thy god with joyfulness , and with gladness of heart , by reason of the abundance of all things ;
a nation of fierce countenance , that shall not regard the person of the old , nor show favor to the young ,
and he will bring upon thee again all the diseases of egypt , which thou wast afraid of ; and they shall cleave unto thee .
and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee ; and thou shalt fear night and day , and shalt have no assurance of thy life .
the great trials which thine eyes saw , the signs , and those great wonders :
but jehovah hath not given you a heart to know , and eyes to see , and ears to hear , unto this day .
ye have not eaten bread , neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink ; that ye may know that i am jehovah your god .
and we took their land , and gave it for an inheritance unto the reubenites , and to the gadites , and to the half-tribe of the manassites .
keep therefore the words of this covenant , and do them , that ye may prosper in all that ye do .
that thou mayest enter into the covenant of jehovah thy god , and into his oath , which jehovah thy god maketh with thee this day ;
neither with you only do i make this covenant and this oath ,
but with him that standeth here with us this day before jehovah our god , and also with him that is not here with us this day
( for ye know how we dwelt in the land of egypt , and how we came through the midst of the nations through which ye passed ;
and ye have seen their abominations , and their idols , wood and stone , silver and gold , which were among them ) ;
even all the nations shall say , wherefore hath jehovah done thus unto this land ? what meaneth the heat of this great anger ?
and went and served other gods , and worshipped them , gods that they knew not , and that he had not given unto them :
therefore the anger of jehovah was kindled against this land , to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book ;
if any of thine outcasts be in the uttermost parts of heaven , from thence will jehovah thy god gather thee , and from thence will he fetch thee :
and jehovah thy god will put all these curses upon thine enemies , and on them that hate thee , that persecuted thee .
and thou shalt return and obey the voice of jehovah , and do all his commandments which i command thee this day .
for this commandment which i command thee this day , it is not too hard for thee , neither is it far off .
but the word is very nigh unto thee , in thy mouth , and in thy heart , that thou mayest do it .
see , i have set before thee this day life and good , and death and evil ;
but if thy heart turn away , and thou wilt not hear , but shalt be drawn away , and worship other gods , and serve them ;
and moses went and spake these words unto all israel .
and jehovah will do unto them as he did to sihon and to og , the kings of the amorites , and unto their land ; whom he destroyed .
and jehovah will deliver them up before you , and ye shall do unto them according unto all the commandment which i have commanded you .
and jehovah appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud : and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the tent .
and i will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought , in that they are turned unto other gods .
so moses wrote this song the same day , and taught it the children of israel .
and it came to pass , when moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book , until they were finished ,
that moses commanded the levites , that bare the ark of the covenant of jehovah , saying ,
and moses spake in the ears of all the assembly of israel the words of this song , until they were finished .
give ear , ye heavens , and i will speak ;
my doctrine shall drop as the rain ;
for i will proclaim the name of jehovah :
the rock , his work is perfect ;
they have dealt corruptly with him , they are not his children , it is their blemish ;
do ye thus requite jehovah ,
remember the days of old ,
when the most high gave to the nations their inheritance ,
for jehovah ’ s portion is his people ;
he found him in a desert land ,
as an eagle that stirreth up her nest ,
jehovah alone did lead him ,
he made him ride on the high places of the earth ,
butter of the herd , and milk of the flock ,
but jeshurun waxed fat , and kicked :
they moved him to jealousy with strange gods ;
they sacrificed unto demons , which were no god ,
of the rock that begat thee thou art unmindful ,
and jehovah saw it , and abhorred them ,
and he said , i will hide my face from them ,
they have moved me to jealousy with that which is not god ;
for a fire is kindled in mine anger ,
i will heap evils upon them ;
they shall be wasted with hunger , and devoured with burning heat
without shall the sword bereave ,
i said , i would scatter them afar ,
were it not that i feared the provocation of the enemy ,
for they are a nation void of counsel ,
oh that they were wise , that they understood this ,
how should one chase a thousand ,
for their rock is not as our rock ,
for their vine is of the vine of sodom ,
their wine is the poison of serpents ,
is not this laid up in store with me ,
vengeance is mine , and recompense ,
for jehovah will judge his people ,
and he will say , where are their gods ,
which did eat the fat of their sacrifices ,
see now that i , even i , am he ,
for i lift up my hand to heaven ,
if i whet my glittering sword ,
i will make mine arrows drunk with blood ,
rejoice , o ye nations , with his people :
and moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people , he , and hoshea the son of nun .
and moses made an end of speaking all these words to all israel ;
and jehovah spake unto moses that selfsame day , saying ,
for thou shalt see the land before thee ; but thou shalt not go thither into the land which i give the children of israel .
and this is the blessing , wherewith moses the man of god blessed the children of israel before his death .
yea , he loveth the people ;
moses commanded us a law ,
and he was king in jeshurun ,
let reuben live , and not die ;
and this is the blessing of judah : and he said ,
and of levi he said ,
who said of his father , and of his mother , i have not seen him ;
they shall teach jacob thine ordinances ,
bless , jehovah , his substance ,
of benjamin he said ,
and of joseph he said ,
and for the precious things of the fruits of the sun ,
and for the chief things of the ancient mountains ,
and for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof ,
the firstling of his herd , majesty is his ;
and of zebulun he said ,
they shall call the peoples unto the mountain ;
and of gad he said ,
and he provided the first part for himself ,
and of dan he said ,
and of naphtali he said ,
and of asher he said ,
thy bars shall be iron and brass ;
there is none like unto god , o jeshurun ,
the eternal god is thy dwelling-place ,
and israel dwelleth in safety ,
happy art thou , o israel :
and all naphtali , and the land of ephraim and manasseh , and all the land of judah , unto the hinder sea ,
and the south , and the plain of the valley of jericho the city of palm-trees , unto zoar .
so moses the servant of jehovah died there in the land of moab , according to the word of jehovah .
and he buried him in the valley in the land of moab over against beth-peor : but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day .
and moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died : his eye was not dim , nor his natural force abated .
and the children of israel wept for moses in the plains of moab thirty days : so the days of weeping in the mourning for moses were ended .
and there hath not arisen a prophet since in israel like unto moses , whom jehovah knew face to face ,
and in all the mighty hand , and in all the great terror , which moses wrought in the sight of all israel .
the words of the preacher , the son of david , king in jerusalem .
vanity of vanities , saith the preacher ; vanity of vanities , all is vanity .
what profit hath man of all his labor wherein he laboreth under the sun ?
one generation goeth , and another generation cometh ; but the earth abideth for ever .
the sun also ariseth , and the sun goeth down , and hasteth to its place where it ariseth .
all the rivers run into the sea , yet the sea is not full ; unto the place whither the rivers go , thither they go again .
all things are full of weariness ; man can not utter it : the eye is not satisfied with seeing , nor the ear filled with hearing .
is there a thing whereof it may be said , see , this is new ? it hath been long ago , in the ages which were before us .
i the preacher was king over israel in jerusalem .
i have seen all the works that are done under the sun ; and , behold , all is vanity and a striving after wind .
that which is crooked can not be made straight ; and that which is wanting can not be numbered .
and i applied my heart to know wisdom , and to know madness and folly : i perceived that this also was a striving after wind .
for in much wisdom is much grief ; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow .
i said in my heart , come now , i will prove thee with mirth ; therefore enjoy pleasure : and , behold , this also was vanity .
i said of laughter , it is mad ; and of mirth , what doeth it ?
i made me great works ; i builded me houses ; i planted me vineyards ;
i made me gardens and parks , and i planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit ;
i made me pools of water , to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared ;
so i was great , and increased more than all that were before me in jerusalem : also my wisdom remained with me .
then i saw that wisdom excelleth folly , as far as light excelleth darkness .
the wise man ’ s eyes are in his head , and the fool walketh in darkness : and yet i perceived that one event happeneth to them all .
so i hated life , because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me ; for all is vanity and a striving after wind .
and i hated all my labor wherein i labored under the sun , seeing that i must leave it unto the man that shall be after me .
therefore i turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor wherein i had labored under the sun .
for what hath a man of all his labor , and of the striving of his heart , wherein he laboreth under the sun ?
for who can eat , or who can have enjoyment , more than i ?
for everything there is a season , and a time for every purpose under heaven :
a time to be born , and a time to die ; a time to plant , and a time to pluck up that which is planted ;
a time to kill , and a time to heal ; a time to break down , and a time to build up ;
a time to weep , and a time to laugh ; a time to mourn , and a time to dance ;
a time to cast away stones , and a time to gather stones together ; a time to embrace , and a time to refrain from embracing ;
a time to seek , and a time to lose ; a time to keep , and a time to cast away ;
a time to rend , and a time to sew ; a time to keep silence , and a time to speak ;
a time to love , and a time to hate ; a time for war , and a time for peace .
what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth ?
i have seen the travail which god hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith .
i know that there is nothing better for them , than to rejoice , and to do good so long as they live .
and also that every man should eat and drink , and enjoy good in all his labor , is the gift of god .
that which is hath been long ago ; and that which is to be hath long ago been : and god seeketh again that which is passed away .
i said in my heart , god will judge the righteous and the wicked ; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work .
all go unto one place ; all are of the dust , and all turn to dust again .
who knoweth the spirit of man , whether it goeth upward , and the spirit of the beast , whether it goeth downward to the earth ?
wherefore i praised the dead that have been long dead more than the living that are yet alive ;
yea , better than them both did i esteem him that hath not yet been , who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun .
the fool foldeth his hands together , and eateth his own flesh .
better is a handful , with quietness , than two handfuls with labor and striving after wind .
then i returned and saw vanity under the sun .
two are better than one , because they have a good reward for their labor .
again , if two lie together , then they have warmth ; but how can one be warm alone ?
and if a man prevail against him that is alone , two shall withstand him ; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken .
better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king , who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more .
for out of prison he came forth to be king ; yea , even in his kingdom he was born poor .
i saw all the living that walk under the sun , that they were with the youth , the second , that stood up in his stead .
for a dream cometh with a multitude of business , and a fool ’ s voice with a multitude of words .
when thou vowest a vow unto god , defer not to pay it ; for he hath no pleasure in fools : pay that which thou vowest .
better is it that thou shouldest not vow , than that thou shouldest vow and not pay .
for in the multitude of dreams there are vanities , and in many words : but fear thou god .
moreover the profit of the earth is for all : the king himself is served by the field .
he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver ; nor he that loveth abundance , with increase : this also is vanity .
when goods increase , they are increased that eat them ; and what advantage is there to the owner thereof , save the beholding of them with his eyes ?
the sleep of a laboring man is sweet , whether he eat little or much ; but the fulness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep .
there is a grievous evil which i have seen under the sun , namely , riches kept by the owner thereof to his hurt :
and those riches perish by evil adventure ; and if he hath begotten a son , there is nothing in his hand .
all his days also he eateth in darkness , and he is sore vexed , and hath sickness and wrath .
for he shall not much remember the days of his life ; because god answereth him in the joy of his heart .
there is an evil which i have seen under the sun , and it is heavy upon men :
for it cometh in vanity , and departeth in darkness , and the name thereof is covered with darkness ;
moreover it hath not seen the sun nor known it ; this hath rest rather than the other :
yea , though he live a thousand years twice told , and yet enjoy no good , do not all go to one place ?
all the labor of man is for his mouth , and yet the appetite is not filled .
for what advantage hath the wise more than the fool ? or what hath the poor man , that knoweth how to walk before the living ?
better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire : this also is vanity and a striving after wind .
seeing there are many things that increase vanity , what is man the better ?
a good name is better than precious oil ; and the day of death , than the day of one ’ s birth .
sorrow is better than laughter ; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made glad .
the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning ; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth .
it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise , than for a man to hear the song of fools .
for as the crackling of thorns under a pot , so is the laughter of the fool : this also is vanity .
surely extortion maketh the wise man foolish ; and a bribe destroyeth the understanding .
better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof ; and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit .
be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry ; for anger resteth in the bosom of fools .
say not thou , what is the cause that the former days were better than these ? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this .
wisdom is as good as an inheritance ; yea , more excellent is it for them that see the sun .
consider the work of god : for who can make that straight , which he hath made crooked ?
be not righteous overmuch ; neither make thyself overwise : why shouldest thou destroy thyself ?
be not overmuch wicked , neither be thou foolish : why shouldest thou die before thy time ?
wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers that are in a city .
surely there is not a righteous man upon earth , that doeth good , and sinneth not .
also take not heed unto all words that are spoken , lest thou hear thy servant curse thee ;
for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others .
all this have i proved in wisdom : i said , i will be wise ; but it was far from me .
that which is , is far off and exceeding deep ; who can find it out ?
behold , this have i found , saith the preacher , laying one thing to another , to find out the account ;
behold , this only have i found : that god made man upright ; but they have sought out many inventions .
i counsel thee , keep the king ’ s command , and that in regard of the oath of god .
be not hasty to go out of his presence ; persist not in an evil thing : for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him .
for the king ’ s word hath power ; and who may say unto him , what doest thou ?
whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing ; and a wise man ’ s heart discerneth time and judgment :
for to every purpose there is a time and judgment ; because the misery of man is great upon him :
for he knoweth not that which shall be ; for who can tell him how it shall be ?
because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil .
but it shall not be well with the wicked , neither shall he prolong his days , which are as a shadow ; because he feareth not before god .
for to him that is joined with all the living there is hope ; for a living dog is better than a dead lion .
go thy way , eat thy bread with joy , and drink thy wine with a merry heart ; for god hath already accepted thy works .
let thy garments be always white ; and let not thy head lack oil .
i have also seen wisdom under the sun on this wise , and it seemed great unto me :
now there was found in it a poor wise man , and he by his wisdom delivered the city ; yet no man remembered that same poor man .
then said i , wisdom is better than strength : nevertheless the poor man ’ s wisdom is despised , and his words are not heard .
the words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry of him that ruleth among fools .
wisdom is better than weapons of war ; but one sinner destroyeth much good .
dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor ; so doth a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor .
a wise man ’ s heart is at his right hand ; but a fool ’ s heart at his left .
yea also , when the fool walketh by the way , his understanding faileth him , and he saith to every one that he is a fool .
if the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee , leave not thy place ; for gentleness allayeth great offences .
there is an evil which i have seen under the sun , as it were an error which proceedeth from the ruler :
folly is set in great dignity , and the rich sit in a low place .
i have seen servants upon horses , and princes walking like servants upon the earth .
he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it ; and whoso breaketh through a wall , a serpent shall bite him .
whoso heweth out stones shall be hurt therewith ; and he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby .
if the iron be blunt , and one do not whet the edge , then must he put to more strength : but wisdom is profitable to direct .
if the serpent bite before it is charmed , then is there no advantage in the charmer .
the words of a wise man ’ s mouth are gracious ; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself .
the beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness ; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness .
a fool also multiplieth words : yet man knoweth not what shall be ; and that which shall be after him , who can tell him ?
the labor of fools wearieth every one of them ; for he knoweth not how to go to the city .
woe to thee , o land , when thy king is a child , and thy princes eat in the morning !
by slothfulness the roof sinketh in ; and through idleness of the hands the house leaketh .
a feast is made for laughter , and wine maketh glad the life ; and money answereth all things .
cast thy bread upon the waters ; for thou shalt find it after many days .
give a portion to seven , yea , even unto eight ; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth .
he that observeth the wind shall not sow ; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap .
truly the light is sweet , and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun .
therefore remove sorrow from thy heart , and put away evil from thy flesh ; for youth and the dawn of life are vanity .
before the sun , and the light , and the moon , and the stars , are darkened , and the clouds return after the rain ;
and the dust returneth to the earth as it was , and the spirit returneth unto god who gave it .
vanity of vanities , saith the preacher ; all is vanity .
the preacher sought to find out acceptable words , and that which was written uprightly , even words of truth .
the words of the wise are as goads ; and as nails well fastened are the words of the masters of assemblies , which are given from one shepherd .
and furthermore , my son , be admonished : of making many books there is no end ; and much study is a weariness of the flesh .
this is the end of the matter ; all hath been heard : fear god , and keep his commandments ; for this is the whole duty of man .
for god will bring every work into judgment , with every hidden thing , whether it be good , or whether it be evil .
paul , an apostle of christ jesus through the will of god , to the saints that are at ephesus , and the faithful in christ jesus :
grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ .
blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ , who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in christ :
even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love :
having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through jesus christ unto himself , according to the good pleasure of his will ,
to the praise of the glory of his grace , which he freely bestowed on us in the beloved :
in whom we have our redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of our trespasses , according to the riches of his grace ,
which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence ,
making known unto us the mystery of his will , according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him
in whom also we were made a heritage , having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will ;
to the end that we should be unto the praise of his glory , we who had before hoped in christ :
which is an earnest of our inheritance , unto the redemption of god ’ s own possession , unto the praise of his glory .
cease not to give thanks for you , making mention of you in my prayers ;
that the god of our lord jesus christ , the father of glory , may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him ;
and what the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe , according to that working of the strength of his might
which he wrought in christ , when he raised him from the dead , and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places ,
and he put all things in subjection under his feet , and gave him to be head over all things to the church ,
which is his body , the fulness of him that filleth all in all .
and you did he make alive , when ye were dead through your trespasses and sins ,
but god , being rich in mercy , for his great love wherewith he loved us ,
even when we were dead through our trespasses , made us alive together with christ ( by grace have ye been saved ) ,
and raised us up with him , and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places , in christ jesus :
that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in christ jesus :
for by grace have ye been saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves , it is the gift of god ;
not of works , that no man should glory .
for we are his workmanship , created in christ jesus for good works , which god afore prepared that we should walk in them .
but now in christ jesus ye that once were far off are made nigh in the blood of christ .
for he is our peace , who made both one , and brake down the middle wall of partition ,
and might reconcile them both in one body unto god through the cross , having slain the enmity thereby :
and he came and preached peace to you that were far off , and peace to them that were nigh :
for through him we both have our access in one spirit unto the father .
so then ye are no more strangers and sojourners , but ye are fellow-citizens with the saints , and of the household of god ,
being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , christ jesus himself being the chief corner stone ;
in whom each several building , fitly framed together , groweth into a holy temple in the lord ;
in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of god in the spirit .
for this cause i paul , the prisoner of christ jesus in behalf of you gentiles , —
if so be that ye have heard of the dispensation of that grace of god which was given me to you-ward ;
how that by revelation was made known unto me the mystery , as i wrote before in few words ,
whereby , when ye read , ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of christ ;
which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men , as it hath now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the spirit ;
to wit , that the gentiles are fellow-heirs , and fellow-members of the body , and fellow-partakers of the promise in christ jesus through the gospel ,
whereof i was made a minister , according to the gift of that grace of god which was given me according to the working of his power .
unto me , who am less than the least of all saints , was this grace given , to preach unto the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ ;
and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which for ages hath been hid in god who created all things ;
to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of god ,
according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord :
in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him .
wherefore i ask that ye may not faint at my tribulations for you , which are your glory .
for this cause i bow my knees unto the father ,
from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named ,
that he would grant you , according to the riches of his glory , that ye may be strengthened with power through his spirit in the inward man ;
that christ may dwell in your hearts through faith ; to the end that ye , being rooted and grounded in love ,
may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth ,
and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge , that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of god .
now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think , according to the power that worketh in us ,
unto him be the glory in the church and in christ jesus unto all generations for ever and ever . amen .
i therefore , the prisoner in the lord , beseech you to walk worthily of the calling wherewith ye were called ,
with all lowliness and meekness , with longsuffering , forbearing one another in love ;
giving diligence to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace .
there is one body , and one spirit , even as also ye were called in one hope of your calling ;
one lord , one faith , one baptism ,
one god and father of all , who is over all , and through all , and in all .
but unto each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of christ .
( now this , he ascended , what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth ?
he that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens , that he might fill all things . )
and he gave some to be apostles ; and some , prophets ; and some , evangelists ; and some , pastors and teachers ;
for the perfecting of the saints , unto the work of ministering , unto the building up of the body of christ :
but speaking truth in love , may grow up in all things into him , who is the head , even christ ;
this i say therefore , and testify in the lord , that ye no longer walk as the gentiles also walk , in the vanity of their mind ,
being darkened in their understanding , alienated from the life of god , because of the ignorance that is in them , because of the hardening of their heart ;
who being past feeling gave themselves up to lasciviousness , to work all uncleanness with greediness .
but ye did not so learn christ ;
if so be that ye heard him , and were taught in him , even as truth is in jesus :
that ye put away , as concerning your former manner of life , the old man , that waxeth corrupt after the lusts of deceit ;
and that ye be renewed in the spirit of your mind ,
and put on the new man , that after god hath been created in righteousness and holiness of truth .
wherefore , putting away falsehood , speak ye truth each one with his neighbor : for we are members one of another .
be ye angry , and sin not : let not the sun go down upon your wrath :
neither give place to the devil .
and grieve not the holy spirit of god , in whom ye were sealed unto the day of redemption .
let all bitterness , and wrath , and anger , and clamor , and railing , be put away from you , with all malice :
and be ye kind one to another , tenderhearted , forgiving each other , even as god also in christ forgave you .
be ye therefore imitators of god , as beloved children ;
but fornication , and all uncleanness , or covetousness , let it not even be named among you , as becometh saints ;
nor filthiness , nor foolish talking , or jesting , which are not befitting : but rather giving of thanks .
let no man deceive you with empty words : for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the sons of disobedience .
be not ye therefore partakers with them ;
for ye were once darkness , but are now light in the lord : walk as children of light
( for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth ) ,
proving what is well-pleasing unto the lord ;
and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather even reprove them ;
for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of .
but all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light : for everything that is made manifest is light .
wherefore he saith , awake , thou that sleepest , and arise from the dead , and christ shall shine upon thee .
look therefore carefully how ye walk , not as unwise , but as wise ;
redeeming the time , because the days are evil .
wherefore be ye not foolish , but understand what the will of the lord is .
and be not drunken with wine , wherein is riot , but be filled with the spirit ;
speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody with your heart to the lord ;
giving thanks always for all things in the name of our lord jesus christ to god , even the father ;
subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of christ .
wives , be in subjection unto your own husbands , as unto the lord .
for the husband is the head of the wife , as christ also is the head of the church , being himself the saviour of the body .
but as the church is subject to christ , so let the wives also be to their husbands in everything .
husbands , love your wives , even as christ also loved the church , and gave himself up for it ;
that he might sanctify it , having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word ,
even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies . he that loveth his own wife loveth himself :
for no man ever hated his own flesh ; but nourisheth and cherisheth it , even as christ also the church ;
because we are members of his body .
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife ; and the two shall become one flesh .
this mystery is great : but i speak in regard of christ and of the church .
nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself ; and let the wife see that she fear her husband .
children , obey your parents in the lord : for this is right .
honor thy father and mother ( which is the first commandment with promise ) ,
that it may be well with thee , and thou mayest live long on the earth .
and , ye fathers , provoke not your children to wrath : but nurture them in the chastening and admonition of the lord .
servants , be obedient unto them that according to the flesh are your masters , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as unto christ ;
not in the way of eyeservice , as men-pleasers ; but as servants of christ , doing the will of god from the heart ;
with good will doing service , as unto the lord , and not unto men :
knowing that whatsoever good thing each one doeth , the same shall he receive again from the lord , whether he be bond or free .
finally , be strong in the lord , and in the strength of his might .
put on the whole armor of god , that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil .
wherefore take up the whole armor of god , that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day , and , having done all , to stand .
stand therefore , having girded your loins with truth , and having put on the breastplate of righteousness ,
and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace ;
withal taking up the shield of faith , wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one .
and take the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the spirit , which is the word of god :
with all prayer and supplication praying at all seasons in the spirit , and watching thereunto in all perseverance and supplication for all the saints ,
and on my behalf , that utterance may be given unto me in opening my mouth , to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel ,
for which i am an ambassador in chains ; that in it i may speak boldly , as i ought to speak .
whom i have sent unto you for this very purpose , that ye may know our state , and that he may comfort your hearts .
peace be to the brethren , and love with faith , from god the father and the lord jesus christ .
grace be with all them that love our lord jesus christ with a love incorruptible .
that in those days , when the king ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in shushan the palace ,
when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days , even a hundred and fourscore days .
also vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king ahasuerus .
then the king said to the wise men , who knew the times ( for so was the king ’ s manner toward all that knew law and judgment ;
what shall we do unto the queen vashti according to law , because she hath not done the bidding of the king ahasuerus by the chamberlains ?
and the saying pleased the king and the princes ; and the king did according to the word of memucan :
after these things , when the wrath of king ahasuerus was pacified , he remembered vashti , and what she had done , and what was decreed against her .
then said the king ’ s servants that ministered unto him , let there be fair young virgins sought for the king :
and let the maiden that pleaseth the king be queen instead of vashti . and the thing pleased the king ; and he did so .
esther had not made known her people nor her kindred ; for mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known .
and mordecai walked every day before the court of the women ’ s house , to know how esther did , and what would become of her .
so esther was taken unto king ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month , which is the month tebeth , in the seventh year of his reign .
and when the virgins were gathered together the second time , then mordecai was sitting in the king ’ s gate .
and the thing became known to mordecai , who showed it unto esther the queen ; and esther told the king thereof in mordecai ’ s name .
then the king ’ s servants , that were in the king ’ s gate , said unto mordecai , why transgressest thou the king ’ s commandment ?
and when haman saw that mordecai bowed not down , nor did him reverence , then was haman full of wrath .
and the king took his ring from his hand , and gave it unto haman the son of hammedatha the agagite , the jews ’ enemy .
and the king said unto haman , the silver is given to thee , the people also , to do with them as it seemeth good to thee .
and he came even before the king ’ s gate : for none might enter within the king ’ s gate clothed with sackcloth .
so hathach went forth to mordecai unto the broad place of the city , which was before the king ’ s gate .
and hathach came and told esther the words of mordecai .
then esther spake unto hathach , and gave him a message unto mordecai , saying :
and they told to mordecai esther ’ s words .
then mordecai bade them return answer unto esther , think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king ’ s house , more than all the jews .
then esther bade them return answer unto mordecai ,
so mordecai went his way , and did according to all that esther had commanded him .
and esther said , if it seem good unto the king , let the king and haman come this day unto the banquet that i have prepared for him .
then answered esther , and said , my petition and my request is :
nevertheless haman refrained himself , and went home ; and he sent and fetched his friends and zeresh his wife .
yet all this availeth me nothing , so long as i see mordecai the jew sitting at the king ’ s gate .
on that night could not the king sleep ; and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles , and they were read before the king .
and the king ’ s servants said unto him , behold , haman standeth in the court . and the king said , let him come in .
and haman said unto the king , for the man whom the king delighteth to honor ,
and mordecai came again to the king ’ s gate . but haman hasted to his house , mourning and having his head covered .
while they were yet talking with him , came the king ’ s chamberlains , and hasted to bring haman unto the banquet that esther had prepared .
so the king and haman came to banquet with esther the queen .
and esther said , an adversary and an enemy , even this wicked haman . then haman was afraid before the king and the queen .
so they hanged haman on the gallows that he had prepared for mordecai . then was the king ’ s wrath pacified .
then the king held out to esther the golden sceptre . so esther arose , and stood before the king .
for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people ? or how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred ?
upon one day in all the provinces of king ahasuerus , namely , upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which is the month adar .
the jews had light and gladness , and joy and honor .
for mordecai was great in the king ’ s house , and his fame went forth throughout all the provinces ; for the man mordecai waxed greater and greater .
and in shushan the palace the jews slew and destroyed five hundred men .
and parshandatha , and dalphon , and aspatha ,
and poratha , and adalia , and aridatha ,
and parmashta , and arisai , and aridai , and vaizatha ,
the ten sons of haman the son of hammedatha , the jews ’ enemy , slew they ; but on the spoil they laid not their hand .
on that day the number of those that were slain in shushan the palace was brought before the king .
and the king commanded it so to be done : and a decree was given out in shushan ; and they hanged haman ’ s ten sons .
and mordecai wrote these things , and sent letters unto all the jews that were in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus , both nigh and far ,
to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month adar , and the fifteenth day of the same , yearly ,
and the jews undertook to do as they had begun , and as mordecai had written unto them ;
then esther the queen , the daughter of abihail , and mordecai the jew , wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of purim .
and he sent letters unto all the jews , to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of ahasuerus , with words of peace and truth ,
and the commandment of esther confirmed these matters of purim ; and it was written in the book .
and the king ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land , and upon the isles of the sea .
now these are the names of the sons of israel , who came into egypt ( every man and his household came with jacob ) :
reuben , simeon , levi , and judah ,
issachar , zebulun , and benjamin ,
dan and naphtali , gad and asher .
and all the souls that came out of the loins of jacob were seventy souls : and joseph was in egypt already .
and joseph died , and all his brethren , and all that generation .
and the children of israel were fruitful , and increased abundantly , and multiplied , and waxed exceeding mighty ; and the land was filled with them .
now there arose a new king over egypt , who knew not joseph .
and he said unto his people , behold , the people of the children of israel are more and mightier than we :
therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens . and they built for pharaoh store-cities , pithom and raamses .
but the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad . and they were grieved because of the children of israel .
and the egyptians made the children of israel to serve with rigor :
and the king of egypt spake to the hebrew midwives , of whom the name of the one was shiphrah , and the name of the other puah :
but the midwives feared god , and did not as the king of egypt commanded them , but saved the men-children alive .
and the king of egypt called for the midwives , and said unto them , why have ye done this thing , and have saved the men-children alive ?
and god dealt well with the midwives : and the people multiplied , and waxed very mighty .
and it came to pass , because the midwives feared god , that he made them households .
and pharaoh charged all his people , saying , every son that is born ye shall cast into the river , and every daughter ye shall save alive .
and there went a man of the house of levi , and took to wife a daughter of levi .
and the woman conceived , and bare a son : and when she saw him that he was a goodly child , she hid him three months .
and his sister stood afar off , to know what would be done to him .
and pharaoh ’ s daughter said to her , go . and the maiden went and called the child ’ s mother .
now the priest of midian had seven daughters : and they came and drew water , and filled the troughs to water their father ’ s flock .
and the shepherds came and drove them away ; but moses stood up and helped them , and watered their flock .
and when they came to reuel their father , he said , how is it that ye are come so soon to-day ?
and they said , an egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds , and moreover he drew water for us , and watered the flock .
and moses was content to dwell with the man : and he gave moses zipporah his daughter .
and she bare a son , and he called his name gershom ; for he said , i have been a sojourner in a foreign land .
and god heard their groaning , and god remembered his covenant with abraham , with isaac , and with jacob .
and god saw the children of israel , and god took knowledge of them .
and moses said , i will turn aside now , and see this great sight , why the bush is not burnt .
and he said , draw not nigh hither : put off thy shoes from off thy feet , for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground .
and now , behold , the cry of the children of israel is come unto me : moreover i have seen the oppression wherewith the egyptians oppress them .
come now therefore , and i will send thee unto pharaoh , that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt .
and i know that the king of egypt will not give you leave to go , no , not by a mighty hand .
and jehovah said unto him , what is that in thy hand ? and he said , a rod .
now therefore go , and i will be with thy mouth , and teach thee what thou shalt speak .
and he said , oh , lord , send , i pray thee , by the hand of him whom thou wilt send .
and thou shalt take in thy hand this rod , wherewith thou shalt do the signs .
and jehovah said unto moses in midian , go , return into egypt ; for all the men are dead that sought thy life .
and thou shalt say unto pharaoh , thus saith jehovah , israel is my son , my first-born :
and it came to pass on the way at the lodging-place , that jehovah met him , and sought to kill him .
so he let him alone . then she said , a bridegroom of blood art thou , because of the circumcision .
and moses told aaron all the words of jehovah wherewith he had sent him , and all the signs wherewith he had charged him .
and moses and aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of israel :
and aaron spake all the words which jehovah had spoken unto moses , and did the signs in the sight of the people .
and the king of egypt said unto them , wherefore do ye , moses and aaron , loose the people from their works ? get you unto your burdens .
and pharaoh said , behold , the people of the land are now many , and ye make them rest from their burdens .
and the same day pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people , and their officers , saying ,
ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick , as heretofore : let them go and gather straw for themselves .
let heavier work be laid upon the men , that they may labor therein ; and let them not regard lying words .
go yourselves , get you straw where ye can find it ; for nought of your work shall be diminished .
so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of egypt to gather stubble for straw .
and the taskmasters were urgent , saying , fulfil your works , your daily tasks , as when there was straw .
then the officers of the children of israel came and cried unto pharaoh , saying , wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants ?
but he said , ye are idle , ye are idle : therefore ye say , let us go and sacrifice to jehovah .
go therefore now , and work ; for there shall no straw be given you , yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks .
and they met moses and aaron , who stood in the way , as they came forth from pharaoh :
and moses returned unto jehovah , and said , lord , wherefore hast thou dealt ill with this people ? why is it that thou hast sent me ?
for since i came to pharaoh to speak in thy name , he hath dealt ill with this people ; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all .
and god spake unto moses , and said unto him , i am jehovah :
and i appeared unto abraham , unto isaac , and unto jacob , as god almighty ; but by my name jehovah i was not known to them .
and i have also established my covenant with them , to give them the land of canaan , the land of their sojournings , wherein they sojourned .
and moreover i have heard the groaning of the children of israel , whom the egyptians keep in bondage ; and i have remembered my covenant .
and moses spake so unto the children of israel : but they hearkened not unto moses for anguish of spirit , and for cruel bondage .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
go in , speak unto pharaoh king of egypt , that he let the children of israel go out of his land .
the sons of gershon : libni and shimei , according to their families .
and the sons of merari : mahli and mushi . these are the families of the levites according to their generations .
and the sons of izhar : korah , and nepheg , and zichri .
and the sons of uzziel : mishael , and elzaphan , and sithri .
and the sons of korah : assir , and elkanah , and abiasaph ; these are the families of the korahites .
these are that aaron and moses , to whom jehovah said , bring out the children of israel from the land of egypt according to their hosts .
these are they that spake to pharaoh king of egypt , to bring out the children of israel from egypt : these are that moses and aaron .
and it came to pass on the day when jehovah spake unto moses in the land of egypt ,
that jehovah spake unto moses , saying , i am jehovah : speak thou unto pharaoh king of egypt all that i speak unto thee .
and moses said before jehovah , behold , i am of uncircumcised lips , and how shall pharaoh hearken unto me ?
and jehovah said unto moses , see , i have made thee as god to pharaoh ; and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet .
and i will harden pharaoh ’ s heart , and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of egypt .
and the egyptians shall know that i am jehovah , when i stretch forth my hand upon egypt , and bring out the children of israel from among them .
and moses and aaron did so ; as jehovah commanded them , so did they .
and moses was fourscore years old , and aaron fourscore and three years old , when they spake unto pharaoh .
and jehovah spake unto moses and unto aaron , saying ,
then pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers : and they also , the magicians of egypt , did in like manner with their enchantments .
for they cast down every man his rod , and they became serpents : but aaron ’ s rod swallowed up their rods .
and pharaoh ’ s heart was hardened , and he hearkened not unto them ; as jehovah had spoken .
and jehovah said unto moses , pharaoh ’ s heart is stubborn , he refuseth to let the people go .
and the fish that are in the river shall die , and the river shall become foul ; and the egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river .
and pharaoh turned and went into his house , neither did he lay even this to heart .
and all the egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink ; for they could not drink of the water of the river .
and seven days were fulfilled , after that jehovah had smitten the river .
and if thou refuse to let them go , behold , i will smite all thy borders with frogs :
and the frogs shall come up both upon thee , and upon thy people , and upon all thy servants .
and aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of egypt ; and the frogs came up , and covered the land of egypt .
and the magicians did in like manner with their enchantments , and brought up frogs upon the land of egypt .
and moses and aaron went out from pharaoh : and moses cried unto jehovah concerning the frogs which he had brought upon pharaoh .
and jehovah did according to the word of moses ; and the frogs died out of the houses , out of the courts , and out of the fields .
and they gathered them together in heaps ; and the land stank .
but when pharaoh saw that there was respite , he hardened his heart , and hearkened not unto them ; as jehovah had spoken .
and the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice , but they could not : and there were lice upon man , and upon beast .
and i will put a division between my people and thy people : by to-morrow shall this sign be .
and pharaoh called for moses and for aaron , and said , go ye , sacrifice to your god in the land .
we will go three days ’ journey into the wilderness , and sacrifice to jehovah our god , as he shall command us .
and moses went out from pharaoh , and entreated jehovah .
and pharaoh hardened his heart this time also , and he did not let the people go .
for if thou refuse to let them go , and wilt hold them still ,
and jehovah appointed a set time , saying , to-morrow jehovah shall do this thing in the land .
and jehovah did that thing on the morrow ; and all the cattle of egypt died ; but of the cattle of the children of israel died not one .
and the magicians could not stand before moses because of the boils ; for the boils were upon the magicians , and upon all the egyptians .
and jehovah hardened the heart of pharaoh , and he hearkened not unto them ; as jehovah had spoken unto moses .
for now i had put forth my hand , and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence , and thou hadst been cut off from the earth :
as yet exaltest thou thyself against my people , that thou wilt not let them go ?
he that feared the word of jehovah among the servants of pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses :
and he that regarded not the word of jehovah left his servants and his cattle in the field .
only in the land of goshen , where the children of israel were , was there no hail .
entreat jehovah ; for there hath been enough of these mighty thunderings and hail ; and i will let you go , and ye shall stay no longer .
but as for thee and thy servants , i know that ye will not yet fear jehovah god .
and the flax and the barley were smitten : for the barley was in the ear , and the flax was in bloom .
but the wheat and the spelt were not smitten : for they were not grown up .
and the heart of pharaoh was hardened , and he did not let the children of israel go ; as jehovah had spoken by moses .
else , if thou refuse to let my people go , behold , to-morrow will i bring locusts into thy border :
then pharaoh called for moses and aaron in haste ; and he said , i have sinned against jehovah your god , and against you .
and he went out from pharaoh , and entreated jehovah .
but jehovah hardened pharaoh ’ s heart , and he did not let the children of israel go .
and moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven ; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of egypt three days ;
they saw not one another , neither rose any one from his place for three days : but all the children of israel had light in their dwellings .
and moses said , thou must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt-offerings , that we may sacrifice unto jehovah our god .
but jehovah hardened pharaoh ’ s heart , and he would not let them go .
and moses said , thou hast spoken well ; i will see thy face again no more .
and moses said , thus saith jehovah , about midnight will i go out into the midst of egypt :
and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of egypt , such as there hath not been , nor shall be any more .
and jehovah said unto moses , pharaoh will not hearken unto you ; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of egypt .
and jehovah spake unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt , saying ,
this month shall be unto you the beginning of months : it shall be the first month of the year to you .
your lamb shall be without blemish , a male a year old : ye shall take it from the sheep , or from the goats :
and ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month ; and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it at even .
and they shall take of the blood , and put it on the two side-posts and on the lintel , upon the houses wherein they shall eat it .
and they shall eat the flesh in that night , roast with fire , and unleavened bread ; with bitter herbs they shall eat it .
eat not of it raw , nor boiled at all with water , but roast with fire ; its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof .
and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning ; but that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire .
ye shall eat nothing leavened ; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread .
and ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever .
and it shall come to pass , when your children shall say unto you , what mean ye by this service ?
and the children of israel went and did so ; as jehovah had commanded moses and aaron , so did they .
take both your flocks and your herds , as ye have said , and be gone ; and bless me also .
and the egyptians were urgent upon the people , to send them out of the land in haste ; for they said , we are all dead men .
and the people took their dough before it was leavened , their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders .
and jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the egyptians , so that they let them have what they asked . and they despoiled the egyptians .
and the children of israel journeyed from rameses to succoth , about six hundred thousand on foot that were men , besides children .
and a mixed multitude went up also with them ; and flocks , and herds , even very much cattle .
now the time that the children of israel dwelt in egypt was four hundred and thirty years .
and jehovah said unto moses and aaron , this is the ordinance of the passover : there shall no foreigner eat thereof ;
but every man ’ s servant that is bought for money , when thou hast circumcised him , then shall he eat thereof .
a sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof .
all the congregation of israel shall keep it .
one law shall be to him that is home-born , and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you .
thus did all the children of israel ; as jehovah commanded moses and aaron , so did they .
and it came to pass the selfsame day , that jehovah did bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt by their hosts .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
sanctify unto me all the first-born , whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of israel , both of man and of beast : it is mine .
this day ye go forth in the month abib .
seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread , and in the seventh day shall be a feast to jehovah .
and thou shalt tell thy son in that day , saying , it is because of that which jehovah did for me when i came forth out of egypt .
thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year .
and they took their journey from succoth , and encamped in etham , in the edge of the wilderness .
the pillar of cloud by day , and the pillar of fire by night , departed not from before the people .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and pharaoh will say of the children of israel , they are entangled in the land , the wilderness hath shut them in .
and he made ready his chariot , and took his people with him :
and he took six hundred chosen chariots , and all the chariots of egypt , and captains over all of them .
jehovah will fight for you , and ye shall hold your peace .
and jehovah said unto moses , wherefore criest thou unto me ? speak unto the children of israel , that they go forward .
and the egyptians shall know that i am jehovah , when i have gotten me honor upon pharaoh , upon his chariots , and upon his horsemen .
and the egyptians pursued , and went in after them into the midst of the sea , all pharaoh ’ s horses , his chariots , and his horsemen .
thus jehovah saved israel that day out of the hand of the egyptians ; and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the sea-shore .
then sang moses and the children of israel this song unto jehovah , and spake , saying ,
jehovah is my strength and song ,
jehovah is a man of war :
pharaoh ’ s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea ;
the deeps cover them :
thy right hand , o jehovah , is glorious in power ,
and in the greatness of thine excellency thou overthrowest them that rise up against thee : thou sendest forth thy wrath , it consumeth them as stubble .
and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were piled up ,
the enemy said , i will pursue , i will overtake , i will divide the spoil ;
thou didst blow with thy wind , the sea covered them :
who is like unto thee , o jehovah , among the gods ?
thou stretchedst out thy right hand ,
thou in thy lovingkindness hast led the people that thou hast redeemed :
the peoples have heard , they tremble :
then were the chiefs of edom dismayed ;
terror and dread falleth upon them ;
thou wilt bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance ,
jehovah shall reign for ever and ever .
and miriam answered them ,
and the people murmured against moses , saying , what shall we drink ?
and they came to elim , where were twelve springs of water , and threescore and ten palm-trees : and they encamped there by the waters .
and the whole congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron in the wilderness :
and moses said unto aaron , say unto all the congregation of the children of israel , come near before jehovah ; for he hath heard your murmurings .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and the children of israel did so , and gathered some more , some less .
and moses said unto them , let no man leave of it till the morning .
and they gathered it morning by morning , every man according to his eating : and when the sun waxed hot , it melted .
and they laid it up till the morning , as moses bade : and it did not become foul , neither was there any worm therein .
and moses said , eat that to-day ; for to-day is a sabbath unto jehovah : to-day ye shall not find it in the field .
six days ye shall gather it ; but on the seventh day is the sabbath , in it there shall be none .
and it came to pass on the seventh day , that there went out some of the people to gather , and they found none .
and jehovah said unto moses , how long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws ?
so the people rested on the seventh day .
as jehovah commanded moses , so aaron laid it up before the testimony , to be kept .
now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah .
and moses cried unto jehovah , saying , what shall i do unto this people ? they are almost ready to stone me .
then came amalek , and fought with israel in rephidim .
and it came to pass , when moses held up his hand , that israel prevailed ; and when he let down his hand , amalek prevailed .
and joshua discomfited amalek and his people with the edge of the sword .
and moses built an altar , and called the name of it jehovah-nissi ;
and he said , jehovah hath sworn : jehovah will have war with amalek from generation to generation .
and jethro , moses ’ father-in-law , took zipporah , moses ’ wife , after he had sent her away ,
and her two sons ; of whom the name of the one was gershom ; for he said , i have been a sojourner in a foreign land :
and jethro , moses ’ father-in-law , came with his sons and his wife unto moses into the wilderness where he was encamped , at the mount of god :
and he said unto moses , i , thy father-in-law jethro , am come unto thee , and thy wife , and her two sons with her .
and jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which jehovah had done to israel , in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the egyptians .
now i know that jehovah is greater than all gods ; yea , in the thing wherein they dealt proudly against them .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that moses sat to judge the people : and the people stood about moses from the morning unto the evening .
and moses said unto his father-in-law , because the people come unto me to inquire of god :
and moses ’ father-in-law said unto him , the thing that thou doest is not good .
and thou shalt teach them the statutes and the laws , and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk , and the work that they must do .
so moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law , and did all that he had said .
and they judged the people at all seasons : the hard causes they brought unto moses , but every small matter they judged themselves .
and moses let his father-in-law depart ; and he went his way into his own land .
in the third month after the children of israel were gone forth out of the land of egypt , the same day came they into the wilderness of sinai .
ye have seen what i did unto the egyptians , and how i bare you on eagles ’ wings , and brought you unto myself .
and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests , and a holy nation . these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel .
and moses came and called for the elders of the people , and set before them all these words which jehovah commanded him .
and all the people answered together , and said , all that jehovah hath spoken we will do . and moses reported the words of the people unto jehovah .
and jehovah said unto moses , go unto the people , and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow , and let them wash their garments ,
and be ready against the third day ; for the third day jehovah will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount sinai .
and moses went down from the mount unto the people , and sanctified the people ; and they washed their garments .
and he said unto the people , be ready against the third day : come not near a woman .
and moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet god ; and they stood at the nether part of the mount .
and when the voice of the trumpet waxed louder and louder , moses spake , and god answered him by a voice .
and jehovah said unto moses , go down , charge the people , lest they break through unto jehovah to gaze , and many of them perish .
and let the priests also , that come near to jehovah , sanctify themselves , lest jehovah break forth upon them .
so moses went down unto the people , and told them .
and god spake all these words , saying ,
i am jehovah thy god , who brought thee out of the land of egypt , out of the house of bondage .
thou shalt have no other gods before me .
and showing lovingkindness unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments .
thou shalt not take the name of jehovah thy god in vain ; for jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain .
remember the sabbath day , to keep it holy .
six days shalt thou labor , and do all thy work ;
honor thy father and thy mother , that thy days may be long in the land which jehovah thy god giveth thee .
thou shalt not kill .
thou shalt not commit adultery .
thou shalt not steal .
thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor .
and they said unto moses , speak thou with us , and we will hear ; but let not god speak with us , lest we die .
and the people stood afar off , and moses drew near unto the thick darkness where god was .
and jehovah said unto moses , thus thou shalt say unto the children of israel , ye yourselves have seen that i have talked with you from heaven .
ye shall not make other gods with me ; gods of silver , or gods of gold , ye shall not make unto you .
neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar , that thy nakedness be not uncovered thereon .
now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them .
if thou buy a hebrew servant , six years he shall serve : and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing .
if he come in by himself , he shall go out by himself : if he be married , then his wife shall go out with him .
but if the servant shall plainly say , i love my master , my wife , and my children ; i will not go out free :
and if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant , she shall not go out as the men-servants do .
and if he espouse her unto his son , he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters .
if he take him another wife ; her food , her raiment , and her duty of marriage , shall he not diminish .
and if he do not these three things unto her , then shall she go out for nothing , without money .
he that smiteth a man , so that he dieth , shall surely be put to death .
and if a man lie not in wait , but god deliver him into his hand ; then i will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee .
and if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor , to slay him with guile ; thou shalt take him from mine altar , that he may die .
and he that smiteth his father , or his mother , shall be surely put to death .
and he that stealeth a man , and selleth him , or if he be found in his hand , he shall surely be put to death .
and he that curseth his father or his mother , shall surely be put to death .
and if men contend , and one smite the other with a stone , or with his fist , and he die not , but keep his bed ;
and if a man smite his servant , or his maid , with a rod , and he die under his hand ; he shall surely be punished .
notwithstanding , if he continue a day or two , he shall not be punished : for he is his money .
but if any harm follow , then thou shalt give life for life ,
eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot ,
burning for burning , wound for wound , stripe for stripe .
if there be laid on him a ransom , then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him .
whether it have gored a son , or have gored a daughter , according to this judgment shall it be done unto him .
if the ox gore a man-servant or a maid-servant , there shall be given unto their master thirty shekels of silver , and the ox shall be stoned .
the owner of the pit shall make it good ; he shall give money unto the owner thereof , and the dead beast shall be his .
if the thief be found breaking in , and be smitten so that he dieth , there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him .
if the theft be found in his hand alive , whether it be ox , or ass , or sheep ; he shall pay double .
but if it be stolen from him , he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof .
if it be torn in pieces , let him bring it for witness ; he shall not make good that which was torn .
if the owner thereof be with it , he shall not make it good : if it be a hired thing , it came for its hire .
and if a man entice a virgin that is not betrothed , and lie with her , he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife .
if her father utterly refuse to give her unto him , he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins .
thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live .
whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death .
he that sacrificeth unto any god , save unto jehovah only , shall be utterly destroyed .
and a sojourner shalt thou not wrong , neither shalt thou oppress him : for ye were sojourners in the land of egypt .
ye shall not afflict any widow , or fatherless child .
if thou afflict them at all , and they cry at all unto me , i will surely hear their cry ;
and my wrath shall wax hot , and i will kill you with the sword ; and your wives shall be widows , and your children fatherless .
if thou at all take thy neighbor ’ s garment to pledge , thou shalt restore it unto him before the sun goeth down :
thou shalt not revile god , nor curse a ruler of thy people .
thou shalt not delay to offer of thy harvest , and of the outflow of thy presses . the first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto me .
thou shalt not take up a false report : put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness .
thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil ; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to turn aside after a multitude to wrest justice :
neither shalt thou favor a poor man in his cause .
if thou meet thine enemy ’ s ox or his ass going astray , thou shalt surely bring it back to him again .
if thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden , thou shalt forbear to leave him , thou shalt surely release it with him .
thou shalt not wrest the justice due to thy poor in his cause .
keep thee far from a false matter ; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not : for i will not justify the wicked .
and thou shalt take no bribe : for a bribe blindeth them that have sight , and perverteth the words of the righteous .
and a sojourner shalt thou not oppress : for ye know the heart of a sojourner , seeing ye were sojourners in the land of egypt .
and six years thou shalt sow thy land , and shalt gather in the increase thereof :
three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year .
three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the lord jehovah .
thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread ; neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning .
behold , i send an angel before thee , to keep thee by the way , and to bring thee into the place which i have prepared .
there shall none cast her young , nor be barren , in thy land : the number of thy days i will fulfil .
and i will send the hornet before thee , which shall drive out the hivite , the canaanite , and the hittite , from before thee .
i will not drive them out from before thee in one year , lest the land become desolate , and the beasts of the field multiply against thee .
by little and little i will drive them out from before thee , until thou be increased , and inherit the land .
thou shalt make no covenant with them , nor with their gods .
and moses alone shall come near unto jehovah ; but they shall not come near ; neither shall the people go up with him .
and he sent young men of the children of israel , who offered burnt-offerings , and sacrificed peace-offerings of oxen unto jehovah .
and moses took half of the blood , and put it in basins ; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar .
then went up moses , and aaron , nadab , and abihu , and seventy of the elders of israel :
and upon the nobles of the children of israel he laid not his hand : and they beheld god , and did eat and drink .
and moses rose up , and joshua his minister : and moses went up into the mount of god .
and moses went up into the mount , and the cloud covered the mount .
and the appearance of the glory of jehovah was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of israel .
and moses entered into the midst of the cloud , and went up into the mount : and moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
speak unto the children of israel , that they take for me an offering : of every man whose heart maketh him willing ye shall take my offering .

now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar : two lambs a year old day by day continually .

ye shall offer no strange incense thereon , nor burnt-offering , nor meal-offering ; and ye shall pour no drink-offering thereon .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered , from twenty years old and upward , shall give the offering of jehovah .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat :
moreover jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and of cassia five hundred , after the shekel of the sanctuary , and of olive oil a hin ;
and thou shalt make it a holy anointing oil , a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer : it shall be a holy anointing oil .
and thou shalt anoint therewith the tent of meeting , and the ark of the testimony ,
and the table and all the vessels thereof , and the candlestick and the vessels thereof , and the altar of incense ,
and the altar of burnt-offering with all the vessels thereof , and the laver and the base thereof .
and thou shalt sanctify them , that they may be most holy : whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy .
and thou shalt anoint aaron and his sons , and sanctify them , that they may minister unto me in the priest ’ s office .
and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel , saying , this shall be a holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations .
whosoever compoundeth any like it , or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger , he shall be cut off from his people .
and thou shalt make of it incense , a perfume after the art of the perfumer , seasoned with salt , pure and holy :
and the incense which thou shalt make , according to the composition thereof ye shall not make for yourselves : it shall be unto thee holy for jehovah .
whosoever shall make like unto that , to smell thereof , he shall be cut off from his people .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
see , i have called by name bezalel the son of uri , the son of hur , of the tribe of judah :
and i have filled him with the spirit of god , in wisdom , and in understanding , and in knowledge , and in all manner of workmanship ,
to devise skilful works , to work in gold , and in silver , and in brass ,
and in cutting of stones for setting , and in carving of wood , to work in all manner of workmanship .
the tent of meeting , and the ark of the testimony , and the mercy-seat that is thereupon , and all the furniture of the tent ,
and the table and its vessels , and the pure candlestick with all its vessels , and the altar of incense ,
and the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels , and the laver and its base ,
and the anointing oil , and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place : according to all that i have commanded thee shall they do .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
wherefore the children of israel shall keep the sabbath , to observe the sabbath throughout their generations , for a perpetual covenant .
and all the people brake off the golden rings which were in their ears , and brought them unto aaron .
and when aaron saw this , he built an altar before it ; and aaron made proclamation , and said , to-morrow shall be a feast to jehovah .
and jehovah said unto moses , i have seen this people , and , behold , it is a stiffnecked people :
and jehovah repented of the evil which he said he would do unto his people .
and the tables were the work of god , and the writing was the writing of god , graven upon the tables .
and when joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted , he said unto moses , there is a noise of war in the camp .
and moses said unto aaron , what did this people unto thee , that thou hast brought a great sin upon them ?
and aaron said , let not the anger of my lord wax hot : thou knowest the people , that they are set on evil .
and when moses saw that the people were broken loose ( for aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies ) ,
and the sons of levi did according to the word of moses : and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men .
and moses returned unto jehovah , and said , oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold .
yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin— ; and if not , blot me , i pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written .
and jehovah said unto moses , whosoever hath sinned against me , him will i blot out of my book .
and jehovah smote the people , because they made the calf , which aaron made .
and when the people heard these evil tidings , they mourned : and no man did put on him his ornaments .
and the children of israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount horeb onward .
and he said , my presence shall go with thee , and i will give thee rest .
and he said unto him , if thy presence go not with me , carry us not up hence .
and he said , show me , i pray thee , thy glory .
and he said , thou canst not see my face ; for man shall not see me and live .
and jehovah said , behold , there is a place by me , and thou shalt stand upon the rock :
and i will take away my hand , and thou shalt see my back ; but my face shall not be seen .
and be ready by the morning , and come up in the morning unto mount sinai , and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount .
and jehovah descended in the cloud , and stood with him there , and proclaimed the name of jehovah .
and moses made haste , and bowed his head toward the earth , and worshipped .
but ye shall break down their altars , and dash in pieces their pillars , and ye shall cut down their asherim
( for thou shalt worship no other god : for jehovah , whose name is jealous , is a jealous god ) ;
thou shalt make thee no molten gods .
all that openeth the womb is mine ; and all thy cattle that is male , the firstlings of cow and sheep .
six days thou shalt work , but on the seventh day thou shalt rest : in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest .
and thou shalt observe the feast of weeks , even of the first-fruits of wheat harvest , and the feast of ingathering at the year ’ s end .
three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the lord jehovah , the god of israel .
thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread ; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning .
and jehovah said unto moses , write thou these words : for after the tenor of these words i have made a covenant with thee and with israel .
and when aaron and all the children of israel saw moses , behold , the skin of his face shone ; and they were afraid to come nigh him .
and moses called unto them ; and aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him : and moses spake to them .
and afterward all the children of israel came nigh : and he gave them in commandment all that jehovah had spoken with him in mount sinai .
and when moses had done speaking with them , he put a veil on his face .
ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day .
and moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of israel , saying , this is the thing which jehovah commanded , saying ,
and blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine linen , and goats ’ hair ,
and rams ’ skins dyed red , and sealskins , and acacia wood ,
and oil for the light , and spices for the anointing oil , and for the sweet incense ,
and onyx stones , and stones to be set , for the ephod , and for the breastplate .
and let every wise-hearted man among you come , and make all that jehovah hath commanded :
the tabernacle , its tent , and its covering , its clasps , and its boards , its bars , its pillars , and its sockets ;
the ark , and the staves thereof , the mercy-seat , and the veil of the screen ;

and all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats ’ hair .
and the rulers brought the onyx stones , and the stones to be set , for the ephod , and for the breastplate ;
and the spice , and the oil ; for the light , and for the anointing oil , and for the sweet incense .
and he hath filled him with the spirit of god , in wisdom , in understanding , and in knowledge , and in all manner of workmanship ;
and to devise skilful works , to work in gold , and in silver , and in brass ,
and in cutting of stones for setting , and in carving of wood , to work in all manner of skilful workmanship .
and he hath put in his heart that he may teach , both he , and oholiab , the son of ahisamach , of the tribe of dan .
and all the wise men , that wrought all the work of the sanctuary , came every man from his work which they wrought ;
and they spake unto moses , saying , the people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which jehovah commanded to make .
for the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it , and too much .

according to all that jehovah commanded moses , so the children of israel did all the work .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
on the first day of the first month shalt thou rear up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting .
and thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony , and thou shalt screen the ark with the veil .
and thou shalt set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony , and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle .
and thou shalt set the altar of burnt-offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting .
and thou shalt set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar , and shalt put water therein .
and thou shalt set up the court round about , and hang up the screen of the gate of the court .
and thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt-offering , and all its vessels , and sanctify the altar : and the altar shall be most holy .
and thou shalt anoint the laver and its base , and sanctify it .
and thou shalt bring aaron and his sons unto the door of the tent of meeting , and shalt wash them with water .
and thou shalt bring his sons , and put coats upon them ;
thus did moses : according to all that jehovah commanded him , so did he .
and it came to pass in the first month in the second year , on the first day of the month , that the tabernacle was reared up .
and he spread the tent over the tabernacle , and put the covering of the tent above upon it ; as jehovah commanded moses .
and he took and put the testimony into the ark , and set the staves on the ark , and put the mercy-seat above upon the ark :
and he put the table in the tent of meeting , upon the side of the tabernacle northward , without the veil .
and he set the bread in order upon it before jehovah ; as jehovah commanded moses .
and he put the candlestick in the tent of meeting , over against the table , on the side of the tabernacle southward .

and moses and aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat ;
when they went into the tent of meeting , and when they came near unto the altar , they washed ; as jehovah commanded moses .
then the cloud covered the tent of meeting , and the glory of jehovah filled the tabernacle .
and moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting , because the cloud abode thereon , and the glory of jehovah filled the tabernacle .
and when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle , the children of israel went onward , throughout all their journeys :
but if the cloud was not taken up , then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up .
in the fifth day of the month , which was the fifth year of king jehoiachin ’ s captivity ,
and out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures . and this was their appearance : they had the likeness of a man ;
and every one had four faces , and every one of them had four wings .
and they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides ; and they four had their faces and their wings thus :
their wings were joined one to another ; they turned not when they went ; they went every one straight forward .
and their faces and their wings were separate above ; two wings of every one were joined one to another , and two covered their bodies .
and they went every one straight forward : whither the spirit was to go , they went ; they turned not when they went .
and the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning .
now as i beheld the living creatures , behold , one wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures , for each of the four faces thereof .
when they went , they went in their four directions : they turned not when they went .
as for their rims , they were high and dreadful ; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about .
and there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads : when they stood , they let down their wings .
and he said unto me , son of man , stand upon thy feet , and i will speak with thee .
and the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me , and set me upon my feet ; and i heard him that spake unto me .
and the children are impudent and stiffhearted : i do send thee unto them ; and thou shalt say unto them , thus saith the lord jehovah .
and thou shalt speak my words unto them , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear ; for they are most rebellious .
and when i looked , behold , a hand was put forth unto me ; and , lo , a roll of a book was therein ;
and he spread it before me : and it was written within and without ; and there were written therein lamentations , and mourning , and woe .
and he said unto me , son of man , eat that which thou findest ; eat this roll , and go , speak unto the house of israel .
so i opened my mouth , and he caused me to eat the roll .
and he said unto me , son of man , go , get thee unto the house of israel , and speak with my words unto them .
for thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language , but to the house of israel ;
behold , i have made thy face hard against their faces , and thy forehead hard against their foreheads .
as an adamant harder than flint have i made thy forehead : fear them not , neither be dismayed at their looks , though they are a rebellious house .
moreover he said unto me , son of man , all my words that i shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart , and hear with thine ears .
and it came to pass at the end of seven days , that the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
thou also , son of man , take thee a tile , and lay it before thee , and portray upon it a city , even jerusalem :
and thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of jerusalem , with thine arm uncovered ; and thou shalt prophesy against it .
and thy food which thou shalt eat shall be by weight , twenty shekels a day : from time to time shalt thou eat it .
and thou shalt drink water by measure , the sixth part of a hin : from time to time shalt thou drink .
and thou shalt eat it as barley cakes , and thou shalt bake it in their sight with dung that cometh out of man .
and jehovah said , even thus shall the children of israel eat their bread unclean , among the nations whither i will drive them .
then he said unto me , see , i have given thee cow ’ s dung for man ’ s dung , and thou shalt prepare thy bread thereon .
that they may want bread and water , and be dismayed one with another , and pine away in their iniquity .
and thou shalt take thereof a few in number , and bind them in thy skirts .
thus saith the lord jehovah : this is jerusalem ; i have set her in the midst of the nations , and countries are round about her .
and i will do in thee that which i have not done , and whereunto i will not do any more the like , because of all thine abominations .
moreover i will make thee a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee , in the sight of all that pass by .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , set thy face toward the mountains of israel , and prophesy unto them ,
and your altars shall become desolate , and your sun-images shall be broken ; and i will cast down your slain men before your idols .
and i will lay the dead bodies of the children of israel before their idols ; and i will scatter your bones round about your altars .
and the slain shall fall in the midst of you , and ye shall know that i am jehovah .
yet will i leave a remnant , in that ye shall have some that escape the sword among the nations , when ye shall be scattered through the countries .
and they shall know that i am jehovah : i have not said in vain that i would do this evil unto them .
moreover the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
thus saith the lord jehovah : an evil , an only evil ; behold , it cometh .
an end is come , the end is come ; it awaketh against thee ; behold , it cometh .
behold , the day , behold , it cometh : thy doom is gone forth ; the rod hath blossomed , pride hath budded .
the time is come , the day draweth near : let not the buyer rejoice , nor the seller mourn ; for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof .
they have blown the trumpet , and have made all ready ; but none goeth to the battle ; for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof .
all hands shall be feeble , and all knees shall be weak as water .
they shall also gird themselves with sackcloth , and horror shall cover them ; and shame shall be upon all faces , and baldness upon all their heads .
my face will i turn also from them , and they shall profane my secret place ; and robbers shall enter into it , and profane it .
make the chain ; for the land is full of bloody crimes , and the city is full of violence .
destruction cometh ; and they shall seek peace , and there shall be none .
and , behold , the glory of the god of israel was there , according to the appearance that i saw in the plain .
and he brought me to the door of the court ; and when i looked , behold , a hole in the wall .
then said he unto me , son of man , dig now in the wall : and when i had digged in the wall , behold , a door .
and he said unto me , go in , and see the wicked abominations that they do here .
he said also unto me , thou shalt again see yet other great abominations which they do .
then said he unto me , hast thou seen this , o son of man ? thou shalt again see yet greater abominations than these .
and as for me also , mine eye shall not spare , neither will i have pity , but i will bring their way upon their head .
now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house , when the man went in ; and the cloud filled the inner court .
and the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court , as the voice of god almighty when he speaketh .
and there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man ’ s hand under their wings .
and as for their appearance , they four had one likeness , as if a wheel had been within a wheel .
as for the wheels , they were called in my hearing the whirling wheels .
and the cherubim mounted up : this is the living creature that i saw by the river chebar .
when they stood , these stood ; and when they mounted up , these mounted up with them : for the spirit of the living creature was in them .
and the glory of jehovah went forth from over the threshold of the house , and stood over the cherubim .
this is the living creature that i saw under the god of israel by the river chebar ; and i knew that they were cherubim .
every one had four faces , and every one four wings ; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings .
and he said unto me , son of man , these are the men that devise iniquity , and that give wicked counsel in this city ;
that say , the time is not near to build houses : this city is the caldron , and we are the flesh .
therefore prophesy against them , prophesy , o son of man .
ye have multiplied your slain in this city , and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain .
ye have feared the sword ; and i will bring the sword upon you , saith the lord jehovah .
and i will bring you forth out of the midst thereof , and deliver you into the hands of strangers , and will execute judgments among you .
ye shall fall by the sword ; i will judge you in the border of israel ; and ye shall know that i am jehovah .
this city shall not be your caldron , neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof ; i will judge you in the border of israel ;
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
and they shall come thither , and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence .
then did the cherubim lift up their wings , and the wheels were beside them ; and the glory of the god of israel was over them above .
and the glory of jehovah went up from the midst of the city , and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city .
then i spake unto them of the captivity all the things that jehovah had showed me .
the word of jehovah also came unto me , saying ,
dig thou through the wall in their sight , and carry out thereby .
and in the morning came the word of jehovah unto me , saying ,
son of man , hath not the house of israel , the rebellious house , said unto thee , what doest thou ?
say thou unto them , thus saith the lord jehovah : this burden concerneth the prince in jerusalem , and all the house of israel among whom they are .
say , i am your sign : like as i have done , so shall it be done unto them ; they shall go into exile , into captivity .
and they shall know that i am jehovah , when i shall disperse them among the nations , and scatter them through the countries .
moreover the word of jehovah came to me , saying ,
son of man , eat thy bread with quaking , and drink thy water with trembling and with fearfulness ;
and the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste , and the land shall be a desolation ; and ye shall know that i am jehovah .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , what is this proverb that ye have in the land of israel , saying , the days are prolonged , and every vision faileth ?
for there shall be no more any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of israel .
again the word of jehovah came to me , saying ,
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
thus saith the lord jehovah , woe unto the foolish prophets , that follow their own spirit , and have seen nothing !
o israel , thy prophets have been like foxes in the waste places .
lo , when the wall is fallen , shall it not be said unto you , where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it ?
then came certain of the elders of israel unto me , and sat before me .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
that i may take the house of israel in their own heart , because they are all estranged from me through their idols .
and they shall bear their iniquity : the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him that seeketh unto him ;
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
or if i send a pestilence into that land , and pour out my wrath upon it in blood , to cut off from it man and beast ;
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , what is the vine-tree more than any tree , the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest ?
shall wood be taken thereof to make any work ? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon ?
and i will make the land desolate , because they have committed a trespass , saith the lord jehovah .
again the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , cause jerusalem to know her abominations ;
then washed i thee with water ; yea , i thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee , and i anointed thee with oil .
i clothed thee also with broidered work , and shod thee with sealskin , and i girded thee about with fine linen , and covered thee with silk .
and i decked thee with ornaments , and i put bracelets upon thy hands , and a chain on thy neck .
and i put a ring upon thy nose , and ear-rings in thine ears , and a beautiful crown upon thy head .
and thou tookest thy broidered garments , and coveredst them , and didst set mine oil and mine incense before them .
that thou hast slain my children , and delivered them up , in causing them to pass through the fire unto them ?
and it is come to pass after all thy wickedness ( woe , woe unto thee ! saith the lord jehovah ) ,
that thou hast built unto thee a vaulted place , and hast made thee a lofty place in every street .
thou hast also committed fornication with the egyptians , thy neighbors , great of flesh ; and hast multiplied thy whoredom , to provoke me to anger .
thou hast moreover multiplied thy whoredom unto the land of traffic , unto chaldea ; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith .
how weak is thy heart , saith the lord jehovah , seeing thou doest all these things , the work of an impudent harlot ;
a wife that committeth adultery ! that taketh strangers instead of her husband !
wherefore , o harlot , hear the word of jehovah :
and i will judge thee , as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged ; and i will bring upon thee the blood of wrath and jealousy .
they shall also bring up a company against thee , and they shall stone thee with stones , and thrust thee through with their swords .
behold , every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee , saying , as is the mother , so is her daughter .
and they were haughty , and committed abomination before me : therefore i took them away as i saw good .
that thou mayest bear thine own shame , and mayest be ashamed because of all that thou hast done , in that thou art a comfort unto them .
for thy sister sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride ,
thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations , saith jehovah .
for thus saith the lord jehovah : i will also deal with thee as thou hast done , who hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant .
nevertheless i will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth , and i will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant .
and i will establish my covenant with thee ; and thou shalt know that i am jehovah ;
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , put forth a riddle , and speak a parable unto the house of israel ;
he cropped off the topmost of the young twigs thereof , and carried it unto a land of traffic ; he set it in a city of merchants .
moreover the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
that the kingdom might be base , that it might not lift itself up , but that by keeping his covenant it might stand .
the word of jehovah came unto me again , saying ,
as i live , saith the lord jehovah , ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in israel .
but if a man be just , and do that which is lawful and right ,
hath walked in my statutes , and hath kept mine ordinances , to deal truly ; he is just , he shall surely live , saith the lord jehovah .
if he beget a son that is a robber , a shedder of blood , and that doeth any one of these things ,
and that doeth not any of those duties , but even hath eaten upon the mountains , and defiled his neighbor ’ s wife ,
none of his transgressions that he hath committed shall be remembered against him : in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live .
have i any pleasure in the death of the wicked ? saith the lord jehovah ; and not rather that he should return from his way , and live ?
when the righteous man turneth away from his righteousness , and committeth iniquity , and dieth therein ; in his iniquity that he hath done shall he die .
because he considereth , and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
for i have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth , saith the lord jehovah : wherefore turn yourselves , and live .
moreover , take thou up a lamentation for the princes of israel ,
and say , what was thy mother ? a lioness : she couched among lions , in the midst of the young lions she nourished her whelps .
and she brought up one of her whelps : he became a young lion , and he learned to catch the prey ; he devoured men .
the nations also heard of him ; he was taken in their pit ; and they brought him with hooks unto the land of egypt .
now when she saw that she had waited , and her hope was lost , then she took another of her whelps , and made him a young lion .
and he went up and down among the lions ; he became a young lion , and he learned to catch the prey ; he devoured men .
then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces ; and they spread their net over him ; he was taken in their pit .
thy mother was like a vine , in thy blood , planted by the waters : it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters .
and now it is planted in the wilderness , in a dry and thirsty land .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
wilt thou judge them , son of man , wilt thou judge them ? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers ;
so i caused them to go forth out of the land of egypt , and brought them into the wilderness .
and i gave them my statutes , and showed them mine ordinances , which if a man do , he shall live in them .
moreover also i gave them my sabbaths , to be a sign between me and them , that they might know that i am jehovah that sanctifieth them .
because they rejected mine ordinances , and walked not in my statutes , and profaned my sabbaths : for their heart went after their idols .
nevertheless mine eye spared them , and i destroyed them not , neither did i make a full end of them in the wilderness .
i am jehovah your god : walk in my statutes , and keep mine ordinances , and do them ;
and hallow my sabbaths ; and they shall be a sign between me and you , that ye may know that i am jehovah your god .
moreover i sware unto them in the wilderness , that i would scatter them among the nations , and disperse them through the countries ;
because they had not executed mine ordinances , but had rejected my statutes , and had profaned my sabbaths , and their eyes were after their fathers ’ idols .
moreover also i gave them statutes that were not good , and ordinances wherein they should not live ;
then i said unto them , what meaneth the high place whereunto ye go ? so the name thereof is called bamah unto this day .
and i will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples , and there will i enter into judgment with you face to face .
and i will cause you to pass under the rod , and i will bring you into the bond of the covenant ;
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
and all flesh shall see that i , jehovah , have kindled it ; it shall not be quenched .
then said i , ah lord jehovah ! they say of me , is he not a speaker of parables ?
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , set thy face toward jerusalem , and drop thy word toward the sanctuaries , and prophesy against the land of israel ;
and all flesh shall know that i , jehovah , have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath ; it shall not return any more .
sigh therefore , thou son of man ; with the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness shalt thou sigh before their eyes .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , prophesy , and say , thus saith jehovah : say , a sword , a sword , it is sharpened , and also furbished ;
for there is a trial ; and what if even the rod that contemneth shall be no more ? saith the lord jehovah .
gather thee together , go to the right , set thyself in array , go to the left , whithersoever thy face is set .
i will also smite my hands together , and i will cause my wrath to rest : i , jehovah , have spoken it .
the word of jehovah came unto me again , saying ,
thou shalt appoint a way for the sword to come to rabbah of the children of ammon , and to judah in jerusalem the fortified .
and thou , o deadly wounded wicked one , the prince of israel , whose day is come , in the time of the iniquity of the end ,
cause it to return into its sheath . in the place where thou wast created , in the land of thy birth , will i judge thee .
moreover the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
and thou , son of man , wilt thou judge , wilt thou judge the bloody city ? then cause her to know all her abominations .
those that are near , and those that are far from thee , shall mock thee , thou infamous one and full of tumult .
behold , the princes of israel , every one according to his power , have been in thee to shed blood .
thou hast despised my holy things , and hast profaned my sabbaths .
slanderous men have been in thee to shed blood ; and in thee they have eaten upon the mountains : in the midst of thee they have committed lewdness .
in thee have they uncovered their fathers ’ nakedness ; in thee have they humbled her that was unclean in her impurity .
and i will scatter thee among the nations , and disperse thee through the countries ; and i will consume thy filthiness out of thee .
and thou shalt be profaned in thyself , in the sight of the nations ; and thou shalt know that i am jehovah .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
therefore thus saith the lord jehovah : because ye are all become dross , therefore , behold , i will gather you into the midst of jerusalem .
yea , i will gather you , and blow upon you with the fire of my wrath , and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , say unto her , thou art a land that is not cleansed , nor rained upon in the day of indignation .
her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey , to shed blood , and to destroy souls , that they may get dishonest gain .
the people of the land have used oppression , and exercised robbery ; yea , they have vexed the poor and needy , and have oppressed the sojourner wrongfully .
the word of jehovah came again unto me , saying ,
son of man , there were two women , the daughters of one mother :
and oholah played the harlot when she was mine ; and she doted on her lovers , on the assyrians her neighbors ,
who were clothed with blue , governors and rulers , all of them desirable young men , horsemen riding upon horses .
wherefore i delivered her into the hand of her lovers , into the hand of the assyrians , upon whom she doted .
she doted upon the assyrians , governors and rulers , her neighbors , clothed most gorgeously , horsemen riding upon horses , all of them desirable young men .
and i saw that she was defiled ; they both took one way .
and she increased her whoredoms ; for she saw men portrayed upon the wall , the images of the chaldeans portrayed with vermilion ,
and as soon as she saw them she doted upon them , and sent messengers unto them into chaldea .
so she uncovered her whoredoms , and uncovered her nakedness : then my soul was alienated from her , like as my soul was alienated from her sister .
yet she multiplied her whoredoms , remembering the days of her youth , wherein she had played the harlot in the land of egypt .
and she doted upon their paramours , whose flesh is as the flesh of asses , and whose issue is like the issue of horses .
thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth , in the handling of thy bosom by the egyptians for the breasts of thy youth .
they shall also strip thee of thy clothes , and take away thy fair jewels .
these things shall be done unto thee , for that thou hast played the harlot after the nations , and because thou art polluted with their idols .
thou hast walked in the way of thy sister ; therefore will i give her cup into thy hand .
thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow , with the cup of astonishment and desolation , with the cup of thy sister samaria .
therefore thus saith the lord jehovah : because thou hast forgotten me , and cast me behind thy back , therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms .
jehovah said moreover unto me : son of man , wilt thou judge oholah and oholibah ? then declare unto them their abominations .
moreover this they have done unto me : they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day , and have profaned my sabbaths .
and sit upon a stately bed , with a table prepared before it , whereupon thou didst set mine incense and mine oil .
then said i of her that was old in adulteries , now will they play the harlot with her , and she with them .
and they went in unto her , as they go in unto a harlot : so went they in unto oholah and unto oholibah , the lewd women .
for thus saith the lord jehovah : i will bring up a company against them , and will give them to be tossed to and fro and robbed .
thus will i cause lewdness to cease out of the land , that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness .
and they shall recompense your lewdness upon you , and ye shall bear the sins of your idols ; and ye shall know that i am the lord jehovah .
again , in the ninth year , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , write thee the name of the day , even of this selfsame day : the king of babylon drew close unto jerusalem this selfsame day .
gather the pieces thereof into it , even every good piece , the thigh , and the shoulder ; fill it with the choice bones .
that it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance , i have set her blood upon the bare rock , that it should not be covered .
therefore thus saith the lord jehovah : woe to the bloody city ! i also will make the pile great .
heap on the wood , make the fire hot , boil well the flesh , and make thick the broth , and let the bones be burned .
she hath wearied herself with toil ; yet her great rust goeth not forth out of her ; her rust goeth not forth by fire .
also the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
so i spake unto the people in the morning ; and at even my wife died ; and i did in the morning as i was commanded .
and the people said unto me , wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us , that thou doest so ?
then i said unto them , the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
and ye shall do as i have done : ye shall not cover your lips , nor eat the bread of men .
that in that day he that escapeth shall come unto thee , to cause thee to hear it with thine ears ?
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , set thy face toward the children of ammon , and prophesy against them :
and i will make rabbah a stable for camels , and the children of ammon a couching-place for flocks : and ye shall know that i am jehovah .
thus saith the lord jehovah : because that moab and seir do say , behold , the house of judah is like unto all the nations ;
and i will execute judgments upon moab ; and they shall know that i am jehovah .
thus saith the lord jehovah : because the philistines have dealt by revenge , and have taken vengeance with despite of soul to destroy with perpetual enmity ;
and i will execute great vengeance upon them with wrathful rebukes ; and they shall know that i am jehovah , when i shall lay my vengeance upon them .
and it came to pass in the eleventh year , in the first day of the month , that the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
and her daughters that are in the field shall be slain with the sword : and they shall know that i am jehovah .
and he shall set his battering engines against thy walls , and with his axes he shall break down thy towers .
and i will cause the noise of thy songs to cease ; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard .
now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall ; yea , the isles that are in the sea shall be dismayed at thy departure .
the word of jehovah came again unto me , saying ,
and thou , son of man , take up a lamentation over tyre ;
thy borders are in the heart of the seas ; thy builders have perfected thy beauty .
they have made all thy planks of fir-trees from senir ; they have taken a cedar from lebanon to make a mast for thee .
of the oaks of bashan have they made thine oars ; they have made thy benches of ivory inlaid in boxwood , from the isles of kittim .
the inhabitants of sidon and arvad were thy rowers : thy wise men , o tyre , were in thee , they were thy pilots .
persia and lud and put were in thine army , thy men of war : they hanged the shield and helmet in thee ; they set forth thy comeliness .
javan , tubal , and meshech , they were thy traffickers ; they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass for thy merchandise .
they of the house of togarmah traded for thy wares with horses and war-horses and mules .
the men of dedan were thy traffickers ; many isles were the mart of thy hand : they brought thee in exchange horns of ivory and ebony .
vedan and javan traded with yarn for thy wares : bright iron , cassia , and calamus , were among thy merchandise .
dedan was thy trafficker in precious cloths for riding .
haran and canneh and eden , the traffickers of sheba , asshur and chilmad , were thy traffickers .
the ships of tarshish were thy caravans for thy merchandise : and thou wast replenished , and made very glorious in the heart of the seas .
thy rowers have brought thee into great waters : the east wind hath broken thee in the heart of the seas .
at the sound of the cry of thy pilots the suburbs shall shake .
and they shall make themselves bald for thee , and gird them with sackcloth , and they shall weep for thee in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning .
all the inhabitants of the isles are astonished at thee , and their kings are horribly afraid ; they are troubled in their countenance .
the merchants among the peoples hiss at thee ; thou art become a terror , and thou shalt nevermore have any being .
the word of jehovah came again unto me , saying ,
behold , thou art wiser than daniel ; there is no secret that is hidden from thee ;
by thy wisdom and by thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches , and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures ;
by thy great wisdom and by thy traffic hast thou increased thy riches , and thy heart is lifted up because of thy riches ; —
therefore thus saith the lord jehovah : because thou hast set thy heart as the heart of god ,
they shall bring thee down to the pit ; and thou shalt die the death of them that are slain , in the heart of the seas .
thou shalt die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers : for i have spoken it , saith the lord jehovah .
moreover the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created , till unrighteousness was found in thee .
all they that know thee among the peoples shall be astonished at thee : thou art become a terror , and thou shalt nevermore have any being .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , set thy face toward sidon , and prophesy against it ,
in the tenth year , in the tenth month , in the twelfth day of the month , the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , set thy face against pharaoh king of egypt , and prophesy against him , and against all egypt ;
and all the inhabitants of egypt shall know that i am jehovah , because they have been a staff of reed to the house of israel .
therefore thus saith the lord jehovah : behold , i will bring a sword upon thee , and will cut off from thee man and beast .
no foot of man shall pass through it , nor foot of beast shall pass through it , neither shall it be inhabited forty years .
for thus saith the lord jehovah : at the end of forty years will i gather the egyptians from the peoples whither they were scattered ;
i have given him the land of egypt as his recompense for which he served , because they wrought for me , saith the lord jehovah .
the word of jehovah came again unto me , saying ,
son of man , prophesy , and say , thus saith the lord jehovah : wail ye , alas for the day !
for the day is near , even the day of jehovah is near ; it shall be a day of clouds , a time of the nations .
and they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate ; and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted .
and they shall know that i am jehovah , when i have set a fire in egypt , and all her helpers are destroyed .
thus saith the lord jehovah : i will also make the multitude of egypt to cease , by the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon .
and i will make pathros desolate , and will set a fire in zoan , and will execute judgments upon no .
and i will pour my wrath upon sin , the stronghold of egypt ; and i will cut off the multitude of no .
the young men of aven and of pi-beseth shall fall by the sword ; and these cities shall go into captivity .
thus will i execute judgments upon egypt ; and they shall know that i am jehovah .
and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations , and will disperse them through the countries .
and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations , and disperse them through the countries ; and they shall know that i am jehovah .
son of man , say unto pharaoh king of egypt , and to his multitude : whom art thou like in thy greatness ?
thus was it fair in its greatness , in the length of its branches ; for its root was by many waters .
i made it fair by the multitude of its branches , so that all the trees of eden , that were in the garden of god , envied it .
upon his ruin all the birds of the heavens shall dwell , and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches ;
and i will lay thy flesh upon the mountains , and fill the valleys with thy height .
i will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest , even to the mountains ; and the watercourses shall be full of thee .
all the bright lights of heaven will i make dark over thee , and set darkness upon thy land , saith the lord jehovah .
i will also vex the hearts of many peoples , when i shall bring thy destruction among the nations , into the countries which thou hast not known .
for thus saith the lord jehovah : the sword of the king of babylon shall come upon thee .
then will i make their waters clear , and cause their rivers to run like oil , saith the lord jehovah .
it came to pass also in the twelfth year , in the fifteenth day of the month , that the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
whom dost thou pass in beauty ? go down , and be thou laid with the uncircumcised .
they shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword : she is delivered to the sword ; draw her away and all her multitudes .
asshur is there and all her company ; her graves are round about her ; all of them slain , fallen by the sword ;
but thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised , and shalt lie with them that are slain by the sword .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
if , when he seeth the sword come upon the land , he blow the trumpet , and warn the people ;
again , when i say unto the wicked , thou shalt surely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is lawful and right ;
none of his sins that he hath committed shall be remembered against him : he hath done that which is lawful and right ; he shall surely live .
yet the children of thy people say , the way of the lord is not equal : but as for them , their way is not equal .
when the righteous turneth from his righteousness , and committeth iniquity , he shall even die therein .
and when the wicked turneth from his wickedness , and doeth that which is lawful and right , he shall live thereby .
yet ye say , the way of the lord is not equal . o house of israel , i will judge you every one after his ways .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
ye stand upon your sword , ye work abomination , and ye defile every one his neighbor ’ s wife : and shall ye possess the land ?
and when this cometh to pass ( behold , it cometh ) , then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
ye eat the fat , and ye clothe you with the wool , ye kill the fatlings ; but ye feed not the sheep .
and they were scattered , because there was no shepherd ; and they became food to all the beasts of the field , and were scattered .
therefore , ye shepherds , hear the word of jehovah :
therefore , ye shepherds , hear the word of jehovah :
for thus saith the lord jehovah : behold , i myself , even i , will search for my sheep , and will seek them out .
i myself will be the shepherd of my sheep , and i will cause them to lie down , saith the lord jehovah .
and as for you , o my flock , thus saith the lord jehovah : behold , i judge between sheep and sheep , the rams and the he-goats .
and as for my sheep , they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet , and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet .
therefore thus saith the lord jehovah unto them : behold , i , even i , will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep .
because ye thrust with side and with shoulder , and push all the diseased with your horns , till ye have scattered them abroad ;
therefore will i save my flock , and they shall no more be a prey ; and i will judge between sheep and sheep .
and i , jehovah , will be their god , and my servant david prince among them ; i , jehovah , have spoken it .
and ye my sheep , the sheep of my pasture , are men , and i am your god , saith the lord jehovah .
moreover the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
son of man , set thy face against mount seir , and prophesy against it ,
i will lay thy cities waste , and thou shalt be desolate ; and thou shalt know that i am jehovah .
thus will i make mount seir an astonishment and a desolation ; and i will cut off from it him that passeth through and him that returneth .
i will make thee a perpetual desolation , and thy cities shall not be inhabited ; and ye shall know that i am jehovah .
because thou hast said , these two nations and these two countries shall be mine , and we will possess it ; whereas jehovah was there :
and ye have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth , and have multiplied your words against me : i have heard it .
thus saith the lord jehovah : when the whole earth rejoiceth , i will make thee desolate .
and thou , son of man , prophesy unto the mountains of israel , and say , ye mountains of israel , hear the word of jehovah .
thus saith the lord jehovah : because the enemy hath said against you , aha ! and , the ancient high places are ours in possession ;
therefore thus saith the lord jehovah : i have sworn , saying , surely the nations that are round about you , they shall bear their shame .
for , behold , i am for you , and i will turn unto you , and ye shall be tilled and sown ;
thus saith the lord jehovah : because they say unto you , thou land art a devourer of men , and hast been a bereaver of thy nation ;
therefore thou shalt devour men no more , neither bereave thy nation any more , saith the lord jehovah ;
moreover the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
wherefore i poured out my wrath upon them for the blood which they had poured out upon the land , and because they had defiled it with their idols ;
and i scattered them among the nations , and they were dispersed through the countries : according to their way and according to their doings i judged them .
but i had regard for my holy name , which the house of israel had profaned among the nations , whither they went .
for i will take you from among the nations , and gather you out of all the countries , and will bring you into your own land .
and i will put my spirit within you , and cause you to walk in my statutes , and ye shall keep mine ordinances , and do them .
and ye shall dwell in the land that i gave to your fathers ; and ye shall be my people , and i will be your god .
and i will save you from all your uncleannesses : and i will call for the grain , and will multiply it , and lay no famine upon you .
and the land that was desolate shall be tilled , whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all that passed by .
and he said unto me , son of man , can these bones live ? and i answered , o lord jehovah , thou knowest .
again he said unto me , prophesy over these bones , and say unto them , o ye dry bones , hear the word of jehovah .
thus saith the lord jehovah unto these bones : behold , i will cause breath to enter into you , and ye shall live .
the word of jehovah came again unto me , saying ,
and join them for thee one to another into one stick , that they may become one in thy hand .
and when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee , saying , wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these ?
and the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes .
my tabernacle also shall be with them ; and i will be their god , and they shall be my people .
and the nations shall know that i am jehovah that sanctifieth israel , when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
and say , thus saith the lord jehovah : behold , i am against thee , o gog , prince of rosh , meshech , and tubal :
persia , cush , and put with them , all of them with shield and helmet ;
gomer , and all his hordes ; the house of togarmah in the uttermost parts of the north , and all his hordes ; even many peoples with thee .
be thou prepared , yea , prepare thyself , thou , and all thy companies that are assembled unto thee , and be thou a guard unto them .
and i will call for a sword against him unto all my mountains , saith the lord jehovah : every man ’ s sword shall be against his brother .
and i will smite thy bow out of thy left hand , and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand .
thou shalt fall upon the open field ; for i have spoken it , saith the lord jehovah .
and i will send a fire on magog , and on them that dwell securely in the isles ; and they shall know that i am jehovah .
behold , it cometh , and it shall be done , saith the lord jehovah ; this is the day whereof i have spoken .
and seven months shall the house of israel be burying them , that they may cleanse the land .
and hamonah shall also be the name of a city . thus shall they cleanse the land .
and ye shall eat fat till ye be full , and drink blood till ye be drunken , of my sacrifice which i have sacrificed for you .
and ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots , with mighty men , and with all men of war , saith the lord jehovah .
so the house of israel shall know that i am jehovah their god , from that day and forward .
according to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions did i unto them ; and i hid my face from them .
neither will i hide my face any more from them ; for i have poured out my spirit upon the house of israel , saith the lord jehovah .
he measured also the porch of the gate toward the house , one reed .
and he measured the breadth of the opening of the gate , ten cubits ; and the length of the gate , thirteen cubits ;
he made also posts , threescore cubits ; and the court reached unto the posts , round about the gate .
and from the forefront of the gate at the entrance unto the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits .
and the pavement was by the side of the gates , answerable unto the length of the gates , even the lower pavement .
and the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north , he measured the length thereof and the breadth thereof .
and there was a gate to the inner court toward the south : and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits .
then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate : and he measured the south gate according to these measures ;
and there were arches round about , five and twenty cubits long , and five cubits broad .
and the arches thereof were toward the outer court ; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof : and the ascent to it had eight steps .
and he brought me into the inner court toward the east : and he measured the gate according to these measures ;
and he brought me to the north gate : and he measured it according to these measures ;
and a chamber with the door thereof was by the posts at the gates ; there they washed the burnt-offering .
four tables were on this side , and four tables on that side , by the side of the gate ; eight tables , whereupon they slew the sacrifices .
and the hooks , a handbreadth long , were fastened within round about : and upon the tables was the flesh of the oblation .
and he said unto me , this chamber , whose prospect is toward the south , is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the house ;
and he measured the court , a hundred cubits long , and a hundred cubits broad , foursquare ; and the altar was before the house .
then he measured the wall of the house , six cubits ; and the breadth of every side-chamber , four cubits , round about the house on every side .
i saw also that the house had a raised basement round about : the foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed of six great cubits .
and between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side .
so he measured the house , a hundred cubits long ; and the separate place , and the building , with the walls thereof , a hundred cubits long ;
also the breadth of the face of the house , and of the separate place toward the east , a hundred cubits .
to the space above the door , even unto the inner house , and without , and by all the wall round about within and without , by measure .
and it was made with cherubim and palm-trees ; and a palm-tree was between cherub and cherub , and every cherub had two faces ;
from the ground unto above the door were cherubim and palm-trees made ; thus was the wall of the temple .
as for the temple , the door-posts were squared ; and as for the face of the sanctuary , the appearance thereof was as the appearance of the temple .
and the temple and the sanctuary had two doors .
and the doors had two leaves apiece , two turning leaves : two leaves for the one door , and two leaves for the other .
before the length of a hundred cubits was the north door , and the breadth was fifty cubits .
and before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits ’ breadth inward , a way of one cubit ; and their doors were toward the north .
now the upper chambers were shorter ; for the galleries took away from these , more than from the lower and the middlemost , in the building .
and the wall that was without by the side of the chambers , toward the outer court before the chambers , the length thereof was fifty cubits .
for the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits : and , lo , before the temple were a hundred cubits .
and from under these chambers was the entry on the east side , as one goeth into them from the outer court .
in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east , before the separate place , and before the building , there were chambers .
he measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds , with the measuring reed round about .
he measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about .
he measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed .
he turned about to the west side , and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed .
afterward he brought me to the gate , even the gate that looketh toward the east .
and the glory of jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east .
and the spirit took me up , and brought me into the inner court ; and , behold , the glory of jehovah filled the house .
and i heard one speaking unto me out of the house ; and a man stood by me .
and the upper altar shall be four cubits ; and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns .
and the altar hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve broad , square in the four sides thereof .
thou shalt also take the bullock of the sin-offering , and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house , without the sanctuary .
when thou hast made an end of cleansing it , thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish , and a ram out of the flock without blemish .
and thou shalt bring them near before jehovah , and the priests shall cast salt upon them , and they shall offer them up for a burnt-offering unto jehovah .
seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it ; so shall they consecrate it .
then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary , which looketh toward the east ; and it was shut .
and ye have not kept the charge of my holy things ; but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves .
but the levites that went far from me , when israel went astray , that went astray from me after their idols , they shall bear their iniquity .
yet will i make them keepers of the charge of the house , for all the service thereof , and for all that shall be done therein .
they shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister unto me , and they shall keep my charge .
they shall have linen tires upon their heads , and shall have linen breeches upon their loins ; they shall not gird themselves with anything that causeth sweat .
neither shall they shave their heads , nor suffer their locks to grow long ; they shall only cut off the hair of their heads .
neither shall any of the priests drink wine , when they enter into the inner court .
and they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common , and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean .
and after he is cleansed , they shall reckon unto him seven days .
and they shall have an inheritance : i am their inheritance ; and ye shall give them no possession in israel ; i am their possession .
they shall eat the meal-offering , and the sin-offering , and the trespass-offering ; and every devoted thing in israel shall be theirs .
the priests shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself , or is torn , whether it be bird or beast .
ye shall have just balances , and a just ephah , and a just bath .
and the shekel shall be twenty gerahs ; twenty shekels , five and twenty shekels , fifteen shekels , shall be your maneh .
all the people of the land shall give unto this oblation for the prince in israel .
and upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin-offering .
and he shall prepare a meal-offering , an ephah for a bullock , and an ephah for a ram , and a hin of oil to an ephah .
and the people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before jehovah on the sabbaths and on the new moons .
and the burnt-offering that the prince shall offer unto jehovah shall be on the sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish ;
and the prince , when they go in , shall go in in the midst of them ; and when they go forth , they shall go forth together .
and thou shalt prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering unto jehovah daily : morning by morning shalt thou prepare it .
thus shall they prepare the lamb , and the meal-offering , and the oil , morning by morning , for a continual burnt-offering .
in the four corners of the court there were courts inclosed , forty cubits long and thirty broad : these four in the corners were of one measure .
and there was a wall round about in them , round about the four , and boiling-places were made under the walls round about .
then said he unto me , these are the boiling-houses , where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people .
now when i had returned , behold , upon the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
but the miry places thereof , and the marshes thereof , shall not be healed ; they shall be given up to salt .
hamath , berothah , sibraim , which is between the border of damascus and the border of hamath ; hazer-hatticon , which is by the border of hauran .
and the west side shall be the great sea , from the south border as far as over against the entrance of hamath . this is the west side .
so shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of israel .
and it shall come to pass , that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth , there shall ye give him his inheritance , saith the lord jehovah .
and by the border of dan , from the east side unto the west side , asher , one portion .
and by the border of asher , from the east side even unto the west side , naphtali , one portion .
and by the border of naphtali , from the east side unto the west side , manasseh , one portion .
and by the border of manasseh , from the east side unto the west side , ephraim , one portion .
and by the border of ephraim , from the east side even unto the west side , reuben , one portion .
and by the border of reuben , from the east side unto the west side , judah , one portion .
the oblation that ye shall offer unto jehovah shall be five and twenty thousand reeds in length , and ten thousand in breadth .
and it shall be unto them an oblation from the oblation of the land , a thing most holy , by the border of the levites .
and they shall sell none of it , nor exchange it , nor shall the first-fruits of the land be alienated ; for it is holy unto jehovah .
and they that labor in the city , out of all the tribes of israel , shall till it .
all the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand : ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare , with the possession of the city .
and as for the rest of the tribes : from the east side unto the west side , benjamin , one portion .
and by the border of benjamin , from the east side unto the west side , simeon , one portion .
and by the border of simeon , from the east side unto the west side , issachar , one portion .
and by the border of issachar , from the east side unto the west side , zebulun , one portion .
and by the border of zebulun , from the east side unto the west side , gad , one portion .
this is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of israel for inheritance , and these are their several portions , saith the lord jehovah .
and these are the egresses of the city : on the north side four thousand and five hundred reeds by measure ;
it shall be eighteen thousand reeds round about : and the name of the city from that day shall be , jehovah is there .
even those did cyrus king of persia bring forth by the hand of mithredath the treasurer , and numbered them unto sheshbazzar , the prince of judah .
and this is the number of them : thirty platters of gold , a thousand platters of silver , nine and twenty knives ,
thirty bowls of gold , silver bowls of a second sort four hundred and ten , and other vessels a thousand .

the children of delaiah , the children of tobiah , the children of nekoda , six hundred fifty and two .
these sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy , but they were not found : therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood .
and the governor said unto them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , till there stood up a priest with urim and with thummim .
the whole assembly together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore ,
besides their men-servants and their maid-servants , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven : and they had two hundred singing men and singing women .
their horses were seven hundred thirty and six ; their mules , two hundred forty and five ;
their camels , four hundred thirty and five ; their asses , six thousand seven hundred and twenty .
and when the seventh month was come , and the children of israel were in the cities , the people gathered themselves together as one man to jerusalem .
from the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt-offerings unto jehovah : but the foundation of the temple of jehovah was not yet laid .
now when the adversaries of judah and benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple unto jehovah , the god of israel ;
then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of judah , and troubled them in building ,
and hired counsellors against them , to frustrate their purpose , all the days of cyrus king of persia , even until the reign of darius king of persia .
and in the reign of ahasuerus , in the beginning of his reign , wrote they an accusation against the inhabitants of judah and jerusalem .
rehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against jerusalem to artaxerxes the king in this sort :
this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto artaxerxes the king : thy servants the men beyond the river , and so forth .
we certify the king that , if this city be builded , and the walls finished , by this means thou shalt have no portion beyond the river .
the letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me .
make ye now a decree to cause these men to cease , and that this city be not builded , until a decree shall be made by me .
and take heed that ye be not slack herein : why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings ?
then ceased the work of the house of god which is at jerusalem ; and it ceased until the second year of the reign of darius king of persia .
then we told them after this manner , what the names of the men were that were making this building .
they sent a letter unto him , wherein was written thus : unto darius the king , all peace .
then asked we those elders , and said unto them thus , who gave you a decree to build this house , and to finish this wall ?
we asked them their names also , to certify thee , that we might write the names of the men that were at the head of them .
but in the first year of cyrus king of babylon , cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of god .
then darius the king made a decree , and search was made in the house of the archives , where the treasures were laid up in babylon .
and there was found at achmetha , in the palace that is in the province of media , a roll , and therein was thus written for a record :
with three courses of great stones , and a course of new timber : and let the expenses be given out of the king ’ s house .
now therefore , tattenai , governor beyond the river , shethar-bozenai , and your companions the apharsachites , who are beyond the river , be ye far from thence :
that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savor unto the god of heaven , and pray for the life of the king , and of his sons .
then tattenai , the governor beyond the river , shethar-bozenai , and their companions , because that darius the king had sent , did accordingly with all diligence .
and this house was finished on the third day of the month adar , which was in the sixth year of the reign of darius the king .
and the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month .
now after these things , in the reign of artaxerxes king of persia , ezra the son of seraiah , the son of azariah , the son of hilkiah ,
the son of shallum , the son of zadok , the son of ahitub ,
the son of amariah , the son of azariah , the son of meraioth ,
the son of zerahiah , the son of uzzi , the son of bukki ,
the son of abishua , the son of phinehas , the son of eleazar , the son of aaron the chief priest—
and he came to jerusalem in the fifth month , which was in the seventh year of the king .
for ezra had set his heart to seek the law of jehovah , and to do it , and to teach in israel statutes and ordinances .
artaxerxes , king of kings , unto ezra the priest , the scribe of the law of the god of heaven , perfect and so forth .
and to carry the silver and gold , which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the god of israel , whose habitation is in jerusalem ,
and the vessels that are given thee for the service of the house of thy god , deliver thou before the god of jerusalem .
of the sons of phinehas , gershom . of the sons of ithamar , daniel . of the sons of david , hattush .
of the sons of shecaniah , of the sons of parosh , zechariah ; and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males a hundred and fifty .
of the sons of pahath-moab , eliehoenai the son of zerahiah ; and with him two hundred males .
of the sons of shecaniah , the son of jahaziel ; and with him three hundred males .
and of the sons of adin , ebed the son of jonathan ; and with him fifty males .
and of the sons of elam , jeshaiah the son of athaliah ; and with him seventy males .
and of the sons of shephatiah , zebadiah the son of michael ; and with him fourscore males .
of the sons of joab , obadiah the son of jehiel ; and with him two hundred and eighteen males .
and of the sons of shelomith , the son of josiphiah ; and with him a hundred and threescore males .
and of the sons of bebai , zechariah the son of bebai ; and with him twenty and eight males .
and of the sons of azgad , johanan the son of hakkatan ; and with him a hundred and ten males .
and of the sons of bigvai , uthai and zabbud ; and with them seventy males .
and hashabiah , and with him jeshaiah of the sons of merari , his brethren and their sons , twenty ;
so we fasted and besought our god for this : and he was entreated of us .
then i set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests , even sherebiah , hashabiah , and ten of their brethren with them ,
i weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver , and silver vessels a hundred talents ; of gold a hundred talents ;
and twenty bowls of gold , of a thousand darics ; and two vessels of fine bright brass , precious as gold .
and we came to jerusalem , and abode there three days .
the whole by number and by weight : and all the weight was written at that time .
and now , o our god , what shall we say after this ? for we have forsaken thy commandments ,
arise ; for the matter belongeth unto thee , and we are with thee : be of good courage , and do it .
and they made proclamation throughout judah and jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity , that they should gather themselves together unto jerusalem ;
and ezra the priest stood up , and said unto them , ye have trespassed , and have married foreign women , to increase the guilt of israel .
then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice , as thou hast said concerning us , so must we do .
only jonathan the son of asahel and jahzeiah the son of tikvah stood up against this matter : and meshullam and shabbethai the levite helped them .
and they made an end with all the men that had married foreign women by the first day of the first month .
and they gave their hand that they would put away their wives ; and being guilty , they offered a ram of the flock for their guilt .

all these had taken foreign wives ; and some of them had wives by whom they had children .
and all the brethren that are with me , unto the churches of galatia :
grace to you and peace from god the father , and our lord jesus christ ,
who gave himself for our sins , that he might deliver us out of this present evil world , according to the will of our god and father :
to whom be the glory for ever and ever . amen .
i marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of christ unto a different gospel ;
which is not another gospel : only there are some that trouble you , and would pervert the gospel of christ .
but though we , or an angel from heaven , should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you , let him be anathema .
for i make known to you , brethren , as touching the gospel which was preached by me , that it is not after man .
for neither did i receive it from man , nor was i taught it , but it came to me through revelation of jesus christ .
and i advanced in the jews ’ religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen , being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers .
but when it was the good pleasure of god , who separated me , even from my mother ’ s womb , and called me through his grace ,
to reveal his son in me , that i might preach him among the gentiles ; straightway i conferred not with flesh and blood :
neither went i up to jerusalem to them that were apostles before me : but i went away into arabia ; and again i returned unto damascus .
then after three years i went up to jerusalem to visit cephas , and tarried with him fifteen days .
but other of the apostles saw i none , save james the lord ’ s brother .
now touching the things which i write unto you , behold , before god , i lie not .
then i came into the regions of syria and cilicia .
and i was still unknown by face unto the churches of judaea which were in christ :
but they only heard say , he that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havoc ;
and they glorified god in me .
then after the space of fourteen years i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas , taking titus also with me .
but not even titus who was with me , being a greek , was compelled to be circumcised :
to whom we gave place in the way of subjection , no , not for an hour ; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you .
but contrariwise , when they saw that i had been intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision , even as peter with the gospel of the circumcision
( for he that wrought for peter unto the apostleship of the circumcision wrought for me also unto the gentiles ) ;
only they would that we should remember the poor ; which very thing i was also zealous to do .
but when cephas came to antioch , i resisted him to the face , because he stood condemned .
and the rest of the jews dissembled likewise with him ; insomuch that even barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation .
we being jews by nature , and not sinners of the gentiles ,
but if , while we sought to be justified in christ , we ourselves also were found sinners , is christ a minister of sin ? god forbid .
for if i build up again those things which i destroyed , i prove myself a transgressor .
for i through the law died unto the law , that i might live unto god .
i do not make void the grace of god : for if righteousness is through the law , then christ died for nought .
o foolish galatians , who did bewitch you , before whose eyes jesus christ was openly set forth crucified ?
this only would i learn from you , received ye the spirit by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
are ye so foolish ? having begun in the spirit , are ye now perfected in the flesh ?
did ye suffer so many things in vain ? if it be indeed in vain .
even as abraham believed god , and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness .
know therefore that they that are of faith , the same are sons of abraham .
so then they that are of faith are blessed with the faithful abraham .
now that no man is justified by the law before god , is evident : for , the righteous shall live by faith ;
and the law is not of faith ; but , he that doeth them shall live in them .
that upon the gentiles might come the blessing of abraham in christ jesus ; that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith .
for if the inheritance is of the law , it is no more of promise : but god hath granted it to abraham by promise .
now a mediator is not a mediator of one ; but god is one .
but the scripture shut up all things under sin , that the promise by faith in jesus christ might be given to them that believe .
but before faith came , we were kept in ward under the law , shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed .
so that the law is become our tutor to bring us unto christ , that we might be justified by faith .
but now that faith is come , we are no longer under a tutor .
for ye are all sons of god , through faith , in christ jesus .
for as many of you as were baptized into christ did put on christ .
and if ye are christ ’ s , then are ye abraham ’ s seed , heirs according to promise .
but i say that so long as the heir is a child , he differeth nothing from a bondservant though he is lord of all ;
but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed of the father .
so we also , when we were children , were held in bondage under the rudiments of the world :
but when the fulness of the time came , god sent forth his son , born of a woman , born under the law ,
that he might redeem them that were under the law , that we might receive the adoption of sons .
and because ye are sons , god sent forth the spirit of his son into our hearts , crying , abba , father .
so that thou art no longer a bondservant , but a son ; and if a son , then an heir through god .
howbeit at that time , not knowing god , ye were in bondage to them that by nature are no gods :
ye observe days , and months , and seasons , and years .
i am afraid of you , lest by any means i have bestowed labor upon you in vain .
i beseech you , brethren , become as i am , for i also am become as ye are . ye did me no wrong :
but ye know that because of an infirmity of the flesh i preached the gospel unto you the first time :
so then am i become your enemy , by telling you the truth ?
they zealously seek you in no good way ; nay , they desire to shut you out , that ye may seek them .
but it is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times , and not only when i am present with you .
my little children , of whom i am again in travail until christ be formed in you—
but i could wish to be present with you now , and to change my tone ; for i am perplexed about you .
tell me , ye that desire to be under the law , do ye not hear the law ?
for it is written , that abraham had two sons , one by the handmaid , and one by the freewoman .
howbeit the son by the handmaid is born after the flesh ; but the son by the freewoman is born through promise .
which things contain an allegory : for these women are two covenants ; one from mount sinai , bearing children unto bondage , which is hagar .
now this hagar is mount sinai in arabia and answereth to the jerusalem that now is : for she is in bondage with her children .
but the jerusalem that is above is free , which is our mother .
for it is written ,
now we , brethren , as isaac was , are children of promise .
but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit , so also it is now .
howbeit what saith the scripture ? cast out the handmaid and her son : for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman .
wherefore , brethren , we are not children of a handmaid , but of the freewoman .
for freedom did christ set us free : stand fast therefore , and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage .
behold , i paul say unto you , that , if ye receive circumcision , christ will profit you nothing .
yea , i testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision , that he is a debtor to do the whole law .
ye are severed from christ , ye who would be justified by the law ; ye are fallen away from grace .
for we through the spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness .
for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth anything , nor uncircumcision ; but faith working through love .
ye were running well ; who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth ?
this persuasion came not of him that calleth you .
a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump .
but i , brethren , if i still preach circumcision , why am i still persecuted ? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away .
i would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision .
for the whole law is fulfilled in one word , even in this : thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself .
but if ye bite and devour one another , take heed that ye be not consumed one of another .
but i say , walk by the spirit , and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh .
but if ye are led by the spirit , ye are not under the law .
now the works of the flesh are manifest , which are these : fornication , uncleanness , lasciviousness ,
idolatry , sorcery , enmities , strife , jealousies , wraths , factions , divisions , parties ,
but the fruit of the spirit is love , joy , peace , longsuffering , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
meekness , self-control ; against such there is no law .
and they that are of christ jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof .
if we live by the spirit , by the spirit let us also walk .
let us not become vainglorious , provoking one another , envying one another .
bear ye one another ’ s burdens , and so fulfil the law of christ .
for if a man thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing , he deceiveth himself .
but let each man prove his own work , and then shall he have his glorying in regard of himself alone , and not of his neighbor .
for each man shall bear his own burden .
but let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things .
be not deceived ; god is not mocked : for whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap .
for he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption ; but he that soweth unto the spirit shall of the spirit reap eternal life .
and let us not be weary in well-doing : for in due season we shall reap , if we faint not .
see with how large letters i write unto you with mine own hand .
for not even they who receive circumcision do themselves keep the law ; but they desire to have you circumcised , that they may glory in your flesh .
for neither is circumcision anything , nor uncircumcision , but a new creature .
and as many as shall walk by this rule , peace be upon them , and mercy , and upon the israel of god .
henceforth let no man trouble me ; for i bear branded on my body the marks of jesus .
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit , brethren . amen .
in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth .
and god said , let there be light : and there was light .
and god saw the light , that it was good : and god divided the light from the darkness .
and god called the light day , and the darkness he called night . and there was evening and there was morning , one day .
and god said , let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters , and let it divide the waters from the waters .
and god made the firmament , and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament : and it was so .
and god called the firmament heaven . and there was evening and there was morning , a second day .
and god said , let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place , and let the dry land appear : and it was so .
and god called the dry land earth ; and the gathering together of the waters called he seas : and god saw that it was good .
and there was evening and there was morning , a third day .
and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth : and it was so .
and god set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth ,
and to rule over the day and over the night , and to divide the light from the darkness : and god saw that it was good .
and there was evening and there was morning , a fourth day .
and god said , let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures , and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven .
and god blessed them , saying , be fruitful , and multiply , and fill the waters in the seas , and let birds multiply on the earth .
and there was evening and there was morning , a fifth day .
and god created man in his own image , in the image of god created he him ; male and female created he them .
and the heavens and the earth were finished , and all the host of them .
and on the seventh day god finished his work which he had made ; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made .
and god blessed the seventh day , and hallowed it ; because that in it he rested from all his work which god had created and made .
these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that jehovah god made earth and heaven .
but there went up a mist from the earth , and watered the whole face of the ground .
and jehovah god formed man of the dust of the ground , and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living soul .
and jehovah god planted a garden eastward , in eden ; and there he put the man whom he had formed .
and a river went out of eden to water the garden ; and from thence it was parted , and became four heads .
the name of the first is pishon : that is it which compasseth the whole land of havilah , where there is gold ;
and the gold of that land is good : there is bdellium and the onyx stone .
and the name of the second river is gihon : the same is it that compasseth the whole land of cush .
and the name of the third river is hiddekel : that is it which goeth in front of assyria . and the fourth river is the euphrates .
and jehovah god took the man , and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it .
and jehovah god commanded the man , saying , of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat :
and jehovah god said , it is not good that the man should be alone ; i will make him a help meet for him .
and the rib , which jehovah god had taken from the man , made he a woman , and brought her unto the man .
therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh .
and they were both naked , the man and his wife , and were not ashamed .
and the woman said unto the serpent , of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat :
and the serpent said unto the woman , ye shall not surely die :
and the eyes of them both were opened , and they knew that they were naked ; and they sewed fig-leaves together , and made themselves aprons .
and jehovah god called unto the man , and said unto him , where art thou ?
and he said , i heard thy voice in the garden , and i was afraid , because i was naked ; and i hid myself .
and he said , who told thee that thou wast naked ? hast thou eaten of the tree , whereof i commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat ?
and the man said , the woman whom thou gavest to be with me , she gave me of the tree , and i did eat .
and jehovah god said unto the woman , what is this thou hast done ? and the woman said , the serpent beguiled me , and i did eat .
thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee ; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field ;
and the man called his wife ’ s name eve ; because she was the mother of all living .
and jehovah god made for adam and for his wife coats of skins , and clothed them .
therefore jehovah god sent him forth from the garden of eden , to till the ground from whence he was taken .
and the man knew eve his wife ; and she conceived , and bare cain , and said , i have gotten a man with the help of jehovah .
and again she bare his brother abel . and abel was a keeper of sheep , but cain was a tiller of the ground .
and in process of time it came to pass , that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto jehovah .
and abel , he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof . and jehovah had respect unto abel and to his offering :
but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect . and cain was very wroth , and his countenance fell .
and jehovah said unto cain , why art thou wroth ? and why is thy countenance fallen ?
and jehovah said unto cain , where is abel thy brother ? and he said , i know not : am i my brother ’ s keeper ?
and he said , what hast thou done ? the voice of thy brother ’ s blood crieth unto me from the ground .
and now cursed art thou from the ground , which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother ’ s blood from thy hand ;
when thou tillest the ground , it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength ; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth .
and cain said unto jehovah , my punishment is greater than i can bear .
and cain went out from the presence of jehovah , and dwelt in the land of nod , on the east of eden .
and unto enoch was born irad : and irad begat mehujael ; and mehujael begat methushael ; and methushael begat lamech .
and lamech took unto him two wives : the name of the one was adah , and the name of the other zillah .
and adah bare jabal : he was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle .
and his brother ’ s name was jubal : he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe .
and zillah , she also bare tubal-cain , the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron : and the sister of tubal-cain was naamah .
and lamech said unto his wives :
if cain shall be avenged sevenfold ,
this is the book of the generations of adam . in the day that god created man , in the likeness of god made he him ;
male and female created he them , and blessed them , and called their name adam , in the day when they were created .
and adam lived a hundred and thirty years , and begat a son in his own likeness , after his image ; and called his name seth :
and the days of adam after he begat seth were eight hundred years : and he begat sons and daughters .
and all the days that adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years : and he died .
and seth lived a hundred and five years , and begat enosh :
and seth lived after he begat enosh eight hundred and seven years , and begat sons and daughters :
and all the days of seth were nine hundred and twelve years : and he died .
and enosh lived ninety years , and begat kenan .
and enosh lived after he begat kenan eight hundred and fifteen years , and begat sons and daughters :
and all the days of enosh were nine hundred and five years : and he died .
and kenan lived seventy years , and begat mahalalel :
and kenan lived after he begat mahalalel eight hundred and forty years , and begat sons and daughters :
and all the days of kenan were nine hundred and ten years : and he died .
and mahalalel lived sixty and five years , and begat jared :
and mahalalel lived after he begat jared eight hundred and thirty years , and begat sons and daughters :
and all the days of mahalalel were eight hundred ninety and five years : and he died .
and jared lived a hundred sixty and two years , and begat enoch :
and jared lived after he begat enoch eight hundred years , and begat sons and daughters :
and all the days of jared were nine hundred sixty and two years : and he died .
and enoch lived sixty and five years , and begat methuselah :
and enoch walked with god after he begat methuselah three hundred years , and begat sons and daughters :
and all the days of enoch were three hundred sixty and five years :
and enoch walked with god : and he was not ; for god took him .
and methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years , and begat lamech :
and methuselah lived after he begat lamech seven hundred eighty and two years , and begat sons and daughters :
and all the days of methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years : and he died .
and lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years , and begat a son :
and lamech lived after he begat noah five hundred ninety and five years , and begat sons and daughters :
and all the days of lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years : and he died .
and noah was five hundred years old : and noah begat shem , ham , and japheth .
and it came to pass , when men began to multiply on the face of the ground , and daughters were born unto them ,
that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair ; and they took them wives of all that they chose .
and jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth , and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually .
and it repented jehovah that he had made man on the earth , and it grieved him at his heart .
but noah found favor in the eyes of jehovah .
these are the generations of noah . noah was a righteous man , and perfect in his generations : noah walked with god .
and noah begat three sons , shem , ham , and japheth .
and the earth was corrupt before god , and the earth was filled with violence .
and god saw the earth , and , behold , it was corrupt ; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth .
make thee an ark of gopher wood ; rooms shalt thou make in the ark , and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch .
thus did noah ; according to all that god commanded him , so did he .
and jehovah said unto noah , come thou and all thy house into the ark ; for thee have i seen righteous before me in this generation .
of the birds also of the heavens , seven and seven , male and female , to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth .
and noah did according unto all that jehovah commanded him .
and noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth .
of clean beasts , and of beasts that are not clean , and of birds , and of everything that creepeth upon the ground ,
there went in two and two unto noah into the ark , male and female , as god commanded noah .
and it came to pass after the seven days , that the waters of the flood were upon the earth .
and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights .
and they went in unto noah into the ark , two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life .
and they that went in , went in male and female of all flesh , as god commanded him : and jehovah shut him in .
and the flood was forty days upon the earth ; and the waters increased , and bare up the ark , and it was lifted up above the earth .
and the waters prevailed , and increased greatly upon the earth ; and the ark went upon the face of the waters .
and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth ; and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered .
fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail ; and the mountains were covered .
all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life , of all that was on the dry land , died .
and the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days .
the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped , and the rain from heaven was restrained ;
and the waters returned from off the earth continually : and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased .
and the ark rested in the seventh month , on the seventeenth day of the month , upon the mountains of ararat .
and it came to pass at the end of forty days , that noah opened the window of the ark which he had made :
and he sent forth a raven , and it went forth to and fro , until the waters were dried up from off the earth .
and he sent forth a dove from him , to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground ;
and he stayed yet other seven days ; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark ;
and he stayed yet other seven days , and sent forth the dove ; and she returned not again unto him any more .
and in the second month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , was the earth dry .
and god spake unto noah , saying ,
go forth from the ark , thou , and thy wife , and thy sons , and thy sons ’ wives with thee .
and noah went forth , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ’ wives with him :
every beast , every creeping thing , and every bird , whatsoever moveth upon the earth , after their families , went forth out of the ark .
and noah builded an altar unto jehovah , and took of every clean beast , and of every clean bird , and offered burnt-offerings on the altar .
while the earth remaineth , seedtime and harvest , and cold and heat , and summer and winter , and day and night shall not cease .
and god blessed noah and his sons , and said unto them , be fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the earth .
every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you ; as the green herb have i given you all .
but flesh with the life thereof , which is the blood thereof , shall ye not eat .
whoso sheddeth man ’ s blood , by man shall his blood be shed : for in the image of god made he man .
and you , be ye fruitful , and multiply ; bring forth abundantly in the earth , and multiply therein .
and god spake unto noah , and to his sons with him , saying ,
and i , behold , i establish my covenant with you , and with your seed after you ;
i do set my bow in the cloud , and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth .
and it shall come to pass , when i bring a cloud over the earth , that the bow shall be seen in the cloud ,
and god said unto noah , this is the token of the covenant which i have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth .
and the sons of noah , that went forth from the ark , were shem , and ham , and japheth : and ham is the father of canaan .
these three were the sons of noah : and of these was the whole earth overspread .
and noah began to be a husbandman , and planted a vineyard :
and he drank of the wine , and was drunken ; and he was uncovered within his tent .
and ham , the father of canaan , saw the nakedness of his father , and told his two brethren without .
and noah awoke from his wine , and knew what his youngest son had done unto him .
and noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years .
and all the days of noah were nine hundred and fifty years : and he died .
the sons of japheth : gomer , and magog , and madai , and javan , and tubal , and meshech , and tiras .
and the sons of gomer : ashkenaz , and riphath , and togarmah .
and the sons of javan : elishah , and tarshish , kittim , and dodanim .
of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands , every one after his tongue , after their families , in their nations .
and the sons of ham : cush , and mizraim , and put , and canaan .
and cush begat nimrod : he began to be a mighty one in the earth .
he was a mighty hunter before jehovah : wherefore it is said , like nimrod a mighty hunter before jehovah .
and the beginning of his kingdom was babel , and erech , and accad , and calneh , in the land of shinar .
out of that land he went forth into assyria , and builded nineveh , and rehoboth-ir , and calah ,
and resen between nineveh and calah ( the same is the great city ) .
and mizraim begat ludim , and anamim , and lehabim , and naphtuhim ,
and pathrusim , and casluhim ( whence went forth the philistines ) , and caphtorim .
and canaan begat sidon his first-born , and heth ,
and the jebusite , and the amorite , and the girgashite ,
and the hivite , and the arkite , and the sinite ,
and the arvadite , and the zemarite , and the hamathite : and afterward were the families of the canaanite spread abroad .
these are the sons of ham , after their families , after their tongues , in their lands , in their nations .
and unto shem , the father of all the children of eber , the elder brother of japheth , to him also were children born .
the sons of shem : elam , and asshur , and arpachshad , and lud , and aram .
and the sons of aram : uz , and hul , and gether , and mash .
and arpachshad begat shelah ; and shelah begat eber .
and joktan begat almodad , and sheleph , and hazarmaveth , and jerah ,
and hadoram , and uzal , and diklah ,
and obal , and abimael , and sheba ,
and ophir , and havilah , and jobab : all these were the sons of joktan .
and their dwelling was from mesha , as thou goest toward sephar , the mountain of the east .
these are the sons of shem , after their families , after their tongues , in their lands , after their nations .
and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech .
and it came to pass , as they journeyed east , that they found a plain in the land of shinar ; and they dwelt there .
and jehovah came down to see the city and the tower , which the children of men builded .
come , let us go down , and there confound their language , that they may not understand one another ’ s speech .
so jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth : and they left off building the city .
these are the generations of shem . shem was a hundred years old , and begat arpachshad two years after the flood :
and shem lived after he begat arpachshad five hundred years , and begat sons and daughters .
and arpachshad lived five and thirty years , and begat shelah :
and arpachshad lived after he begat shelah four hundred and three years , and begat sons and daughters .
and shelah lived thirty years , and begat eber :
and shelah lived after he begat eber four hundred and three years , and begat sons and daughters .
and eber lived four and thirty years , and begat peleg :
and eber lived after he begat peleg four hundred and thirty years , and begat sons and daughters .
and peleg lived thirty years , and begat reu :
and peleg lived after he begat reu two hundred and nine years , and begat sons and daughters .
and reu lived two and thirty years , and begat serug :
and reu lived after he begat serug two hundred and seven years , and begat sons and daughters .
and serug lived thirty years , and begat nahor :
and serug lived after he begat nahor two hundred years , and begat sons and daughters .
and nahor lived nine and twenty years , and begat terah :
and nahor lived after he begat terah a hundred and nineteen years , and begat sons and daughters .
and terah lived seventy years , and begat abram , nahor , and haran .
now these are the generations of terah . terah begat abram , nahor , and haran ; and haran begat lot .
and haran died before his father terah in the land of his nativity , in ur of the chaldees .
and sarai was barren ; she had no child .
and the days of terah were two hundred and five years : and terah died in haran .
and i will make of thee a great nation , and i will bless thee , and make thy name great ; and be thou a blessing :
and abram passed through the land unto the place of shechem , unto the oak of moreh . and the canaanite was then in the land .
and abram journeyed , going on still toward the south .
and there was a famine in the land : and abram went down into egypt to sojourn there ; for the famine was sore in the land .
and it came to pass , that , when abram was come into egypt , the egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair .
and the princes of pharaoh saw her , and praised her to pharaoh : and the woman was taken into pharaoh ’ s house .
and jehovah plagued pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of sarai , abram ’ s wife .
and pharaoh called abram , and said , what is this that thou hast done unto me ? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife ?
and pharaoh gave men charge concerning him : and they brought him on the way , and his wife , and all that he had .
and abram went up out of egypt , he , and his wife , and all that he had , and lot with him , into the south .
and abram was very rich in cattle , in silver , and in gold .
and he went on his journeys from the south even to beth-el , unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning , between beth-el and ai ,
unto the place of the altar , which he had made there at the first : and there abram called on the name of jehovah .
and lot also , who went with abram , had flocks , and herds , and tents .
and the land was not able to bear them , that they might dwell together : for their substance was great , so that they could not dwell together .
so lot chose him all the plain of the jordan ; and lot journeyed east : and they separated themselves the one from the other .
abram dwelt in the land of canaan , and lot dwelt in the cities of the plain , and moved his tent as far as sodom .
now the men of sodom were wicked and sinners against jehovah exceedingly .
for all the land which thou seest , to thee will i give it , and to thy seed for ever .
arise , walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it ; for unto thee will i give it .
and abram moved his tent , and came and dwelt by the oaks of mamre , which are in hebron , and built there an altar unto jehovah .
and it came to pass in the days of amraphel king of shinar , arioch king of ellasar , chedorlaomer king of elam , and tidal king of goiim ,
all these joined together in the vale of siddim ( the same is the salt sea ) .
twelve years they served chedorlaomer , and in the thirteenth year they rebelled .
and the horites in their mount seir , unto el-paran , which is by the wilderness .
against chedorlaomer king of elam , and tidal king of goiim , and amraphel king of shinar , and arioch king of ellasar ; four kings against the five .
and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah , and all their victuals , and went their way .
and they took lot , abram ’ s brother ’ s son , who dwelt in sodom , and his goods , and departed .
and he brought back all the goods , and also brought back his brother lot , and his goods , and the women also , and the people .
and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine : and he was priest of god most high .
and he blessed him , and said , blessed be abram of god most high , possessor of heaven and earth :
and blessed be god most high , who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand . and he gave him a tenth of all .
and the king of sodom said unto abram , give me the persons , and take the goods to thyself .
and abram said to the king of sodom , i have lifted up my hand unto jehovah , god most high , possessor of heaven and earth ,
that i will not take a thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine , lest thou shouldest say , i have made abram rich :
and abram said , behold , to me thou hast given no seed : and , lo , one born in my house is mine heir .
and he believed in jehovah ; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness .
and he said unto him , i am jehovah that brought thee out of ur of the chaldees , to give thee this land to inherit it .
and he said , o lord jehovah , whereby shall i know that i shall inherit it ?
and he took him all these , and divided them in the midst , and laid each half over against the other : but the birds divided he not .
and the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses , and abram drove them away .
and when the sun was going down , a deep sleep fell upon abram ; and , lo , a horror of great darkness fell upon him .
and also that nation , whom they shall serve , will i judge : and afterward shall they come out with great substance .
but thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace ; thou shalt be buried in a good old age .
and in the fourth generation they shall come hither again : for the iniquity of the amorite is not yet full .
the kenite , and the kenizzite , and the kadmonite ,
and the hittite , and the perizzite , and the rephaim ,
and the amorite , and the canaanite , and the girgashite , and the jebusite .
now sarai , abram ’ s wife , bare him no children : and she had a handmaid , an egyptian , whose name was hagar .
and he went in unto hagar , and she conceived : and when she saw that she had conceived , her mistress was despised in her eyes .
and the angel of jehovah found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain in the way to shur .
and the angel of jehovah said unto her , return to thy mistress , and submit thyself under her hands .
and the angel of jehovah said unto her , i will greatly multiply thy seed , that it shall not be numbered for multitude .
wherefore the well was called beer-lahai-roi ; behold , it is between kadesh and bered .
and hagar bare abram a son : and abram called the name of his son , whom hagar bare , ishmael .
and abram was fourscore and six years old , when hagar bare ishmael to abram .
and i will make my covenant between me and thee , and will multiply thee exceedingly .
and abram fell on his face : and god talked with him , saying ,
as for me , behold , my covenant is with thee , and thou shalt be the father of a multitude of nations .
neither shall thy name any more be called abram , but thy name shall be abraham ; for the father of a multitude of nations have i made thee .
and i will make thee exceeding fruitful , and i will make nations of thee , and kings shall come out of thee .
and god said unto abraham , and as for thee , thou shalt keep my covenant , thou , and thy seed after thee throughout their generations .
this is my covenant , which ye shall keep , between me and you and thy seed after thee : every male among you shall be circumcised .
and ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin ; and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt me and you .
and god said unto abraham , as for sarai thy wife , thou shalt not call her name sarai , but sarah shall her name be .
and abraham said unto god , oh that ishmael might live before thee !
but my covenant will i establish with isaac , whom sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year .
and he left off talking with him , and god went up from abraham .
and abraham was ninety years old and nine , when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin .
and ishmael his son was thirteen years old , when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin .
in the selfsame day was abraham circumcised , and ishmael his son .
and all the men of his house , those born in the house , and those bought with money of a foreigner , were circumcised with him .
and jehovah appeared unto him by the oaks of mamre , as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day ;
and said , my lord , if now i have found favor in thy sight , pass not away , i pray thee , from thy servant :
let now a little water be fetched , and wash your feet , and rest yourselves under the tree :
and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah , and said , make ready quickly three measures of fine meal , knead it , and make cakes .
and abraham ran unto the herd , and fetched a calf tender and good , and gave it unto the servant ; and he hasted to dress it .
and they said unto him , where is sarah thy wife ? and he said , behold , in the tent .
now abraham and sarah were old , and well stricken in age ; it had ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women .
and sarah laughed within herself , saying , after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure , my lord being old also ?
and jehovah said unto abraham , wherefore did sarah laugh , saying , shall i of a surety bear a child , who am old ?
is anything too hard for jehovah ? at the set time i will return unto thee , when the season cometh round , and sarah shall have a son .
then sarah denied , saying , i laughed not ; for she was afraid . and he said , nay ; but thou didst laugh .
and the men rose up from thence , and looked toward sodom : and abraham went with them to bring them on the way .
and jehovah said , shall i hide from abraham that which i do ;
seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation , and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him ?
and jehovah said , because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great , and because their sin is very grievous ;
and the men turned from thence , and went toward sodom : but abraham stood yet before jehovah .
and abraham drew near , and said , wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked ?
peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city : wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein ?
and jehovah said , if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city , then i will spare all the place for their sake .
and abraham answered and said , behold now , i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord , who am but dust and ashes :
and jehovah went his way , as soon as he had left off communing with abraham : and abraham returned unto his place .
and lot went out unto them to the door , and shut the door after him .
and he said , i pray you , my brethren , do not so wickedly .
but the men put forth their hand , and brought lot into the house to them , and shut to the door .
for we will destroy this place , because the cry of them is waxed great before jehovah ; and jehovah hath sent us to destroy it .
and lot said unto them , oh , not so , my lord :
and he said unto him , see , i have accepted thee concerning this thing also , that i will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken .
haste thee , escape thither ; for i can not do anything till thou be come thither . therefore the name of the city was called zoar .
the sun was risen upon the earth when lot came unto zoar .
then jehovah rained upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and fire from jehovah out of heaven ;
and he overthrew those cities , and all the plain , and all the inhabitants of the cities , and that which grew upon the ground .
but his wife looked back from behind him , and she became a pillar of salt .
and abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before jehovah :
come , let us make our father drink wine , and we will lie with him , that we may preserve seed of our father .
thus were both the daughters of lot with child by their father .
and the first-born bare a son , and called his name moab : the same is the father of the moabites unto this day .
and the younger , she also bare a son , and called his name ben-ammi : the same is the father of the children of ammon unto this day .
and abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the south , and dwelt between kadesh and shur ; and he sojourned in gerar .
and abraham said of sarah his wife , she is my sister : and abimelech king of gerar sent , and took sarah .
now abimelech had not come near her : and he said , lord , wilt thou slay even a righteous nation ?
and abimelech rose early in the morning , and called all his servants , and told all these things in their ears : and the men were sore afraid .
and abimelech said unto abraham , what sawest thou , that thou hast done this thing ?
and moreover she is indeed my sister , the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she became my wife :
and abimelech took sheep and oxen , and men-servants and women-servants , and gave them unto abraham , and restored him sarah his wife .
and abimelech said , behold , my land is before thee : dwell where it pleaseth thee .
and abraham prayed unto god : and god healed abimelech , and his wife , and his maid-servants ; and they bare children .
for jehovah had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of abimelech , because of sarah , abraham ’ s wife .
and jehovah visited sarah as he had said , and jehovah did unto sarah as he had spoken .
and sarah conceived , and bare abraham a son in his old age , at the set time of which god had spoken to him .
and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him , whom sarah bare to him , isaac .
and abraham circumcised his son isaac when he was eight days old , as god had commanded him .
and abraham was a hundred years old , when his son isaac was born unto him .
and sarah said , god hath made me to laugh ; every one that heareth will laugh with me .
and she said , who would have said unto abraham , that sarah should give children suck ? for i have borne him a son in his old age .
and the child grew , and was weaned : and abraham made a great feast on the day that isaac was weaned .
and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian , whom she had borne unto abraham , mocking .
and the thing was very grievous in abraham ’ s sight on account of his son .
and also of the son of the handmaid will i make a nation , because he is thy seed .
and the water in the bottle was spent , and she cast the child under one of the shrubs .
arise , lift up the lad , and hold him in thy hand ; for i will make him a great nation .
and god was with the lad , and he grew ; and he dwelt in the wilderness , and became , as he grew up , an archer .
and he dwelt in the wilderness of paran : and his mother took him a wife out of the land of egypt .
and abraham said , i will swear .
and abraham reproved abimelech because of the well of water , which abimelech ’ s servants had violently taken away .
and abimelech said , i know not who hath done this thing : neither didst thou tell me , neither yet heard i of it , but to-day .
and abraham took sheep and oxen , and gave them unto abimelech ; and they two made a covenant .
and abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves .
and abimelech said unto abraham , what mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves ?
wherefore he called that place beer-sheba ; because there they sware both of them .
and abraham planted a tamarisk tree in beer-sheba , and called there on the name of jehovah , the everlasting god .
and abraham sojourned in the land of the philistines many days .
and it came to pass after these things , that god did prove abraham , and said unto him , abraham ; and he said , here am i .
on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes , and saw the place afar off .
and abraham said , god will provide himself the lamb for a burnt-offering , my son : so they went both of them together .
and abraham stretched forth his hand , and took the knife to slay his son .
and the angel of jehovah called unto him out of heaven , and said , abraham , abraham : and he said , here am i .
and abraham called the name of that place jehovah-jireh : as it is said to this day , in the mount of jehovah it shall be provided .
and the angel of jehovah called unto abraham a second time out of heaven ,
and said , by myself have i sworn , saith jehovah , because thou hast done this thing , and hast not withheld thy son , thine only son ,
and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed ; because thou hast obeyed my voice .
so abraham returned unto his young men , and they rose up and went together to beer-sheba ; and abraham dwelt at beer-sheba .
uz his first-born , and buz his brother , and kemuel the father of aram ,
and chesed , and hazo , and pildash , and jidlaph , and bethuel .
and bethuel begat rebekah : these eight did milcah bear to nahor , abraham ’ s brother .
and his concubine , whose name was reumah , she also bare tebah , and gaham , and tahash , and maacah .
and the life of sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years : these were the years of the life of sarah .
and abraham rose up from before his dead , and spake unto the children of heth , saying ,
and the children of heth answered abraham , saying unto him ,
and abraham rose up , and bowed himself to the people of the land , even to the children of heth .
and abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land .
and ephron answered abraham , saying unto him ,
unto abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of heth , before all that went in at the gate of his city .
and the field , and the cave that is therein , were made sure unto abraham for a possession of a burying-place by the children of heth .
and abraham was old , and well stricken in age : and jehovah had blessed abraham in all things .
but thou shalt go unto my country , and to my kindred , and take a wife for my son isaac .
and abraham said unto him , beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again .
and the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master , and sware to him concerning this matter .
behold , i am standing by the fountain of water ; and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water :
and the servant ran to meet her , and said , give me to drink , i pray thee , a little water from thy pitcher .
and she said , drink , my lord : and she hasted , and let down her pitcher upon her hand , and gave him drink .
and when she had done giving him drink , she said , i will draw for thy camels also , until they have done drinking .
and she hasted , and emptied her pitcher into the trough , and ran again unto the well to draw , and drew for all his camels .
and the man looked stedfastly on her , holding his peace , to know whether jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not .
and said , whose daughter art thou ? tell me , i pray thee . is there room in thy father ’ s house for us to lodge in ?
and she said unto him , i am the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah , whom she bare unto nahor .
she said moreover unto him , we have both straw and provender enough , and room to lodge in .
and the man bowed his head , and worshipped jehovah .
and the damsel ran , and told her mother ’ s house according to these words .
and rebekah had a brother , and his name was laban : and laban ran out unto the man , unto the fountain .
and he said , come in , thou blessed of jehovah ; wherefore standest thou without ? for i have prepared the house , and room for the camels .
and he said , i am abraham ’ s servant .
and sarah my master ’ s wife bare a son to my master when she was old : and unto him hath he given all that he hath .
but thou shalt go unto my father ’ s house , and to my kindred , and take a wife for my son .
and i said unto my master , peradventure the woman will not follow me .
then laban and bethuel answered and said , the thing proceedeth from jehovah : we can not speak unto thee bad or good .
and it came to pass , that , when abraham ’ s servant heard their words , he bowed himself down to the earth unto jehovah .
and her brother and her mother said , let the damsel abide with us a few days , at the least ten ; after that she shall go .
and he said unto them , hinder me not , seeing jehovah hath prospered my way ; send me away that i may go to my master .
and they said , we will call the damsel , and inquire at her mouth .
and they called rebekah , and said unto her , wilt thou go with this man ? and she said , i will go .
and they sent away rebekah their sister , and her nurse , and abraham ’ s servant , and his men .
and isaac came from the way of beer-lahai-roi ; for he dwelt in the land of the south .
and rebekah lifted up her eyes , and when she saw isaac , she alighted from the camel .
and the servant told isaac all the things that he had done .
and abraham took another wife , and her name was keturah .
and she bare him zimran , and jokshan , and medan , and midian , and ishbak , and shuah .
and jokshan begat sheba , and dedan . and the sons of dedan were asshurim , and letushim , and leummim .
and the sons of midian : ephah , and epher , and hanoch , and abida , and eldaah . all these were the children of keturah .
and abraham gave all that he had unto isaac .
and these are the days of the years of abraham ’ s life which he lived , a hundred threescore and fifteen years .
the field which abraham purchased of the children of heth : there was abraham buried , and sarah his wife .
and it came to pass after the death of abraham , that god blessed isaac his son : and isaac dwelt by beer-lahai-roi .
now these are the generations of ishmael , abraham ’ s son , whom hagar the egyptian , sarah ’ s handmaid , bare unto abraham :
and mishma , and dumah , and massa ,
hadad , and tema , jetur , naphish , and kedemah :
these are the sons of ishmael , and these are their names , by their villages , and by their encampments ; twelve princes according to their nations .
and they dwelt from havilah unto shur that is before egypt , as thou goest toward assyria : he abode over against all his brethren .
and these are the generations of isaac , abraham ’ s son : abraham begat isaac :
and isaac entreated jehovah for his wife , because she was barren : and jehovah was entreated of him , and rebekah his wife conceived .
and the children struggled together within her ; and she said , if it be so , wherefore do i live ? and she went to inquire of jehovah .
and jehovah said unto her ,
and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled , behold , there were twins in her womb .
and the first came forth red , all over like a hairy garment ; and they called his name esau .
and the boys grew : and esau was a skilful hunter , a man of the field ; and jacob was a quiet man , dwelling in tents .
now isaac loved esau , because he did eat of his venison : and rebekah loved jacob .
and jacob boiled pottage : and esau came in from the field , and he was faint :
and jacob said , sell me first thy birthright .
and esau said , behold , i am about to die : and what profit shall the birthright do to me ?
and jacob said , swear to me first ; and he sware unto him : and he sold his birthright unto jacob .
and jehovah appeared unto him , and said , go not down into egypt ; dwell in the land which i shall tell thee of :
because that abraham obeyed my voice , and kept my charge , my commandments , my statutes , and my laws .
and isaac dwelt in gerar :
and abimelech charged all the people , saying , he that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death .
and isaac sowed in that land , and found in the same year a hundredfold : and jehovah blessed him .
and the man waxed great , and grew more and more until he became very great :
and he had possessions of flocks , and possessions of herds , and a great household : and the philistines envied him .
now all the wells which his father ’ s servants had digged in the days of abraham his father , the philistines had stopped , and filled with earth .
and abimelech said unto isaac , go from us ; for thou art much mightier than we .
and isaac departed thence , and encamped in the valley of gerar , and dwelt there .
and isaac ’ s servants digged in the valley , and found there a well of springing water .
and they digged another well , and they strove for that also : and he called the name of it sitnah .
and he went up from thence to beer-sheba .
then abimelech went to him from gerar , and ahuzzath his friend , and phicol the captain of his host .
and isaac said unto them , wherefore are ye come unto me , seeing ye hate me , and have sent me away from you ?
and he made them a feast , and they did eat and drink .
and they rose up betimes in the morning , and sware one to another : and isaac sent them away , and they departed from him in peace .
and he called it shibah : therefore the name of the city is beer-sheba unto this day .
and when esau was forty years old he took to wife judith the daughter of beeri the hittite , and basemath the daughter of elon the hittite :
and they were a grief of mind unto isaac and to rebekah .
and he said , behold now , i am old , i know not the day of my death .
now therefore take , i pray thee , thy weapons , thy quiver and thy bow , and go out to the field , and take me venison ;
and rebekah heard when isaac spake to esau his son . and esau went to the field to hunt for venison , and to bring it .
and rebekah spake unto jacob her son , saying , behold , i heard thy father speak unto esau thy brother , saying ,
bring me venison , and make me savory food , that i may eat , and bless thee before jehovah before my death .
now therefore , my son , obey my voice according to that which i command thee .
and thou shalt bring it to thy father , that he may eat , so that he may bless thee before his death .
and jacob said to rebekah his mother , behold , esau my brother is a hairy man , and i am a smooth man .
and his mother said unto him , upon me be thy curse , my son ; only obey my voice , and go fetch me them .
and he went , and fetched , and brought them to his mother : and his mother made savory food , such as his father loved .
and rebekah took the goodly garments of esau her elder son , which were with her in the house , and put them upon jacob her younger son ;
and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands , and upon the smooth of his neck :
and she gave the savory food and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son jacob .
and he came unto his father , and said , my father : and he said , here am i ; who art thou , my son ?
and he discerned him not , because his hands were hairy , as his brother esau ’ s hands : so he blessed him .
and he said , art thou my very son esau ? and he said , i am .
and his father isaac said unto him , come near now , and kiss me , my son .
and he came near , and kissed him : and he smelled the smell of his raiment , and blessed him , and said ,
and god give thee of the dew of heaven ,
let peoples serve thee ,
and isaac his father said unto him , who art thou ? and he said , i am thy son , thy first-born , esau .
and he said , thy brother came with guile , and hath taken away thy blessing .
and isaac his father answered and said unto him ,
and by thy sword shalt thou live , and thou shalt serve thy brother ;
now therefore , my son , obey my voice ; and arise , flee thou to laban my brother to haran ;
and tarry with him a few days , until thy brother ’ s fury turn away ;
and isaac called jacob , and blessed him , and charged him , and said unto him , thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan .
and god almighty bless thee , and make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , that thou mayest be a company of peoples ;
and that jacob obeyed his father and his mother , and was gone to paddan-aram :
and esau saw that the daughters of canaan pleased not isaac his father ;
and jacob went out from beer-sheba , and went toward haran .
and jacob awaked out of his sleep , and he said , surely jehovah is in this place ; and i knew it not .
and he called the name of that place beth-el : but the name of the city was luz at the first .
so that i come again to my father ’ s house in peace , and jehovah will be my god ,
then jacob went on his journey , and came to the land of the children of the east .
and jacob said unto them , my brethren , whence are ye ? and they said , of haran are we .
and he said unto them , know ye laban the son of nahor ? and they said , we know him .
while he was yet speaking with them , rachel came with her father ’ s sheep ; for she kept them .
and jacob kissed rachel , and lifted up his voice , and wept .
and jacob told rachel that he was her father ’ s brother , and that he was rebekah ’ s son : and she ran and told her father .
and laban said to him , surely thou art my bone and my flesh . and he abode with him the space of a month .
and laban said unto jacob , because thou art my brother , shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought ? tell me , what shall thy wages be ?
and laban had two daughters : the name of the elder was leah , and the name of the younger was rachel .
and leah ’ s eyes were tender ; but rachel was beautiful and well-favored .
and jacob loved rachel ; and he said , i will serve thee seven years for rachel thy younger daughter .
and laban said , it is better that i give her to thee , than that i should give her to another man : abide with me .
and jacob served seven years for rachel ; and they seemed unto him but a few days , for the love he had to her .
and jacob said unto laban , give me my wife , for my days are fulfilled , that i may go in unto her .
and laban gathered together all the men of the place , and made a feast .
and it came to pass in the evening , that he took leah his daughter , and brought her to him ; and he went in unto her .
and laban gave zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter leah for a handmaid .
and laban said , it is not so done in our place , to give the younger before the first-born .
fulfil the week of this one , and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years .
and jacob did so , and fulfilled her week : and he gave him rachel his daughter to wife .
and laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid .
and he went in also unto rachel , and he loved also rachel more than leah , and served with him yet seven other years .
and jehovah saw that leah was hated , and he opened her womb : but rachel was barren .
and she gave him bilhah her handmaid to wife : and jacob went in unto her .
and bilhah conceived , and bare jacob a son .
and rachel said , god hath judged me , and hath also heard my voice , and hath given me a son : therefore called she his name dan .
and bilhah rachel ’ s handmaid conceived again , and bare jacob a second son .
and rachel said , with mighty wrestlings have i wrestled with my sister , and have prevailed : and she called his name naphtali .
when leah saw that she had left off bearing , she took zilpah her handmaid , and gave her to jacob to wife .
and zilpah leah ’ s handmaid bare jacob a son .
and leah said , fortunate ! and she called his name gad .
and zilpah leah ’ s handmaid bare jacob a second son .
and leah said , happy am i ! for the daughters will call me happy : and she called his name asher .
and god hearkened unto leah , and she conceived , and bare jacob a fifth son .
and leah said , god hath given me my hire , because i gave my handmaid to my husband : and she called his name issachar .
and leah conceived again , and bare a sixth son to jacob .
and afterwards she bare a daughter , and called her name dinah .
and god remembered rachel , and god hearkened to her , and opened her womb .
and she conceived , and bare a son : and said , god hath taken away my reproach :
and she called his name joseph , saying , jehovah add to me another son .
give me my wives and my children for whom i have served thee , and let me go : for thou knowest my service wherewith i have served thee .
and he said , appoint me thy wages , and i will give it .
and he said unto him , thou knowest how i have served thee , and how thy cattle have fared with me .
and laban said , behold , i would it might be according to thy word .
and he set three days ’ journey betwixt himself and jacob : and jacob fed the rest of laban ’ s flocks .
and the flocks conceived before the rods , and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked , speckled , and spotted .
but when the flock were feeble , he put them not in : so the feebler were laban ’ s , and the stronger jacob ’ s .
and the man increased exceedingly , and had large flocks , and maid-servants and men-servants , and camels and asses .
and jacob beheld the countenance of laban , and , behold , it was not toward him as beforetime .
and jehovah said unto jacob , return unto the land of thy fathers , and to thy kindred ; and i will be with thee .
and jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field unto his flock ,
and ye know that with all my power i have served your father .
and your father hath deceived me , and changed my wages ten times ; but god suffered him not to hurt me .
thus god hath taken away the cattle of your father , and given them to me .
and the angel of god said unto me in the dream , jacob : and i said , here am i .
and rachel and leah answered and said unto him , is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father ’ s house ?
are we not accounted by him as foreigners ? for he hath sold us , and hath also quite devoured our money .
then jacob rose up , and set his sons and his wives upon the camels ;
now laban was gone to shear his sheep : and rachel stole the teraphim that were her father ’ s .
and jacob stole away unawares to laban the syrian , in that he told him not that he fled .
so he fled with all that he had ; and he rose up , and passed over the river , and set his face toward the mountain of gilead .
and it was told laban on the third day that jacob was fled .
and he took his brethren with him , and pursued after him seven days ’ journey ; and he overtook him in the mountain of gilead .
and laban came up with jacob . now jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain : and laban with his brethren encamped in the mountain of gilead .
and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters ? now hast thou done foolishly .
and now , though thou wouldest needs be gone , because thou sore longedst after thy father ’ s house , yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods ?
and jacob answered and said to laban , because i was afraid : for i said , lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force .
thus i was ; in the day the drought consumed me , and the frost by night ; and my sleep fled from mine eyes .
and now come , let us make a covenant , i and thou ; and let it be for a witness between me and thee .
and jacob took a stone , and set it up for a pillar .
and jacob said unto his brethren , gather stones ; and they took stones , and made a heap : and they did eat there by the heap .
and laban called it jegar-saha-dutha : but jacob called it galeed .
and laban said , this heap is witness between me and thee this day . therefore was the name of it called galeed :
and mizpah , for he said , jehovah watch between me and thee , when we are absent one from another .
and laban said to jacob , behold this heap , and behold the pillar , which i have set betwixt me and thee .
and jacob went on his way , and the angels of god met him .
and jacob said when he saw them , this is god ’ s host : and he called the name of that place mahanaim .
and jacob sent messengers before him to esau his brother unto the land of seir , the field of edom .
and he said , if esau come to the one company , and smite it , then the company which is left shall escape .
and thou saidst , i will surely do thee good , and make thy seed as the sand of the sea , which can not be numbered for multitude .
and he lodged there that night , and took of that which he had with him a present for esau his brother :
two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats , two hundred ewes and twenty rams ,
thirty milch camels and their colts , forty cows and ten bulls , twenty she-asses and ten foals .
so the present passed over before him : and he himself lodged that night in the company .
and he took them , and sent them over the stream , and sent over that which he had .
and jacob was left alone ; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day .
and he said , let me go , for the day breaketh . and he said , i will not let thee go , except thou bless me .
and he said unto him , what is thy name ? and he said , jacob .
and he said , thy name shall be called no more jacob , but israel : for thou hast striven with god and with men , and hast prevailed .
and jacob called the name of the place peniel : for , said he , i have seen god face to face , and my life is preserved .
and the sun rose upon him as he passed over penuel , and he limped upon his thigh .
and he put the handmaids and their children foremost , and leah and her children after , and rachel and joseph hindermost .
and he himself passed over before them , and bowed himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
and esau ran to meet him , and embraced him , and fell on his neck , and kissed him : and they wept .
then the handmaids came near , they and their children , and they bowed themselves .
and leah also and her children came near , and bowed themselves : and after came joseph near and rachel , and they bowed themselves .
and he said , what meanest thou by all this company which i met ? and he said , to find favor in the sight of my lord .
and esau said , i have enough , my brother ; let that which thou hast be thine .
and he said , let us take our journey , and let us go , and i will go before thee .
so esau returned that day on his way unto seir .
and jacob journeyed to succoth , and built him a house , and made booths for his cattle : therefore the name of the place is called succoth .
and he erected there an altar , and called it el-elohe-israel .
and dinah the daughter of leah , whom she bare unto jacob , went out to see the daughters of the land .
and his soul clave unto dinah the daughter of jacob , and he loved the damsel , and spake kindly unto the damsel .
and shechem spake unto his father hamor , saying , get me this damsel to wife .
and hamor the father of shechem went out unto jacob to commune with him .
and hamor communed with them , saying , the soul of my son shechem longeth for your daughter : i pray you , give her unto him to wife .
and make ye marriages with us ; give your daughters unto us , and take our daughters unto you .
and ye shall dwell with us : and the land shall be before you ; dwell and trade ye therein , and get you possessions therein .
and shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren , let me find favor in your eyes , and what ye shall say unto me i will give .
ask me never so much dowry and gift , and i will give according as ye shall say unto me : but give me the damsel to wife .
and the sons of jacob answered shechem and hamor his father with guile , and spake , because he had defiled dinah their sister ,
and said unto them , we can not do this thing , to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised ; for that were a reproach unto us .
only on this condition will we consent unto you : if ye will be as we are , that every male of you be circumcised ;
but if ye will not hearken unto us , to be circumcised ; then will we take our daughter , and we will be gone .
and their words pleased hamor , and shechem hamor ’ s son .
and hamor and shechem his son came unto the gate of their city , and communed with the men of their city , saying ,
shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours ? only let us consent unto them , and they will dwell with us .
and they slew hamor and shechem his son with the edge of the sword , and took dinah out of shechem ’ s house , and went forth .
the sons of jacob came upon the slain , and plundered the city , because they had defiled their sister .
they took their flocks and their herds and their asses , and that which was in the city , and that which was in the field ;
and all their wealth , and all their little ones and their wives , took they captive and made a prey , even all that was in the house .
and they said , should he deal with our sister as with a harlot ?
and they journeyed : and a terror of god was upon the cities that were round about them , and they did not pursue after the sons of jacob .
so jacob came to luz , which is in the land of canaan ( the same is beth-el ) , he and all the people that were with him .
and deborah rebekah ’ s nurse died , and she was buried below beth-el under the oak : and the name of it was called allon-bacuth .
and god appeared unto jacob again , when he came from paddan-aram , and blessed him .
and the land which i gave unto abraham and isaac , to thee i will give it , and to thy seed after thee will i give the land .
and god went up from him in the place where he spake with him .
and jacob called the name of the place where god spake with him , beth-el .
and they journeyed from beth-el ; and there was still some distance to come to ephrath : and rachel travailed , and she had hard labor .
and rachel died , and was buried in the way to ephrath ( the same is beth-lehem ) .
and jacob set up a pillar upon her grave : the same is the pillar of rachel ’ s grave unto this day .
and israel journeyed , and spread his tent beyond the tower of eder .
the sons of leah : reuben , jacob ’ s first-born , and simeon , and levi , and judah , and issachar , and zebulun ;
the sons of rachel : joseph and benjamin ;
and the sons of bilhah , rachel ’ s handmaid : dan and naphtali ;
and the sons of zilpah , leah ’ s handmaid : gad and asher : these are the sons of jacob , that were born to him in paddan-aram .
and jacob came unto isaac his father to mamre , to kiriath-arba ( the same is hebron ) , where abraham and isaac sojourned .
and the days of isaac were a hundred and fourscore years .
now these are the generations of esau ( the same is edom ) .
and basemath ishmael ’ s daughter , sister of nebaioth .
and adah bare to esau eliphaz ; and basemath bare reuel ;
and oholibamah bare jeush , and jalam , and korah : these are the sons of esau , that were born unto him in the land of canaan .
for their substance was too great for them to dwell together ; and the land of their sojournings could not bear them because of their cattle .
and esau dwelt in mount seir : esau is edom .
and these are the generations of esau the father of the edomites in mount seir :
these are the names of esau ’ s sons : eliphaz the son of adah the wife of esau , reuel the son of basemath the wife of esau .
and the sons of eliphaz were teman , omar , zepho , and gatam , and kenaz .
and timna was concubine to eliphaz esau ’ s son ; and she bare to eliphaz amalek : these are the sons of adah , esau ’ s wife .
and these are the sons of reuel : nahath , and zerah , shammah , and mizzah : these were the sons of basemath , esau ’ s wife .
chief korah , chief gatam , chief amalek : these are the chiefs that came of eliphaz in the land of edom ; these are the sons of adah .
these are the sons of esau , and these are their chiefs : the same is edom .
these are the sons of seir the horite , the inhabitants of the land : lotan and shobal and zibeon and anah ,
and dishon and ezer and dishan : these are the chiefs that came of the horites , the children of seir in the land of edom .
and the children of lotan were hori and heman ; and lotan ’ s sister was timna .
and these are the children of shobal : alvan and manahath and ebal , shepho and onam .
and these are the children of anah : dishon and oholibamah the daughter of anah .
and these are the children of dishon : hemdan and eshban and ithran and cheran .
these are the children of ezer : bilhan and zaavan and akan .
these are the children of dishan : uz and aran .
these are the chiefs that came of the horites : chief lotan , chief shobal , chief zibeon , chief anah ,
chief dishon , chief ezer , chief dishan : these are the chiefs that came of the horites , according to their chiefs in the land of seir .
and these are the kings that reigned in the land of edom , before there reigned any king over the children of israel .
and bela the son of beor reigned in edom ; and the name of his city was dinhabah .
and bela died , and jobab the son of zerah of bozrah reigned in his stead .
and jobab died , and husham of the land of the temanites reigned in his stead .
and hadad died , and samlah of masrekah reigned in his stead .
and samlah died , and shaul of rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead .
and shaul died , and baal-hanan the son of achbor reigned in his stead .
chief oholibamah , chief elah , chief pinon ,
chief kenaz , chief teman , chief mibzar ,
and jacob dwelt in the land of his father ’ s sojournings , in the land of canaan .
now israel loved joseph more than all his children , because he was the son of his old age : and he made him a coat of many colors .
and his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren ; and they hated him , and could not speak peaceably unto him .
and joseph dreamed a dream , and he told it to his brethren : and they hated him yet the more .
and he said unto them , hear , i pray you , this dream which i have dreamed :
and his brethren envied him ; but his father kept the saying in mind .
and his brethren went to feed their father ’ s flock in shechem .
and a certain man found him , and , behold , he was wandering in the field : and the man asked him , saying , what seekest thou ?
and he said , i am seeking my brethren : tell me , i pray thee , where they are feeding the flock .
and they saw him afar off , and before he came near unto them , they conspired against him to slay him .
and they said one to another , behold , this dreamer cometh .
and reuben heard it , and delivered him out of their hand , and said , let us not take his life .
and they took him , and cast him into the pit : and the pit was empty , there was no water in it .
and judah said unto his brethren , what profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood ?
and reuben returned unto the pit ; and , behold , joseph was not in the pit ; and he rent his clothes .
and he returned unto his brethren , and said , the child is not ; and i , whither shall i go ?
and they took joseph ’ s coat , and killed a he-goat , and dipped the coat in the blood ;
and jacob rent his garments , and put sackcloth upon his loins , and mourned for his son many days .
and the midianites sold him into egypt unto potiphar , an officer of pharaoh ’ s , the captain of the guard .
and it came to pass at that time , that judah went down from his brethren , and turned in to a certain adullamite , whose name was hirah .
and judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite whose name was shua ; and he took her , and went in unto her .
and she conceived , and bare a son ; and he called his name er .
and she conceived again , and bare a son ; and she called his name onan .
and she yet again bare a son , and called his name shelah : and he was at chezib , when she bare him .
and judah took a wife for er his first-born , and her name was tamar .
and er , judah ’ s first-born , was wicked in the sight of jehovah ; and jehovah slew him .
and the thing which he did was evil in the sight of jehovah : and he slew him also .
and it was told tamar , saying , behold , thy father-in-law goeth up to timnah to shear his sheep .
when judah saw her , he thought her to be a harlot ; for she had covered her face .
and she arose , and went away , and put off her veil from her , and put on the garments of her widowhood .
and it came to pass in the time of her travail , that , behold , twins were in her womb .
and afterward came out his brother , that had the scarlet thread upon his hand : and his name was called zerah .
and jehovah was with joseph , and he was a prosperous man ; and he was in the house of his master the egyptian .
and his master saw that jehovah was with him , and that jehovah made all that he did to prosper in his hand .
and it came to pass after these things , that his master ’ s wife cast her eyes upon joseph ; and she said , lie with me .
and it came to pass , when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand , and was fled forth ,
and she laid up his garment by her , until his master came home .
and it came to pass , as i lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment by me , and fled out .
but jehovah was with joseph , and showed kindness unto him , and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison .
and it came to pass after these things , that the butler of the king of egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of egypt .
and pharaoh was wroth against his two officers , against the chief of the butlers , and against the chief of the bakers .
and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard , into the prison , the place where joseph was bound .
and the captain of the guard charged joseph with them , and he ministered unto them : and they continued a season in ward .
and joseph came in unto them in the morning , and saw them , and , behold , they were sad .
and he asked pharaoh ’ s officers that were with him in ward in his master ’ s house , saying , wherefore look ye so sad to-day ?
and the chief butler told his dream to joseph , and said to him , in my dream , behold , a vine was before me ;
and joseph said unto him , this is the interpretation of it : the three branches are three days ;
for indeed i was stolen away out of the land of the hebrews : and here also have i done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon .
and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for pharaoh ; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head .
and joseph answered and said , this is the interpretation thereof : the three baskets are three days ;
and he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again ; and he gave the cup into pharaoh ’ s hand :
but he hanged the chief baker : as joseph had interpreted to them .
yet did not the chief butler remember joseph , but forgat him .
and it came to pass at the end of two full years , that pharaoh dreamed : and , behold , he stood by the river .
and , behold , there came up out of the river seven kine , well-favored and fat-fleshed ; and they fed in the reed-grass .
and the ill-favored and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven well-favored and fat kine . so pharaoh awoke .
and he slept and dreamed a second time : and , behold , seven ears of grain came up upon one stalk , rank and good .
and , behold , seven ears , thin and blasted with the east wind , sprung up after them .
and the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears . and pharaoh awoke , and , behold , it was a dream .
then spake the chief butler unto pharaoh , saying , i do remember my faults this day :
pharaoh was wroth with his servants , and put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guard , me and the chief baker :
and we dreamed a dream in one night , i and he ; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream .
and it came to pass , as he interpreted to us , so it was ; me he restored unto mine office , and him he hanged .
and joseph answered pharaoh , saying , it is not in me : god will give pharaoh an answer of peace .
and pharaoh spake unto joseph , in my dream , behold , i stood upon the brink of the river :
and , behold , there came up out of the river seven kine , fat-fleshed and well-favored ; and they fed in the reed-grass :
and the lean and ill-favored kine did eat up the first seven fat kine :
and i saw in my dream , and , behold , seven ears came up upon one stalk , full and good :
and , behold , seven ears , withered , thin , and blasted with the east wind , sprung up after them :
and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears : and i told it unto the magicians ; but there was none that could declare it to me .
and joseph said unto pharaoh , the dream of pharaoh is one : what god is about to do he hath declared unto pharaoh .
the seven good kine are seven years ; and the seven good ears are seven years : the dream is one .
that is the thing which i spake unto pharaoh : what god is about to do he hath showed unto pharaoh .
behold , there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt :
and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which followeth ; for it shall be very grievous .
and for that the dream was doubled unto pharaoh , it is because the thing is established by god , and god will shortly bring it to pass .
now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise , and set him over the land of egypt .
and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh , and in the eyes of all his servants .
and pharaoh said unto his servants , can we find such a one as this , a man in whom the spirit of god is ?
and pharaoh said unto joseph , forasmuch as god hath showed thee all this , there is none so discreet and wise as thou :
thou shalt be over my house , and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled : only in the throne will i be greater than thou .
and pharaoh said unto joseph , see , i have set thee over all the land of egypt .
and pharaoh said unto joseph , i am pharaoh , and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of egypt .
and in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls .
and joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea , very much , until he left off numbering ; for it was without number .
and unto joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came , whom asenath , the daughter of potiphera priest of on , bare unto him .
and the name of the second called he ephraim : for god hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction .
and the seven years of plenty , that was in the land of egypt , came to an end .
and all countries came into egypt to joseph to buy grain , because the famine was sore in all the earth .
now jacob saw that there was grain in egypt , and jacob said unto his sons , why do ye look one upon another ?
and joseph ’ s ten brethren went down to buy grain from egypt .
but benjamin , joseph ’ s brother , jacob sent not with his brethren ; for he said , lest peradventure harm befall him .
and the sons of israel came to buy among those that came : for the famine was in the land of canaan .
and joseph knew his brethren , but they knew not him .
and they said unto him , nay , my lord , but to buy food are thy servants come .
we are all one man ’ s sons ; we are true men , thy servants are no spies .
and he said unto them , nay , but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come .
and joseph said unto them , that is it that i spake unto you , saying , ye are spies :
hereby ye shall be proved : by the life of pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence , except your youngest brother come hither .
and he put them all together into ward three days .
and joseph said unto them the third day , this do , and live ; for i fear god :
if ye be true men , let one of your brethren be bound in your prison-house ; but go ye , carry grain for the famine of your houses :
and bring your youngest brother unto me ; so shall your words be verified , and ye shall not die . and they did so .
and they knew not that joseph understood them ; for there was an interpreter between them .
and they laded their asses with their grain , and departed thence .
and they came unto jacob their father unto the land of canaan , and told him all that had befallen them , saying ,
the man , the lord of the land , spake roughly with us , and took us for spies of the country .
and we said unto him , we are true men ; we are no spies :
we are twelve brethren , sons of our father ; one is not , and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of canaan .
and the famine was sore in the land .
if thou wilt send our brother with us , we will go down and buy thee food :
and israel said , wherefore dealt ye so ill with me , as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother ?
for except we had lingered , surely we had now returned a second time .
take also your brother , and arise , go again unto the man :
and the man did as joseph bade ; and the man brought the men to joseph ’ s house .
and they came near to the steward of joseph ’ s house , and they spake unto him at the door of the house ,
and said , oh , my lord , we came indeed down at the first time to buy food :
and other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food : we know not who put our money in our sacks .
and the man brought the men into joseph ’ s house , and gave them water , and they washed their feet ; and he gave their asses provender .
and they made ready the present against joseph ’ s coming at noon : for they heard that they should eat bread there .
and when joseph came home , they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house , and bowed down themselves to him to the earth .
and he asked them of their welfare , and said , is your father well , the old man of whom ye spake ? is he yet alive ?
and they said , thy servant our father is well , he is yet alive . and they bowed the head , and made obeisance .
and he washed his face , and came out ; and he refrained himself , and said , set on bread .
and they sat before him , the first-born according to his birthright , and the youngest according to his youth : and the men marvelled one with another .
as soon as the morning was light , the men were sent away , they and their asses .
is not this that in which my lord drinketh , and whereby he indeed divineth ? ye have done evil in so doing .
and he overtook them , and he spake unto them these words .
and they said unto him , wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these ? far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing .
with whomsoever of thy servants it be found , let him die , and we also will be my lord ’ s bondmen .
then they hasted , and took down every man his sack to the ground , and opened every man his sack .
and he searched , and began at the eldest , and left off at the youngest : and the cup was found in benjamin ’ s sack .
then they rent their clothes , and laded every man his ass , and returned to the city .
and judah and his brethren came to joseph ’ s house ; and he was yet there : and they fell before him on the ground .
and joseph said unto them , what deed is this that ye have done ? know ye not that such a man as i can indeed divine ?
my lord asked his servants , saying , have ye a father , or a brother ?
and thou saidst unto thy servants , bring him down unto me , that i may set mine eyes upon him .
and we said unto my lord , the lad can not leave his father : for if he should leave his father , his father would die .
and thou saidst unto thy servants , except your youngest brother come down with you , ye shall see my face no more .
and it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father , we told him the words of my lord .
and our father said , go again , buy us a little food .
and thy servant my father said unto us , ye know that my wife bare me two sons :
and the one went out from me , and i said , surely he is torn in pieces ; and i have not seen him since :
and if ye take this one also from me , and harm befall him , ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to sheol .
for how shall i go up to my father , if the lad be not with me ? lest i see the evil that shall come on my father .
and he wept aloud : and the egyptians heard , and the house of pharaoh heard .
and now be not grieved , nor angry with yourselves , that ye sold me hither : for god did send me before you to preserve life .
for these two years hath the famine been in the land : and there are yet five years , in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest .
and god sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth , and to save you alive by a great deliverance .
and , behold , your eyes see , and the eyes of my brother benjamin , that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you .
and he fell upon his brother benjamin ’ s neck , and wept ; and benjamin wept upon his neck .
and he kissed all his brethren , and wept upon them : and after that his brethren talked with him .
and pharaoh said unto joseph , say unto thy brethren , this do ye : lade your beasts , and go , get you unto the land of canaan ;
also regard not your stuff ; for the good of all the land of egypt is yours .
and the sons of israel did so : and joseph gave them wagons , according to the commandment of pharaoh , and gave them provision for the way .
to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment ; but to benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver , and five changes of raiment .
so he sent his brethren away , and they departed : and he said unto them , see that ye fall not out by the way .
and they went up out of egypt , and came into the land of canaan unto jacob their father .
and israel said , it is enough ; joseph my son is yet alive : i will go and see him before i die .
and israel took his journey with all that he had , and came to beer-sheba , and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father isaac .
and god spake unto israel in the visions of the night , and said , jacob , jacob . and he said , here am i .
i will go down with thee into egypt ; and i will also surely bring thee up again : and joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes .
and these are the names of the children of israel , who came into egypt , jacob and his sons : reuben , jacob ’ s first-born .
and the sons of reuben : hanoch , and pallu , and hezron , and carmi .
and the sons of simeon : jemuel , and jamin , and ohad , and jachin , and zohar , and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman .
and the sons of levi : gershon , kohath , and merari .
and the sons of issachar : tola , and puvah , and iob , and shimron .
and the sons of zebulun : sered , and elon , and jahleel .
and the sons of gad : ziphion , and haggi , shuni , and ezbon , eri , and arodi , and areli .
these are the sons of zilpah , whom laban gave to leah his daughter ; and these she bare unto jacob , even sixteen souls .
the sons of rachel jacob ’ s wife : joseph and benjamin .
and unto joseph in the land of egypt were born manasseh and ephraim , whom asenath , the daughter of poti-phera priest of on , bare unto him .
these are the sons of rachel , who were born to jacob : all the souls were fourteen .
and the sons of dan : hushim .
and the sons of naphtali : jahzeel , and guni , and jezer , and shillem .
these are the sons of bilhah , whom laban gave unto rachel his daughter , and these she bare unto jacob : all the souls were seven .
and he sent judah before him unto joseph , to show the way before him unto goshen ; and they came into the land of goshen .
and israel said unto joseph , now let me die , since i have seen thy face , that thou art yet alive .
and it shall come to pass , when pharaoh shall call you , and shall say , what is your occupation ?
and from among his brethren he took five men , and presented them unto pharaoh .
and pharaoh said unto his brethren , what is your occupation ? and they said unto pharaoh , thy servants are shepherds , both we , and our fathers .
and pharaoh spake unto joseph , saying , thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee :
and joseph brought in jacob his father , and set him before pharaoh : and jacob blessed pharaoh .
and pharaoh said unto jacob , how many are the days of the years of thy life ?
and jacob blessed pharaoh , and went out from the presence of pharaoh .
and joseph nourished his father , and his brethren , and all his father ’ s household , with bread , according to their families .
and joseph said , give your cattle ; and i will give you for your cattle , if money fail .
and as for the people , he removed them to the cities from one end of the border of egypt even to the other end thereof .
and they said , thou hast saved our lives : let us find favor in the sight of my lord , and we will be pharaoh ’ s servants .
and israel dwelt in the land of egypt , in the land of goshen ; and they gat them possessions therein , and were fruitful , and multiplied exceedingly .
and he said , swear unto me : and he sware unto him . and israel bowed himself upon the bed ’ s head .
and one told jacob , and said , behold , thy son joseph cometh unto thee : and israel strengthened himself , and sat upon the bed .
and jacob said unto joseph , god almighty appeared unto me at luz in the land of canaan , and blessed me ,
and thy issue , that thou begettest after them , shall be thine ; they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance .
and israel beheld joseph ’ s sons , and said , who are these ?
and israel said unto joseph , i had not thought to see thy face : and , lo , god hath let me see thy seed also .
and joseph brought them out from between his knees ; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth .
and joseph said unto his father , not so , my father ; for this is the first-born ; put thy right hand upon his head .
and israel said unto joseph , behold , i die : but god will be with you , and bring you again unto the land of your fathers .
moreover i have given to thee one portion above thy brethren , which i took out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow .
and jacob called unto his sons , and said : gather yourselves together , that i may tell you that which shall befall you in the latter days .
assemble yourselves , and hear , ye sons of jacob ;
reuben , thou art my first-born , my might , and the beginning of my strength ;
boiling over as water , thou shalt not have the pre-eminence ;
simeon and levi are brethren ;
o my soul , come not thou into their council ;
cursed be their anger , for it was fierce ;
judah , thee shall thy brethren praise :
judah is a lion ’ s whelp ;
the sceptre shall not depart from judah ,
binding his foal unto the vine ,
his eyes shall be red with wine ,
zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea ;
issachar is a strong ass ,
and he saw a resting-place that it was good ,
dan shall judge his people ,
dan shall be a serpent in the way ,
i have waited for thy salvation , o jehovah .
gad , a troop shall press upon him ;
out of asher his bread shall be fat ,
naphtali is a hind let loose :
joseph is a fruitful bough ,
the archers have sorely grieved him ,
but his bow abode in strength ,
even by the god of thy father , who shall help thee ,
the blessings of thy father
benjamin is a wolf that raveneth :
there they buried abraham and sarah his wife ; there they buried isaac and rebekah his wife ; and there i buried leah—
the field and the cave that is therein , which was purchased from the children of heth .
and joseph fell upon his father ’ s face , and wept upon him , and kissed him .
and joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father : and the physicians embalmed israel .
and forty days were fulfilled for him ; for so are fulfilled the days of embalming : and the egyptians wept for him three-score and ten days .
and pharaoh said , go up , and bury thy father , according as he made thee swear .
and there went up with him both chariots and horsemen : and it was a very great company .
and his sons did unto him according as he commanded them :
and they sent a message unto joseph , saying , thy father did command before he died , saying ,
and his brethren also went and fell down before his face ; and they said , behold , we are thy servants .
and joseph said unto them , fear not : for am i in the place of god ?
now therefore fear ye not : i will nourish you , and your little ones . and he comforted them , and spake kindly unto them .
and joseph dwelt in egypt , he , and his father ’ s house : and joseph lived a hundred and ten years .
and joseph saw ephraim ’ s children of the third generation : the children also of machir the son of manasseh were born upon joseph ’ s knees .
and joseph took an oath of the children of israel , saying , god will surely visit you , and ye shall carry up my bones from hence .
so joseph died , being a hundred and ten years old : and they embalmed him , and he was put in a coffin in egypt .
the burden which habakkuk the prophet did see .
o jehovah , how long shall i cry , and thou wilt not hear ? i cry out unto thee of violence , and thou wilt not save .
why dost thou show me iniquity , and look upon perverseness ? for destruction and violence are before me ; and there is strife , and contention riseth up .
therefore the law is slacked , and justice doth never go forth ; for the wicked doth compass about the righteous ; therefore justice goeth forth perverted .
they are terrible and dreadful ; their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves .
they come all of them for violence ; the set of their faces is forwards ; and they gather captives as the sand .
yea , he scoffeth at kings , and princes are a derision unto him ; he derideth every stronghold ; for he heapeth up dust , and taketh it .
then shall he sweep by as a wind , and shall pass over , and be guilty , even he whose might is his god .
and makest men as the fishes of the sea , as the creeping things , that have no ruler over them ?
therefore he sacrificeth unto his net , and burneth incense unto his drag ; because by them his portion is fat , and his food plenteous .
shall he therefore empty his net , and spare not to slay the nations continually ?
and jehovah answered me , and said , write the vision , and make it plain upon tablets , that he may run that readeth it .
behold , his soul is puffed up , it is not upright in him ; but the righteous shall live by his faith .
shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee , and awake that shall vex thee , and thou shalt be for booty unto them ?
thou hast devised shame to thy house , by cutting off many peoples , and hast sinned against thy soul .
for the stone shall cry out of the wall , and the beam out of the timber shall answer it .
woe to him that buildeth a town with blood , and establisheth a city by iniquity !
behold , is it not of jehovah of hosts that the peoples labor for the fire , and the nations weary themselves for vanity ?
for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of jehovah , as the waters cover the sea .
woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink , to thee that addest thy venom , and makest him drunken also , that thou mayest look on their nakedness !
but jehovah is in his holy temple : let all the earth keep silence before him .
a prayer of habakkuk the prophet , set to shigionoth .
o jehovah , i have heard the report of thee , and am afraid :
god came from teman ,
and his brightness was as the light ;
before him went the pestilence ,
he stood , and measured the earth ;
i saw the tents of cushan in affliction ;
was jehovah displeased with the rivers ?
thy bow was made quite bare ;
the mountains saw thee , and were afraid ;
the sun and moon stood still in their habitation ,
thou didst march through the land in indignation ;
thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people ,
thou didst pierce with his own staves the head of his warriors :
thou didst tread the sea with thy horses ,
i heard , and my body trembled ,
for though the fig-tree shall not flourish ,
yet i will rejoice in jehovah ,
jehovah , the lord , is my strength ;
then came the word of jehovah by haggai the prophet , saying ,
is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your ceiled houses , while this house lieth waste ?
now therefore thus saith jehovah of hosts : consider your ways .
thus saith jehovah of hosts : consider your ways .
therefore for your sake the heavens withhold the dew , and the earth withholdeth its fruit .
then spake haggai jehovah ’ s messenger in jehovah ’ s message unto the people , saying , i am with you , saith jehovah .
in the four and twentieth day of the month , in the sixth month , in the second year of darius the king .
in the seventh month , in the one and twentieth day of the month , came the word of jehovah by haggai the prophet , saying ,
according to the word that i covenanted with you when ye came out of egypt , and my spirit abode among you : fear ye not .
the silver is mine , and the gold is mine , saith jehovah of hosts .
in the four and twentieth day of the ninth month , in the second year of darius , came the word of jehovah by haggai the prophet , saying ,
thus saith jehovah of hosts : ask now the priests concerning the law , saying ,
and now , i pray you , consider from this day and backward , before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of jehovah .
i smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your hands ; yet ye turned not to me , saith jehovah .
and the word of jehovah came the second time unto haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month , saying ,
speak to zerubbabel , governor of judah , saying , i will shake the heavens and the earth ;
god , having of old time spoken unto the fathers in the prophets by divers portions and in divers manners ,
hath at the end of these days spoken unto us in his son , whom he appointed heir of all things , through whom also he made the worlds ;
having become by so much better than the angels , as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they .
for unto which of the angels said he at any time ,
and when he again bringeth in the firstborn into the world he saith , and let all the angels of god worship him .
and of the angels he saith ,
but of the son he saith ,
thou hast loved righteousness , and hated iniquity ;
they shall perish ; but thou continuest :
and as a mantle shalt thou roll them up ,
but of which of the angels hath he said at any time ,
are they not all ministering spirits , sent forth to do service for the sake of them that shall inherit salvation ?
therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things that were heard , lest haply we drift away from them .
for if the word spoken through angels proved stedfast , and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward ;
for not unto angels did he subject the world to come , whereof we speak .
but one hath somewhere testified , saying ,
thou madest him a little lower than the angels ;
thou didst put all things in subjection under his feet .
for both he that sanctifieth and they that are sanctified are all of one : for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren ,
and again , i will put my trust in him . and again , behold , i and the children whom god hath given me .
and might deliver all them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage .
for verily not to angels doth he give help , but he giveth help to the seed of abraham .
for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted , he is able to succor them that are tempted .
wherefore , holy brethren , partakers of a heavenly calling , consider the apostle and high priest of our confession , even jesus ;
who was faithful to him that appointed him , as also was moses in all his house .
for he hath been counted worthy of more glory than moses , by so much as he that built the house hath more honor than the house .
for every house is builded by some one ; but he that built all things is god .
and moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant , for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken ;
wherefore , even as the holy spirit saith ,
harden not your hearts , as in the provocation ,
where your fathers tried me by proving me ,
wherefore i was displeased with this generation ,
as i sware in my wrath ,
take heed , brethren , lest haply there shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief , in falling away from the living god :
but exhort one another day by day , so long as it is called to-day ; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin :
for we are become partakers of christ , if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end :
while it is said ,
for who , when they heard , did provoke ? nay , did not all they that came out of egypt by moses ?
and with whom was he displeased forty years ? was it not with them that sinned , whose bodies fell in the wilderness ?
and to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest , but to them that were disobedient ?
and we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief .
for we who have believed do enter into that rest ; even as he hath said ,
for he hath said somewhere of the seventh day on this wise , and god rested on the seventh day from all his works ;
and in this place again ,
seeing therefore it remaineth that some should enter thereinto , and they to whom the good tidings were before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience ,
he again defineth a certain day , to-day , saying in david so long a time afterward ( even as hath been said before ) ,
for if joshua had given them rest , he would not have spoken afterward of another day .
there remaineth therefore a sabbath rest for the people of god .
for he that is entered into his rest hath himself also rested from his works , as god did from his .
let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest , that no man fall after the same example of disobedience .
having then a great high priest , who hath passed through the heavens , jesus the son of god , let us hold fast our confession .
who can bear gently with the ignorant and erring , for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity ;
and by reason thereof is bound , as for the people , so also for himself , to offer for sins .
and no man taketh the honor unto himself , but when he is called of god , even as was aaron .
so christ also glorified not himself to be made a high priest , but he that spake unto him ,
as he saith also in another place ,
though he was a son , yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered ;
and having been made perfect , he became unto all them that obey him the author of eternal salvation ;
named of god a high priest after the order of melchizedek .
of whom we have many things to say , and hard of interpretation , seeing ye are become dull of hearing .
for every one that partaketh of milk is without experience of the word of righteousness ; for he is a babe .
but solid food is for fullgrown men , even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil .
of the teaching of baptisms , and of laying on of hands , and of resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment .
and this will we do , if god permit .
for as touching those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift , and were made partakers of the holy spirit ,
and tasted the good word of god , and the powers of the age to come ,
but if it beareth thorns and thistles , it is rejected and nigh unto a curse ; whose end is to be burned .
but , beloved , we are persuaded better things of you , and things that accompany salvation , though we thus speak :
and we desire that each one of you may show the same diligence unto the fulness of hope even to the end :
that ye be not sluggish , but imitators of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises .
for when god made promise to abraham , since he could swear by none greater , he sware by himself ,
saying , surely blessing i will bless thee , and multiplying i will multiply thee .
and thus , having patiently endured , he obtained the promise .
for men swear by the greater : and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation .
wherein god , being minded to show more abundantly unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel , interposed with an oath ;
which we have as an anchor of the soul , a hope both sure and stedfast and entering into that which is within the veil ;
whither as a forerunner jesus entered for us , having become a high priest for ever after the order of melchizedek .
for this melchizedek , king of salem , priest of god most high , who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him ,
now consider how great this man was , unto whom abraham , the patriarch , gave a tenth out of the chief spoils .
but he whose genealogy is not counted from them hath taken tithes of abraham , and hath blessed him that hath the promises .
but without any dispute the less is blessed of the better .
and here men that die receive tithes ; but there one , of whom it is witnessed that he liveth .
and , so to say , through abraham even levi , who receiveth tithes , hath paid tithes ;
for he was yet in the loins of his father , when melchizedek met him .
for the priesthood being changed , there is made of necessity a change also of the law .
for he of whom these things are said belongeth to another tribe , from which no man hath given attendance at the altar .
for it is evident that our lord hath sprung out of judah ; as to which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priests .
and what we say is yet more abundantly evident , if after the likeness of melchizedek there ariseth another priest ,
who hath been made , not after the law of a carnal commandment , but after the power of an endless life :
for it is witnessed of him ,
for there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness
( for the law made nothing perfect ) , and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope , through which we draw nigh unto god .
and inasmuch as it is not without the taking of an oath
( for they indeed have been made priests without an oath ; but he with an oath by him that saith of him ,
by so much also hath jesus become the surety of a better covenant .
and they indeed have been made priests many in number , because that by death they are hindered from continuing :
but he , because he abideth for ever , hath his priesthood unchangeable .
wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that draw near unto god through him , seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them .
for such a high priest became us , holy , guileless , undefiled , separated from sinners , and made higher than the heavens ;
a minister of the sanctuary , and of the true tabernacle , which the lord pitched , not man .
for every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices : wherefore it is necessary that this high priest also have somewhat to offer .
now if he were on earth , he would not be a priest at all , seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law ;
for if that first covenant had been faultless , then would no place have been sought for a second .
for finding fault with them , he saith ,
not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers
for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel
and they shall not teach every man his fellow-citizen ,
for i will be merciful to their iniquities ,
now even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service , and its sanctuary , a sanctuary of this world .
for there was a tabernacle prepared , the first , wherein were the candlestick , and the table , and the showbread ; which is called the holy place .
and after the second veil , the tabernacle which is called the holy of holies ;
and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat ; of which things we can not now speak severally .
now these things having been thus prepared , the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle , accomplishing the services ;
the holy spirit this signifying , that the way into the holy place hath not yet been made manifest , while the first tabernacle is yet standing ;
being only ( with meats and drinks and divers washings ) carnal ordinances , imposed until a time of reformation .
for if the blood of goats and bulls , and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling them that have been defiled , sanctify unto the cleanness of the flesh :
for where a testament is , there must of necessity be the death of him that made it .
for a testament is of force where there hath been death : for it doth never avail while he that made it liveth .
wherefore even the first covenant hath not been dedicated without blood .
saying , this is the blood of the covenant which god commanded to you-ward .
moreover the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry he sprinkled in like manner with the blood .
and according to the law , i may almost say , all things are cleansed with blood , and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission .
it was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest entereth into the holy place year by year with blood not his own ;
and inasmuch as it is appointed unto men once to die , and after this cometh judgment ;
else would they not have ceased to be offered ? because the worshippers , having been once cleansed , would have had no more consciousness of sins .
but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance made of sins year by year .
for it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins .
wherefore when he cometh into the world , he saith ,
in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hadst no pleasure :
then said i , lo , i am come ( in the roll of the book it is written of me )
then hath he said , lo , i am come to do thy will . he taketh away the first , that he may establish the second .
by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all .
and every priest indeed standeth day by day ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices , the which can never take away sins :
but he , when he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever , sat down on the right hand of god ;
henceforth expecting till his enemies be made the footstool of his feet .
for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified .
and the holy spirit also beareth witness to us ; for after he hath said ,
this is the covenant that i will make with them
and their sins and their iniquities will i remember no more .
now where remission of these is , there is no more offering for sin .
having therefore , brethren , boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of jesus ,
by the way which he dedicated for us , a new and living way , through the veil , that is to say , his flesh ;
and having a great priest over the house of god ;
let us hold fast the confession of our hope that it waver not ; for he is faithful that promised :
and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works ;
for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth , there remaineth no more a sacrifice for sins ,
but a certain fearful expectation of judgment , and a fierceness of fire which shall devour the adversaries .
a man that hath set at nought moses ’ law dieth without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses :
for we know him that said , vengeance belongeth unto me , i will recompense . and again , the lord shall judge his people .
it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god .
but call to remembrance the former days , in which , after ye were enlightened , ye endured a great conflict of sufferings ;
partly , being made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions ; and partly , becoming partakers with them that were so used .
cast not away therefore your boldness , which hath great recompense of reward .
for ye have need of patience , that , having done the will of god , ye may receive the promise .
for yet a very little while ,
but my righteous one shall live by faith :
but we are not of them that shrink back unto perdition ; but of them that have faith unto the saving of the soul .
now faith is assurance of things hoped for , a conviction of things not seen .
for therein the elders had witness borne to them .
for he looked for the city which hath the foundations , whose builder and maker is god .
by faith even sarah herself received power to conceive seed when she was past age , since she counted him faithful who had promised :
for they that say such things make it manifest that they are seeking after a country of their own .
and if indeed they had been mindful of that country from which they went out , they would have had opportunity to return .
by faith abraham , being tried , offered up isaac : yea , he that had gladly received the promises was offering up his only begotten son ;
even he to whom it was said , in isaac shall thy seed be called :
accounting that god is able to raise up , even from the dead ; from whence he did also in a figure receive him back .
by faith isaac blessed jacob and esau , even concerning things to come .
by faith jacob , when he was dying , blessed each of the sons of joseph ; and worshipped , leaning upon the top of his staff .
by faith joseph , when his end was nigh , made mention of the departure of the children of israel ; and gave commandment concerning his bones .
by faith moses , when he was grown up , refused to be called the son of pharaoh ’ s daughter ;
choosing rather to share ill treatment with the people of god , than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season ;
accounting the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures of egypt : for he looked unto the recompense of reward .
by faith he forsook egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king : for he endured , as seeing him who is invisible .
by faith he kept the passover , and the sprinkling of the blood , that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them .
by faith they passed through the red sea as by dry land : which the egyptians assaying to do were swallowed up .
by faith the walls of jericho fell down , after they had been compassed about for seven days .
by faith rahab the harlot perished not with them that were disobedient , having received the spies with peace .
who through faith subdued kingdoms , wrought righteousness , obtained promises , stopped the mouths of lions ,
women received their dead by a resurrection : and others were tortured , not accepting their deliverance ; that they might obtain a better resurrection :
and others had trial of mockings and scourgings , yea , moreover of bonds and imprisonment :
( of whom the world was not worthy ) , wandering in deserts and mountains and caves , and the holes of the earth .
and these all , having had witness borne to them through their faith , received not the promise ,
god having provided some better thing concerning us , that apart from us they should not be made perfect .
for consider him that hath endured such gainsaying of sinners against himself , that ye wax not weary , fainting in your souls .
ye have not yet resisted unto blood , striving against sin :
and ye have forgotten the exhortation which reasoneth with you as with sons ,
for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth ,
it is for chastening that ye endure ; god dealeth with you as with sons ; for what son is there whom his father chasteneth not ?
but if ye are without chastening , whereof all have been made partakers , then are ye bastards , and not sons .
for they indeed for a few days chastened us as seemed good to them ; but he for our profit , that we may be partakers of his holiness .
wherefore lift up the hands that hang down , and the palsied knees ;
and make straight paths for your feet , that that which is lame be not turned out of the way , but rather be healed .
follow after peace with all men , and the sanctification without which no man shall see the lord :
lest there be any fornicator , or profane person , as esau , who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright .
for ye are not come unto a mount that might be touched , and that burned with fire , and unto blackness , and darkness , and tempest ,
and the sound of a trumpet , and the voice of words ; which voice they that heard entreated that no word more should be spoken unto them ;
for they could not endure that which was enjoined , if even a beast touch the mountain , it shall be stoned ;
and so fearful was the appearance , that moses said , i exceedingly fear and quake :
but ye are come unto mount zion , and unto the city of the living god , the heavenly jerusalem , and to innumerable hosts of angels ,
and to jesus the mediator of a new covenant , and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better than that of abel .
wherefore , receiving a kingdom that can not be shaken , let us have grace , whereby we may offer service well-pleasing to god with reverence and awe :
for our god is a consuming fire .
let love of the brethren continue .
forget not to show love unto strangers : for thereby some have entertained angels unawares .
remember them that are in bonds , as bound with them ; them that are ill-treated , as being yourselves also in the body .
let marriage be had in honor among all , and let the bed be undefiled : for fornicators and adulterers god will judge .
so that with good courage we say ,
jesus christ is the same yesterday and to-day , yea and for ever .
we have an altar , whereof they have no right to eat that serve the tabernacle .
for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin , are burned without the camp .
wherefore jesus also , that he might sanctify the people through his own blood , suffered without the gate .
let us therefore go forth unto him without the camp , bearing his reproach .
for we have not here an abiding city , but we seek after the city which is to come .
through him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to god continually , that is , the fruit of lips which make confession to his name .
but to do good and to communicate forget not : for with such sacrifices god is well pleased .
pray for us : for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience , desiring to live honorably in all things .
and i exhort you the more exceedingly to do this , that i may be restored to you the sooner .
but i exhort you , brethren , bear with the word of exhortation : for i have written unto you in few words .
know ye that our brother timothy hath been set at liberty ; with whom , if he come shortly , i will see you .
salute all them that have the rule over you , and all the saints . they of italy salute you .
grace be with you all . amen .
so he went and took gomer the daughter of diblaim ; and she conceived , and bare him a son .
and it shall come to pass at that day , that i will break the bow of israel in the valley of jezreel .
now when she had weaned lo-ruhamah , she conceived , and bare a son .
and jehovah said , call his name lo-ammi ; for ye are not my people , and i will not be your god .
say ye unto your brethren , ammi ; and to your sisters , ruhamah .
yea , upon her children will i have no mercy ; for they are children of whoredom ;
therefore , behold , i will hedge up thy way with thorns , and i will build a wall against her , that she shall not find her paths .
and now will i uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers , and none shall deliver her out of my hand .
i will also cause all her mirth to cease , her feasts , her new moons , and her sabbaths , and all her solemn assemblies .
therefore , behold , i will allure her , and bring her into the wilderness , and speak comfortably unto her .
and it shall be at that day , saith jehovah , that thou shalt call me ishi , and shalt call me no more baali .
for i will take away the names of the baalim out of her mouth , and they shall no more be mentioned by their name .
i will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness ; and thou shalt know jehovah .
and it shall come to pass in that day , i will answer , saith jehovah , i will answer the heavens , and they shall answer the earth ;
and the earth shall answer the grain , and the new wine , and the oil ; and they shall answer jezreel .
so i bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver , and a homer of barley , and a half-homer of barley ;
for the children of israel shall abide many days without king , and without prince , and without sacrifice , and without pillar , and without ephod or teraphim :
there is nought but swearing and breaking faith , and killing , and stealing , and committing adultery ; they break out , and blood toucheth blood .
yet let no man strive , neither let any man reprove ; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest .
and thou shalt stumble in the day , and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night ; and i will destroy thy mother .
as they were multiplied , so they sinned against me : i will change their glory into shame .
they feed on the sin of my people , and set their heart on their iniquity .
and it shall be , like people , like priest ; and i will punish them for their ways , and will requite them their doings .
whoredom and wine and new wine take away the understanding .
for israel hath behaved himself stubbornly , like a stubborn heifer : now will jehovah feed them as a lamb in a large place .
ephraim is joined to idols ; let him alone .
their drink is become sour ; they play the harlot continually ; her rulers dearly love shame .
the wind hath wrapped her up in its wings ; and they shall be put to shame because of their sacrifices .
and the revolters are gone deep in making slaughter ; but i am a rebuker of them all .
i know ephraim , and israel is not hid from me ; for now , o ephraim , thou hast played the harlot , israel is defiled .
their doings will not suffer them to turn unto their god ; for the spirit of whoredom is within them , and they know not jehovah .
and the pride of israel doth testify to his face : therefore israel and ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity ; judah also shall stumble with them .
they shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek jehovah ; but they shall not find him : he hath withdrawn himself from them .
they have dealt treacherously against jehovah ; for they have borne strange children : now shall the new moon devour them with their fields .
blow ye the cornet in gibeah , and the trumpet in ramah : sound an alarm at beth-aven ; behind thee , o benjamin .
ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke : among the tribes of israel have i made known that which shall surely be .
the princes of judah are like them that remove the landmark : i will pour out my wrath upon them like water .
ephraim is oppressed , he is crushed in judgment ; because he was content to walk after man ’ s command .
therefore am i unto ephraim as a moth , and to the house of judah as rottenness .
i will go and return to my place , till they acknowledge their offence , and seek my face : in their affliction they will seek me earnestly .
after two days will he revive us : on the third day he will raise us up , and we shall live before him .
for i desire goodness , and not sacrifice ; and the knowledge of god more than burnt-offerings .
but they like adam have transgressed the covenant : there have they dealt treacherously against me .
gilead is a city of them that work iniquity ; it is stained with blood .
and as troops of robbers wait for a man , so the company of priests murder in the way toward shechem ; yea , they have committed lewdness .
in the house of israel i have seen a horrible thing : there whoredom is found in ephraim , israel is defiled .
also , o judah , there is a harvest appointed for thee , when i bring back the captivity of my people .
and they consider not in their hearts that i remember all their wickedness : now have their own doings beset them about ; they are before my face .
they make the king glad with their wickedness , and the princes with their lies .
on the day of our king the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine ; he stretched out his hand with scoffers .
they are all hot as an oven , and devour their judges ; all their kings are fallen : there is none among them that calleth unto me .
ephraim , he mixeth himself among the peoples ; ephraim is a cake not turned .
strangers have devoured his strength , and he knoweth it not : yea , gray hairs are here and there upon him , and he knoweth it not .
and the pride of israel doth testify to his face : yet they have not returned unto jehovah their god , nor sought him , for all this .
and ephraim is like a silly dove , without understanding : they call unto egypt , they go to assyria .
though i have taught and strengthened their arms , yet do they devise mischief against me .
they shall cry unto me , my god , we israel know thee .
israel hath cast off that which is good : the enemy shall pursue him .
he hath cast off thy calf , o samaria ; mine anger is kindled against them : how long will it be ere they attain to innocency ?
for from israel is even this ; the workman made it , and it is no god ; yea , the calf of samaria shall be broken in pieces .
israel is swallowed up : now are they among the nations as a vessel wherein none delighteth .
for they are gone up to assyria , like a wild ass alone by himself : ephraim hath hired lovers .
because ephraim hath multiplied altars for sinning , altars have been unto him for sinning .
i wrote for him the ten thousand things of my law ; but they are counted as a strange thing .
the threshing-floor and the winepress shall not feed them , and the new wine shall fail her .
they shall not dwell in jehovah ’ s land ; but ephraim shall return to egypt , and they shall eat unclean food in assyria .
what will ye do in the day of solemn assembly , and in the day of the feast of jehovah ?
they have deeply corrupted themselves , as in the days of gibeah : he will remember their iniquity , he will visit their sins .
as for ephraim , their glory shall fly away like a bird : there shall be no birth , and none with child , and no conception .
ephraim , like as i have seen tyre , is planted in a pleasant place : but ephraim shall bring out his children to the slayer .
give them , o jehovah—what wilt thou give ? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts .
my god will cast them away , because they did not hearken unto him ; and they shall be wanderers among the nations .
their heart is divided ; now shall they be found guilty : he will smite their altars , he will destroy their pillars .
surely now shall they say , we have no king ; for we fear not jehovah ; and the king , what can he do for us ?
they speak vain words , swearing falsely in making covenants : therefore judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field .
it also shall be carried unto assyria for a present to king jareb : ephraim shall receive shame , and israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel .
as for samaria , her king is cut off , as foam upon the water .
o israel , thou hast sinned from the days of gibeah : there they stood ; the battle against the children of iniquity doth not overtake them in gibeah .
when it is my desire , i will chastise them ; and the peoples shall be gathered against them , when they are bound to their two transgressions .
so shall beth-el do unto you because of your great wickedness : at daybreak shall the king of israel be utterly cut off .
when israel was a child , then i loved him , and called my son out of egypt .
the more the prophets called them , the more they went from them : they sacrificed unto the baalim , and burned incense to graven images .
yet i taught ephraim to walk ; i took them on my arms ; but they knew not that i healed them .
they shall not return into the land of egypt ; but the assyrian shall be their king , because they refused to return to me .
and the sword shall fall upon their cities , and shall consume their bars , and devour them , because of their own counsels .
and my people are bent on backsliding from me : though they call them to him that is on high , none at all will exalt him .
they shall walk after jehovah , who will roar like a lion ; for he will roar , and the children shall come trembling from the west .
ephraim compasseth me about with falsehood , and the house of israel with deceit ; but judah yet ruleth with god , and is faithful with the holy one .
jehovah hath also a controversy with judah , and will punish jacob according to his ways ; according to his doings will he recompense him .
in the womb he took his brother by the heel ; and in his manhood he had power with god :
even jehovah , the god of hosts ; jehovah is his memorial name .
therefore turn thou to thy god : keep kindness and justice , and wait for thy god continually .
he is a trafficker , the balances of deceit are in his hand : he loveth to oppress .
i have also spoken unto the prophets , and i have multiplied visions ; and by the ministry of the prophets have i used similitudes .
is gilead iniquity ? they are altogether false ; in gilgal they sacrifice bullocks ; yea , their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the field .
and jacob fled into the field of aram , and israel served for a wife , and for a wife he kept sheep .
and by a prophet jehovah brought israel up out of egypt , and by a prophet was he preserved .
ephraim hath provoked to anger most bitterly : therefore shall his blood be left upon him , and his reproach shall his lord return unto him .
when ephraim spake , there was trembling ; he exalted himself in israel ; but when he offended in baal , he died .
yet i am jehovah thy god from the land of egypt ; and thou shalt know no god but me , and besides me there is no saviour .
i did know thee in the wilderness , in the land of great drought .
according to their pasture , so were they filled ; they were filled , and their heart was exalted : therefore have they forgotten me .
therefore am i unto them as a lion ; as a leopard will i watch by the way ;
it is thy destruction , o israel , that thou art against me , against thy help .
i have given thee a king in mine anger , and have taken him away in my wrath .
the iniquity of ephraim is bound up ; his sin is laid up in store .
o israel , return unto jehovah thy god ; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity .
i will heal their backsliding , i will love them freely ; for mine anger is turned away from him .
i will be as the dew unto israel ; he shall blossom as the lily , and cast forth his roots as lebanon .
his branches shall spread , and his beauty shall be as the olive-tree , and his smell as lebanon .
the ox knoweth his owner , and the ass his master ’ s crib ; but israel doth not know , my people doth not consider .
why will ye be still stricken , that ye revolt more and more ? the whole head is sick , and the whole heart faint .
and the daughter of zion is left as a booth in a vineyard , as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers , as a besieged city .
except jehovah of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant , we should have been as sodom , we should have been like unto gomorrah .
hear the word of jehovah , ye rulers of sodom ; give ear unto the law of our god , ye people of gomorrah .
when ye come to appear before me , who hath required this at your hand , to trample my courts ?
your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth ; they are a trouble unto me ; i am weary of bearing them .
wash you , make you clean ; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes ; cease to do evil ;
learn to do well ; seek justice , relieve the oppressed , judge the fatherless , plead for the widow .
if ye be willing and obedient , ye shall eat the good of the land :
but if ye refuse and rebel , ye shall be devoured with the sword ; for the mouth of jehovah hath spoken it .
how is the faithful city become a harlot ! she that was full of justice ! righteousness lodged in her , but now murderers .
thy silver is become dross , thy wine mixed with water .
and i will turn my hand upon thee , and thoroughly purge away thy dross , and will take away all thy tin ;
zion shall be redeemed with justice , and her converts with righteousness .
but the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together , and they that forsake jehovah shall be consumed .
for they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired , and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen .
for ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth , and as a garden that hath no water .
and the strong shall be as tow , and his work as a spark ; and they shall both burn together , and none shall quench them .
the word that isaiah the son of amoz saw concerning judah and jerusalem .
o house of jacob , come ye , and let us walk in the light of jehovah .
their land also is full of idols ; they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fingers have made .
and the mean man is bowed down , and the great man is brought low : therefore forgive them not .
enter into the rock , and hide thee in the dust , from before the terror of jehovah , and from the glory of his majesty .
the lofty looks of man shall be brought low , and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down , and jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day .
and upon all the cedars of lebanon , that are high and lifted up , and upon all the oaks of bashan ,
and upon all the high mountains , and upon all the hills that are lifted up ,
and upon every lofty tower , and upon every fortified wall ,
and upon all the ships of tarshish , and upon all pleasant imagery .
and the loftiness of man shall be bowed down , and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low ; and jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day .
and the idols shall utterly pass away .
cease ye from man , whose breath is in his nostrils ; for wherein is he to be accounted of ?
the mighty man , and the man of war ; the judge , and the prophet , and the diviner , and the elder ;
the captain of fifty , and the honorable man , and the counsellor , and the expert artificer , and the skilful enchanter .
and i will give children to be their princes , and babes shall rule over them .
for jerusalem is ruined , and judah is fallen ; because their tongue and their doings are against jehovah , to provoke the eyes of his glory .
say ye of the righteous , that it shall be well with him ; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings .
woe unto the wicked ! it shall be ill with him ; for what his hands have done shall be done unto him .
jehovah standeth up to contend , and standeth to judge the peoples .
what mean ye that ye crush my people , and grind the face of the poor ? saith the lord , jehovah of hosts .
therefore the lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of zion , and jehovah will lay bare their secret parts .
in that day the lord will take away the beauty of their anklets , and the cauls , and the crescents ;
the pendants , and the bracelets , and the mufflers ;
the headtires , and the ankle chains , and the sashes , and the perfume-boxes , and the amulets ;
the rings , and the nose-jewels ;
the festival robes , and the mantles , and the shawls , and the satchels ;
the hand-mirrors , and the fine linen , and the turbans , and the veils .
thy men shall fall by the sword , and thy mighty in the war .
and her gates shall lament and mourn ; and she shall be desolate and sit upon the ground .
and there shall be a pavilion for a shade in the day-time from the heat , and for a refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain .
let me sing for my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard . my wellbeloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill :
and now , o inhabitants of jerusalem and men of judah , judge , i pray you , betwixt me and my vineyard .
in mine ears saith jehovah of hosts , of a truth many houses shall be desolate , even great and fair , without inhabitant .
for ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath , and a homer of seed shall yield but an ephah .
woe unto them that rise up early in the morning , that they may follow strong drink ; that tarry late into the night , till wine inflame them !
therefore my people are gone into captivity for lack of knowledge ; and their honorable men are famished , and their multitude are parched with thirst .
and the mean man is bowed down , and the great man is humbled , and the eyes of the lofty are humbled :
but jehovah of hosts is exalted in justice , and god the holy one is sanctified in righteousness .
then shall the lambs feed as in their pasture , and the waste places of the fat ones shall wanderers eat .
woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of falsehood , and sin as it were with a cart rope ;
woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes , and prudent in their own sight !
woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine , and men of strength to mingle strong drink ;
that justify the wicked for a bribe , and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him !
whose arrows are sharp , and all their bows bent ; their horses ’ hoofs shall be accounted as flint , and their wheels as a whirlwind :
in the year that king uzziah died i saw the lord sitting upon a throne , high and lifted up ; and his train filled the temple .
and one cried unto another , and said , holy , holy , holy , is jehovah of hosts : the whole earth is full of his glory .
and the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him that cried , and the house was filled with smoke .
then flew one of the seraphim unto me , having a live coal in his hand , which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar :
and he said , go , and tell this people , hear ye indeed , but understand not ; and see ye indeed , but perceive not .
and jehovah have removed men far away , and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land .
because syria , ephraim , and the son of remaliah , have purposed evil against thee , saying ,
thus saith the lord jehovah , it shall not stand , neither shall it come to pass .
and jehovah spake again unto ahaz , saying ,
ask thee a sign of jehovah thy god ; ask it either in the depth , or in the height above .
but ahaz said , i will not ask , neither will i tempt jehovah .
therefore the lord himself will give you a sign : behold , a virgin shall conceive , and bear a son , and shall call his name immanuel .
butter and honey shall he eat , when he knoweth to refuse the evil , and choose the good .
for before the child shall know to refuse the evil , and choose the good , the land whose two kings thou abhorrest shall be forsaken .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that a man shall keep alive a young cow , and two sheep ;
with arrows and with bow shall one come thither , because all the land shall be briers and thorns .
and jehovah said unto me , take thee a great tablet , and write upon it with the pen of a man , for maher-shalal-hash-baz ;
and i will take unto me faithful witnesses to record , uriah the priest , and zechariah the son of jeberechiah .
and i went unto the prophetess ; and she conceived , and bare a son . then said jehovah unto me , call his name maher-shalal-hash-baz .
and jehovah spake unto me yet again , saying ,
forasmuch as this people have refused the waters of shiloah that go softly , and rejoice in rezin and remaliah ’ s son ;
take counsel together , and it shall be brought to nought ; speak the word , and it shall not stand : for god is with us .
for jehovah spake thus to me with a strong hand , and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people , saying ,
say ye not , a conspiracy , concerning all whereof this people shall say , a conspiracy ; neither fear ye their fear , nor be in dread thereof .
jehovah of hosts , him shall ye sanctify ; and let him be your fear , and let him be your dread .
and many shall stumble thereon , and fall , and be broken , and be snared , and be taken .
bind thou up the testimony , seal the law among my disciples .
and i will wait for jehovah , that hideth his face from the house of jacob , and i will look for him .
behold , i and the children whom jehovah hath given me are for signs and for wonders in israel from jehovah of hosts , who dwelleth in mount zion .
to the law and to the testimony ! if they speak not according to this word , surely there is no morning for them .
for the yoke of his burden , and the staff of his shoulder , the rod of his oppressor , thou hast broken as in the day of midian .
for all the armor of the armed man in the tumult , and the garments rolled in blood , shall be for burning , for fuel of fire .
the lord sent a word into jacob , and it hath lighted upon israel .
and all the people shall know , even ephraim and the inhabitant of samaria , that say in pride and in stoutness of heart ,
the bricks are fallen , but we will build with hewn stone ; the sycomores are cut down , but we will put cedars in their place .
therefore jehovah will set up on high against him the adversaries of rezin , and will stir up his enemies ,
yet the people have not turned unto him that smote them , neither have they sought jehovah of hosts .
therefore jehovah will cut off from israel head and tail , palm-branch and rush , in one day .
the elder and the honorable man , he is the head ; and the prophet that teacheth lies , he is the tail .
for they that lead this people cause them to err ; and they that are led of them are destroyed .
through the wrath of jehovah of hosts is the land burnt up ; and the people are as the fuel of fire : no man spareth his brother .
woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees , and to the writers that write perverseness ;
ho assyrian , the rod of mine anger , the staff in whose hand is mine indignation !
for he saith , are not my princes all of them kings ?
is not calno as carchemish ? is not hamath as arpad ? is not samaria as damascus ?
as my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols , whose graven images did excel them of jerusalem and of samaria ;
shall i not , as i have done unto samaria and her idols , so do to jerusalem and her idols ?
and the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few , so that a child may write them .
a remnant shall return , even the remnant of jacob , unto the mighty god .
for a full end , and that determined , will the lord , jehovah of hosts , make in the midst of all the earth .
for yet a very little while , and the indignation against thee shall be accomplished , and mine anger shall be directed to his destruction .
he is come to aiath , he is passed through migron ; at michmash he layeth up his baggage ;
they are gone over the pass ; they have taken up their lodging at geba ; ramah trembleth ; gibeah of saul is fled .
cry aloud with thy voice , o daughter of gallim ! hearken , o laishah ! o thou poor anathoth !
madmenah is a fugitive ; the inhabitants of gebim flee for safety .
this very day shall he halt at nob : he shaketh his hand at the mount of the daughter of zion , the hill of jerusalem .
and he will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron , and lebanon shall fall by a mighty one .
and there shall come forth a shoot out of the stock of jesse , and a branch out of his roots shall bear fruit .
and righteousness shall be the girdle of his waist , and faithfulness the girdle of his loins .
and the cow and the bear shall feed ; their young ones shall lie down together ; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox .
and the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp , and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder ’ s den .
therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation .
sing unto jehovah ; for he hath done excellent things : let this be known in all the earth .
cry aloud and shout , thou inhabitant of zion ; for great in the midst of thee is the holy one of israel .
the burden of babylon , which isaiah the son of amoz did see .
i have commanded my consecrated ones , yea , i have called my mighty men for mine anger , even my proudly exulting ones .
they come from a far country , from the uttermost part of heaven , even jehovah , and the weapons of his indignation , to destroy the whole land .
wail ye ; for the day of jehovah is at hand ; as destruction from the almighty shall it come .
therefore shall all hands be feeble , and every heart of man shall melt :
i will make a man more rare than fine gold , even a man than the pure gold of ophir .
every one that is found shall be thrust through ; and every one that is taken shall fall by the sword .
their infants also shall be dashed in pieces before their eyes ; their houses shall be rifled , and their wives ravished .
behold , i will stir up the medes against them , who shall not regard silver , and as for gold , they shall not delight in it .
and babylon , the glory of kingdoms , the beauty of the chaldeans ’ pride , shall be as when god overthrew sodom and gomorrah .
that thou shalt take up this parable against the king of babylon , and say , how hath the oppressor ceased ! the golden city ceased !
jehovah hath broken the staff of the wicked , the sceptre of the rulers ;
that smote the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke , that ruled the nations in anger , with a persecution that none restrained .
the whole earth is at rest , and is quiet : they break forth into singing .
yea , the fir-trees rejoice at thee , and the cedars of lebanon , saying , since thou art laid low , no hewer is come up against us .
all they shall answer and say unto thee , art thou also become weak as we ? art thou become like unto us ?
thy pomp is brought down to sheol , and the noise of thy viols : the worm is spread under thee , and worms cover thee .
i will ascend above the heights of the clouds ; i will make myself like the most high .
yet thou shalt be brought down to sheol , to the uttermost parts of the pit .
that made the world as a wilderness , and overthrew the cities thereof ; that let not loose his prisoners to their home ?
all the kings of the nations , all of them , sleep in glory , every one in his own house .
this is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth ; and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations .
for jehovah of hosts hath purposed , and who shall annul it ? and his hand is stretched out , and who shall turn it back ?
in the year that king ahaz died was this burden .
what then shall one answer the messengers of the nation ? that jehovah hath founded zion , and in her shall the afflicted of his people take refuge .
the burden of moab .
in their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth ; on their housetops , and in their broad places , every one waileth , weeping abundantly .
for the waters of nimrim shall be desolate ; for the grass is withered away , the tender grass faileth , there is no green thing .
therefore the abundance they have gotten , and that which they have laid up , shall they carry away over the brook of the willows .
for the cry is gone round about the borders of moab ; the wailing thereof unto eglaim , and the wailing thereof unto beer-elim .
send ye the lambs for the ruler of the land from selah to the wilderness , unto the mount of the daughter of zion .
for it shall be that , as wandering birds , as a scattered nest , so shall the daughters of moab be at the fords of the arnon .
give counsel , execute justice ; make thy shade as the night in the midst of the noonday ; hide the outcasts ; betray not the fugitive .
therefore shall moab wail for moab , every one shall wail : for the raisin-cakes of kir-hareseth shall ye mourn , utterly stricken .
wherefore my heart soundeth like a harp for moab , and mine inward parts for kir-heres .
this is the word that jehovah spake concerning moab in time past .
the burden of damascus .
the cities of aroer are forsaken ; they shall be for flocks , which shall lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the glory of jacob shall be made thin , and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean .
in that day shall men look unto their maker , and their eyes shall have respect to the holy one of israel .
ah , the land of the rustling of wings , which is beyond the rivers of ethiopia ;
the burden of egypt .
and the waters shall fail from the sea , and the river shall be wasted and become dry .
and the rivers shall become foul ; the streams of egypt shall be diminished and dried up ; the reeds and flags shall wither away .
and the fishers shall lament , and all they that cast angle into the nile shall mourn , and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish .
moreover they that work in combed flax , and they that weave white cloth , shall be confounded .
and the pillars of egypt shall be broken in pieces ; all they that work for hire shall be grieved in soul .
where then are thy wise men ? and let them tell thee now ; and let them know what jehovah of hosts hath purposed concerning egypt .
neither shall there be for egypt any work , which head or tail , palm-branch or rush , may do .
in that day shall there be an altar to jehovah in the midst of the land of egypt , and a pillar at the border thereof to jehovah .
and jehovah will smite egypt , smiting and healing ; and they shall return unto jehovah , and he will be entreated of them , and will heal them .
in that day shall israel be the third with egypt and with assyria , a blessing in the midst of the earth ;
for that jehovah of hosts hath blessed them , saying , blessed be egypt my people , and assyria the work of my hands , and israel mine inheritance .
in the year that tartan came unto ashdod , when sargon the king of assyria sent him , and he fought against ashdod and took it ;
and jehovah said , like as my servant isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder concerning egypt and concerning ethiopia ;
and they shall be dismayed and confounded , because of ethiopia their expectation , and of egypt their glory .
the burden of the wilderness of the sea .
my heart fluttereth , horror hath affrighted me ; the twilight that i desired hath been turned into trembling unto me .
they prepare the table , they set the watch , they eat , they drink : rise up , ye princes , anoint the shield .
for thus hath the lord said unto me , go , set a watchman ; let him declare what he seeth :
and when he seeth a troop , horsemen in pairs , a troop of asses , a troop of camels , he shall hearken diligently with much heed .
and he cried as a lion : o lord , i stand continually upon the watch-tower in the day-time , and am set in my ward whole nights ;
the burden of dumah .
the watchman said , the morning cometh , and also the night : if ye will inquire , inquire ye : turn ye , come .
the burden upon arabia .
unto him that was thirsty they brought water ; the inhabitants of the land of tema did meet the fugitives with their bread .
for they fled away from the swords , from the drawn sword , and from the bent bow , and from the grievousness of war .
for thus hath the lord said unto me , within a year , according to the years of a hireling , all the glory of kedar shall fail ;
the burden of the valley of vision .
all thy rulers fled away together , they were bound by the archers ; all that were found of thee were bound together ; they fled afar off .
therefore said i , look away from me , i will weep bitterly ; labor not to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people .
and elam bare the quiver , with chariots of men and horsemen ; and kir uncovered the shield .
and it came to pass , that thy choicest valleys were full of chariots , and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate .
and he took away the covering of judah ; and thou didst look in that day to the armor in the house of the forest .
and ye saw the breaches of the city of david , that they were many ; and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool ;
and ye numbered the houses of jerusalem , and ye brake down the houses to fortify the wall ;
and in that day did the lord , jehovah of hosts , call to weeping , and to mourning , and to baldness , and to girding with sackcloth :
and jehovah of hosts revealed himself in mine ears , surely this iniquity shall not be forgiven you till ye die , saith the lord , jehovah of hosts .
thus saith the lord , jehovah of hosts , go , get thee unto this treasurer , even unto shebna , who is over the house , and say ,
behold , jehovah , like a strong man , will hurl thee away violently ; yea , he will wrap thee up closely .
and i will thrust thee from thine office ; and from thy station shalt thou be pulled down .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that i will call my servant eliakim the son of hilkiah :
and i will fasten him as a nail in a sure place ; and he shall be for a throne of glory to his father ’ s house .
the burden of tyre .
be still , ye inhabitants of the coast , thou whom the merchants of sidon , that pass over the sea , have replenished .
and on great waters the seed of the shihor , the harvest of the nile , was her revenue ; and she was the mart of nations .
when the report cometh to egypt , they shall be sorely pained at the report of tyre .
pass ye over to tarshish ; wail , ye inhabitants of the coast .
is this your joyous city , whose antiquity is of ancient days , whose feet carried her afar off to sojourn ?
who hath purposed this against tyre , the bestower of crowns , whose merchants are princes , whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth ?
jehovah of hosts hath purposed it , to stain the pride of all glory , to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth .
pass through thy land as the nile , o daughter of tarshish ; there is no restraint any more .
he hath stretched out his hand over the sea , he hath shaken the kingdoms : jehovah hath given commandment concerning canaan , to destroy the strongholds thereof .
howl , ye ships of tarshish ; for your stronghold is laid waste .
take a harp , go about the city , thou harlot that hast been forgotten ; make sweet melody , sing many songs , that thou mayest be remembered .
behold , jehovah maketh the earth empty , and maketh it waste , and turneth it upside down , and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof .
the earth shall be utterly emptied , and utterly laid waste ; for jehovah hath spoken this word .
the earth mourneth and fadeth away , the world languisheth and fadeth away , the lofty people of the earth do languish .
the earth also is polluted under the inhabitants thereof ; because they have transgressed the laws , violated the statutes , broken the everlasting covenant .
the new wine mourneth , the vine languisheth , all the merry-hearted do sigh .
the mirth of tabrets ceaseth , the noise of them that rejoice endeth , the joy of the harp ceaseth .
they shall not drink wine with a song ; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it .
the waste city is broken down ; every house is shut up , that no man may come in .
there is a crying in the streets because of the wine ; all joy is darkened , the mirth of the land is gone .
in the city is left desolation , and the gate is smitten with destruction .
these shall lift up their voice , they shall shout ; for the majesty of jehovah they cry aloud from the sea .
wherefore glorify ye jehovah in the east , even the name of jehovah , the god of israel , in the isles of the sea .
from the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs : glory to the righteous .
fear , and the pit , and the snare , are upon thee , o inhabitant of the earth .
the earth is utterly broken , the earth is rent asunder , the earth is shaken violently .
therefore shall a strong people glorify thee ; a city of terrible nations shall fear thee .
and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering that covereth all peoples , and the veil that is spread over all nations .
and the high fortress of thy walls hath he brought down , laid low , and brought to the ground , even to the dust .
in that day shall this song be sung in the land of judah : we have a strong city ; salvation will he appoint for walls and bulwarks .
open ye the gates , that the righteous nation which keepeth faith may enter in .
thou wilt keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on thee ; because he trusteth in thee .
trust ye in jehovah for ever ; for in jehovah , even jehovah , is an everlasting rock .
the foot shall tread it down ; even the feet of the poor , and the steps of the needy .
the way of the just is uprightness : thou that art upright dost direct the path of the just .
jehovah , thou wilt ordain peace for us ; for thou hast also wrought all our works for us .
o jehovah our god , other lords besides thee have had dominion over us ; but by thee only will we make mention of thy name .
thou hast increased the nation , o jehovah , thou hast increased the nation ; thou art glorified ; thou hast enlarged all the borders of the land .
jehovah , in trouble have they visited thee ; they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them .
in that day : a vineyard of wine , sing ye unto it .
i jehovah am its keeper ; i will water it every moment : lest any hurt it , i will keep it night and day .
wrath is not in me : would that the briers and thorns were against me in battle ! i would march upon them , i would burn them together .
or else let him take hold of my strength , that he may make peace with me ; yea , let him make peace with me .
in days to come shall jacob take root ; israel shall blossom and bud ; and they shall fill the face of the world with fruit .
hath he smitten them as he smote those that smote them ? or are they slain according to the slaughter of them that were slain by them ?
the crown of pride of the drunkards of ephraim shall be trodden under foot :
in that day will jehovah of hosts become a crown of glory , and a diadem of beauty , unto the residue of his people ;
and a spirit of justice to him that sitteth in judgment , and strength to them that turn back the battle at the gate .
for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness , so that there is no place clean .
whom will he teach knowledge ? and whom will he make to understand the message ? them that are weaned from the milk , and drawn from the breasts ?
for it is precept upon precept , precept upon precept ; line upon line , line upon line ; here a little , there a little .
nay , but by men of strange lips and with another tongue will he speak to this people ;
wherefore hear the word of jehovah , ye scoffers , that rule this people that is in jerusalem :
for the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it ; and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it .
give ye ear , and hear my voice ; hearken , and hear my speech .
doth he that ploweth to sow plow continually ? doth he continually open and harrow his ground ?
for his god doth instruct him aright , and doth teach him .
this also cometh forth from jehovah of hosts , who is wonderful in counsel , and excellent in wisdom .
ho ariel , ariel , the city where david encamped ! add ye year to year ; let the feasts come round :
then will i distress ariel , and there shall be mourning and lamentation ; and she shall be unto me as ariel .
and i will encamp against thee round about , and will lay siege against thee with posted troops , and i will raise siege works against thee .
tarry ye and wonder ; take your pleasure and be blind : they are drunken , but not with wine ; they stagger , but not with strong drink .
and the book is delivered to him that is not learned , saying , read this , i pray thee ; and he saith , i am not learned .
is it not yet a very little while , and lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest ?
and in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book , and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness .
the meek also shall increase their joy in jehovah , and the poor among men shall rejoice in the holy one of israel .
for the terrible one is brought to nought , and the scoffer ceaseth , and all they that watch for iniquity are cut off ;
therefore thus saith jehovah , who redeemed abraham , concerning the house of jacob : jacob shall not now be ashamed , neither shall his face now wax pale .
they also that err in spirit shall come to understanding , and they that murmur shall receive instruction .
therefore shall the strength of pharaoh be your shame , and the refuge in the shadow of egypt your confusion .
for their princes are at zoan , and their ambassadors are come to hanes .
the burden of the beasts of the south .
for egypt helpeth in vain , and to no purpose : therefore have i called her rahab that sitteth still .
for it is a rebellious people , lying children , children that will not hear the law of jehovah ;
that say to the seers , see not ; and to the prophets , prophesy not unto us right things , speak unto us smooth things , prophesy deceits ,
get you out of the way , turn aside out of the path , cause the holy one of israel to cease from before us .
wherefore thus saith the holy one of israel , because ye despise this word , and trust in oppression and perverseness , and rely thereon ;
therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall , swelling out in a high wall , whose breaking cometh suddenly in an instant .
the oxen likewise and the young asses that till the ground shall eat savory provender , which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork .
for through the voice of jehovah shall the assyrian be dismayed ; with his rod will he smite him .
as birds hovering , so will jehovah of hosts protect jerusalem ; he will protect and deliver it , he will pass over and preserve it .
turn ye unto him from whom ye have deeply revolted , o children of israel .
behold , a king shall reign in righteousness , and princes shall rule in justice .
and the eyes of them that see shall not be dim , and the ears of them that hear shall hearken .
and the heart of the rash shall understand knowledge , and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly .
the fool shall be no more called noble , nor the churl said to be bountiful .
and the instruments of the churl are evil : he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the meek with lying words , even when the needy speaketh right .
but the noble deviseth noble things ; and in noble things shall he continue .
rise up , ye women that are at ease , and hear my voice ; ye careless daughters , give ear unto my speech .
for days beyond a year shall ye be troubled , ye careless women ; for the vintage shall fail , the ingathering shall not come .
they shall smite upon the breasts for the pleasant fields , for the fruitful vine .
upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers ; yea , upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city .
until the spirit be poured upon us from on high , and the wilderness become a fruitful field , and the fruitful field be esteemed as a forest .
then justice shall dwell in the wilderness ; and righteousness shall abide in the fruitful field .
and the work of righteousness shall be peace ; and the effect of righteousness , quietness and confidence for ever .
and my people shall abide in a peaceable habitation , and in safe dwellings , and in quiet resting-places .
but it shall hail in the downfall of the forest ; and the city shall be utterly laid low .
blessed are ye that sow beside all waters , that send forth the feet of the ox and the ass .
o jehovah , be gracious unto us ; we have waited for thee : be thou our arm every morning , our salvation also in the time of trouble .
at the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled ; at the lifting up of thyself the nations are scattered .
and your spoil shall be gathered as the caterpillar gathereth : as locusts leap shall men leap upon it .
jehovah is exalted ; for he dwelleth on high : he hath filled zion with justice and righteousness .
and there shall be stability in thy times , abundance of salvation , wisdom , and knowledge : the fear of jehovah is thy treasure .
behold , their valiant ones cry without ; the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly .
the highways lie waste , the wayfaring man ceaseth : the enemy hath broken the covenant , he hath despised the cities , he regardeth not man .
the land mourneth and languisheth ; lebanon is confounded and withereth away ; sharon is like a desert ; and bashan and carmel shake off their leaves .
now will i arise , saith jehovah ; now will i lift up myself ; now will i be exalted .
ye shall conceive chaff , ye shall bring forth stubble : your breath is a fire that shall devour you .
and the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime , as thorns cut down , that are burned in the fire .
hear , ye that are far off , what i have done ; and , ye that are near , acknowledge my might .
he shall dwell on high ; his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks ; his bread shall be given him ; his waters shall be sure .
thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty : they shall behold a land that reacheth afar .
thy heart shall muse on the terror : where is he that counted , where is he that weighed the tribute ? where is he that counted the towers ?
thou shalt not see the fierce people , a people of a deep speech that thou canst not comprehend , of a strange tongue that thou canst not understand .
for jehovah is our judge , jehovah is our lawgiver , jehovah is our king ; he will save us .
and the inhabitant shall not say , i am sick : the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity .
for jehovah hath indignation against all the nations , and wrath against all their host : he hath utterly destroyed them , he hath delivered them to the slaughter .
their slain also shall be cast out , and the stench of their dead bodies shall come up ; and the mountains shall be melted with their blood .
for my sword hath drunk its fill in heaven : behold , it shall come down upon edom , and upon the people of my curse , to judgment .
for jehovah hath a day of vengeance , a year of recompense for the cause of zion .
and the streams of edom shall be turned into pitch , and the dust thereof into brimstone , and the land thereof shall become burning pitch .
they shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom , but none shall be there ; and all its princes shall be nothing .
the wilderness and the dry land shall be glad ; and the desert shall rejoice , and blossom as the rose .
strengthen ye the weak hands , and confirm the feeble knees .
then the eyes of the blind shall be opened , and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped .
no lion shall be there , nor shall any ravenous beast go up thereon ; they shall not be found there ; but the redeemed shall walk there :
i say , thy counsel and strength for the war are but vain words : now on whom dost thou trust , that thou hast rebelled against me ?
and am i now come up without jehovah against this land to destroy it ? jehovah said unto me , go up against this land , and destroy it .
thus saith the king , let not hezekiah deceive you ; for he will not be able to deliver you :
until i come and take you away to a land like your own land , a land of grain and new wine , a land of bread and vineyards .
where are the gods of hamath and arpad ? where are the gods of sepharvaim ? and have they delivered samaria out of my hand ?
but they held their peace , and answered him not a word ; for the king ’ s commandment was , saying , answer him not .
so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah .
so rabshakeh returned , and found the king of assyria warring against libnah ; for he had heard that he was departed from lachish .
behold , thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done to all lands , by destroying them utterly : and shalt thou be delivered ?
where is the king of hamath , and the king of arpad , and the king of the city of sepharvaim , of hena , and ivvah ?
and hezekiah prayed unto jehovah , saying ,
of a truth , jehovah , the kings of assyria have laid waste all the countries , and their land ,
i have digged and drunk water , and with the sole of my feet will i dry up all the rivers of egypt .
but i know thy sitting down , and thy going out , and thy coming in , and thy raging against me .
and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall again take root downward , and bear fruit upward .
for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant , and out of mount zion they that shall escape . the zeal of jehovah of hosts will perform this .
by the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and he shall not come unto this city , saith jehovah .
for i will defend this city to save it , for mine own sake , and for my servant david ’ s sake .
so sennacherib king of assyria departed , and went and returned , and dwelt at nineveh .
then hezekiah turned his face to the wall , and prayed unto jehovah ,
then came the word of jehovah to isaiah , saying ,
and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria ; and i will defend this city .
and this shall be the sign unto thee from jehovah , that jehovah will do this thing that he hath spoken :
the writing of hezekiah king of judah , when he had been sick , and was recovered of his sickness .
i said , in the noontide of my days i shall go into the gates of sheol :
i said , i shall not see jehovah , even jehovah in the land of the living :
my dwelling is removed , and is carried away from me as a shepherd ’ s tent :
i quieted myself until morning ; as a lion , so he breaketh all my bones :
like a swallow or a crane , so did i chatter ;
what shall i say ? he hath both spoken unto me , and himself hath done it :
o lord , by these things men live ;
behold , it was for my peace that i had great bitterness :
for sheol can not praise thee , death can not celebrate thee :
the living , the living , he shall praise thee , as i do this day :
jehovah is ready to save me :
now isaiah had said , let them take a cake of figs , and lay it for a plaster upon the boil , and he shall recover .
hezekiah also had said , what is the sign that i shall go up to the house of jehovah ?
then said isaiah to hezekiah , hear the word of jehovah of hosts :
comfort ye , comfort ye my people , saith your god .
the voice of one that crieth , prepare ye in the wilderness the way of jehovah ; make level in the desert a highway for our god .
and the glory of jehovah shall be revealed , and all flesh shall see it together ; for the mouth of jehovah hath spoken it .
the grass withereth , the flower fadeth , because the breath of jehovah bloweth upon it ; surely the people is grass .
the grass withereth , the flower fadeth ; but the word of our god shall stand forever .
who hath directed the spirit of jehovah , or being his counsellor hath taught him ?
and lebanon is not sufficient to burn , nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt-offering .
all the nations are as nothing before him ; they are accounted by him as less than nothing , and vanity .
to whom then will ye liken god ? or what likeness will ye compare unto him ?
the image , a workman hath cast it , and the goldsmith overlayeth it with gold , and casteth for it silver chains .
that bringeth princes to nothing ; that maketh the judges of the earth as vanity .
to whom then will ye liken me , that i should be equal to him ? saith the holy one .
he giveth power to the faint ; and to him that hath no might he increaseth strength .
even the youths shall faint and be weary , and the young men shall utterly fall :
he pursueth them , and passeth on safely , even by a way that he had not gone with his feet .
who hath wrought and done it , calling the generations from the beginning ? i , jehovah , the first , and with the last , i am he .
the isles have seen , and fear ; the ends of the earth tremble ; they draw near , and come .
they help every one his neighbor ; and every one saith to his brother , be of good courage .
but thou , israel , my servant , jacob whom i have chosen , the seed of abraham my friend ,
for i , jehovah thy god , will hold thy right hand , saying unto thee , fear not ; i will help thee .
produce your cause , saith jehovah ; bring forth your strong reasons , saith the king of jacob .
behold , ye are of nothing , and your work is of nought ; an abomination is he that chooseth you .
i am the first that saith unto zion , behold , behold them ; and i will give to jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings .
behold , all of them , their works are vanity and nought ; their molten images are wind and confusion .
he will not cry , nor lift up his voice , nor cause it to be heard in the street .
a bruised reed will he not break , and a dimly burning wick will he not quench : he will bring forth justice in truth .
he will not fail nor be discouraged , till he have set justice in the earth ; and the isles shall wait for his law .
to open the blind eyes , to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon , and them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house .
i am jehovah , that is my name ; and my glory will i not give to another , neither my praise unto graven images .
behold , the former things are come to pass , and new things do i declare ; before they spring forth i tell you of them .
let them give glory unto jehovah , and declare his praise in the islands .
i will lay waste mountains and hills , and dry up all their herbs ; and i will make the rivers islands , and will dry up the pools .
hear , ye deaf ; and look , ye blind , that ye may see .
thou seest many things , but thou observest not ; his ears are open , but he heareth not .
it pleased jehovah , for his righteousness ’ sake , to magnify the law , and make it honorable .
who is there among you that will give ear to this ? that will hearken and hear for the time to come ?
fear not ; for i am with thee : i will bring thy seed from the east , and gather thee from the west ;
every one that is called by my name , and whom i have created for my glory , whom i have formed , yea , whom i have made .
bring forth the blind people that have eyes , and the deaf that have ears .
i , even i , am jehovah ; and besides me there is no saviour .
i am jehovah , your holy one , the creator of israel , your king .
thus saith jehovah , who maketh a way in the sea , and a path in the mighty waters ;
remember ye not the former things , neither consider the things of old .
the people which i formed for myself , that they might set forth my praise .
yet thou hast not called upon me , o jacob ; but thou hast been weary of me , o israel .
i , even i , am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake ; and i will not remember thy sins .
put me in remembrance ; let us plead together : set thou forth thy cause , that thou mayest be justified .
thy first father sinned , and thy teachers have transgressed against me .
therefore i will profane the princes of the sanctuary ; and i will make jacob a curse , and israel a reviling .
yet now hear , o jacob my servant , and israel , who i have chosen :
and they shall spring up among the grass , as willows by the watercourses .
who hath fashioned a god , or molten an image that is profitable for nothing ?
that frustrateth the signs of the liars , and maketh diviners mad ; that turneth wise men backward , and maketh their knowledge foolish ;
that saith to the deep , be dry , and i will dry up thy rivers ;
i am jehovah , and there is none else ; besides me there is no god . i will gird thee , though thou hast not known me ;
i form the light , and create darkness ; i make peace , and create evil ; i am jehovah , that doeth all these things .
woe unto him that saith unto a father , what begettest thou ? or to a woman , with what travailest thou ?
verily thou art a god that hidest thyself , o god of israel , the saviour .
they shall be put to shame , yea , confounded , all of them ; they shall go into confusion together that are makers of idols .
but israel shall be saved by jehovah with an everlasting salvation : ye shall not be put to shame nor confounded world without end .
look unto me , and be ye saved , all the ends of the earth ; for i am god , and there is none else .
in jehovah shall all the seed of israel be justified , and shall glory .
they stoop , they bow down together ; they could not deliver the burden , but themselves are gone into captivity .
to whom will ye liken me , and make me equal , and compare me , that we may be like ?
remember this , and show yourselves men ; bring it again to mind , o ye transgressors .
remember the former things of old : for i am god , and there is none else ; i am god , and there is none like me ;
hearken unto me , ye stout-hearted , that are far from righteousness :
take the millstones , and grind meal ; remove thy veil , strip off the train , uncover the leg , pass through the rivers .
thy nakedness shall be uncovered , yea , thy shame shall be seen : i will take vengeance , and will spare no man .
our redeemer , jehovah of hosts is his name , the holy one of israel .
sit thou silent , and get thee into darkness , o daughter of the chaldeans ; for thou shalt no more be called the mistress of kingdoms .
( for they call themselves of the holy city , and stay themselves upon the god of israel ; jehovah of hosts is his name ) :
because i knew that thou art obstinate , and thy neck is an iron sinew , and thy brow brass ;
for my name ’ s sake will i defer mine anger , and for my praise will i refrain for thee , that i cut thee not off .
behold , i have refined thee , but not as silver ; i have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction .
hearken unto me , o jacob , and israel my called : i am he ; i am the first , i also am the last .
i , even i , have spoken ; yea , i have called him ; i have brought him , and he shall make his way prosperous .
oh that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments ! then had thy peace been as a river , and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea :
there is no peace , saith jehovah , to the wicked .
and he said unto me , thou art my servant ; israel , in whom i will be glorified .
and i will make all my mountains a way , and my highways shall be exalted .
lo , these shall come from far ; and , lo , these from the north and from the west ; and these from the land of sinim .
but zion said , jehovah hath forsaken me , and the lord hath forgotten me .
behold , i have graven thee upon the palms of my hands ; thy walls are continually before me .
thy children make haste ; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth from thee .
the children of thy bereavement shall yet say in thine ears , the place is too strait for me ; give place to me that i may dwell .
shall the prey be taken from the mighty , or the lawful captives be delivered ?
i clothe the heavens with blackness , and i make sackcloth their covering .
the lord jehovah hath opened mine ear , and i was not rebellious , neither turned away backward .
i gave my back to the smiters , and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair ; i hid not my face from shame and spitting .
the captive exile shall speedily be loosed ; and he shall not die and go down into the pit , neither shall his bread fail .
for i am jehovah thy god , who stirreth up the sea , so that the waves thereof roar : jehovah of hosts is his name .
these two things are befallen thee , who shall bemoan thee ? desolation and destruction , and the famine and the sword ; how shall i comfort thee ?
therefore hear now this , thou afflicted , and drunken , but not with wine :
for thus saith jehovah , ye were sold for nought ; and ye shall be redeemed without money .
for thus saith the lord jehovah , my people went down at the first into egypt to sojourn there : and the assyrian hath oppressed them without cause .
therefore my people shall know my name : therefore they shall know in that day that i am he that doth speak ; behold , it is i .
break forth into joy , sing together , ye waste places of jerusalem ; for jehovah hath comforted his people , he hath redeemed jerusalem .
jehovah hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our god .
behold , my servant shall deal wisely , he shall be exalted and lifted up , and shall be very high .
like as many were astonished at thee ( his visage was so marred more than any man , and his form more than the sons of men ) ,
who hath believed our message ? and to whom hath the arm of jehovah been revealed ?
surely he hath borne our griefs , and carried our sorrows ; yet we did esteem him stricken , smitten of god , and afflicted .
all we like sheep have gone astray ; we have turned every one to his own way ; and jehovah hath laid on him the iniquity of us all .
enlarge the place of thy tent , and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations ; spare not : lengthen thy cords , and strengthen thy stakes .
for jehovah hath called thee as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit , even a wife of youth , when she is cast off , saith thy god .
for a small moment have i forsaken thee ; but with great mercies will i gather thee .
in overflowing wrath i hid my face from thee for a moment ; but with everlasting lovingkindness will i have mercy on thee , saith jehovah thy redeemer .
o thou afflicted , tossed with tempest , and not comforted , behold , i will set thy stones in fair colors , and lay thy foundations with sapphires .
and i will make thy pinnacles of rubies , and thy gates of carbuncles , and all thy border of precious stones .
and all thy children shall be taught of jehovah ; and great shall be the peace of thy children .
behold , they may gather together , but not by me : whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall because of thee .
behold , i have given him for a witness to the peoples , a leader and commander to the peoples .
seek ye jehovah while he may be found ; call ye upon him while he is near :
for my thoughts are not your thoughts , neither are your ways my ways , saith jehovah .
for as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are my ways higher than your ways , and my thoughts than your thoughts .
thus saith jehovah , keep ye justice , and do righteousness ; for my salvation is near to come , and my righteousness to be revealed .
for thus saith jehovah of the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths , and choose the things that please me , and hold fast my covenant :
the lord jehovah , who gathereth the outcasts of israel , saith , yet will i gather others to him , besides his own that are gathered .
all ye beasts of the field , come to devour , yea , all ye beasts in the forest .
he entereth into peace ; they rest in their beds , each one that walketh in his uprightness .
but draw near hither , ye sons of the sorceress , the seed of the adulterer and the harlot .
ye that inflame yourselves among the oaks , under every green tree ; that slay the children in the valleys , under the clefts of the rocks ?
upon a high and lofty mountain hast thou set thy bed ; thither also wentest thou up to offer sacrifice .
i will declare thy righteousness ; and as for thy works , they shall not profit thee .
and he will say , cast ye up , cast ye up , prepare the way , take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people .
i have seen his ways , and will heal him : i will lead him also , and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners .
but the wicked are like the troubled sea ; for it can not rest , and its waters cast up mire and dirt .
there is no peace , saith my god , to the wicked .
then shalt thou call , and jehovah will answer ; thou shalt cry , and he will say , here i am .
behold , jehovah ’ s hand is not shortened , that it can not save ; neither his ear heavy , that it can not hear :
but your iniquities have separated between you and your god , and your sins have hid his face from you , so that he will not hear .
for your hands are defiled with blood , and your fingers with iniquity ; your lips have spoken lies , your tongue muttereth wickedness .
none sueth in righteousness , and none pleadeth in truth : they trust in vanity , and speak lies ; they conceive mischief , and bring forth iniquity .
their feet run to evil , and they make haste to shed innocent blood : their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity ; desolation and destruction are in their paths .
transgressing and denying jehovah , and turning away from following our god , speaking oppression and revolt , conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood .
and justice is turned away backward , and righteousness standeth afar off ; for truth is fallen in the street , and uprightness can not enter .
yea , truth is lacking ; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey .
according to their deeds , accordingly he will repay , wrath to his adversaries , recompense to his enemies ; to the islands he will repay recompense .
and a redeemer will come to zion , and unto them that turn from transgression in jacob , saith jehovah .
arise , shine ; for thy light is come , and the glory of jehovah is risen upon thee .
and nations shall come to thy light , and kings to the brightness of thy rising .
who are these that fly as a cloud , and as the doves to their windows ?
for that nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish ; yea , those nations shall be utterly wasted .
whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated , so that no man passed through thee , i will make thee an eternal excellency , a joy of many generations .
violence shall no more be heard in thy land , desolation nor destruction within thy borders ; but thou shalt call thy walls salvation , and thy gates praise .
the little one shall become a thousand , and the small one a strong nation ; i , jehovah , will hasten it in its time .
to proclaim the year of jehovah ’ s favor , and the day of vengeance of our god ; to comfort all that mourn ;
and they shall build the old wastes , they shall raise up the former desolations , and they shall repair the waste cities , the desolations of many generations .
and strangers shall stand and feed your flocks , and foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vine-dressers .
thou shalt also be a crown of beauty in the hand of jehovah , and a royal diadem in the hand of thy god .
and give him no rest , till he establish , and till he make jerusalem a praise in the earth .
but they that have garnered it shall eat it , and praise jehovah ; and they that have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary .
and they shall call them the holy people , the redeemed of jehovah : and thou shalt be called sought out , a city not forsaken .
wherefore art thou red in thine apparel , and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winevat ?
for the day of vengeance was in my heart , and the year of my redeemed is come .
and i trod down the peoples in mine anger , and made them drunk in my wrath , and i poured out their lifeblood on the earth .
for he said , surely , they are my people , children that will not deal falsely : so he was their saviour .
but they rebelled , and grieved his holy spirit : therefore he was turned to be their enemy , and himself fought against them .
that caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of moses ? that divided the waters before them , to make himself an everlasting name ?
that led them through the depths , as a horse in the wilderness , so that they stumbled not ?
thy holy people possessed it but a little while : our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary .
we are become as they over whom thou never barest rule , as they that were not called by thy name .
oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens , that thou wouldest come down , that the mountains might quake at thy presence ,
when thou didst terrible things which we looked not for , thou camest down , the mountains quaked at thy presence .
be not wroth very sore , o jehovah , neither remember iniquity for ever : behold , look , we beseech thee , we are all thy people .
thy holy cities are become a wilderness , zion is become a wilderness , jerusalem a desolation .
our holy and our beautiful house , where our fathers praised thee , is burned with fire ; and all our pleasant places are laid waste .
wilt thou refrain thyself for these things , o jehovah ? wilt thou hold thy peace , and afflict us very sore ?
i have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people , that walk in a way that is not good , after their own thoughts ;
a people that provoke me to my face continually , sacrificing in gardens , and burning incense upon bricks ;
that sit among the graves , and lodge in the secret places ; that eat swine ’ s flesh , and broth of abominable things is in their vessels ;
behold , it is written before me : i will not keep silence , but will recompense , yea , i will recompense into their bosom ,
but ye that forsake jehovah , that forget my holy mountain , that prepare a table for fortune , and that fill up mingled wine unto destiny ;
behold , my servants shall sing for joy of heart , but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart , and shall wail for vexation of spirit .
for , behold , i create new heavens and a new earth ; and the former things shall not be remembered , nor come into mind .
but be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which i create ; for , behold , i create jerusalem a rejoicing , and her people a joy .
and they shall build houses , and inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and eat the fruit of them .
they shall not labor in vain , nor bring forth for calamity ; for they are the seed of the blessed of jehovah , and their offspring with them .
and it shall come to pass that , before they call , i will answer ; and while they are yet speaking , i will hear .
a voice of tumult from the city , a voice from the temple , a voice of jehovah that rendereth recompense to his enemies .
before she travailed , she brought forth ; before her pain came , she was delivered of a man-child .
rejoice ye with jerusalem , and be glad for her , all ye that love her : rejoice for joy with her , all ye that mourn over her ;
that ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations ; that ye may milk out , and be delighted with the abundance of her glory .
as one whom his mother comforteth , so will i comfort you ; and ye shall be comforted in jerusalem .
for by fire will jehovah execute judgment , and by his sword , upon all flesh ; and the slain of jehovah shall be many .
and of them also will i take for priests and for levites , saith jehovah .
james , a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ , to the twelve tribes which are of the dispersion , greeting .
count it all joy , my brethren , when ye fall into manifold temptations ;
knowing that the proving of your faith worketh patience .
and let patience have its perfect work , that ye may be perfect and entire , lacking in nothing .
but if any of you lacketh wisdom , let him ask of god , who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given him .
but let him ask in faith , nothing doubting : for he that doubteth is like the surge of the sea driven by the wind and tossed .
for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the lord ;
a doubleminded man , unstable in all his ways .
but let the brother of low degree glory in his high estate :
and the rich , in that he is made low : because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away .
but each man is tempted , when he is drawn away by his own lust , and enticed .
then the lust , when it hath conceived , beareth sin : and the sin , when it is fullgrown , bringeth forth death .
be not deceived , my beloved brethren .
of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth , that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures .
ye know this , my beloved brethren . but let every man be swift to hear , slow to speak , slow to wrath :
for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god .
wherefore putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness , receive with meekness the implanted word , which is able to save your souls .
but be ye doers of the word , and not hearers only , deluding your own selves .
for if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror :
for he beholdeth himself , and goeth away , and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was .
if any man thinketh himself to be religious , while he bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his heart , this man ’ s religion is vain .
my brethren , hold not the faith of our lord jesus christ , the lord of glory , with respect of persons .
for if there come into your synagogue a man with a gold ring , in fine clothing , and there come in also a poor man in vile clothing ;
do ye not make distinctions among yourselves , and become judges with evil thoughts ?
but ye have dishonored the poor man . do not the rich oppress you , and themselves drag you before the judgment-seats ?
do not they blaspheme the honorable name by which ye are called ?
howbeit if ye fulfil the royal law , according to the scripture , thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself , ye do well :
but if ye have respect of persons , ye commit sin , being convicted by the law as transgressors .
for whosoever shall keep the whole law , and yet stumble in one point , he is become guilty of all .
so speak ye , and so do , as men that are to be judged by a law of liberty .
for judgment is without mercy to him that hath showed no mercy : mercy glorieth against judgment .
what doth it profit , my brethren , if a man say he hath faith , but have not works ? can that faith save him ?
if a brother or sister be naked and in lack of daily food ,
even so faith , if it have not works , is dead in itself .
thou believest that god is one ; thou doest well : the demons also believe , and shudder .
but wilt thou know , o vain man , that faith apart from works is barren ?
was not abraham our father justified by works , in that he offered up isaac his son upon the altar ?
thou seest that faith wrought with his works , and by works was faith made perfect ;
ye see that by works a man is justified , and not only by faith .
and in like manner was not also rahab the harlot justified by works , in that she received the messengers , and sent them out another way ?
for as the body apart from the spirit is dead , even so faith apart from works is dead .
be not many of you teachers , my brethren , knowing that we shall receive heavier judgment .
for in many things we all stumble . if any stumbleth not in word , the same is a perfect man , able to bridle the whole body also .
now if we put the horses ’ bridles into their mouths that they may obey us , we turn about their whole body also .
so the tongue also is a little member , and boasteth great things . behold , how much wood is kindled by how small a fire !
for every kind of beasts and birds , of creeping things and things in the sea , is tamed , and hath been tamed by mankind :
but the tongue can no man tame ; it is a restless evil , it is full of deadly poison .
therewith bless we the lord and father ; and therewith curse we men , who are made after the likeness of god :
out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing . my brethren , these things ought not so to be .
doth the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet water and bitter ?
can a fig tree , my brethren , yield olives , or a vine figs ? neither can salt water yield sweet .
who is wise and understanding among you ? let him show by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom .
but if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart , glory not and lie not against the truth .
this wisdom is not a wisdom that cometh down from above , but is earthly , sensual , devilish .
for where jealousy and faction are , there is confusion and every vile deed .
and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace .
whence come wars and whence come fightings among you ? come they not hence , even of your pleasures that war in your members ?
ye ask , and receive not , because ye ask amiss , that ye may spend it in your pleasures .
or think ye that the scripture speaketh in vain ? doth the spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying ?
but he giveth more grace . wherefore the scripture saith , god resisteth the proud , but giveth grace to the humble .
be subject therefore unto god ; but resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
draw nigh to god , and he will draw nigh to you . cleanse your hands , ye sinners ; and purify your hearts , ye doubleminded .
be afflicted , and mourn , and weep : let your laughter be turned to mourning , and your joy to heaviness .
humble yourselves in the sight of the lord , and he shall exalt you .
one only is the lawgiver and judge , even he who is able to save and to destroy : but who art thou that judgest thy neighbor ?
come now , ye that say , to-day or to-morrow we will go into this city , and spend a year there , and trade , and get gain :
for that ye ought to say , if the lord will , we shall both live , and do this or that .
but now ye glory in your vauntings : all such glorying is evil .
to him therefore that knoweth to do good , and doeth it not , to him it is sin .
come now , ye rich , weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you .
your riches are corrupted , and your garments are moth-eaten .
ye have lived delicately on the earth , and taken your pleasure ; ye have nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter .
ye have condemned , ye have killed the righteous one ; he doth not resist you .
be ye also patient ; establish your hearts : for the coming of the lord is at hand .
murmur not , brethren , one against another , that ye be not judged : behold , the judge standeth before the doors .
take , brethren , for an example of suffering and of patience , the prophets who spake in the name of the lord .
is any among you suffering ? let him pray . is any cheerful ? let him sing praise .
and he prayed again ; and the heaven gave rain , and the earth brought forth her fruit .
my brethren , if any among you err from the truth , and one convert him ;
peter , an apostle of jesus christ , to the elect who are sojourners of the dispersion in pontus , galatia , cappadocia , asia , and bithynia ,
unto an inheritance incorruptible , and undefiled , and that fadeth not away , reserved in heaven for you ,
who by the power of god are guarded through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
wherein ye greatly rejoice , though now for a little while , if need be , ye have been put to grief in manifold trials ,
receiving the end of your faith , even the salvation of your souls .
concerning which salvation the prophets sought and searched diligently , who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you :
as children of obedience , not fashioning yourselves according to your former lusts in the time of your ignorance :
but like as he who called you is holy , be ye yourselves also holy in all manner of living ;
because it is written , ye shall be holy ; for i am holy .
knowing that ye were redeemed , not with corruptible things , with silver or gold , from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers ;
but with precious blood , as of a lamb without blemish and without spot , even the blood of christ :
who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world , but was manifested at the end of the times for your sake ,
seeing ye have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth unto unfeigned love of the brethren , love one another from the heart fervently :
having been begotten again , not of corruptible seed , but of incorruptible , through the word of god , which liveth and abideth .
but the word of the lord abideth for ever .
putting away therefore all wickedness , and all guile , and hypocrisies , and envies , and all evil speakings ,
as newborn babes , long for the spiritual milk which is without guile , that ye may grow thereby unto salvation ;
if ye have tasted that the lord is gracious :
unto whom coming , a living stone , rejected indeed of men , but with god elect , precious ,
because it is contained in scripture ,
for you therefore that believe is the preciousness : but for such as disbelieve ,
who in time past were no people , but now are the people of god : who had not obtained mercy , but now have obtained mercy .
beloved , i beseech you as sojourners and pilgrims , to abstain from fleshly lusts , which war against the soul ;
be subject to every ordinance of man for the lord ’ s sake : whether to the king , as supreme ;
or unto governors , as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to them that do well .
for so is the will of god , that by well-doing ye should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men :
as free , and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness , but as bondservants of god .
honor all men . love the brotherhood . fear god . honor the king .
servants , be in subjection to your masters with all fear ; not only to the good and gentle , but also to the froward .
for this is acceptable , if for conscience toward god a man endureth griefs , suffering wrongfully .
for hereunto were ye called : because christ also suffered for you , leaving you an example , that ye should follow his steps :
who did no sin , neither was guile found in his mouth :
who , when he was reviled , reviled not again ; when he suffered , threatened not ; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously :
for ye were going astray like sheep ; but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls .
beholding your chaste behavior coupled with fear .
whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of braiding the hair , and of wearing jewels of gold , or of putting on apparel ;
for after this manner aforetime the holy women also , who hoped in god , adorned themselves , being in subjection to their own husbands :
as sarah obeyed abraham , calling him lord : whose children ye now are , if ye do well , and are not put in fear by any terror .
finally , be ye all likeminded , compassionate , loving as brethren , tenderhearted , humbleminded :
not rendering evil for evil , or reviling for reviling ; but contrariwise blessing ; for hereunto were ye called , that ye should inherit a blessing .
and let him turn away from evil , and do good ;
for the eyes of the lord are upon the righteous ,
and who is he that will harm you , if ye be zealous of that which is good ?
but even if ye should suffer for righteousness ’ sake , blessed are ye : and fear not their fear , neither be troubled ;
having a good conscience ; that , wherein ye are spoken against , they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in christ .
for it is better , if the will of god should so will , that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing .
in which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison ,
who is on the right hand of god , having gone into heaven ; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him .
that ye no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh to the lusts of men , but to the will of god .
wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them into the same excess of riot , speaking evil of you :
who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead .
but the end of all things is at hand : be ye therefore of sound mind , and be sober unto prayer :
above all things being fervent in your love among yourselves ; for love covereth a multitude of sins :
using hospitality one to another without murmuring :
according as each hath received a gift , ministering it among yourselves , as good stewards of the manifold grace of god ;
beloved , think it not strange concerning the fiery trial among you , which cometh upon you to prove you , as though a strange thing happened unto you :
but insomuch as ye are partakers of christ ’ s sufferings , rejoice ; that at the revelation of his glory also ye may rejoice with exceeding joy .
if ye are reproached for the name of christ , blessed are ye ; because the spirit of glory and the spirit of god resteth upon you .
for let none of you suffer as a murderer , or a thief , or an evil-doer , or as a meddler in other men ’ s matters :
but if a man suffer as a christian , let him not be ashamed ; but let him glorify god in this name .
and if the righteous is scarcely saved , where shall the ungodly and sinner appear ?
wherefore let them also that suffer according to the will of god commit their souls in well-doing unto a faithful creator .
neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you , but making yourselves ensamples to the flock .
and when the chief shepherd shall be manifested , ye shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away .
humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god , that he may exalt you in due time ;
casting all your anxiety upon him , because he careth for you .
be sober , be watchful : your adversary the devil , as a roaring lion , walketh about , seeking whom he may devour :
whom withstand stedfast in your faith , knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your brethren who are in the world .
to him be the dominion for ever and ever . amen .
she that is in babylon , elect together with you , saluteth you ; and so doth mark my son .
salute one another with a kiss of love .
grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord ;
yea , and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence , in your faith supply virtue ; and in your virtue knowledge ;
and in your knowledge self-control ; and in your self-control patience ; and in your patience godliness ;
and in your godliness brotherly kindness ; and in your brotherly kindness love .
for if these things are yours and abound , they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful unto the knowledge of our lord jesus christ .
for he that lacketh these things is blind , seeing only what is near , having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins .
wherefore , brethren , give the more diligence to make your calling and election sure : for if ye do these things , ye shall never stumble :
for thus shall be richly supplied unto you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ .
and i think it right , as long as i am in this tabernacle , to stir you up by putting you in remembrance ;
knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle cometh swiftly , even as our lord jesus christ signified unto me .
yea , i will give diligence that at every time ye may be able after my decease to call these things to remembrance .
and this voice we ourselves heard borne out of heaven , when we were with him in the holy mount .
knowing this first , that no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation .
for no prophecy ever came by the will of man : but men spake from god , being moved by the holy spirit .
and many shall follow their lascivious doings ; by reason of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken of .
and in covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you : whose sentence now from of old lingereth not , and their destruction slumbereth not .
and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow , having made them an example unto those that should live ungodly ;
and delivered righteous lot , sore distressed by the lascivious life of the wicked
( for that righteous man dwelling among them , in seeing and hearing , vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their lawless deeds ) :
the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation , and to keep the unrighteous under punishment unto the day of judgment ;
but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement , and despise dominion . daring , self-willed , they tremble not to rail at dignities :
whereas angels , though greater in might and power , bring not a railing judgment against them before the lord .
having eyes full of adultery , and that can not cease from sin ; enticing unstedfast souls ; having a heart exercised in covetousness ; children of cursing ;
forsaking the right way , they went astray , having followed the way of balaam the son of beor , who loved the hire of wrong-doing ;
but he was rebuked for his own transgression : a dumb ass spake with man ’ s voice and stayed the madness of the prophet .
these are springs without water , and mists driven by a storm ; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved .
promising them liberty , while they themselves are bondservants of corruption ; for of whom a man is overcome , of the same is he also brought into bondage .
that ye should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets , and the commandment of the lord and saviour through your apostles :
knowing this first , that in the last days mockers shall come with mockery , walking after their own lusts ,
by which means the world that then was , being overflowed with water , perished :
but forget not this one thing , beloved , that one day is with the lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
seeing that these things are thus all to be dissolved , what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy living and godliness ,
but , according to his promise , we look for new heavens and a new earth , wherein dwelleth righteousness .
wherefore , beloved , seeing that ye look for these things , give diligence that ye may be found in peace , without spot and blameless in his sight .
ye therefore , beloved , knowing these things beforehand , beware lest , being carried away with the error of the wicked , ye fall from your own stedfastness .
but grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord and saviour jesus christ . to him be the glory both now and for ever . amen .
and these things we write , that our joy may be made full .
and this is the message which we have heard from him and announce unto you , that god is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness , we lie , and do not the truth :
if we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
if we confess our sins , he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins , and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness .
if we say that we have not sinned , we make him a liar , and his word is not in us .
and he is the propitiation for our sins ; and not for ours only , but also for the whole world .
and hereby we know that we know him , if we keep his commandments .
he that saith , i know him , and keepeth not his commandments , is a liar , and the truth is not in him ;
but whoso keepeth his word , in him verily hath the love of god been perfected . hereby we know that we are in him :
he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked .
he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother , is in the darkness even until now .
he that loveth his brother abideth in the light , and there is no occasion of stumbling in him .
i write unto you , my little children , because your sins are forgiven you for his name ’ s sake .
and the world passeth away , and the lust thereof : but he that doeth the will of god abideth for ever .
and ye have an anointing from the holy one , and ye know all things .
i have not written unto you because ye know not the truth , but because ye know it , and because no lie is of the truth .
who is the liar but he that denieth that jesus is the christ ? this is the antichrist , even he that denieth the father and the son .
whosoever denieth the son , the same hath not the father : he that confesseth the son hath the father also .
and this is the promise which he promised us , even the life eternal .
these things have i written unto you concerning them that would lead you astray .
if ye know that he is righteous , ye know that every one also that doeth righteousness is begotten of him .
and every one that hath this hope set on him purifieth himself , even as he is pure .
every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness ; and sin is lawlessness .
and ye know that he was manifested to take away sins ; and in him is no sin .
whosoever abideth in him sinneth not : whosoever sinneth hath not seen him , neither knoweth him .
my little children , let no man lead you astray : he that doeth righteousness is righteous , even as he is righteous :
whosoever is begotten of god doeth no sin , because his seed abideth in him : and he can not sin , because he is begotten of god .
for this is the message which ye heard from the beginning , that we should love one another :
marvel not , brethren , if the world hateth you .
we know that we have passed out of death into life , because we love the brethren . he that loveth not abideth in death .
whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer : and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him .
hereby know we love , because he laid down his life for us : and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
my little children , let us not love in word , neither with the tongue ; but in deed and truth .
hereby shall we know that we are of the truth , and shall assure our heart before him :
because if our heart condemn us , god is greater than our heart , and knoweth all things .
beloved , if our heart condemn us not , we have boldness toward god ;
and whatsoever we ask we receive of him , because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight .
beloved , believe not every spirit , but prove the spirits , whether they are of god ; because many false prophets are gone out into the world .
hereby know ye the spirit of god : every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god :
ye are of god , my little children , and have overcome them : because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world .
they are of the world : therefore speak they as of the world , and the world heareth them .
beloved , let us love one another : for love is of god ; and every one that loveth is begotten of god , and knoweth god .
he that loveth not knoweth not god ; for god is love .
herein was the love of god manifested in us , that god hath sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him .
herein is love , not that we loved god , but that he loved us , and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins .
beloved , if god so loved us , we also ought to love one another .
no man hath beheld god at any time : if we love one another , god abideth in us , and his love is perfected in us :
hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us , because he hath given us of his spirit .
and we have beheld and bear witness that the father hath sent the son to be the saviour of the world .
whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god , god abideth in him , and he in god .
there is no fear in love : but perfect love casteth out fear , because fear hath punishment ; and he that feareth is not made perfect in love .
we love , because he first loved us .
and this commandment have we from him , that he who loveth god love his brother also .
whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is begotten of god : and whosoever loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him .
hereby we know that we love the children of god , when we love god and do his commandments .
for this is the love of god , that we keep his commandments : and his commandments are not grievous .
for whatsoever is begotten of god overcometh the world : and this is the victory that hath overcome the world , even our faith .
and who is he that overcometh the world , but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god ?
this is he that came by water and blood , even jesus christ ; not with the water only , but with the water and with the blood .
and it is the spirit that beareth witness , because the spirit is the truth .
for there are three who bear witness , the spirit , and the water , and the blood : and the three agree in one .
and the witness is this , that god gave unto us eternal life , and this life is in his son .
he that hath the son hath the life ; he that hath not the son of god hath not the life .
and this is the boldness which we have toward him , that , if we ask anything according to his will , he heareth us :
and if we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask , we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him .
all unrighteousness is sin : and there is a sin not unto death .
we know that whosoever is begotten of god sinneth not ; but he that was begotten of god keepeth himself , and the evil one toucheth him not .
we know that we are of god , and the whole world lieth in the evil one .
my little children , guard yourselves from idols .
the elder unto the elect lady and her children , whom i love in truth ; and not i only , but also all they that know the truth ;
for the truth ’ s sake which abideth in us , and it shall be with us for ever :
i rejoice greatly that i have found certain of thy children walking in truth , even as we received commandment from the father .
look to yourselves , that ye lose not the things which we have wrought , but that ye receive a full reward .
if any one cometh unto you , and bringeth not this teaching , receive him not into your house , and give him no greeting :
for he that giveth him greeting partaketh in his evil works .
the children of thine elect sister salute thee .
the elder unto gaius the beloved , whom i love in truth .
beloved , i pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health , even as thy soul prospereth .
for i rejoiced greatly , when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth , even as thou walkest in truth .
greater joy have i none than this , to hear of my children walking in the truth .
beloved , thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal ;
who bare witness to thy love before the church : whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of god :
because that for the sake of the name they went forth , taking nothing of the gentiles .
we therefore ought to welcome such , that we may be fellow-workers for the truth .
i wrote somewhat unto the church : but diotrephes , who loveth to have the preeminence among them , receiveth us not .
demetrius hath the witness of all men , and of the truth itself : yea , we also bear witness ; and thou knowest that our witness is true .
i had many things to write unto thee , but i am unwilling to write them to thee with ink and pen :
the words of jeremiah the son of hilkiah , of the priests that were in anathoth in the land of benjamin :
to whom the word of jehovah came in the days of josiah the son of amon , king of judah , in the thirteenth year of his reign .
now the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
then said i , ah , lord jehovah ! behold , i know not how to speak ; for i am a child .
be not afraid because of them ; for i am with thee to deliver thee , saith jehovah .
then jehovah put forth his hand , and touched my mouth ; and jehovah said unto me , behold , i have put my words in thy mouth :
moreover the word of jehovah came unto me , saying , jeremiah , what seest thou ? and i said , i see a rod of an almond-tree .
then said jehovah unto me , thou hast well seen : for i watch over my word to perform it .
then jehovah said unto me , out of the north evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land .
and they shall fight against thee ; but they shall not prevail against thee : for i am with thee , saith jehovah , to deliver thee .
and the word of jehovah came to me , saying ,
israel was holiness unto jehovah , the first-fruits of his increase : all that devour him shall be held guilty ; evil shall come upon them , saith jehovah .
hear ye the word of jehovah , o house of jacob , and all the families of the house of israel :
wherefore i will yet contend with you , saith jehovah , and with your children ’ s children will i contend .
hath a nation changed its gods , which yet are no gods ? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit .
be astonished , o ye heavens , at this , and be horribly afraid , be ye very desolate , saith jehovah .
is israel a servant ? is he a home-born slave ? why is he become a prey ?
the young lions have roared upon him , and yelled ; and they have made his land waste : his cities are burned up , without inhabitant .
the children also of memphis and tahpanhes have broken the crown of thy head .
hast thou not procured this unto thyself , in that thou hast forsaken jehovah thy god , when he led thee by the way ?
yet i had planted thee a noble vine , wholly a right seed : how then art thou turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine unto me ?
for though thou wash thee with lye , and take thee much soap , yet thine iniquity is marked before me , saith the lord jehovah .
wherefore will ye contend with me ? ye all have transgressed against me , saith jehovah .
in vain have i smitten your children ; they received no correction : your own sword hath devoured your prophets , like a destroying lion .
can a virgin forget her ornaments , or a bride her attire ? yet my people have forgotten me days without number .
how trimmest thou thy way to seek love ! therefore even the wicked women hast thou taught thy ways .
why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way ? thou shalt be ashamed of egypt also , as thou wast ashamed of assyria .
therefore the showers have been withholden , and there hath been no latter rain ; yet thou hadst a harlot ’ s forehead , thou refusedst to be ashamed .
wilt thou not from this time cry unto me , my father , thou art the guide of my youth ?
and i said after she had done all these things , she will return unto me ; but she returned not : and her treacherous sister judah saw it .
and it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom , that the land was polluted , and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks .
and yet for all this her treacherous sister judah hath not returned unto me with her whole heart , but feignedly , saith jehovah .
and jehovah said unto me , backsliding israel hath showed herself more righteous than treacherous judah .
and i will give you shepherds according to my heart , who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding .
surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband , so have ye dealt treacherously with me , o house of israel , saith jehovah .
return , ye backsliding children , i will heal your backslidings .
but the shameful thing hath devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth , their flocks and their herds , their sons and their daughters .
for thus saith jehovah to the men of judah and to jerusalem , break up your fallow ground , and sow not among thorns .
set up a standard toward zion : flee for safety , stay not ; for i will bring evil from the north , and a great destruction .
for this gird you with sackcloth , lament and wail ; for the fierce anger of jehovah is not turned back from us .
a full wind from these shall come for me : now will i also utter judgments against them .
o jerusalem , wash thy heart from wickedness , that thou mayest be saved . how long shall thine evil thoughts lodge within thee ?
for a voice declareth from dan , and publisheth evil from the hills of ephraim .
as keepers of a field are they against her round about , because she hath been rebellious against me , saith jehovah .
thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee ; this is thy wickedness ; for it is bitter , for it reacheth unto thy heart .
destruction upon destruction is cried ; for the whole land is laid waste : suddenly are my tents destroyed , and my curtains in a moment .
how long shall i see the standard , and hear the sound of the trumpet ?
i beheld the earth , and , lo , it was waste and void ; and the heavens , and they had no light .
i beheld the mountains , and , lo , they trembled , and all the hills moved to and fro .
i beheld , and , lo , there was no man , and all the birds of the heavens were fled .
for thus saith jehovah , the whole land shall be a desolation ; yet will i not make a full end .
and though they say , as jehovah liveth ; surely they swear falsely .
then i said , surely these are poor ; they are foolish ; for they know not the way of jehovah , nor the law of their god :
they were as fed horses roaming at large ; every one neighed after his neighbor ’ s wife .
shall i not visit for these things ? saith jehovah ; and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
go ye up upon her walls , and destroy ; but make not a full end : take away her branches ; for they are not jehovah ’ s .
for the house of israel and the house of judah have dealt very treacherously against me , saith jehovah .
they have denied jehovah , and said , it is not he ; neither shall evil come upon us ; neither shall we see sword nor famine :
and the prophets shall become wind , and the word is not in them : thus shall it be done unto them .
their quiver is an open sepulchre , they are all mighty men .
but even in those days , saith jehovah , i will not make a full end with you .
declare ye this in the house of jacob , and publish it in judah , saying ,
hear now this , o foolish people , and without understanding ; that have eyes , and see not ; that have ears , and hear not :
but this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart ; they are revolted and gone .
your iniquities have turned away these things , and your sins have withholden good from you .
for among my people are found wicked men : they watch , as fowlers lie in wait ; they set a trap , they catch men .
as a cage is full of birds , so are their houses full of deceit : therefore they are become great , and waxed rich .
shall i not visit for these things ? saith jehovah ; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
a wonderful and horrible thing is come to pass in the land :
the comely and delicate one , the daughter of zion , will i cut off .
shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her ; they shall pitch their tents against her round about ; they shall feed every one in his place .
arise , and let us go up by night , and let us destroy her palaces .
be thou instructed , o jerusalem , lest my soul be alienated from thee ; lest i make thee a desolation , a land not inhabited .
thus saith jehovah of hosts , they shall thoroughly glean the remnant of israel as a vine : turn again thy hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets .
they have healed also the hurt of my people slightly , saying , peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
and i set watchmen over you , saying , hearken to the sound of the trumpet ; but they said , we will not hearken .
therefore hear , ye nations , and know , o congregation , what is among them .
thus saith jehovah , behold , a people cometh from the north country ; and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth .
we have heard the report thereof ; our hands wax feeble : anguish hath taken hold of us , and pangs as of a woman in travail .
go not forth into the field , nor walk by the way ; for the sword of the enemy , and terror , are on every side .
i have made thee a trier and a fortress among my people ; that thou mayest know and try their way .
they are all grievous revolters , going about with slanders ; they are brass and iron : they all of them deal corruptly .
the bellows blow fiercely ; the lead is consumed of the fire : in vain do they go on refining ; for the wicked are not plucked away .
refuse silver shall men call them , because jehovah hath rejected them .
the word that came to jeremiah from jehovah , saying ,
thus saith jehovah of hosts , the god of israel , amend your ways and your doings , and i will cause you to dwell in this place .
trust ye not in lying words , saying , the temple of jehovah , the temple of jehovah , the temple of jehovah , are these .
for if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings ; if ye thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor ;
then will i cause you to dwell in this place , in the land that i gave to your fathers , from of old even for evermore .
behold , ye trust in lying words , that can not profit .
and i will cast you out of my sight , as i have cast out all your brethren , even the whole seed of ephraim .
therefore pray not thou for this people , neither lift up cry nor prayer for them , neither make intercession to me ; for i will not hear thee .
seest thou not what they do in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem ?
do they provoke me to anger ? saith jehovah ; do they not provoke themselves , to the confusion of their own faces ?
thus saith jehovah of hosts , the god of israel : add your burnt-offerings unto your sacrifices , and eat ye flesh .
for i spake not unto your fathers , nor commanded them in the day that i brought them out of the land of egypt , concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices :
yet they hearkened not unto me , nor inclined their ear , but made their neck stiff : they did worse than their fathers .
moreover thou shalt say unto them , thus saith jehovah : shall men fall , and not rise up again ? shall one turn away , and not return ?
why then is this people of jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding ? they hold fast deceit , they refuse to return .
and they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
we looked for peace , but no good came ; and for a time of healing , and , behold , dismay !
for , behold , i will send serpents , adders , among you , which will not be charmed ; and they shall bite you , saith jehovah .
oh that i could comfort myself against sorrow ! my heart is faint within me .
the harvest is past , the summer is ended , and we are not saved .
for the hurt of the daughter of my people am i hurt : i mourn ; dismay hath taken hold on me .
is there no balm in gilead ? is there no physician there ? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered ?
thy habitation is in the midst of deceit ; through deceit they refuse to know me , saith jehovah .
shall i not visit them for these things ? saith jehovah ; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
and i will make jerusalem heaps , a dwelling-place of jackals ; and i will make the cities of judah a desolation , without inhabitant .
and jehovah saith , because they have forsaken my law which i set before them , and have not obeyed my voice , neither walked therein ,
but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart , and after the baalim , which their fathers taught them ;
behold , the days come , saith jehovah , that i will punish all them that are circumcised in their uncircumcision :
hear ye the word which jehovah speaketh unto you , o house of israel :
thus saith jehovah , learn not the way of the nations , and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven ; for the nations are dismayed at them .
they deck it with silver and with gold ; they fasten it with nails and with hammers , that it move not .
there is none like unto thee , o jehovah ; thou art great , and thy name is great in might .
but they are together brutish and foolish : the instruction of idols ! it is but a stock .
he hath made the earth by his power , he hath established the world by his wisdom , and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens .
they are vanity , a work of delusion : in the time of their visitation they shall perish .
gather up thy wares out of the land , o thou that abidest in the siege .
woe is me because of my hurt ! my wound is grievous : but i said , truly this is my grief , and i must bear it .
for the shepherds are become brutish , and have not inquired of jehovah : therefore they have not prospered , and all their flocks are scattered .
o jehovah , i know that the way of man is not in himself ; it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps .
o jehovah , correct me , but in measure ; not in thine anger , lest thou bring me to nothing .
the word that came to jeremiah from jehovah , saying ,
hear ye the words of this covenant , and speak unto the men of judah , and to the inhabitants of jerusalem ;
and say thou unto them , thus saith jehovah , the god of israel : cursed be the man that heareth not the words of this covenant ,
and jehovah said unto me , a conspiracy is found among the men of judah , and among the inhabitants of jerusalem .
and jehovah gave me knowledge of it , and i knew it : then thou showedst me their doings .
and there shall be no remnant unto them : for i will bring evil upon the men of anathoth , even the year of their visitation .
i have forsaken my house , i have cast off my heritage ; i have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies .
my heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest : she hath uttered her voice against me ; therefore i have hated her .
many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard , they have trodden my portion under foot , they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness .
they have made it a desolation ; it mourneth unto me , being desolate ; the whole land is made desolate , because no man layeth it to heart .
but if they will not hear , then will i pluck up that nation , plucking up and destroying it , saith jehovah .
thus saith jehovah unto me , go , and buy thee a linen girdle , and put it upon thy loins , and put it not in water .
so i bought a girdle according to the word of jehovah , and put it upon my loins .
and the word of jehovah came unto me the second time , saying ,
so i went , and hid it by the euphrates , as jehovah commanded me .
then the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
thus saith jehovah , after this manner will i mar the pride of judah , and the great pride of jerusalem .
hear ye , and give ear ; be not proud ; for jehovah hath spoken .
say thou unto the king and to the queen-mother , humble yourselves , sit down ; for your headtires are come down , even the crown of your glory .
lift up your eyes , and behold them that come from the north : where is the flock that was given thee , thy beautiful flock ?
can the ethiopian change his skin , or the leopard his spots ? then may ye also do good , that are accustomed to do evil .
therefore will i scatter them , as the stubble that passeth away , by the wind of the wilderness .
this is thy lot , the portion measured unto thee from me , saith jehovah ; because thou hast forgotten me , and trusted in falsehood .
therefore will i also uncover thy skirts upon thy face , and thy shame shall appear .
the word of jehovah that came to jeremiah concerning the drought .
judah mourneth , and the gates thereof languish , they sit in black upon the ground ; and the cry of jerusalem is gone up .
because of the ground which is cracked , for that no rain hath been in the land , the plowmen are put to shame , they cover their heads .
yea , the hind also in the field calveth , and forsaketh her young , because there is no grass .
and the wild asses stand on the bare heights , they pant for air like jackals ; their eyes fail , because there is no herbage .
and jehovah said unto me , pray not for this people for their good .
we acknowledge , o jehovah , our wickedness , and the iniquity of our fathers ; for we have sinned against thee .
do not abhor us , for thy name ’ s sake ; do not disgrace the throne of thy glory : remember , break not thy covenant with us .
for who will have pity upon thee , o jerusalem ? or who will bemoan thee ? or who will turn aside to ask of thy welfare ?
can one break iron , even iron from the north , and brass ?
thy substance and thy treasures will i give for a spoil without price , and that for all thy sins , even in all thy borders .
and i will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked , and i will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible .
the word of jehovah came also unto me , saying ,
thou shalt not take thee a wife , neither shalt thou have sons or daughters , in this place .
and thou shalt not go into the house of feasting to sit with them , to eat and to drink .
for mine eyes are upon all their ways ; they are not hid from my face , neither is their iniquity concealed from mine eyes .
shall a man make unto himself gods , which yet are no gods ?
whilst their children remember their altars and their asherim by the green trees upon the high hills .
thus saith jehovah : cursed is the man that trusteth in man , and maketh flesh his arm , and whose heart departeth from jehovah .
blessed is the man that trusteth in jehovah , and whose trust jehovah is .
the heart is deceitful above all things , and it is exceedingly corrupt : who can know it ?
a glorious throne , set on high from the beginning , is the place of our sanctuary .
heal me , o jehovah , and i shall be healed ; save me , and i shall be saved : for thou art my praise .
behold , they say unto me , where is the word of jehovah ? let it come now .
be not a terror unto me : thou art my refuge in the day of evil .
thus saith jehovah , take heed to yourselves , and bear no burden on the sabbath day , nor bring it in by the gates of jerusalem ;
but they hearkened not , neither inclined their ear , but made their neck stiff , that they might not hear , and might not receive instruction .
the word which came to jeremiah from jehovah , saying ,
arise , and go down to the potter ’ s house , and there i will cause thee to hear my words .
then i went down to the potter ’ s house , and , behold , he was making a work on the wheels .
then the word of jehovah came to me , saying ,
at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdom , to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it ;
if that nation , concerning which i have spoken , turn from their evil , i will repent of the evil that i thought to do unto them .
and at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdom , to build and to plant it ;
therefore thus saith jehovah : ask ye now among the nations , who hath heard such things ; the virgin of israel hath done a very horrible thing .
shall the snow of lebanon fail from the rock of the field ? or shall the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up ?
to make their land an astonishment , and a perpetual hissing ; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished , and shake his head .
give heed to me , o jehovah , and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me .
and i will make this city an astonishment , and a hissing ; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof .
then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee ,
thus will i do unto this place , saith jehovah , and to the inhabitants thereof , even making this city as topheth :
now pashhur , the son of immer the priest , who was chief officer in the house of jehovah , heard jeremiah prophesying these things .
then pashhur smote jeremiah the prophet , and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of benjamin , which was in the house of jehovah .
sing unto jehovah , praise ye jehovah ; for he hath delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evil-doers .
cursed be the day wherein i was born : let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed .
cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father , saying , a man-child is born unto thee ; making him very glad .
because he slew me not from the womb ; and so my mother would have been my grave , and her womb always great .
wherefore came i forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow , that my days should be consumed with shame ?
then said jeremiah unto them , thus shall ye say to zedekiah :
and i myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm , even in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation .
and i will smite the inhabitants of this city , both man and beast : they shall die of a great pestilence .
and unto this people thou shalt say , thus saith jehovah : behold , i set before you the way of life and the way of death .
and touching the house of the king of judah , hear ye the word of jehovah :
thus said jehovah : go down to the house of the king of judah , and speak there this word ,
but if ye will not hear these words , i swear by myself , saith jehovah , that this house shall become a desolation .
and i will prepare destroyers against thee , every one with his weapons ; and they shall cut down thy choice cedars , and cast them into the fire .
and many nations shall pass by this city , and they shall say every man to his neighbor , wherefore hath jehovah done thus unto this great city ?
then they shall answer , because they forsook the covenant of jehovah their god , and worshipped other gods , and served them .
but in the place whither they have led him captive , there shall he die , and he shall see this land no more .
he judged the cause of the poor and needy ; then it was well . was not this to know me ? saith jehovah .
he shall be buried with the burial of an ass , drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of jerusalem .
go up to lebanon , and cry ; and lift up thy voice in bashan , and cry from abarim ; for all thy lovers are destroyed .
the wind shall feed all thy shepherds , and thy lovers shall go into captivity : surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness .
and i will cast thee out , and thy mother that bare thee , into another country , where ye were not born ; and there shall ye die .
but to the land whereunto their soul longeth to return , thither shall they not return .
o earth , earth , earth , hear the word of jehovah .
woe unto the shepherds that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture ! saith jehovah .
in his days judah shall be saved , and israel shall dwell safely ; and this is his name whereby he shall be called : jehovah our righteousness .
for both prophet and priest are profane ; yea , in my house have i found their wickedness , saith jehovah .
and i have seen folly in the prophets of samaria ; they prophesied by baal , and caused my people israel to err .
for who hath stood in the council of jehovah , that he should perceive and hear his word ? who hath marked my word , and heard it ?
i sent not these prophets , yet they ran : i spake not unto them , yet they prophesied .
am i a god at hand , saith jehovah , and not a god afar off ?
can any hide himself in secret places so that i shall not see him ? saith jehovah . do not i fill heaven and earth ? saith jehovah .
i have heard what the prophets have said , that prophesy lies in my name , saying , i have dreamed , i have dreamed .
how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies , even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart ?
is not my word like fire ? saith jehovah ; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces ?
therefore , behold , i am against the prophets , saith jehovah , that steal my words every one from his neighbor .
behold , i am against the prophets , saith jehovah , that use their tongues , and say , he saith .
thus shall ye say every one to his neighbor , and every one to his brother , what hath jehovah answered ? and , what hath jehovah spoken ?
thus shalt thou say to the prophet , what hath jehovah answered thee ? and , what hath jehovah spoken ?
and i will bring an everlasting reproach upon you , and a perpetual shame , which shall not be forgotten .
and the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
which jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of judah , and to all the inhabitants of jerusalem , saying :
yet ye have not hearkened unto me , saith jehovah ; that ye may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt .
therefore thus saith jehovah of hosts : because ye have not heard my words ,
and this whole land shall be a desolation , and an astonishment ; and these nations shall serve the king of babylon seventy years .
and they shall drink , and reel to and fro , and be mad , because of the sword that i will send among them .
then took i the cup at jehovah ’ s hand , and made all the nations to drink , unto whom jehovah had sent me :
pharaoh king of egypt , and his servants , and his princes , and all his people ;
edom , and moab , and the children of ammon ;
and all the kings of tyre , and all the kings of sidon , and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea ;
dedan , and tema , and buz , and all that have the corners of their hair cut off ;
and all the kings of arabia , and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the wilderness ;
and all the kings of zimri , and all the kings of elam , and all the kings of the medes ;
and the shepherds shall have no way to flee , nor the principal of the flock to escape .
a voice of the cry of the shepherds , and the wailing of the principal of the flock ! for jehovah layeth waste their pasture .
and the peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of jehovah .
in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah , king of judah , came this word from jehovah , saying ,
then will i make this house like shiloh , and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth .
and the priests and the prophets and all the people heard jeremiah speaking these words in the house of jehovah .
but as for me , behold , i am in your hand : do with me as is good and right in your eyes .
then rose up certain of the elders of the land , and spake to all the assembly of the people , saying ,
and jehoiakim the king sent men into egypt , namely , elnathan the son of achbor , and certain men with him , into egypt ;
in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah , king of judah , came this word unto jeremiah from jehovah , saying ,
thus saith jehovah to me : make thee bonds and bars , and put them upon thy neck ;
and give them a charge unto their masters , saying , thus saith jehovah of hosts , the god of israel , thus shall ye say unto your masters :
for they prophesy a lie unto you , to remove you far from your land , and that i should drive you out , and ye should perish .
hearken not unto them ; serve the king of babylon , and live : wherefore should this city become a desolation ?
thus speaketh jehovah of hosts , the god of israel , saying , i have broken the yoke of the king of babylon .
nevertheless hear thou now this word that i speak in thine ears , and in the ears of all the people :
then hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet jeremiah ’ s neck , and brake it .
then the word of jehovah came unto jeremiah , after that hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet jeremiah , saying ,
so hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month .
thus saith jehovah of hosts , the god of israel , unto all the captivity , whom i have caused to be carried away captive from jerusalem unto babylon :
build ye houses , and dwell in them ; and plant gardens , and eat the fruit of them .
for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name : i have not sent them , saith jehovah .
and ye shall call upon me , and ye shall go and pray unto me , and i will hearken unto you .
and ye shall seek me , and find me , when ye shall search for me with all your heart .
because ye have said , jehovah hath raised us up prophets in babylon ;
hear ye therefore the word of jehovah , all ye of the captivity , whom i have sent away from jerusalem to babylon .
and concerning shemaiah the nehelamite thou shalt speak , saying ,
now therefore , why hast thou not rebuked jeremiah of anathoth , who maketh himself a prophet to you ,
and zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of jeremiah the prophet .
then came the word of jehovah unto jeremiah , saying ,
the word that came to jeremiah from jehovah , saying ,
thus speaketh jehovah , the god of israel , saying , write thee all the words that i have spoken unto thee in a book .
and these are the words that jehovah spake concerning israel and concerning judah .
for thus saith jehovah : we have heard a voice of trembling , of fear , and not of peace .
but they shall serve jehovah their god , and david their king , whom i will raise up unto them .
for thus saith jehovah , thy hurt is incurable , and thy wound grievous .
there is none to plead thy cause , that thou mayest be bound up : thou hast no healing medicines .
their children also shall be as aforetime , and their congregation shall be established before me ; and i will punish all that oppress them .
and ye shall be my people , and i will be your god .
behold , the tempest of jehovah , even his wrath , is gone forth , a sweeping tempest : it shall burst upon the head of the wicked .
at that time , saith jehovah , will i be the god of all the families of israel , and they shall be my people .
thus saith jehovah , the people that were left of the sword found favor in the wilderness ; even israel , when i went to cause him to rest .
jehovah appeared of old unto me , saying , yea , i have loved thee with an everlasting love : therefore with lovingkindness have i drawn thee .
again shalt thou plant vineyards upon the mountains of samaria ; the planters shall plant , and shall enjoy the fruit thereof .
for jehovah hath ransomed jacob , and redeemed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he .
and i will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness , and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness , saith jehovah .
and there is hope for thy latter end , saith jehovah ; and thy children shall come again to their own border .
and judah and all the cities thereof shall dwell therein together , the husbandmen , and they that go about with flocks .
for i have satiated the weary soul , and every sorrowful soul have i replenished .
upon this i awaked , and beheld ; and my sleep was sweet unto me .
in those days they shall say no more , the fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children ’ s teeth are set on edge .
but every one shall die for his own iniquity : every man that eateth the sour grapes , his teeth shall be set on edge .
behold , the days come , saith jehovah , that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel , and with the house of judah :
if these ordinances depart from before me , saith jehovah , then the seed of israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever .
behold , the days come , saith jehovah , that the city shall be built to jehovah from the tower of hananel unto the gate of the corner .
and the measuring line shall go out further straight onward unto the hill gareb , and shall turn about unto goah .
the word that came to jeremiah from jehovah in the tenth year of zedekiah king of judah , which was the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar .
and jeremiah said , the word of jehovah came unto me , saying ,
and i bought the field that was in anathoth of hanamel mine uncle ’ s son , and weighed him the money , even seventeen shekels of silver .
and i subscribed the deed , and sealed it , and called witnesses , and weighed him the money in the balances .
so i took the deed of the purchase , both that which was sealed , according to the law and custom , and that which was open :
and i charged baruch before them , saying ,
for thus saith jehovah of hosts , the god of israel : houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land .
now after i had delivered the deed of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah , i prayed unto jehovah , saying ,
and gavest them this land , which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them , a land flowing with milk and honey ;
then came the word of jehovah unto jeremiah , saying ,
behold , i am jehovah , the god of all flesh : is there anything too hard for me ?
but they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name , to defile it .
and they shall be my people , and i will be their god :
moreover the word of jehovah came unto jeremiah the second time , while he was yet shut up in the court of the guard , saying ,
thus saith jehovah that doeth it , jehovah that formeth it to establish it ; jehovah is his name :
call unto me , and i will answer thee , and will show thee great things , and difficult , which thou knowest not .
behold , i will bring it health and cure , and i will cure them ; and i will reveal unto them abundance of peace and truth .
and i will cause the captivity of judah and the captivity of israel to return , and will build them , as at the first .
in those days shall judah be saved , and jerusalem shall dwell safely ; and this is the name whereby she shall be called : jehovah our righteousness .
for thus saith jehovah : david shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of israel ;
neither shall the priests the levites want a man before me to offer burnt-offerings , and to burn meal-offerings , and to do sacrifice continually .
and the word of jehovah came unto jeremiah , saying ,
and the word of jehovah came to jeremiah , saying ,
thus saith jehovah : if my covenant of day and night stand not , if i have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth ;
yet hear the word of jehovah , o zedekiah king of judah : thus saith jehovah concerning thee , thou shalt not die by the sword ;
then jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto zedekiah king of judah in jerusalem ,
therefore the word of jehovah came to jeremiah from jehovah , saying ,
the word which came unto jeremiah from jehovah in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah , king of judah , saying ,
and i set before the sons of the house of the rechabites bowls full of wine , and cups ; and i said unto them , drink ye wine .
nor to build houses for us to dwell in ; neither have we vineyard , nor field , nor seed :
but we have dwelt in tents , and have obeyed , and done according to all that jonadab our father commanded us .
then came the word of jehovah unto jeremiah , saying ,
therefore thus saith jehovah of hosts , the god of israel : jonadab the son of rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever .
and jeremiah commanded baruch , saying , i am shut up ; i can not go into the house of jehovah :
and when micaiah the son of gemariah , the son of shaphan , had heard out of the book all the words of jehovah ,
then micaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard , when baruch read the book in the ears of the people .
and they said unto him , sit down now , and read it in our ears . so baruch read it in their ears .
and they asked baruch , saying , tell us now , how didst thou write all these words at his mouth ?
then baruch answered them , he pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth , and i wrote them with ink in the book .
then said the princes unto baruch , go , hide thee , thou and jeremiah ; and let no man know where ye are .
now the king was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth month : and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him .
and they were not afraid , nor rent their garments , neither the king , nor any of his servants that heard all these words .
moreover elnathan and delaiah and gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll ; but he would not hear them .
take thee again another roll , and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll , which jehoiakim the king of judah hath burned .
now jeremiah came in and went out among the people ; for they had not put him into prison .
then came the word of jehovah unto the prophet jeremiah , saying ,
and the chaldeans shall come again , and fight against this city ; and they shall take it , and burn it with fire .
thus saith jehovah , deceive not yourselves , saying , the chaldeans shall surely depart from us ; for they shall not depart .
and it came to pass that , when the army of the chaldeans was broken up from jerusalem for fear of pharaoh ’ s army ,
then jeremiah went forth out of jerusalem to go into the land of benjamin , to receive his portion there , in the midst of the people .
when jeremiah was come into the dungeon-house , and into the cells , and jeremiah had remained there many days ;
where now are your prophets that prophesied unto you , saying , the king of babylon shall not come against you , nor against this land ?
thus saith jehovah , this city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of babylon , and he shall take it .
and zedekiah the king said , behold , he is in your hand ; for the king is not he that can do anything against you .
ebed-melech went forth out of the king ’ s house , and spake to the king , saying ,
and ebed-melech the ethiopian said unto jeremiah , put now these rags and worn-out garments under thine armholes under the cords . and jeremiah did so .
so they drew up jeremiah with the cords , and took him up out of the dungeon : and jeremiah remained in the court of the guard .
but if thou refuse to go forth , this is the word that jehovah hath showed me :
then said zedekiah unto jeremiah , let no man know of these words , and thou shalt not die .
so jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day that jerusalem was taken .
in the eleventh year of zedekiah , in the fourth month , the ninth day of the month , a breach was made in the city ) ,
then the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah in riblah before his eyes : also the king of babylon slew all the nobles of judah .
moreover he put out zedekiah ’ s eyes , and bound him in fetters , to carry him to babylon .
and the chaldeans burned the king ’ s house , and the houses of the people , with fire , and brake down the walls of jerusalem .
now nebuchadrezzar king of babylon gave charge concerning jeremiah to nebuzaradan the captain of the guard , saying ,
take him , and look well to him , and do him no harm ; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee .
so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent , and nebushazban , rab-saris , and nergal-sharezer , rab-mag , and all the chief officers of the king of babylon ;
now the word of jehovah came unto jeremiah , while he was shut up in the court of the guard , saying ,
but i will deliver thee in that day , saith jehovah ; and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid .
and the captain of the guard took jeremiah , and said unto him , jehovah thy god pronounced this evil upon this place ;
then went jeremiah unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah , and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land .
moreover johanan the son of kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields , came to gedaliah to mizpah ,
but gedaliah the son of ahikam said unto johanan the son of kareah , thou shalt not do this thing ; for thou speakest falsely of ishmael .
and it came to pass the second day after he had slain gedaliah , and no man knew it ,
then they took all the men , and went to fight with ishmael the son of nethaniah , and found him by the great waters that are in gibeon .
so all the people that ishmael had carried away captive from mizpah turned about and came back , and went unto johanan the son of kareah .
but ishmael the son of nethaniah escaped from johanan with eight men , and went to the children of ammon .
and they departed , and dwelt in geruth chimham , which is by beth-lehem , to go to enter into egypt ,
that jehovah thy god may show us the way wherein we should walk , and the thing that we should do .
and it came to pass after ten days , that the word of jehovah came unto jeremiah .
and said unto them , thus saith jehovah , the god of israel , unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him :
and i will grant you mercy , that he may have mercy upon you , and cause you to return to your own land .
but if ye say , we will not dwell in this land ; so that ye obey not the voice of jehovah your god ,
jehovah hath spoken concerning you , o remnant of judah , go ye not into egypt : know certainly that i have testified unto you this day .
and they came into the land of egypt ; for they obeyed not the voice of jehovah : and they came unto tahpanhes .
then came the word of jehovah unto jeremiah in tahpanhes , saying ,
but they hearkened not , nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness , to burn no incense unto other gods .
as for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of jehovah , we will not hearken unto thee .
moreover jeremiah said unto all the people , and to all the women , hear the word of jehovah , all judah that are in the land of egypt :
thus saith jehovah , the god of israel , unto thee , o baruch :
the word of jehovah which came to jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations .
prepare ye the buckler and shield , and draw near to battle .
harness the horses , and get up , ye horsemen , and stand forth with your helmets ; furbish the spears , put on the coats of mail .
let not the swift flee away , nor the mighty man escape ; in the north by the river euphrates have they stumbled and fallen .
who is this that riseth up like the nile , whose waters toss themselves like the rivers ?
go up into gilead , and take balm , o virgin daughter of egypt : in vain dost thou use many medicines ; there is no healing for thee .
the word that jehovah spake to jeremiah the prophet , how that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon should come and smite the land of egypt .
why are thy strong ones swept away ? they stood not , because jehovah did drive them .
they cried there , pharaoh king of egypt is but a noise ; he hath let the appointed time pass by .
egypt is a very fair heifer ; but destruction out of the north is come , it is come .
the sound thereof shall go like the serpent ; for they shall march with an army , and come against her with axes , as hewers of wood .
they shall cut down her forest , saith jehovah , though it can not be searched ; because they are more than the locusts , and are innumerable .
the daughter of egypt shall be put to shame ; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north .
the word of jehovah that came to jeremiah the prophet concerning the philistines , before that pharaoh smote gaza .
baldness is come upon gaza ; ashkelon is brought to nought , the remnant of their valley : how long wilt thou cut thyself ?
o thou sword of jehovah , how long will it be ere thou be quiet ? put up thyself into thy scabbard ; rest , and be still .
how canst thou be quiet , seeing jehovah hath given thee a charge ? against ashkelon , and against the sea-shore , there hath he appointed it .
the sound of a cry from horonaim , desolation and great destruction !
moab is destroyed ; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard .
flee , save your lives , and be like the heath in the wilderness .
give wings unto moab , that she may fly and get her away : and her cities shall become a desolation , without any to dwell therein .
cursed be he that doeth the work of jehovah negligently ; and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood .
and moab shall be ashamed of chemosh , as the house of israel was ashamed of beth-el their confidence .
how say ye , we are mighty men , and valiant men for the war ?
the calamity of moab is near to come , and his affliction hasteth fast .
o inhabitant of aroer , stand by the way , and watch : ask him that fleeth , and her that escapeth ; say , what hath been done ?
moab is put to shame ; for it is broken down : wail and cry ; tell ye it by the arnon , that moab is laid waste .
and judgment is come upon the plain country , upon holon , and upon jahzah , and upon mephaath ,
and upon dibon , and upon nebo , and upon beth-diblathaim ,
and upon kiriathaim , and upon beth-gamul , and upon beth-meon ,
and upon kerioth , and upon bozrah , and upon all the cities of the land of moab , far or near .
the horn of moab is cut off , and his arm is broken , saith jehovah .
make ye him drunken ; for he magnified himself against jehovah : and moab shall wallow in his vomit , and he also shall be in derision .
for was not israel a derision unto thee ? was he found among thieves ? for as often as thou speakest of him , thou waggest the head .
i know his wrath , saith jehovah , that it is nought ; his boastings have wrought nothing .
therefore will i wail for moab ; yea , i will cry out for all moab : for the men of kir-heres shall they mourn .
moreover i will cause to cease in moab , saith jehovah , him that offereth in the high place , and him that burneth incense to his gods .
for every head is bald , and every beard clipped : upon all the hands are cuttings , and upon the loins sackcloth .
for thus saith jehovah : behold , he shall fly as an eagle , and shall spread out his wings against moab .
and moab shall be destroyed from being a people , because he hath magnified himself against jehovah .
fear , and the pit , and the snare , are upon thee , o inhabitant of moab , saith jehovah .
woe unto thee , o moab ! the people of chemosh is undone ; for thy sons are taken away captive , and thy daughters into captivity .
yet will i bring back the captivity of moab in the latter days , saith jehovah . thus far is the judgment of moab .
wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys , thy flowing valley , o backsliding daughter ? that trusted in her treasures , saying , who shall come unto me ?
but afterward i will bring back the captivity of the children of ammon , saith jehovah .
of edom . thus saith jehovah of hosts : is wisdom no more in teman ? is counsel perished from the prudent ? is their wisdom vanished ?
if grape-gatherers came to thee , would they not leave some gleaning grapes ? if thieves by night , would they not destroy till they had enough ?
leave thy fatherless children , i will preserve them alive ; and let thy widows trust in me .
for , behold , i have made thee small among the nations , and despised among men .
and edom shall become an astonishment : every one that passeth by it shall be astonished , and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof .
the earth trembleth at the noise of their fall ; there is a cry , the noise whereof is heard in the red sea .
how is the city of praise not forsaken , the city of my joy ?
therefore her young men shall fall in her streets , and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day , saith jehovah of hosts .
and i will kindle a fire in the wall of damascus , and it shall devour the palaces of ben-hadad .
of kedar , and of the kingdoms of hazor , which nebuchadrezzar king of babylon smote .
and hazor shall be a dwelling-place of jackals , a desolation for ever : no man shall dwell there , neither shall any son of man sojourn therein .
the word of jehovah that came to jeremiah the prophet concerning elam , in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah , saying ,
thus saith jehovah of hosts : behold , i will break the bow of elam , the chief of their might .
and i will set my throne in elam , and will destroy from thence king and princes , saith jehovah .
but it shall come to pass in the latter days , that i will bring back the captivity of elam , saith jehovah .
the word that jehovah spake concerning babylon , concerning the land of the chaldeans , by jeremiah the prophet .
they shall inquire concerning zion with their faces thitherward , saying , come ye , and join yourselves to jehovah in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten .
flee out of the midst of babylon , and go forth out of the land of the chaldeans , and be as the he-goats before the flocks .
and chaldea shall be a prey : all that prey upon her shall be satisfied , saith jehovah .
a sound of battle is in the land , and of great destruction .
how is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken ! how is babylon become a desolation among the nations !
come against her from the utmost border ; open her store-houses ; cast her up as heaps , and destroy her utterly ; let nothing of her be left .
slay all her bullocks ; let them go down to the slaughter : woe unto them ! for their day is come , the time of their visitation .
therefore shall her young men fall in her streets , and all her men of war shall be brought to silence in that day , saith jehovah .
a sword is upon the chaldeans , saith jehovah , and upon the inhabitants of babylon , and upon her princes , and upon her wise men .
a sword is upon the boasters , and they shall become fools ; a sword is upon her mighty men , and they shall be dismayed .
a drought is upon her waters , and they shall be dried up ; for it is a land of graven images , and they are mad over idols .
behold , a people cometh from the north ; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth .
at the noise of the taking of babylon the earth trembleth , and the cry is heard among the nations .
thus saith jehovah : behold , i will raise up against babylon , and against them that dwell in leb-kamai , a destroying wind .
and they shall fall down slain in the land of the chaldeans , and thrust through in her streets .
babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed : wail for her ; take balm for her pain , if so be she may be healed .
jehovah hath brought forth our righteousness : come , and let us declare in zion the work of jehovah our god .
o thou that dwellest upon many waters , abundant in treasures , thine end is come , the measure of thy covetousness .
he hath made the earth by his power , he hath established the world by his wisdom , and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens .
they are vanity , a work of delusion : in the time of their visitation they shall perish .
thou art my battle-axe and weapons of war : and with thee will i break in pieces the nations ; and with thee will i destroy kingdoms ;
and with thee will i break in pieces the horse and his rider ;
and i will render unto babylon and to all the inhabitants of chaldea all their evil that they have done in zion in your sight , saith jehovah .
and they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner , nor a stone for foundations ; but thou shalt be desolate for ever , saith jehovah .
prepare against her the nations , the kings of the medes , the governors thereof , and all the deputies thereof , and all the land of their dominion .
one post shall run to meet another , and one messenger to meet another , to show the king of babylon that his city is taken on every quarter :
and the passages are seized , and the reeds they have burned with fire , and the men of war are affrighted .
and babylon shall become heaps , a dwelling-place for jackals , an astonishment , and a hissing , without inhabitant .
they shall roar together like young lions ; they shall growl as lions ’ whelps .
i will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter , like rams with he-goats .
how is sheshach taken ! and the praise of the whole earth seized ! how is babylon become a desolation among the nations !
the sea is come up upon babylon ; she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof .
my people , go ye out of the midst of her , and save yourselves every man from the fierce anger of jehovah .
as babylon hath caused the slain of israel to fall , so at babylon shall fall the slain of all the land .
ye that have escaped the sword , go ye , stand not still ; remember jehovah from afar , and let jerusalem come into your mind .
we are confounded , because we have heard reproach ; confusion hath covered our faces : for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of jehovah ’ s house .
the sound of a cry from babylon , and of great destruction from the land of the chaldeans !
and jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon babylon , even all these words that are written concerning babylon .
and jeremiah said to seraiah , when thou comest to babylon , then see that thou read all these words ,
and he did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah , according to all that jehoiakim had done .
for through the anger of jehovah did it come to pass in jerusalem and judah , until he had cast them out from his presence .
so the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king zedekiah .
but the army of the chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
then they took the king , and carried him up unto the king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath ; and he gave judgment upon him .
and the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah before his eyes : he slew also all the princes of judah in riblah .
and all the army of the chaldeans , that were with the captain of the guard , brake down all the walls of jerusalem round about .
but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen .
and there were ninety and six pomegranates on the sides ; all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network round about .
and the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest , and zephaniah the second priest , and the three keepers of the threshold :
and nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of babylon to riblah .
this is the people whom nebuchadrezzar carried away captive : in the seventh year three thousand jews and three and twenty ;
in the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons ;
and he spake kindly to him , and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in babylon ,
and changed his prison garments . and jehoiachin did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life :
and there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters .
now it came to pass on the day when the sons of god came to present themselves before jehovah , that satan also came among them .
then satan answered jehovah , and said , doth job fear god for nought ?
but put forth thy hand now , and touch all that he hath , and he will renounce thee to thy face .
and it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother ’ s house ,
that there came a messenger unto job , and said , the oxen were plowing , and the asses feeding beside them ;
then job arose , and rent his robe , and shaved his head , and fell down upon the ground , and worshipped ;
in all this job sinned not , nor charged god foolishly .
and satan answered jehovah , and said , skin for skin , yea , all that a man hath will he give for his life .
but put forth thy hand now , and touch his bone and his flesh , and he will renounce thee to thy face .
and jehovah said unto satan , behold , he is in thy hand ; only spare his life .
so satan went forth from the presence of jehovah , and smote job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown .
and he took him a potsherd to scrape himself therewith ; and he sat among the ashes .
then said his wife unto him , dost thou still hold fast thine integrity ? renounce god , and die .
after this opened job his mouth , and cursed his day .
and job answered and said :
let the day perish wherein i was born ,
let that day be darkness ;
let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own ;
as for that night , let thick darkness seize upon it :
lo , let that night be barren ;
let them curse it that curse the day ,
let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark :
because it shut not up the doors of my mother ’ s womb ,
why died i not from the womb ?
why did the knees receive me ?
for now should i have lain down and been quiet ;
with kings and counsellors of the earth ,
or with princes that had gold ,
or as a hidden untimely birth i had not been ,
there the wicked cease from troubling ;
there the prisoners are at ease together ;
the small and the great are there :
wherefore is light given to him that is in misery ,
who long for death , but it cometh not ,
why is light given to a man whose way is hid ,
for my sighing cometh before i eat ,
for the thing which i fear cometh upon me ,
i am not at ease , neither am i quiet , neither have i rest ;
then answered eliphaz the temanite , and said ,
if one assay to commune with thee , wilt thou be grieved ?
behold , thou hast instructed many ,
thy words have upholden him that was falling ,
but now it is come unto thee , and thou faintest ;
is not thy fear of god thy confidence ,
remember , i pray thee , who ever perished , being innocent ?
according as i have seen , they that plow iniquity ,
by the breath of god they perish ,
the roaring of the lion , and the voice of the fierce lion ,
the old lion perisheth for lack of prey ,
now a thing was secretly brought to me ,
in thoughts from the visions of the night ,
fear came upon me , and trembling ,
then a spirit passed before my face ;
it stood still , but i could not discern the appearance thereof ;
shall mortal man be more just than god ?
behold , he putteth no trust in his servants ;
how much more them that dwell in houses of clay ,
betwixt morning and evening they are destroyed :
is not their tent-cord plucked up within them ?
call now ; is there any that will answer thee ?
for vexation killeth the foolish man ,
i have seen the foolish taking root :
his children are far from safety ,
whose harvest the hungry eateth up ,
for affliction cometh not forth from the dust ,
but man is born unto trouble ,
but as for me , i would seek unto god ,
who doeth great things and unsearchable ,
who giveth rain upon the earth ,
so that he setteth up on high those that are low ,
he frustrateth the devices of the crafty ,
he taketh the wise in their own craftiness ;
they meet with darkness in the day-time ,
but he saveth from the sword of their mouth ,
so the poor hath hope ,
behold , happy is the man whom god correcteth :
for he maketh sore , and bindeth up ;
he will deliver thee in six troubles ;
in famine he will redeem thee from death ;
thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue ;
at destruction and dearth thou shalt laugh ;
for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field ;
and thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace ;
thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great ,
thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age ,
lo this , we have searched it , so it is ;
then job answered and said ,
oh that my vexation were but weighed ,
for now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas :
for the arrows of the almighty are within me ,
doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass ?
can that which hath no savor be eaten without salt ?
my soul refuseth to touch them ;
oh that i might have my request ;
even that it would please god to crush me ;
and be it still my consolation ,
what is my strength , that i should wait ?
is my strength the strength of stones ?
is it not that i have no help in me ,
to him that is ready to faint kindness should be showed from his friend ;
my brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook ,
which are black by reason of the ice ,
what time they wax warm , they vanish ;
the caravans that travel by the way of them turn aside ;
the caravans of tema looked ,
they were put to shame because they had hoped ;
for now ye are nothing ;
did i say , give unto me ?
or , deliver me from the adversary ’ s hand ?
teach me , and i will hold my peace ;
how forcible are words of uprightness !
do ye think to reprove words ,
yea , ye would cast lots upon the fatherless ,
now therefore be pleased to look upon me ;
return , i pray you , let there be no injustice ;
is there injustice on my tongue ?
is there not a warfare to man upon earth ?
as a servant that earnestly desireth the shadow ,
so am i made to possess months of misery ,
when i lie down , i say ,
my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust ;
my days are swifter than a weaver ’ s shuttle ,
oh remember that my life is a breath :
the eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more ;
as the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away ,
he shall return no more to his house ,
therefore i will not refrain my mouth ;
am i a sea , or a sea-monster ,
when i say , my bed shall comfort me ,
then thou scarest me with dreams ,
so that my soul chooseth strangling ,
i loathe my life ; i would not live alway :
what is man , that thou shouldest magnify him ,
and that thou shouldest visit him every morning ,
how long wilt thou not look away from me ,
if i have sinned , what do i unto thee , o thou watcher of men ?
and why dost thou not pardon my transgression , and take away mine iniquity ?
then answered bildad the shuhite , and said ,
how long wilt thou speak these things ?
doth god pervert justice ?
if thy children have sinned against him ,
if thou wouldest seek diligently unto god ,
if thou wert pure and upright :
and though thy beginning was small ,
for inquire , i pray thee , of the former age ,
( for we are but of yesterday , and know nothing ,
shall not they teach thee , and tell thee ,
can the rush grow up without mire ?
whilst it is yet in its greenness , and not cut down ,
so are the paths of all that forget god ;
whose confidence shall break in sunder ,
he shall lean upon his house , but it shall not stand :
he is green before the sun ,
his roots are wrapped about the stone-heap ,
if he be destroyed from his place ,
behold , this is the joy of his way ;
behold , god will not cast away a perfect man ,
he will yet fill thy mouth with laughter ,
they that hate thee shall be clothed with shame ;
then job answered and said ,
of a truth i know that it is so :
if he be pleased to contend with him ,
he is wise in heart , and mighty in strength :
him that removeth the mountains , and they know it not ,
that shaketh the earth out of its place ,
that commandeth the sun , and it riseth not ,
that alone stretcheth out the heavens ,
that maketh the bear , orion , and the pleiades ,
that doeth great things past finding out ,
lo , he goeth by me , and i see him not :
behold , he seizeth the prey , who can hinder him ?
god will not withdraw his anger ;
how much less shall i answer him ,
whom , though i were righteous , yet would i not answer ;
if i had called , and he had answered me ,
for he breaketh me with a tempest ,
he will not suffer me to take my breath ,
if we speak of strength , lo , he is mighty !
though i be righteous , mine own mouth shall condemn me :
i am perfect ; i regard not myself ;
it is all one ; therefore i say ,
if the scourge slay suddenly ,
the earth is given into the hand of the wicked ;
now my days are swifter than a post :
they are passed away as the swift ships ;
if i say , i will forget my complaint ,
i am afraid of all my sorrows ,
i shall be condemned ;
if i wash myself with snow water ,
yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch ,
for he is not a man , as i am , that i should answer him ,
there is no umpire betwixt us ,
let him take his rod away from me ,
then would i speak , and not fear him ;
my soul is weary of my life ;
i will say unto god , do not condemn me ;
is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress ,
hast thou eyes of flesh ?
are thy days as the days of man ,
that thou inquirest after mine iniquity ,
although thou knowest that i am not wicked ,
thy hands have framed me and fashioned me
remember , i beseech thee , that thou hast fashioned me as clay ;
hast thou not poured me out as milk ,
thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh ,
thou hast granted me life and lovingkindness ;
yet these things thou didst hide in thy heart ;
if i sin , then thou markest me ,
if i be wicked , woe unto me ;
and if my head exalt itself , thou huntest me as a lion ;
thou renewest thy witnesses against me ,
wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb ?
i should have been as though i had not been ;
are not my days few ? cease then ,
before i go whence i shall not return ,
the land dark as midnight ,
then answered zophar the naamathite , and said ,
should not the multitude of words be answered ?
should thy boastings make men hold their peace ?
for thou sayest , my doctrine is pure ,
but oh that god would speak ,
and that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom !
canst thou by searching find out god ?
it is high as heaven ; what canst thou do ?
the measure thereof is longer than the earth ,
if he pass through , and shut up ,
for he knoweth false men :
but vain man is void of understanding ,
if thou set thy heart aright ,
if iniquity be in thy hand , put it far away ,
surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot ;
for thou shalt forget thy misery ;
and thy life shall be clearer than the noonday ;
and thou shalt be secure , because there is hope ;
also thou shalt lie down , and none shall make thee afraid ;
but the eyes of the wicked shall fail ,
then job answered and said ,
no doubt but ye are the people ,
but i have understanding as well as you ;
i am as one that is a laughing-stock to his neighbor ,
in the thought of him that is at ease there is contempt for misfortune ;
the tents of robbers prosper ,
but ask now the beasts , and they shall teach thee ;
or speak to the earth , and it shall teach thee ;
who knoweth not in all these ,
in whose hand is the soul of every living thing ,
doth not the ear try words ,
with aged men is wisdom ,
with god is wisdom and might ;
behold , he breaketh down , and it can not be built again ;
behold , he withholdeth the waters , and they dry up ;
with him is strength and wisdom ;
he leadeth counsellors away stripped ,
he looseth the bond of kings ,
he leadeth priests away stripped ,
he removeth the speech of the trusty ,
he poureth contempt upon princes ,
he uncovereth deep things out of darkness ,
he increaseth the nations , and he destroyeth them :
he taketh away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth ,
they grope in the dark without light ;
lo , mine eye hath seen all this ,
what ye know , the same do i know also :
surely i would speak to the almighty ,
but ye are forgers of lies ;
oh that ye would altogether hold your peace !
hear now my reasoning ,
will ye speak unrighteously for god ,
will ye show partiality to him ?
is it good that he should search you out ?
he will surely reprove you ,
shall not his majesty make you afraid ,
your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes ,
hold your peace , let me alone , that i may speak ;
wherefore should i take my flesh in my teeth ,
behold , he will slay me ; i have no hope :
this also shall be my salvation ,
hear diligently my speech ,
behold now , i have set my cause in order ;
who is he that will contend with me ?
only do not two things unto me ;
withdraw thy hand far from me ;
then call thou , and i will answer ;
how many are mine iniquities and sins ?
wherefore hidest thou thy face ,
wilt thou harass a driven leaf ?
for thou writest bitter things against me ,
thou puttest my feet also in the stocks ,
though i am like a rotten thing that consumeth ,
man , that is born of a woman ,
he cometh forth like a flower , and is cut down :
and dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one ,
who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean ? not one .
seeing his days are determined ,
look away from him , that he may rest ,
for there is hope of a tree ,
though the root thereof wax old in the earth ,
yet through the scent of water it will bud ,
but man dieth , and is laid low :
as the waters fail from the sea ,
so man lieth down and riseth not :
oh that thou wouldest hide me in sheol ,
if a man die , shall he live again ?
thou wouldest call , and i would answer thee :
but now thou numberest my steps :
my transgression is sealed up in a bag ,
but the mountain falling cometh to nought ;
the waters wear the stones ;
thou prevailest for ever against him , and he passeth ;
his sons come to honor , and he knoweth it not ;
but his flesh upon him hath pain ,
then answered eliphaz the temanite , and said ,
should a wise man make answer with vain knowledge ,
should he reason with unprofitable talk ,
yea , thou doest away with fear ,
for thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth ,
thine own mouth condemneth thee , and not i ;
art thou the first man that was born ?
hast thou heard the secret counsel of god ?
what knowest thou , that we know not ?
with us are both the grayheaded and the very aged men ,
are the consolations of god too small for thee ,
why doth thy heart carry thee away ?
that against god thou turnest thy spirit ,
what is man , that he should be clean ?
behold , he putteth no trust in his holy ones ;
how much less one that is abominable and corrupt ,
i will show thee , hear thou me ;
( which wise men have told
unto whom alone the land was given ,
the wicked man travaileth with pain all his days ,
a sound of terrors is in his ears ;
he believeth not that he shall return out of darkness ,
he wandereth abroad for bread , saying , where is it ?
distress and anguish make him afraid ;
because he hath stretched out his hand against god ,
he runneth upon him with a stiff neck ,
because he hath covered his face with his fatness ,
and he hath dwelt in desolate cities ,
he shall not be rich , neither shall his substance continue ,
he shall not depart out of darkness ;
let him not trust in vanity , deceiving himself ;
it shall be accomplished before his time ,
he shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine ,
for the company of the godless shall be barren ,
they conceive mischief , and bring forth iniquity ,
then job answered and said ,
i have heard many such things :
shall vain words have an end ?
i also could speak as ye do ;
but i would strengthen you with my mouth ,
though i speak , my grief is not assuaged ;
but now he hath made me weary :
and thou hast laid fast hold on me , which is a witness against me :
he hath torn me in his wrath , and persecuted me ;
they have gaped upon me with their mouth ;
god delivereth me to the ungodly ,
i was at ease , and he brake me asunder ;
his archers compass me round about ;
he breaketh me with breach upon breach ;
i have sewed sackcloth upon my skin ,
my face is red with weeping ,
although there is no violence in my hands ,
o earth , cover not thou my blood ,
even now , behold , my witness is in heaven ,
my friends scoff at me :
that he would maintain the right of a man with god ,
for when a few years are come ,
my spirit is consumed , my days are extinct ,
surely there are mockers with me ,
give now a pledge , be surety for me with thyself ;
for thou hast hid their heart from understanding :
he that denounceth his friends for a prey ,
but he hath made me a byword of the people ;
mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow ,
upright men shall be astonished at this ,
yet shall the righteous hold on his way ,
but as for you all , come on now again ;
my days are past , my purposes are broken off ,
they change the night into day :
if i look for sheol as my house ;
if i have said to corruption , thou art my father ;
where then is my hope ?
it shall go down to the bars of sheol ,
then answered bildad the shuhite , and said ,
how long will ye hunt for words ?
wherefore are we counted as beasts ,
thou that tearest thyself in thine anger ,
yea , the light of the wicked shall be put out ,
the light shall be dark in his tent ,
the steps of his strength shall be straitened ,
for he is cast into a net by his own feet ,
a gin shall take him by the heel ,
a noose is hid for him in the ground ,
terrors shall make him afraid on every side ,
his strength shall be hunger-bitten ,
the members of his body shall be devoured ,
he shall be rooted out of his tent wherein he trusteth ;
there shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his :
his roots shall be dried up beneath ,
his remembrance shall perish from the earth ,
he shall be driven from light into darkness ,
he shall have neither son nor son ’ s son among his people ,
they that come after shall be astonished at his day ,
surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous ,
then job answered and said ,
how long will ye vex my soul ,
these ten times have ye reproached me :
and be it indeed that i have erred ,
if indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me ,
know now that god hath subverted me in my cause ,
behold , i cry out of wrong , but i am not heard :
he hath walled up my way that i can not pass ,
he hath stripped me of my glory ,
he hath broken me down on every side , and i am gone ;
he hath also kindled his wrath against me ,
his troops come on together ,
he hath put my brethren far from me ,
my kinsfolk have failed ,
they that dwell in my house , and my maids , count me for a stranger :
i call unto my servant , and he giveth me no answer ,
my breath is strange to my wife ,
even young children despise me ;
all my familiar friends abhor me ,
my bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh ,
have pity upon me , have pity upon me , o ye my friends ;
why do ye persecute me as god ,
oh that my words were now written !
that with an iron pen and lead
but as for me i know that my redeemer liveth ,
and after my skin , even this body , is destroyed ,
whom i , even i , shall see , on my side ,
if ye say , how we will persecute him !
be ye afraid of the sword :
then answered zophar the naamathite , and said ,
therefore do my thoughts give answer to me ,
i have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame ;
knowest thou not this of old time ,
that the triumphing of the wicked is short ,
though his height mount up to the heavens ,
yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung :
he shall fly away as a dream , and shall not be found :
the eye which saw him shall see him no more ;
his children shall seek the favor of the poor ,
his bones are full of his youth ,
though wickedness be sweet in his mouth ,
though he spare it , and will not let it go ,
yet his food in his bowels is turned ,
he hath swallowed down riches , and he shall vomit them up again ;
he shall suck the poison of asps :
he shall not look upon the rivers ,
that which he labored for shall he restore , and shall not swallow it down ;
for he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor ;
because he knew no quietness within him ,
there was nothing left that he devoured not ;
in the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits :
when he is about to fill his belly , god will cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him ,
he shall flee from the iron weapon ,
he draweth it forth , and it cometh out of his body ;
all darkness is laid up for his treasures :
the heavens shall reveal his iniquity ,
the increase of his house shall depart ;
this is the portion of a wicked man from god ,
then job answered and said ,
hear diligently my speech ;
suffer me , and i also will speak ;
as for me , is my complaint to man ?
mark me , and be astonished ,
even when i remember i am troubled ,
wherefore do the wicked live ,
their seed is established with them in their sight ,
their houses are safe from fear ,
their bull gendereth , and faileth not ;
they send forth their little ones like a flock ,
they sing to the timbrel and harp ,
they spend their days in prosperity ,
and they say unto god , depart from us ;
what is the almighty , that we should serve him ?
lo , their prosperity is not in their hand :
how oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out ?
that they are as stubble before the wind ,
ye say , god layeth up his iniquity for his children .
let his own eyes see his destruction ,
for what careth he for his house after him ,
shall any teach god knowledge ,
one dieth in his full strength ,
his pails are full of milk ,
and another dieth in bitterness of soul ,
they lie down alike in the dust ,
behold , i know your thoughts ,
for ye say , where is the house of the prince ?
have ye not asked wayfaring men ?
that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity ?
who shall declare his way to his face ?
yet shall he be borne to the grave ,
the clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him ,
how then comfort ye me in vain ,
then answered eliphaz the temanite , and said ,
can a man be profitable unto god ?
is it any pleasure to the almighty , that thou art righteous ?
is it for thy fear of him that he reproveth thee ,
is not thy wickedness great ?
for thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought ,
thou hast not given water to the weary to drink ,
but as for the mighty man , he had the earth ;
thou hast sent widows away empty ,
therefore snares are round about thee ,
or darkness , so that thou canst not see ,
is not god in the height of heaven ?
and thou sayest , what doth god know ?
thick clouds are a covering to him , so that he seeth not ;
wilt thou keep the old way
who were snatched away before their time ,
who said unto god , depart from us ;
yet he filled their houses with good things :
the righteous see it , and are glad ;
saying , surely they that did rise up against us are cut off ,
acquaint now thyself with him , and be at peace :
receive , i pray thee , the law from his mouth ,
if thou return to the almighty , thou shalt be built up ,
and lay thou thy treasure in the dust ,
and the almighty will be thy treasure ,
for then shalt thou delight thyself in the almighty ,
thou shalt make thy prayer unto him , and he will hear thee ;
thou shalt also decree a thing , and it shall be established unto thee ;
when they cast thee down , thou shalt say , there is lifting up ;
he will deliver even him that is not innocent :
then job answered and said ,
even to-day is my complaint rebellious :
oh that i knew where i might find him !
i would set my cause in order before him ,
i would know the words which he would answer me ,
would he contend with me in the greatness of his power ?
there the upright might reason with him ;
behold , i go forward , but he is not there ;
on the left hand , when he doth work , but i can not behold him ;
but he knoweth the way that i take ;
my foot hath held fast to his steps ;
i have not gone back from the commandment of his lips ;
but he is in one mind , and who can turn him ?
for he performeth that which is appointed for me :
therefore am i terrified at his presence ;
for god hath made my heart faint ,
because i was not cut off before the darkness ,
why are times not laid up by the almighty ?
there are that remove the landmarks ;
they drive away the ass of the fatherless ;
they turn the needy out of the way :
behold , as wild asses in the desert
they cut their provender in the field ;
they lie all night naked without clothing ,
they are wet with the showers of the mountains ,
there are that pluck the fatherless from the breast ,
so that they go about naked without clothing ,
they make oil within the walls of these men ;
from out of the populous city men groan ,
these are of them that rebel against the light ;
the murderer riseth with the light ;
the eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight ,
in the dark they dig through houses :
for the morning is to all of them as thick darkness ;
swiftly they pass away upon the face of the waters ;
drought and heat consume the snow waters :
the womb shall forget him ;
he devoureth the barren that beareth not ,
yet god preserveth the mighty by his power :
god giveth them to be in security , and they rest thereon ;
they are exalted ; yet a little while , and they are gone ;
and if it be not so now , who will prove me a liar ,
then answered bildad the shuhite , and said ,
dominion and fear are with him ;
is there any number of his armies ?
how then can man be just with god ?
behold , even the moon hath no brightness ,
how much less man , that is a worm !
then job answered and said ,
how hast thou helped him that is without power !
how hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom ,
to whom hast thou uttered words ?
they that are deceased tremble
sheol is naked before god ,
he stretcheth out the north over empty space ,
he bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds ;
he incloseth the face of his throne ,
he hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters ,
the pillars of heaven tremble
he stirreth up the sea with his power ,
by his spirit the heavens are garnished ;
lo , these are but the outskirts of his ways :
and job again took up his parable , and said ,
as god liveth , who hath taken away my right ,
( for my life is yet whole in me ,
surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness ,
far be it from me that i should justify you :
my righteousness i hold fast , and will not let it go :
let mine enemy be as the wicked ,
for what is the hope of the godless , though he get him gain ,
will god hear his cry ,
will he delight himself in the almighty ,
i will teach you concerning the hand of god ;
behold , all ye yourselves have seen it ;
this is the portion of a wicked man with god ,
if his children be multiplied , it is for the sword ;
those that remain of him shall be buried in death ,
though he heap up silver as the dust ,
he may prepare it , but the just shall put it on ,
he buildeth his house as the moth ,
he lieth down rich , but he shall not be gathered to his fathers ;
terrors overtake him like waters ;
the east wind carrieth him away , and he departeth ;
for god shall hurl at him , and not spare :
men shall clap their hands at him ,
surely there is a mine for silver ,
iron is taken out of the earth ,
man setteth an end to darkness ,
he breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn ;
as for the earth , out of it cometh bread ;
the stones thereof are the place of sapphires ,
that path no bird of prey knoweth ,
the proud beasts have not trodden it ,
he putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock ;
he cutteth out channels among the rocks ;
he bindeth the streams that they trickle not ;
but where shall wisdom be found ?
man knoweth not the price thereof ;
the deep saith , it is not in me ;
it can not be gotten for gold ,
it can not be valued with the gold of ophir ,
gold and glass can not equal it ,
no mention shall be made of coral or of crystal :
the topaz of ethiopia shall not equal it ,
whence then cometh wisdom ?
seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living ,
destruction and death say ,
god understandeth the way thereof ,
for he looketh to the ends of the earth ,
to make a weight for the wind :
when he made a decree for the rain ,
then did he see it , and declare it ;
and unto man he said ,
and job again took up his parable , and said ,
oh that i were as in the months of old ,
when his lamp shined upon my head ,
as i was in the ripeness of my days ,
when the almighty was yet with me ,
when my steps were washed with butter ,
when i went forth to the gate unto the city ,
the young men saw me and hid themselves ,
the princes refrained from talking ,
the voice of the nobles was hushed ,
for when the ear heard me , then it blessed me ;
because i delivered the poor that cried ,
the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me ;
i put on righteousness , and it clothed me :
i was eyes to the blind ,
i was a father to the needy :
and i brake the jaws of the unrighteous ,
then i said , i shall die in my nest ,
my root is spread out to the waters ,
my glory is fresh in me ,
unto me men gave ear , and waited ,
after my words they spake not again ;
and they waited for me as for the rain ;
i smiled on them , when they had no confidence ;
i chose out their way , and sat as chief ,
but now they that are younger than i have me in derision ,
yea , the strength of their hands , whereto should it profit me ?
they are gaunt with want and famine ;
they pluck salt-wort by the bushes ;
they are driven forth from the midst of men ;
so that they dwell in frightful valleys ,
among the bushes they bray ;
they are children of fools , yea , children of base men ;
and now i am become their song ,
they abhor me , they stand aloof from me ,
for he hath loosed his cord , and afflicted me ;
upon my right hand rise the rabble ;
they mar my path ,
as through a wide breach they come :
terrors are turned upon me ;
and now my soul is poured out within me ;
in the night season my bones are pierced in me ,
by god ’ s great force is my garment disfigured ;
he hath cast me into the mire ,
i cry unto thee , and thou dost not answer me :
thou art turned to be cruel to me ;
thou liftest me up to the wind , thou causest me to ride upon it ;
for i know that thou wilt bring me to death ,
howbeit doth not one stretch out the hand in his fall ?
did not i weep for him that was in trouble ?
when i looked for good , then evil came ;
my heart is troubled , and resteth not ;
i go mourning without the sun :
i am a brother to jackals ,
my skin is black , and falleth from me ,
therefore is my harp turned to mourning ,
i made a covenant with mine eyes ;
for what is the portion from god above ,
is it not calamity to the unrighteous ,
doth not he see my ways ,
if i have walked with falsehood ,
( let me be weighed in an even balance ,
if my step hath turned out of the way ,
then let me sow , and let another eat ;
if my heart hath been enticed unto a woman ,
then let my wife grind unto another ,
for that were a heinous crime ;
for it is a fire that consumeth unto destruction ,
if i have despised the cause of my man-servant or of my maid-servant ,
what then shall i do when god riseth up ?
did not he that made me in the womb make him ?
if i have withheld the poor from their desire ,
or have eaten my morsel alone ,
( nay , from my youth he grew up with me as with a father ,
if i have seen any perish for want of clothing ,
if his loins have not blessed me ,
if i have lifted up my hand against the fatherless ,
then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade ,
for calamity from god is a terror to me ,
if i have made gold my hope ,
if i have rejoiced because my wealth was great ,
if i have beheld the sun when it shined ,
and my heart hath been secretly enticed ,
this also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges ;
if i have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me ,
( yea , i have not suffered my mouth to sin
if the men of my tent have not said ,
( the sojourner hath not lodged in the street ;
if like adam i have covered my transgressions ,
because i feared the great multitude ,
oh that i had one to hear me !
surely i would carry it upon my shoulder ;
i would declare unto him the number of my steps ;
if my land crieth out against me ,
if i have eaten the fruits thereof without money ,
let thistles grow instead of wheat ,
so these three men ceased to answer job , because he was righteous in his own eyes .
also against his three friends was his wrath kindled , because they had found no answer , and yet had condemned job .
now elihu had waited to speak unto job , because they were elder than he .
and when elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men , his wrath was kindled .
and elihu the son of barachel the buzite answered and said ,
i said , days should speak ,
but there is a spirit in man ,
it is not the great that are wise ,
therefore i said , hearken to me ;
behold , i waited for your words ,
yea , i attended unto you ,
beware lest ye say , we have found wisdom ;
for he hath not directed his words against me ;
they are amazed , they answer no more :
and shall i wait , because they speak not ,
i also will answer my part ,
for i am full of words ;
behold , my breast is as wine which hath no vent ;
i will speak , that i may be refreshed ;
let me not , i pray you , respect any man ’ s person ;
for i know not to give flattering titles ;
howbeit , job , i pray thee , hear my speech ,
behold now , i have opened my mouth ;
my words shall utter the uprightness of my heart ;
the spirit of god hath made me ,
if thou canst , answer thou me ;
behold , i am toward god even as thou art :
behold , my terror shall not make thee afraid ,
surely thou hast spoken in my hearing ,
i am clean , without transgression ;
behold , he findeth occasions against me ,
he putteth my feet in the stocks ,
behold , i will answer thee , in this thou art not just ;
why dost thou strive against him ,
for god speaketh once ,
in a dream , in a vision of the night ,
then he openeth the ears of men ,
that he may withdraw man from his purpose ,
he keepeth back his soul from the pit ,
he is chastened also with pain upon his bed ,
so that his life abhorreth bread ,
his flesh is consumed away , that it can not be seen ;
yea , his soul draweth near unto the pit ,
if there be with him an angel ,
then god is gracious unto him , and saith ,
his flesh shall be fresher than a child ’ s ;
he prayeth unto god , and he is favorable unto him ,
he singeth before men , and saith ,
he hath redeemed my soul from going into the pit ,
lo , all these things doth god work ,
to bring back his soul from the pit ,
mark well , o job , hearken unto me :
if thou hast anything to say , answer me :
if not , hearken thou unto me :
moreover elihu answered and said ,
hear my words , ye wise men ;
for the ear trieth words ,
let us choose for us that which is right :
for job hath said , i am righteous ,
notwithstanding my right i am accounted a liar ;
what man is like job ,
who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity ,
for he hath said , it profiteth a man nothing
therefore hearken unto me , ye men of understanding :
for the work of a man will he render unto him ,
yea , of a surety , god will not do wickedly ,
who gave him a charge over the earth ?
if he set his heart upon himself ,
all flesh shall perish together ,
if now thou hast understanding , hear this :
shall even one that hateth justice govern ?
him that saith to a king , thou art vile ,
that respecteth not the persons of princes ,
in a moment they die , even at midnight ;
for his eyes are upon the ways of a man ,
there is no darkness , nor thick gloom ,
for he needeth not further to consider a man ,
he breaketh in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out ,
therefore he taketh knowledge of their works ;
he striketh them as wicked men
because they turned aside from following him ,
so that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him ,
when he giveth quietness , who then can condemn ?
that the godless man reign not ,
for hath any said unto god ,
that which i see not teach thou me :
shall his recompense be as thou wilt , that thou refusest it ?
men of understanding will say unto me ,
job speaketh without knowledge ,
would that job were tried unto the end ,
for he addeth rebellion unto his sin ;
moreover elihu answered and said ,
thinkest thou this to be thy right ,
that thou sayest , what advantage will it be unto thee ?
i will answer thee ,
look unto the heavens , and see ;
if thou hast sinned , what effectest thou against him ?
if thou be righteous , what givest thou him ?
thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art ;
by reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out ;
but none saith , where is god my maker ,
who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth ,
there they cry , but none giveth answer ,
surely god will not hear an empty cry ,
how much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not ,
but now , because he hath not visited in his anger ,
therefore doth job open his mouth in vanity ;
elihu also proceeded , and said ,
suffer me a little , and i will show thee ;
i will fetch my knowledge from afar ,
for truly my words are not false :
behold , god is mighty , and despiseth not any :
he preserveth not the life of the wicked ,
he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous :
and if they be bound in fetters ,
then he showeth them their work ,
he openeth also their ear to instruction ,
if they hearken and serve him ,
but if they hearken not , they shall perish by the sword ,
but they that are godless in heart lay up anger :
they die in youth ,
he delivereth the afflicted by their affliction ,
yea , he would have allured thee out of distress
but thou art full of the judgment of the wicked :
for let not wrath stir thee up against chastisements ;
will thy cry avail , that thou be not in distress ,
desire not the night ,
take heed , regard not iniquity :
behold , god doeth loftily in his power :
who hath enjoined him his way ?
remember that thou magnify his work ,
all men have looked thereon ;
behold , god is great , and we know him not ;
for he draweth up the drops of water ,
which the skies pour down
yea , can any understand the spreadings of the clouds ,
behold , he spreadeth his light around him ;
for by these he judgeth the peoples ;
he covereth his hands with the lightning ,
the noise thereof telleth concerning him ,
yea , at this my heart trembleth ,
hear , oh , hear the noise of his voice ,
he sendeth it forth under the whole heaven ,
after it a voice roareth ;
god thundereth marvellously with his voice ;
for he saith to the snow , fall thou on the earth ;
he sealeth up the hand of every man ,
then the beasts go into coverts ,
out of the chamber of the south cometh the storm ,
by the breath of god ice is given ;
yea , he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture ;
and it is turned round about by his guidance ,
whether it be for correction , or for his land ,
hearken unto this , o job :
dost thou know how god layeth his charge upon them ,
dost thou know the balancings of the clouds ,
how thy garments are warm ,
canst thou with him spread out the sky ,
teach us what we shall say unto him ;
shall it be told him that i would speak ?
and now men see not the light which is bright in the skies ;
out of the north cometh golden splendor :
touching the almighty , we can not find him out :
men do therefore fear him :
then jehovah answered job out of the whirlwind , and said ,
who is this that darkeneth counsel
gird up now thy loins like a man ;
where wast thou when i laid the foundations of the earth ?
who determined the measures thereof , if thou knowest ?
whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened ?
when the morning stars sang together ,
or who shut up the sea with doors ,
when i made clouds the garment thereof ,
and marked out for it my bound ,
and said , hitherto shalt thou come , but no further ;
hast thou commanded the morning since thy days began ,
that it might take hold of the ends of the earth ,
it is changed as clay under the seal ;
and from the wicked their light is withholden ,
hast thou entered into the springs of the sea ?
have the gates of death been revealed unto thee ?
hast thou comprehended the earth in its breadth ?
where is the way to the dwelling of light ?
that thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof ,
doubtless , thou knowest , for thou wast then born ,
hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow ,
which i have reserved against the time of trouble ,
by what way is the light parted ,
who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood ,
to cause it to rain on a land where no man is ;
to satisfy the waste and desolate ground ,
hath the rain a father ?
out of whose womb came the ice ?
the waters hide themselves and become like stone ,
canst thou bind the cluster of the pleiades ,
canst thou lead forth the mazzaroth in their season ?
knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens ?
canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds ,
canst thou send forth lightnings , that they may go ,
who hath put wisdom in the inward parts ?
who can number the clouds by wisdom ?
when the dust runneth into a mass ,
canst thou hunt the prey for the lioness ,
when they couch in their dens ,
who provideth for the raven his prey ,
knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth ?
canst thou number the months that they fulfil ?
they bow themselves , they bring forth their young ,
their young ones become strong , they grow up in the open field ;
who hath sent out the wild ass free ?
whose home i have made the wilderness ,
he scorneth the tumult of the city ,
the range of the mountains is his pasture ,
will the wild-ox be content to serve thee ?
canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow ?
wilt thou trust him , because his strength is great ?
wilt thou confide in him , that he will bring home thy seed ,
the wings of the ostrich wave proudly ;
for she leaveth her eggs on the earth ,
and forgetteth that the foot may crush them ,
she dealeth hardly with her young ones , as if they were not hers :
because god hath deprived her of wisdom ,
what time she lifteth up herself on high ,
hast thou given the horse his might ?
hast thou made him to leap as a locust ?
he paweth in the valley , and rejoiceth in his strength :
he mocketh at fear , and is not dismayed ;
the quiver rattleth against him ,
he swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage ;
as oft as the trumpet soundeth he saith , aha !
is it by thy wisdom that the hawk soareth ,
is it at thy command that the eagle mounteth up ,
on the cliff she dwelleth , and maketh her home ,
from thence she spieth out the prey ;
her young ones also suck up blood :
moreover jehovah answered job , and said ,
shall he that cavilleth contend with the almighty ?
then job answered jehovah , and said ,
behold , i am of small account ; what shall i answer thee ?
once have i spoken , and i will not answer ;
then jehovah answered job out of the whirlwind , and said ,
gird up thy loins now like a man :
wilt thou even annul my judgment ?
or hast thou an arm like god ?
deck thyself now with excellency and dignity ;
pour forth the overflowings of thine anger ;
look on every one that is proud , and bring him low ;
hide them in the dust together ;
then will i also confess of thee
behold now , behemoth , which i made as well as thee ;
lo now , his strength is in his loins ,
he moveth his tail like a cedar :
his bones are as tubes of brass ;
he is the chief of the ways of god :
surely the mountains bring him forth food ,
he lieth under the lotus-trees ,
the lotus-trees cover him with their shade ;
behold , if a river overflow , he trembleth not ;
shall any take him when he is on the watch ,
canst thou draw out leviathan with a fishhook ?
canst thou put a rope into his nose ?
will he make many supplications unto thee ?
will he make a covenant with thee ,
wilt thou play with him as with a bird ?
will the bands of fishermen make traffic of him ?
canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons ,
lay thy hand upon him ;
behold , the hope of him is in vain :
none is so fierce that he dare stir him up ;
who hath first given unto me , that i should repay him ?
i will not keep silence concerning his limbs ,
who can strip off his outer garment ?
who can open the doors of his face ?
his strong scales are his pride ,
one is so near to another ,
they are joined one to another ;
his sneezings flash forth light ,
out of his mouth go burning torches ,
out of his nostrils a smoke goeth ,
his breath kindleth coals ,
in his neck abideth strength ,
the flakes of his flesh are joined together :
his heart is as firm as a stone ;
when he raiseth himself up , the mighty are afraid :
if one lay at him with the sword , it can not avail ;
he counteth iron as straw ,
the arrow can not make him flee :
clubs are counted as stubble :
his underparts are like sharp potsherds :
he maketh the deep to boil like a pot :
he maketh a path to shine after him ;
upon earth there is not his like ,
he beholdeth everything that is high :
then job answered jehovah , and said ,
i know that thou canst do all things ,
who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge ?
hear , i beseech thee , and i will speak ;
i had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear ;
wherefore i abhor myself ,
so eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite went , and did according as jehovah commanded them : and jehovah accepted job .
and jehovah turned the captivity of job , when he prayed for his friends : and jehovah gave job twice as much as he had before .
he had also seven sons and three daughters .
and he called the name of the first , jemimah ; and the name of the second , keziah ; and the name of the third , keren-happuch .
and in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of job : and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren .
and after this job lived a hundred and forty years , and saw his sons , and his sons ’ sons , even four generations .
so job died , being old and full of days .
the word of jehovah that came to joel the son of pethuel .
tell ye your children of it , and let your children tell their children , and their children another generation .
lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth .
the meal-offering and the drink-offering are cut off from the house of jehovah ; the priests , jehovah ’ s ministers , mourn .
the field is laid waste , the land mourneth ; for the grain is destroyed , the new wine is dried up , the oil languisheth .
be confounded , o ye husbandmen , wail , o ye vinedressers , for the wheat and for the barley ; for the harvest of the field is perished .
alas for the day ! for the day of jehovah is at hand , and as destruction from the almighty shall it come .
is not the food cut off before our eyes , yea , joy and gladness from the house of our god ?
the seeds rot under their clods ; the garners are laid desolate , the barns are broken down ; for the grain is withered .
how do the beasts groan ! the herds of cattle are perplexed , because they have no pasture ; yea , the flocks of sheep are made desolate .
yea , the beasts of the field pant unto thee ; for the water brooks are dried up , and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness .
the appearance of them is as the appearance of horses ; and as horsemen , so do they run .
at their presence the peoples are in anguish ; all faces are waxed pale .
neither doth one thrust another ; they march every one in his path ; and they burst through the weapons , and break not off their course .
they leap upon the city ; they run upon the wall ; they climb up into the houses ; they enter in at the windows like a thief .
the earth quaketh before them ; the heavens tremble ; the sun and the moon are darkened , and the stars withdraw their shining .
yet even now , saith jehovah , turn ye unto me with all your heart , and with fasting , and with weeping , and with mourning :
who knoweth whether he will not turn and repent , and leave a blessing behind him , even a meal-offering and a drink-offering unto jehovah your god ?
blow the trumpet in zion , sanctify a fast , call a solemn assembly ;
then was jehovah jealous for his land , and had pity on his people .
fear not , o land , be glad and rejoice ; for jehovah hath done great things .
and the floors shall be full of wheat , and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil .
and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit .
and i will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth : blood , and fire , and pillars of smoke .
the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and terrible day of jehovah cometh .
for , behold , in those days , and in that time , when i shall bring back the captivity of judah and jerusalem ,
and have cast lots for my people , and have given a boy for a harlot , and sold a girl for wine , that they may drink .
forasmuch as ye have taken my silver and my gold , and have carried into your temples my goodly precious things ,
and have sold the children of judah and the children of jerusalem unto the sons of the grecians , that ye may remove them far from their border ;
behold , i will stir them up out of the place whither ye have sold them , and will return your recompense upon your own head ;
proclaim ye this among the nations ; prepare war ; stir up the mighty men ; let all the men of war draw near , let them come up .
beat your plowshares into swords , and your pruning-hooks into spears : let the weak say , i am strong .
haste ye , and come , all ye nations round about , and gather yourselves together : thither cause thy mighty ones to come down , o jehovah .
let the nations bestir themselves , and come up to the valley of jehoshaphat ; for there will i sit to judge all the nations round about .
multitudes , multitudes in the valley of decision ! for the day of jehovah is near in the valley of decision .
the sun and the moon are darkened , and the stars withdraw their shining .
but judah shall abide for ever , and jerusalem from generation to generation .
and i will cleanse their blood , that i have not cleansed : for jehovah dwelleth in zion .
in the beginning was the word , and the word was with god , and the word was god .
the same was in the beginning with god .
all things were made through him ; and without him was not anything made that hath been made .
in him was life ; and the life was the light of men .
and the light shineth in the darkness ; and the darkness apprehended it not .
there came a man , sent from god , whose name was john .
the same came for witness , that he might bear witness of the light , that all might believe through him .
he was not the light , but came that he might bear witness of the light .
there was the true light , even the light which lighteth every man , coming into the world .
he was in the world , and the world was made through him , and the world knew him not .
he came unto his own , and they that were his own received him not .
but as many as received him , to them gave he the right to become children of god , even to them that believe on his name :
who were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of god .
for of his fulness we all received , and grace for grace .
for the law was given through moses ; grace and truth came through jesus christ .
no man hath seen god at any time ; the only begotten son , who is in the bosom of the father , he hath declared him .
and this is the witness of john , when the jews sent unto him from jerusalem priests and levites to ask him , who art thou ?
and he confessed , and denied not ; and he confessed , i am not the christ .
they said therefore unto him , who art thou ? that we may give an answer to them that sent us . what sayest thou of thyself ?
he said , i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness , make straight the way of the lord , as said isaiah the prophet .
and they had been sent from the pharisees .
and they asked him , and said unto him , why then baptizest thou , if thou art not the christ , neither elijah , neither the prophet ?
john answered them , saying , i baptize in water : in the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not ,
even he that cometh after me , the latchet of whose shoe i am not worthy to unloose .
these things were done in bethany beyond the jordan , where john was baptizing .
on the morrow he seeth jesus coming unto him , and saith , behold , the lamb of god , that taketh away the sin of the world !
this is he of whom i said , after me cometh a man who is become before me : for he was before me .
and i knew him not ; but that he should be made manifest to israel , for this cause came i baptizing in water .
and john bare witness , saying , i have beheld the spirit descending as a dove out of heaven ; and it abode upon him .
and i have seen , and have borne witness that this is the son of god .
again on the morrow john was standing , and two of his disciples ;
and he looked upon jesus as he walked , and saith , behold , the lamb of god !
and the two disciples heard him speak , and they followed jesus .
one of the two that heard john speak , and followed him , was andrew , simon peter ’ s brother .
he findeth first his own brother simon , and saith unto him , we have found the messiah ( which is , being interpreted , christ ) .
on the morrow he was minded to go forth into galilee , and he findeth philip : and jesus saith unto him , follow me .
now philip was from bethsaida , of the city of andrew and peter .
and nathanael said unto him , can any good thing come out of nazareth ? philip saith unto him , come and see .
jesus saw nathanael coming to him , and saith of him , behold , an israelite indeed , in whom is no guile !
nathanael answered him , rabbi , thou art the son of god ; thou art king of israel .
and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee ; and the mother of jesus was there :
and jesus also was bidden , and his disciples , to the marriage .
and when the wine failed , the mother of jesus saith unto him , they have no wine .
and jesus saith unto her , woman , what have i to do with thee ? mine hour is not yet come .
his mother saith unto the servants , whatsoever he saith unto you , do it .
now there were six waterpots of stone set there after the jews ’ manner of purifying , containing two or three firkins apiece .
jesus saith unto them , fill the waterpots with water . and they filled them up to the brim .
and he saith unto them , draw out now , and bear unto the ruler of the feast . and they bare it .
this beginning of his signs did jesus in cana of galilee , and manifested his glory ; and his disciples believed on him .
after this he went down to capernaum , he , and his mother , and his brethren , and his disciples ; and there they abode not many days .
and the passover of the jews was at hand , and jesus went up to jerusalem .
and he found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves , and the changers of money sitting :
and to them that sold the doves he said , take these things hence ; make not my father ’ s house a house of merchandise .
his disciples remembered that it was written , zeal for thy house shall eat me up .
the jews therefore answered and said unto him , what sign showest thou unto us , seeing that thou doest these things ?
jesus answered and said unto them , destroy this temple , and in three days i will raise it up .
the jews therefore said , forty and six years was this temple in building , and wilt thou raise it up in three days ?
but he spake of the temple of his body .
now when he was in jerusalem at the passover , during the feast , many believed on his name , beholding his signs which he did .
but jesus did not trust himself unto them , for that he knew all men ,
and because he needed not that any one should bear witness concerning man ; for he himself knew what was in man .
now there was a man of the pharisees , named nicodemus , a ruler of the jews :
that which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the spirit is spirit .
marvel not that i said unto thee , ye must be born anew .
nicodemus answered and said unto him , how can these things be ?
jesus answered and said unto him , art thou the teacher of israel , and understandest not these things ?
if i told you earthly things and ye believe not , how shall ye believe if i tell you heavenly things ?
and no one hath ascended into heaven , but he that descended out of heaven , even the son of man , who is in heaven .
and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the son of man be lifted up ;
that whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life .
for god so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth on him should not perish , but have eternal life .
for god sent not the son into the world to judge the world ; but that the world should be saved through him .
for every one that doeth evil hateth the light , and cometh not to the light , lest his works should be reproved .
but he that doeth the truth cometh to the light , that his works may be made manifest , that they have been wrought in god .
after these things came jesus and his disciples into the land of judaea ; and there he tarried with them , and baptized .
and john also was baptizing in aenon near to salim , because there was much water there : and they came , and were baptized .
for john was not yet cast into prison .
there arose therefore a questioning on the part of john ’ s disciples with a jew about purifying .
john answered and said , a man can receive nothing , except it have been given him from heaven .
ye yourselves bear me witness , that i said , i am not the christ , but , that i am sent before him .
he must increase , but i must decrease .
what he hath seen and heard , of that he beareth witness ; and no man receiveth his witness .
he that hath received his witness hath set his seal to this , that god is true .
for he whom god hath sent speaketh the words of god : for he giveth not the spirit by measure .
the father loveth the son , and hath given all things into his hand .
when therefore the lord knew that the pharisees had heard that jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than john
( although jesus himself baptized not , but his disciples ) ,
he left judaea , and departed again into galilee .
and he must needs pass through samaria .
so he cometh to a city of samaria , called sychar , near to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph :
and jacob ’ s well was there . jesus therefore , being wearied with his journey , sat thus by the well . it was about the sixth hour .
there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water : jesus saith unto her , give me to drink .
for his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food .
the woman saith unto him , sir , thou hast nothing to draw with , and the well is deep : whence then hast thou that living water ?
art thou greater than our father jacob , who gave us the well , and drank thereof himself , and his sons , and his cattle ?
jesus answered and said unto her , every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again :
the woman saith unto him , sir , give me this water , that i thirst not , neither come all the way hither to draw .
jesus saith unto her , go , call thy husband , and come hither .
the woman answered and said unto him , i have no husband . jesus saith unto her , thou saidst well , i have no husband :
for thou hast had five husbands ; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband : this hast thou said truly .
the woman saith unto him , sir , i perceive that thou art a prophet .
our fathers worshipped in this mountain ; and ye say , that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship .
jesus saith unto her , woman , believe me , the hour cometh , when neither in this mountain , nor in jerusalem , shall ye worship the father .
ye worship that which ye know not : we worship that which we know ; for salvation is from the jews .
god is a spirit : and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth .
jesus saith unto her , i that speak unto thee am he .
so the woman left her waterpot , and went away into the city , and saith to the people ,
come , see a man , who told me all things that ever i did : can this be the christ ?
they went out of the city , and were coming to him .
in the mean while the disciples prayed him , saying , rabbi , eat .
but he said unto them , i have meat to eat that ye know not .
the disciples therefore said one to another , hath any man brought him aught to eat ?
jesus saith unto them , my meat is to do the will of him that sent me , and to accomplish his work .
he that reapeth receiveth wages , and gathereth fruit unto life eternal ; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together .
for herein is the saying true , one soweth , and another reapeth .
i sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored : others have labored , and ye are entered into their labor .
so when the samaritans came unto him , they besought him to abide with them : and he abode there two days .
and many more believed because of his word ;
and after the two days he went forth from thence into galilee .
for jesus himself testified , that a prophet hath no honor in his own country .
he came therefore again unto cana of galilee , where he made the water wine . and there was a certain nobleman , whose son was sick at capernaum .
jesus therefore said unto him , except ye see signs and wonders , ye will in no wise believe .
the nobleman saith unto him , sir , come down ere my child die .
jesus saith unto him , go thy way ; thy son liveth . the man believed the word that jesus spake unto him , and he went his way .
and as he was now going down , his servants met him , saying , that his son lived .
so he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend . they said therefore unto him , yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him .
so the father knew that it was at that hour in which jesus said unto him , thy son liveth : and himself believed , and his whole house .
this is again the second sign that jesus did , having come out of judaea into galilee .
after these things there was a feast of the jews ; and jesus went up to jerusalem .
now there is in jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool , which is called in hebrew bethesda , having five porches .
in these lay a multitude of them that were sick , blind , halt , withered .
and a certain man was there , who had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity .
jesus saith unto him , arise , take up thy bed , and walk .
and straightway the man was made whole , and took up his bed and walked .
so the jews said unto him that was cured , it is the sabbath , and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed .
but he answered them , he that made me whole , the same said unto me , take up thy bed , and walk .
they asked him , who is the man that said unto thee , take up thy bed , and walk ?
but he that was healed knew not who it was ; for jesus had conveyed himself away , a multitude being in the place .
the man went away , and told the jews that it was jesus who had made him whole .
and for this cause the jews persecuted jesus , because he did these things on the sabbath .
but jesus answered them , my father worketh even until now , and i work .
for as the father raiseth the dead and giveth them life , even so the son also giveth life to whom he will .
for neither doth the father judge any man , but he hath given all judgment unto the son ;
that all may honor the son , even as they honor the father . he that honoreth not the son honoreth not the father that sent him .
for as the father hath life in himself , even so gave he to the son also to have life in himself :
and he gave him authority to execute judgment , because he is a son of man .
marvel not at this : for the hour cometh , in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice ,
and shall come forth ; they that have done good , unto the resurrection of life ; and they that have done evil , unto the resurrection of judgment .
if i bear witness of myself , my witness is not true .
it is another that beareth witness of me ; and i know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true .
ye have sent unto john , and he hath borne witness unto the truth .
but the witness which i receive is not from man : howbeit i say these things , that ye may be saved .
he was the lamp that burneth and shineth ; and ye were willing to rejoice for a season in his light .
and the father that sent me , he hath borne witness of me . ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his form .
and ye have not his word abiding in you : for whom he sent , him ye believe not .
ye search the scriptures , because ye think that in them ye have eternal life ; and these are they which bear witness of me ;
and ye will not come to me , that ye may have life .
i receive not glory from men .
but i know you , that ye have not the love of god in yourselves .
i am come in my father ’ s name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive .
how can ye believe , who receive glory one of another , and the glory that cometh from the only god ye seek not ?
think not that i will accuse you to the father : there is one that accuseth you , even moses , on whom ye have set your hope .
for if ye believed moses , ye would believe me ; for he wrote of me .
but if ye believe not his writings , how shall ye believe my words ?
after these things jesus went away to the other side of the sea of galilee , which is the sea of tiberias .
and a great multitude followed him , because they beheld the signs which he did on them that were sick .
and jesus went up into the mountain , and there he sat with his disciples .
now the passover , the feast of the jews , was at hand .
and this he said to prove him : for he himself knew what he would do .
philip answered him , two hundred shillings ’ worth of bread is not sufficient for them , that every one may take a little .
one of his disciples , andrew , simon peter ’ s brother , saith unto him ,
there is a lad here , who hath five barley loaves , and two fishes : but what are these among so many ?
jesus said , make the people sit down . now there was much grass in the place . so the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
and when they were filled , he saith unto his disciples , gather up the broken pieces which remain over , that nothing be lost .
so they gathered them up , and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves , which remained over unto them that had eaten .
when therefore the people saw the sign which he did , they said , this is of a truth the prophet that cometh into the world .
jesus therefore perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force , to make him king , withdrew again into the mountain himself alone .
and when evening came , his disciples went down unto the sea ;
and the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew .
but he saith unto them , it is i ; be not afraid .
they were willing therefore to receive him into the boat : and straightway the boat was at the land whither they were going .
( howbeit there came boats from tiberias nigh unto the place where they ate the bread after the lord had given thanks ) :
when the multitude therefore saw that jesus was not there , neither his disciples , they themselves got into the boats , and came to capernaum , seeking jesus .
and when they found him on the other side of the sea , they said unto him , rabbi , when camest thou hither ?
they said therefore unto him , what must we do , that we may work the works of god ?
jesus answered and said unto them , this is the work of god , that ye believe on him whom he hath sent .
they said therefore unto him , what then doest thou for a sign , that we may see , and believe thee ? what workest thou ?
our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness ; as it is written , he gave them bread out of heaven to eat .
for the bread of god is that which cometh down out of heaven , and giveth life unto the world .
they said therefore unto him , lord , evermore give us this bread .
but i said unto you , that ye have seen me , and yet believe not .
all that which the father giveth me shall come unto me ; and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out .
for i am come down from heaven , not to do mine own will , but the will of him that sent me .
the jews therefore murmured concerning him , because he said , i am the bread which came down out of heaven .
jesus answered and said unto them , murmur not among yourselves .
no man can come to me , except the father that sent me draw him : and i will raise him up in the last day .
not that any man hath seen the father , save he that is from god , he hath seen the father .
verily , verily , i say unto you , he that believeth hath eternal life .
i am the bread of life .
your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness , and they died .
this is the bread which cometh down out of heaven , that a man may eat thereof , and not die .
the jews therefore strove one with another , saying , how can this man give us his flesh to eat ?
he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life ; and i will raise him up at the last day .
for my flesh is meat indeed , and my blood is drink indeed .
he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me , and i in him .
as the living father sent me , and i live because of the father ; so he that eateth me , he also shall live because of me .
this is the bread which came down out of heaven : not as the fathers ate , and died ; he that eateth this bread shall live for ever .
these things said he in the synagogue , as he taught in capernaum .
many therefore of his disciples , when they heard this , said , this is a hard saying ; who can hear it ?
but jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this , said unto them , doth this cause you to stumble ?
what then if ye should behold the son of man ascending where he was before ?
it is the spirit that giveth life ; the flesh profiteth nothing : the words that i have spoken unto you are spirit , and are life .
upon this many of his disciples went back , and walked no more with him .
jesus said therefore unto the twelve , would ye also go away ?
simon peter answered him , lord , to whom shall we go ? thou hast the words of eternal life .
and we have believed and know that thou art the holy one of god .
jesus answered them , did not i choose you the twelve , and one of you is a devil ?
now he spake of judas the son of simon iscariot , for he it was that should betray him , being one of the twelve .
and after these things jesus walked in galilee : for he would not walk in judaea , because the jews sought to kill him .
now the feast of the jews , the feast of tabernacles , was at hand .
his brethren therefore said unto him , depart hence , and go into judaea , that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest .
for no man doeth anything in secret , and himself seeketh to be known openly . if thou doest these things , manifest thyself to the world .
for even his brethren did not believe on him .
jesus therefore saith unto them , my time is not yet come ; but your time is always ready .
the world can not hate you ; but me it hateth , because i testify of it , that its works are evil .
go ye up unto the feast : i go not up unto this feast ; because my time is not yet fulfilled .
and having said these things unto them , he abode still in galilee .
but when his brethren were gone up unto the feast , then went he also up , not publicly , but as it were in secret .
the jews therefore sought him at the feast , and said , where is he ?
yet no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews .
but when it was now the midst of the feast jesus went up into the temple , and taught .
the jews therefore marvelled , saying , how knoweth this man letters , having never learned ?
jesus therefore answered them , and said , my teaching is not mine , but his that sent me .
if any man willeth to do his will , he shall know of the teaching , whether it is of god , or whether i speak from myself .
did not moses give you the law , and yet none of you doeth the law ? why seek ye to kill me ?
the multitude answered , thou hast a demon : who seeketh to kill thee ?
jesus answered and said unto them , i did one work , and ye all marvel because thereof .
moses hath given you circumcision ( not that it is of moses , but of the fathers ) ; and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man .
judge not according to appearance , but judge righteous judgment .
some therefore of them of jerusalem said , is not this he whom they seek to kill ?
and lo , he speaketh openly , and they say nothing unto him . can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the christ ?
howbeit we know this man whence he is : but when the christ cometh , no one knoweth whence he is .
i know him ; because i am from him , and he sent me .
they sought therefore to take him : and no man laid his hand on him , because his hour was not yet come .
the pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him ; and the chief priests and the pharisees sent officers to take him .
jesus therefore said , yet a little while am i with you , and i go unto him that sent me .
ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where i am , ye can not come .
what is this word that he said , ye shall seek me , and shall not find me ; and where i am , ye can not come ?
he that believeth on me , as the scripture hath said , from within him shall flow rivers of living water .
some of the multitude therefore , when they heard these words , said , this is of a truth the prophet .
others said , this is the christ . but some said , what , doth the christ come out of galilee ?
hath not the scripture said that the christ cometh of the seed of david , and from bethlehem , the village where david was ?
so there arose a division in the multitude because of him .
and some of them would have taken him ; but no man laid hands on him .
the officers therefore came to the chief priests and pharisees ; and they said unto them , why did ye not bring him ?
the officers answered , never man so spake .
the pharisees therefore answered them , are ye also led astray ?
hath any of the rulers believed on him , or of the pharisees ?
but this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed .
nicodemus saith unto them ( he that came to him before , being one of them ) ,
doth our law judge a man , except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth ?
they answered and said unto him , art thou also of galilee ? search , and see that out of galilee ariseth no prophet .
and they went every man unto his own house :
but jesus went unto the mount of olives .
and early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came unto him ; and he sat down , and taught them .
and the scribes and the pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery ; and having set her in the midst ,
they say unto him , teacher , this woman hath been taken in adultery , in the very act .
now in the law moses commanded us to stone such : what then sayest thou of her ?
and again he stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground .
and jesus lifted up himself , and said unto her , woman , where are they ? did no man condemn thee ?
and she said , no man , lord . and jesus said , neither do i condemn thee : go thy way ; from henceforth sin no more . ]
the pharisees therefore said unto him , thou bearest witness of thyself ; thy witness is not true .
ye judge after the flesh ; i judge no man .
yea and if i judge , my judgment is true ; for i am not alone , but i and the father that sent me .
yea and in your law it is written , that the witness of two men is true .
i am he that beareth witness of myself , and the father that sent me beareth witness of me .
these words spake he in the treasury , as he taught in the temple : and no man took him ; because his hour was not yet come .
the jews therefore said , will he kill himself , that he saith , whither i go , ye can not come ?
and he said unto them , ye are from beneath ; i am from above : ye are of this world ; i am not of this world .
i said therefore unto you , that ye shall die in your sins : for except ye believe that i am he , ye shall die in your sins .
they said therefore unto him , who art thou ? jesus said unto them , even that which i have also spoken unto you from the beginning .
they perceived not that he spake to them of the father .
and he that sent me is with me ; he hath not left me alone ; for i do always the things that are pleasing to him .
as he spake these things , many believed on him .
jesus therefore said to those jews that had believed him , if ye abide in my word , then are ye truly my disciples ;
and ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free .
jesus answered them , verily , verily , i say unto you , every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin .
and the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever : the son abideth for ever .
if therefore the son shall make you free , ye shall be free indeed .
i know that ye are abraham ’ s seed ; yet ye seek to kill me , because my word hath not free course in you .
i speak the things which i have seen with my father : and ye also do the things which ye heard from your father .
but now ye seek to kill me , a man that hath told you the truth , which i heard from god : this did not abraham .
ye do the works of your father . they said unto him , we were not born of fornication ; we have one father , even god .
why do ye not understand my speech ? even because ye can not hear my word .
but because i say the truth , ye believe me not .
which of you convicteth me of sin ? if i say truth , why do ye not believe me ?
he that is of god heareth the words of god : for this cause ye hear them not , because ye are not of god .
the jews answered and said unto him , say we not well that thou art a samaritan , and hast a demon ?
jesus answered , i have not a demon ; but i honor my father , and ye dishonor me .
but i seek not mine own glory : there is one that seeketh and judgeth .
verily , verily , i say unto you , if a man keep my word , he shall never see death .
art thou greater than our father abraham , who died ? and the prophets died : whom makest thou thyself ?
your father abraham rejoiced to see my day ; and he saw it , and was glad .
the jews therefore said unto him , thou art not yet fifty years old , and hast thou seen abraham ?
jesus said unto them , verily , verily , i say unto you , before abraham was born , i am .
they took up stones therefore to cast at him : but jesus hid himself , and went out of the temple .
and as he passed by , he saw a man blind from his birth .
and his disciples asked him , saying , rabbi , who sinned , this man , or his parents , that he should be born blind ?
jesus answered , neither did this man sin , nor his parents : but that the works of god should be made manifest in him .
we must work the works of him that sent me , while it is day : the night cometh , when no man can work .
when i am in the world , i am the light of the world .
when he had thus spoken , he spat on the ground , and made clay of the spittle , and anointed his eyes with the clay ,
the neighbors therefore , and they that saw him aforetime , that he was a beggar , said , is not this he that sat and begged ?
others said , it is he : others said , no , but he is like him . he said , i am he .
they said therefore unto him , how then were thine eyes opened ?
and they said unto him , where is he ? he saith , i know not .
they bring to the pharisees him that aforetime was blind .
now it was the sabbath on the day when jesus made the clay , and opened his eyes .
and asked them , saying , is this your son , who ye say was born blind ? how then doth he now see ?
his parents answered and said , we know that this is our son , and that he was born blind :
therefore said his parents , he is of age ; ask him .
he therefore answered , whether he is a sinner , i know not : one thing i know , that , whereas i was blind , now i see .
they said therefore unto him , what did he to thee ? how opened he thine eyes ?
he answered them , i told you even now , and ye did not hear ; wherefore would ye hear it again ? would ye also become his disciples ?
and they reviled him , and said , thou art his disciple ; but we are disciples of moses .
we know that god hath spoken unto moses : but as for this man , we know not whence he is .
the man answered and said unto them , why , herein is the marvel , that ye know not whence he is , and yet he opened mine eyes .
we know that god heareth not sinners : but if any man be a worshipper of god , and do his will , him he heareth .
since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind .
if this man were not from god , he could do nothing .
they answered and said unto him , thou wast altogether born in sins , and dost thou teach us ? and they cast him out .
jesus heard that they had cast him out ; and finding him , he said , dost thou believe on the son of god ?
he answered and said , and who is he , lord , that i may believe on him ?
jesus said unto him , thou hast both seen him , and he it is that speaketh with thee .
and he said , lord , i believe . and he worshipped him .
and jesus said , for judgment came i into this world , that they that see not may see ; and that they that see may become blind .
those of the pharisees who were with him heard these things , and said unto him , are we also blind ?
jesus said unto them , if ye were blind , ye would have no sin : but now ye say , we see : your sin remaineth .
but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
to him the porter openeth ; and the sheep hear his voice : and he calleth his own sheep by name , and leadeth them out .
when he hath put forth all his own , he goeth before them , and the sheep follow him : for they know his voice .
and a stranger will they not follow , but will flee from him : for they know not the voice of strangers .
this parable spake jesus unto them : but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them .
jesus therefore said unto them again , verily , verily , i say unto you , i am the door of the sheep .
all that came before me are thieves and robbers : but the sheep did not hear them .
i am the good shepherd : the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep .
he fleeth because he is a hireling , and careth not for the sheep .
i am the good shepherd ; and i know mine own , and mine own know me ,
even as the father knoweth me , and i know the father ; and i lay down my life for the sheep .
therefore doth the father love me , because i lay down my life , that i may take it again .
there arose a division again among the jews because of these words .
and many of them said , he hath a demon , and is mad ; why hear ye him ?
others said , these are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon . can a demon open the eyes of the blind ?
and it was the feast of the dedication at jerusalem :
it was winter ; and jesus was walking in the temple in solomon ’ s porch .
but ye believe not , because ye are not of my sheep .
my sheep hear my voice , and i know them , and they follow me :
and i give unto them eternal life ; and they shall never perish , and no one shall snatch them out of my hand .
i and the father are one .
the jews took up stones again to stone him .
jesus answered them , many good works have i showed you from the father ; for which of those works do ye stone me ?
jesus answered them , is it not written in your law , i said , ye are gods ?
if he called them gods , unto whom the word of god came ( and the scripture can not be broken ) ,
say ye of him , whom the father sanctified and sent into the world , thou blasphemest ; because i said , i am the son of god ?
if i do not the works of my father , believe me not .
they sought again to take him : and he went forth out of their hand .
and he went away again beyond the jordan into the place where john was at the first baptizing ; and there he abode .
and many came unto him ; and they said , john indeed did no sign : but all things whatsoever john spake of this man were true .
and many believed on him there .
now a certain man was sick , lazarus of bethany , of the village of mary and her sister martha .
and it was that mary who anointed the lord with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother lazarus was sick .
the sisters therefore sent unto him , saying , lord , behold , he whom thou lovest is sick .
now jesus loved martha , and her sister , and lazarus .
when therefore he heard that he was sick , he abode at that time two days in the place where he was .
then after this he saith to the disciples , let us go into judaea again .
the disciples say unto him , rabbi , the jews were but now seeking to stone thee ; and goest thou thither again ?
but if a man walk in the night , he stumbleth , because the light is not in him .
the disciples therefore said unto him , lord , if he is fallen asleep , he will recover .
now jesus had spoken of his death : but they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep .
then jesus therefore said unto them plainly , lazarus is dead .
and i am glad for your sakes that i was not there , to the intent ye may believe ; nevertheless let us go unto him .
thomas therefore , who is called didymus , said unto his fellow-disciples , let us also go , that we may die with him .
so when jesus came , he found that he had been in the tomb four days already .
now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem , about fifteen furlongs off ;
and many of the jews had come to martha and mary , to console them concerning their brother .
martha therefore , when she heard that jesus was coming , went and met him : but mary still sat in the house .
martha therefore said unto jesus , lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died .
and even now i know that , whatsoever thou shalt ask of god , god will give thee .
jesus saith unto her , thy brother shall rise again .
martha saith unto him , i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day .
jesus said unto her , i am the resurrection , and the life : he that believeth on me , though he die , yet shall he live ;
and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die . believest thou this ?
and when she had said this , she went away , and called mary her sister secretly , saying , the teacher is here , and calleth thee .
and she , when she heard it , arose quickly , and went unto him .
( now jesus was not yet come into the village , but was still in the place where martha met him . )
when jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the jews also weeping who came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled ,
and said , where have ye laid him ? they say unto him , lord , come and see .
the jews therefore said , behold how he loved him !
jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the tomb . now it was a cave , and a stone lay against it .
jesus saith unto her , said i not unto thee , that , if thou believedst , thou shouldest see the glory of god ?
so they took away the stone . and jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , father , i thank thee that thou heardest me .
and when he had thus spoken , he cried with a loud voice , lazarus , come forth .
many therefore of the jews , who came to mary and beheld that which he did , believed on him .
but some of them went away to the pharisees , and told them the things which jesus had done .
the chief priests therefore and the pharisees gathered a council , and said , what do we ? for this man doeth many signs .
if we let him thus alone , all men will believe on him : and the romans will come and take away both our place and our nation .
but a certain one of them , caiaphas , being high priest that year , said unto them , ye know nothing at all ,
nor do ye take account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation perish not .
now this he said not of himself : but being high priest that year , he prophesied that jesus should die for the nation ;
and not for the nation only , but that he might also gather together into one the children of god that are scattered abroad .
so from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death .
now the passover of the jews was at hand : and many went up to jerusalem out of the country before the passover , to purify themselves .
jesus therefore six days before the passover came to bethany , where lazarus was , whom jesus raised from the dead .
so they made him a supper there : and martha served ; but lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him .
but judas iscariot , one of his disciples , that should betray him , saith ,
why was not this ointment sold for three hundred shillings , and given to the poor ?
jesus therefore said , suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying .
for the poor ye have always with you ; but me ye have not always .
but the chief priests took counsel that they might put lazarus also to death ;
because that by reason of him many of the jews went away , and believed on jesus .
on the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast , when they heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem ,
and jesus , having found a young ass , sat thereon ; as it is written ,
fear not , daughter of zion : behold , thy king cometh , sitting on an ass ’ s colt .
the multitude therefore that was with him when he called lazarus out of the tomb , and raised him from the dead , bare witness .
for this cause also the multitude went and met him , for that they heard that he had done this sign .
the pharisees therefore said among themselves , behold how ye prevail nothing ; lo , the world is gone after him .
now there were certain greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast :
these therefore came to philip , who was of bethsaida of galilee , and asked him , saying , sir , we would see jesus .
philip cometh and telleth andrew : andrew cometh , and philip , and they tell jesus .
and jesus answereth them , saying , the hour is come , that the son of man should be glorified .
he that loveth his life loseth it ; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal .
now is my soul troubled ; and what shall i say ? father , save me from this hour . but for this cause came i unto this hour .
father , glorify thy name . there came therefore a voice out of heaven , saying , i have both glorified it , and will glorify it again .
the multitude therefore , that stood by , and heard it , said that it had thundered : others said , an angel hath spoken to him .
jesus answered and said , this voice hath not come for my sake , but for your sakes .
now is the judgment of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out .
and i , if i be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto myself .
but this he said , signifying by what manner of death he should die .
while ye have the light , believe on the light , that ye may become sons of light .
but though he had done so many signs before them , yet they believed not on him :
that the word of isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spake ,
for this cause they could not believe , for that isaiah said again ,
he hath blinded their eyes , and he hardened their heart ;
these things said isaiah , because he saw his glory ; and he spake of him .
for they loved the glory that is of men more than the glory that is of god .
and jesus cried and said , he that believeth on me , believeth not on me , but on him that sent me .
and he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me .
i am come a light into the world , that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness .
and i know that his commandment is life eternal ; the things therefore which i speak , even as the father hath said unto me , so i speak .
and during supper , the devil having already put into the heart of judas iscariot , simon ’ s son , to betray him ,
jesus , knowing that the father had given all things into his hands , and that he came forth from god , and goeth unto god ,
riseth from supper , and layeth aside his garments ; and he took a towel , and girded himself .
then he poureth water into the basin , and began to wash the disciples ’ feet , and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded .
so he cometh to simon peter . he saith unto him , lord , dost thou wash my feet ?
jesus answered and said unto him , what i do thou knowest not now ; but thou shalt understand hereafter .
peter saith unto him , thou shalt never wash my feet . jesus answered him , if i wash thee not , thou hast no part with me .
simon peter saith unto him , lord , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head .
for he knew him that should betray him ; therefore said he , ye are not all clean .
ye call me , teacher , and , lord : and ye say well ; for so i am .
if i then , the lord and the teacher , have washed your feet , ye also ought to wash one another ’ s feet .
for i have given you an example , that ye also should do as i have done to you .
verily , verily , i say unto you , a servant is not greater than his lord ; neither one that is sent greater than he that sent him .
if ye know these things , blessed are ye if ye do them .
from henceforth i tell you before it come to pass , that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe that i am he .
verily , verily , i say unto you , he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me ; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
the disciples looked one on another , doubting of whom he spake .
there was at the table reclining in jesus ’ bosom one of his disciples , whom jesus loved .
simon peter therefore beckoneth to him , and saith unto him , tell us who it is of whom he speaketh .
he leaning back , as he was , on jesus ’ breast saith unto him , lord , who is it ?
and after the sop , then entered satan into him . jesus therefore saith unto him , what thou doest , do quickly .
now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him .
he then having received the sop went out straightway : and it was night .
when therefore he was gone out , jesus saith , now is the son of man glorified , and god is glorified in him ;
and god shall glorify him in himself , and straightway shall he glorify him .
a new commandment i give unto you , that ye love one another ; even as i have loved you , that ye also love one another .
by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples , if ye have love one to another .
peter saith unto him , lord , why can not i follow thee even now ? i will lay down my life for thee .
let not your heart be troubled : believe in god , believe also in me .
and whither i go , ye know the way .
thomas saith unto him , lord , we know not whither thou goest ; how know we the way ?
jesus saith unto him , i am the way , and the truth , and the life : no one cometh unto the father , but by me .
if ye had known me , ye would have known my father also : from henceforth ye know him , and have seen him .
philip saith unto him , lord , show us the father , and it sufficeth us .
believe me that i am in the father , and the father in me : or else believe me for the very works ’ sake .
and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name , that will i do , that the father may be glorified in the son .
if ye shall ask anything in my name , that will i do .
if ye love me , ye will keep my commandments .
and i will pray the father , and he shall give you another comforter , that he may be with you for ever ,
i will not leave you desolate : i come unto you .
yet a little while , and the world beholdeth me no more ; but ye behold me : because i live , ye shall live also .
in that day ye shall know that i am in my father , and ye in me , and i in you .
judas ( not iscariot ) saith unto him , lord , what is come to pass that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us , and not unto the world ?
he that loveth me not keepeth not my words : and the word which ye hear is not mine , but the father ’ s who sent me .
these things have i spoken unto you , while yet abiding with you .
and now i have told you before it come to pass , that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe .
i will no more speak much with you , for the prince of the world cometh : and he hath nothing in me ;
i am the true vine , and my father is the husbandman .
already ye are clean because of the word which i have spoken unto you .
if ye abide in me , and my words abide in you , ask whatsoever ye will , and it shall be done unto you .
herein is my father glorified , that ye bear much fruit ; and so shall ye be my disciples .
even as the father hath loved me , i also have loved you : abide ye in my love .
if ye keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love ; even as i have kept my father ’ s commandments , and abide in his love .
these things have i spoken unto you , that my joy may be in you , and that your joy may be made full .
this is my commandment , that ye love one another , even as i have loved you .
greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends .
ye are my friends , if ye do the things which i command you .
these things i command you , that ye may love one another .
if the world hateth you , ye know that it hath hated me before it hated you .
but all these things will they do unto you for my name ’ s sake , because they know not him that sent me .
if i had not come and spoken unto them , they had not had sin : but now they have no excuse for their sin .
he that hateth me hateth my father also .
but this cometh to pass , that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their law , they hated me without a cause .
and ye also bear witness , because ye have been with me from the beginning .
these things have i spoken unto you , that ye should not be caused to stumble .
they shall put you out of the synagogues : yea , the hour cometh , that whosoever killeth you shall think that he offereth service unto god .
and these things will they do , because they have not known the father , nor me .
but now i go unto him that sent me ; and none of you asketh me , whither goest thou ?
but because i have spoken these things unto you , sorrow hath filled your heart .
and he , when he is come , will convict the world in respect of sin , and of righteousness , and of judgment :
of sin , because they believe not on me ;
of righteousness , because i go to the father , and ye behold me no more ;
of judgment , because the prince of this world hath been judged .
i have yet many things to say unto you , but ye can not bear them now .
he shall glorify me : for he shall take of mine , and shall declare it unto you .
all things whatsoever the father hath are mine : therefore said i , that he taketh of mine , and shall declare it unto you .
a little while , and ye behold me no more ; and again a little while , and ye shall see me .
they said therefore , what is this that he saith , a little while ? we know not what he saith .
and ye therefore now have sorrow : but i will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no one taketh away from you .
hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name : ask , and ye shall receive , that your joy may be made full .
in that day ye shall ask in my name : and i say not unto you , that i will pray the father for you ;
for the father himself loveth you , because ye have loved me , and have believed that i came forth from the father .
i came out from the father , and am come into the world : again , i leave the world , and go unto the father .
his disciples say , lo , now speakest thou plainly , and speakest no dark saying .
now know we that thou knowest all things , and needest not that any man should ask thee : by this we believe that thou camest forth from god .
jesus answered them , do ye now believe ?
even as thou gavest him authority over all flesh , that to all whom thou hast given him , he should give eternal life .
and this is life eternal , that they should know thee the only true god , and him whom thou didst send , even jesus christ .
i glorified thee on the earth , having accomplished the work which thou hast given me to do .
and now , father , glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was .
now they know that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are from thee :
i pray for them : i pray not for the world , but for those whom thou hast given me ; for they are thine :
and all things that are mine are thine , and thine are mine : and i am glorified in them .
but now i come to thee ; and these things i speak in the world , that they may have my joy made full in themselves .
i have given them thy word ; and the world hated them , because they are not of the world , even as i am not of the world .
i pray not that thou shouldest take them from the world , but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil one .
they are not of the world , even as i am not of the world .
sanctify them in the truth : thy word is truth .
as thou didst send me into the world , even so sent i them into the world .
and for their sakes i sanctify myself , that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth .
neither for these only do i pray , but for them also that believe on me through their word ;
and the glory which thou hast given me i have given unto them ; that they may be one , even as we are one ;
o righteous father , the world knew thee not , but i knew thee ; and these knew that thou didst send me ;
now judas also , who betrayed him , knew the place : for jesus oft-times resorted thither with his disciples .
judas then , having received the band of soldiers , and officers from the chief priests and the pharisees , cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons .
jesus therefore , knowing all the things that were coming upon him , went forth , and saith unto them , whom seek ye ?
they answered him , jesus of nazareth . jesus saith unto them , i am he . and judas also , who betrayed him , was standing with them .
when therefore he said unto them , i am he , they went backward , and fell to the ground .
again therefore he asked them , whom seek ye ? and they said , jesus of nazareth .
jesus answered , i told you that i am he ; if therefore ye seek me , let these go their way :
that the word might be fulfilled which he spake , of those whom thou hast given me i lost not one .
jesus therefore said unto peter , put up the sword into the sheath : the cup which the father hath given me , shall i not drink it ?
so the band and the chief captain , and the officers of the jews , seized jesus and bound him ,
and led him to annas first ; for he was father in law to caiaphas , who was high priest that year .
now caiaphas was he that gave counsel to the jews , that it was expedient that one man should die for the people .
the maid therefore that kept the door saith unto peter , art thou also one of this man ’ s disciples ? he saith , i am not .
the high priest therefore asked jesus of his disciples , and of his teaching .
why askest thou me ? ask them that have heard me , what i spake unto them : behold , these know the things which i said .
and when he had said this , one of the officers standing by struck jesus with his hand , saying , answerest thou the high priest so ?
jesus answered him , if i have spoken evil , bear witness of the evil : but if well , why smitest thou me ?
annas therefore sent him bound unto caiaphas the high priest .
peter therefore denied again : and straightway the cock crew .
pilate therefore went out unto them , and saith , what accusation bring ye against this man ?
they answered and said unto him , if this man were not an evil-doer , we should not have delivered him up unto thee .
that the word of jesus might be fulfilled , which he spake , signifying by what manner of death he should die .
pilate therefore entered again into the praetorium , and called jesus , and said unto him , art thou the king of the jews ?
jesus answered , sayest thou this of thyself , or did others tell it thee concerning me ?
pilate answered , am i a jew ? thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee unto me : what hast thou done ?
pilate saith unto him , what is truth ?
they cried out therefore again , saying , not this man , but barabbas . now barabbas was a robber .
then pilate therefore took jesus , and scourged him .
and the soldiers platted a crown of thorns , and put it on his head , and arrayed him in a purple garment ;
and they came unto him , and said , hail , king of the jews ! and they struck him with their hands .
jesus therefore came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment . and pilate saith unto them , behold , the man !
the jews answered him , we have a law , and by that law he ought to die , because he made himself the son of god .
when pilate therefore heard this saying , he was the more afraid ;
and he entered into the praetorium again , and saith unto jesus , whence art thou ? but jesus gave him no answer .
pilate therefore saith unto him , speakest thou not unto me ? knowest thou not that i have power to release thee , and have power to crucify thee ?
now it was the preparation of the passover : it was about the sixth hour . and he saith unto the jews , behold , your king !
then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified .
where they crucified him , and with him two others , on either side one , and jesus in the midst .
and pilate wrote a title also , and put it on the cross . and there was written , jesus of nazareth , the king of the jews .
pilate answered , what i have written i have written .
when jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by whom he loved , he saith unto his mother , woman , behold , thy son !
then saith he to the disciple , behold , thy mother ! and from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home .
after this jesus , knowing that all things are now finished , that the scripture might be accomplished , saith , i thirst .
there was set there a vessel full of vinegar : so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop , and brought it to his mouth .
when jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , it is finished : and he bowed his head , and gave up his spirit .
the soldiers therefore came , and brake the legs of the first , and of the other that was crucified with him :
but when they came to jesus , and saw that he was dead already , they brake not his legs :
howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side , and straightway there came out blood and water .
and he that hath seen hath borne witness , and his witness is true : and he knoweth that he saith true , that ye also may believe .
for these things came to pass , that the scripture might be fulfilled , a bone of him shall not be broken .
and again another scripture saith , they shall look on him whom they pierced .
and there came also nicodemus , he who at the first came to him by night , bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about a hundred pounds .
so they took the body of jesus , and bound it in linen cloths with the spices , as the custom of the jews is to bury .
now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden ; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid .
there then because of the jews ’ preparation ( for the tomb was nigh at hand ) they laid jesus .
peter therefore went forth , and the other disciple , and they went toward the tomb .
and they ran both together : and the other disciple outran peter , and came first to the tomb ;
and stooping and looking in , he seeth the linen cloths lying ; yet entered he not in .
simon peter therefore also cometh , following him , and entered into the tomb ; and he beholdeth the linen cloths lying ,
and the napkin , that was upon his head , not lying with the linen cloths , but rolled up in a place by itself .
then entered in therefore the other disciple also , who came first to the tomb , and he saw , and believed .
for as yet they knew not the scripture , that he must rise again from the dead .
so the disciples went away again unto their own home .
but mary was standing without at the tomb weeping : so , as she wept , she stooped and looked into the tomb ;
and she beholdeth two angels in white sitting , one at the head , and one at the feet , where the body of jesus had lain .
when she had thus said , she turned herself back , and beholdeth jesus standing , and knew not that it was jesus .
jesus saith unto her , mary . she turneth herself , and saith unto him in hebrew , rabboni ; which is to say , teacher .
mary magdalene cometh and telleth the disciples , i have seen the lord ; and that he had said these things unto her .
and when he had said this , he showed unto them his hands and his side . the disciples therefore were glad , when they saw the lord .
jesus therefore said to them again , peace be unto you : as the father hath sent me , even so send i you .
and when he had said this , he breathed on them , and saith unto them , receive ye the holy spirit :
whose soever sins ye forgive , they are forgiven unto them ; whose soever sins ye retain , they are retained .
but thomas , one of the twelve , called didymus , was not with them when jesus came .
thomas answered and said unto him , my lord and my god .
jesus saith unto him , because thou hast seen me , thou hast believed : blessed are they that have not seen , and yet have believed .
many other signs therefore did jesus in the presence of the disciples , which are not written in this book :
after these things jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias ; and he manifested himself on this wise .
but when day was now breaking , jesus stood on the beach : yet the disciples knew not that it was jesus .
jesus therefore saith unto them , children , have ye aught to eat ? they answered him , no .
so when they got out upon the land , they see a fire of coals there , and fish laid thereon , and bread .
jesus saith unto them , bring of the fish which ye have now taken .
jesus cometh , and taketh the bread , and giveth them , and the fish likewise .
this is now the third time that jesus was manifested to the disciples , after that he was risen from the dead .
peter therefore seeing him saith to jesus , lord , and what shall this man do ?
jesus saith unto him , if i will that he tarry till i come , what is that to thee ? follow thou me .
this is the disciple that beareth witness of these things , and wrote these things : and we know that his witness is true .
now the word of jehovah came unto jonah the son of amittai , saying ,
arise , go to nineveh , that great city , and cry against it ; for their wickedness is come up before me .
nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land ; but they could not : for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them .
so they took up jonah , and cast him forth into the sea ; and the sea ceased from its raging .
then the men feared jehovah exceedingly ; and they offered a sacrifice unto jehovah , and made vows .
and jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah ; and jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights .
then jonah prayed unto jehovah his god out of the fish ’ s belly .
for thou didst cast me into the depth , in the heart of the seas ,
and i said , i am cast out from before thine eyes ;
the waters compassed me about , even to the soul ;
i went down to the bottoms of the mountains ;
when my soul fainted within me , i remembered jehovah ;
they that regard lying vanities
but i will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving ;
and jehovah spake unto the fish , and it vomited out jonah upon the dry land .
and the word of jehovah came unto jonah the second time , saying ,
arise , go unto nineveh , that great city , and preach unto it the preaching that i bid thee .
so jonah arose , and went unto nineveh , according to the word of jehovah . now nineveh was an exceeding great city , of three days ’ journey .
who knoweth whether god will not turn and repent , and turn away from his fierce anger , that we perish not ?
but it displeased jonah exceedingly , and he was angry .
therefore now , o jehovah , take , i beseech thee , my life from me ; for it is better for me to die than to live .
and jehovah said , doest thou well to be angry ?
but god prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day , and it smote the gourd , that it withered .
every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon , to you have i given it , as i spake unto moses .
be strong and of good courage ; for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which i sware unto their fathers to give them .
then joshua commanded the officers of the people , saying ,
and to the reubenites , and to the gadites , and to the half-tribe of manasseh , spake joshua , saying ,
remember the word which moses the servant of jehovah commanded you , saying , jehovah your god giveth you rest , and will give you this land .
and they answered joshua , saying , all that thou hast commanded us we will do , and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go .
and it was told the king of jericho , saying , behold , there came men in hither to-night of the children of israel to search out the land .
but she had brought them up to the roof , and hid them with the stalks of flax , which she had laid in order upon the roof .
and before they were laid down , she came up unto them upon the roof ;
then she let them down by a cord through the window : for her house was upon the side of the wall , and she dwelt upon the wall .
and the men said unto her , we will be guiltless of this thine oath which thou hast made us to swear .
but if thou utter this our business , then we shall be guiltless of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear .
and it came to pass after three days , that the officers went through the midst of the camp ;
and joshua said unto the people , sanctify yourselves ; for to-morrow jehovah will do wonders among you .
and joshua said unto the children of israel , come hither , and hear the words of jehovah your god .
behold , the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth passeth over before you into the jordan .
now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of israel , for every tribe a man .
and it came to pass , when all the nation were clean passed over the jordan , that jehovah spake unto joshua , saying ,
take you twelve men out of the people , out of every tribe a man ,
then joshua called the twelve men , whom he had prepared of the children of israel , out of every tribe a man :
that this may be a sign among you , that , when your children ask in time to come , saying , what mean ye by these stones ?
about forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before jehovah unto battle , to the plains of jericho .
on that day jehovah magnified joshua in the sight of all israel ; and they feared him , as they feared moses , all the days of his life .
and jehovah spake unto joshua , saying ,
command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony , that they come up out of the jordan .
joshua therefore commanded the priests , saying , come ye up out of the jordan .
and the people came up out of the jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and encamped in gilgal , on the east border of jericho .
and those twelve stones , which they took out of the jordan , did joshua set up in gilgal .
and he spake unto the children of israel , saying , when your children shall ask their fathers in time to come , saying , what mean these stones ?
then ye shall let your children know , saying , israel came over this jordan on dry land .
that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of jehovah , that it is mighty ; that ye may fear jehovah your god for ever .
at that time jehovah said unto joshua , make thee knives of flint , and circumcise again the children of israel the second time .
and joshua made him knives of flint , and circumcised the children of israel at the hill of the foreskins .
and it came to pass , when they had done circumcising all the nation , that they abode in their places in the camp , till they were whole .
and the children of israel encamped in gilgal ; and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of jericho .
and they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the passover , unleavened cakes and parched grain , in the selfsame day .
now jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of israel : none went out , and none came in .
and jehovah said unto joshua , see , i have given into thy hand jericho , and the king thereof , and the mighty men of valor .
and ye shall compass the city , all the men of war , going about the city once . thus shalt thou do six days .
and they said unto the people , pass on , and compass the city , and let the armed men pass on before the ark of jehovah .
and the armed men went before the priests that blew the trumpets , and the rearward went after the ark , the priests blowing the trumpets as they went .
so he caused the ark of jehovah to compass the city , going about it once : and they came into the camp , and lodged in the camp .
and joshua rose early in the morning , and the priests took up the ark of jehovah .
and the second day they compassed the city once , and returned into the camp : so they did six days .
but all the silver , and gold , and vessels of brass and iron , are holy unto jehovah : they shall come into the treasury of jehovah .
so jehovah was with joshua ; and his fame was in all the land .
so there went up thither of the people about three thousand men : and they fled before the men of ai .
oh , lord , what shall i say , after that israel hath turned their backs before their enemies !
and jehovah said unto joshua , get thee up ; wherefore art thou thus fallen upon thy face ?
so joshua rose up early in the morning , and brought israel near by their tribes ; and the tribe of judah was taken :
and achan answered joshua , and said , of a truth i have sinned against jehovah , the god of israel , and thus and thus have i done :
so joshua sent messengers , and they ran unto the tent ; and , behold , it was hid in his tent , and the silver under it .
and ye shall rise up from the ambush , and take possession of the city : for jehovah your god will deliver it into your hand .
and he took about five thousand men , and set them in ambush between beth-el and ai , on the west side of the city .
and joshua and all israel made as if they were beaten before them , and fled by the way of the wilderness .
and the king of ai they took alive , and brought him to joshua .
and all that fell that day , both of men and women , were twelve thousand , even all the men of ai .
for joshua drew not back his hand , wherewith he stretched out the javelin , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of ai .
only the cattle and the spoil of that city israel took for prey unto themselves , according unto the word of jehovah which he commanded joshua .
so joshua burnt ai , and made it a heap for ever , even a desolation , unto this day .
then joshua built an altar unto jehovah , the god of israel , in mount ebal ,
and he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of moses , which he wrote , in the presence of the children of israel .
and afterward he read all the words of the law , the blessing and the curse , according to all that is written in the book of the law .
that they gathered themselves together , to fight with joshua and with israel , with one accord .
but when the inhabitants of gibeon heard what joshua had done unto jericho and to ai ,
and old and patched shoes upon their feet , and old garments upon them ; and all the bread of their provision was dry and was become mouldy .
and the men of israel said unto the hivites , peradventure ye dwell among us ; and how shall we make a covenant with you ?
and they said unto joshua , we are thy servants . and joshua said unto them , who are ye ? and from whence come ye ?
and the men took of their provision , and asked not counsel at the mouth of jehovah .
and joshua made peace with them , and made a covenant with them , to let them live : and the princes of the congregation sware unto them .
this we will do to them , and let them live ; lest wrath be upon us , because of the oath which we sware unto them .
and now , behold , we are in thy hand : as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us , do .
and so did he unto them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of israel , that they slew them not .
come up unto me , and help me , and let us smite gibeon ; for it hath made peace with joshua and with the children of israel .
so joshua went up from gilgal , he , and all the people of war with him , and all the mighty men of valor .
and jehovah said unto joshua , fear them not : for i have delivered them into thy hands ; there shall not a man of them stand before thee .
joshua therefore came upon them suddenly ; for he went up from gilgal all the night .
then spake joshua to jehovah in the day when jehovah delivered up the amorites before the children of israel ; and he said in the sight of israel ,
and the sun stood still , and the moon stayed ,
and there was no day like that before it or after it , that jehovah hearkened unto the voice of a man : for jehovah fought for israel .
and joshua returned , and all israel with him , unto the camp to gilgal .
and these five kings fled , and hid themselves in the cave at makkedah .
and it was told joshua , saying , the five kings are found , hidden in the cave at makkedah .
and joshua said , roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave , and set men by it to keep them :
that all the people returned to the camp to joshua at makkedah in peace : none moved his tongue against any of the children of israel .
then said joshua , open the mouth of the cave , and bring forth those five kings unto me out of the cave .
and afterward joshua smote them , and put them to death , and hanged them on five trees : and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening .
and joshua passed from makkedah , and all israel with him , unto libnah , and fought against libnah :
and joshua passed from libnah , and all israel with him , unto lachish , and encamped against it , and fought against it :
then horam king of gezer came up to help lachish ; and joshua smote him and his people , until he had left him none remaining .
and joshua passed from lachish , and all israel with him , unto eglon ; and they encamped against it , and fought against it ;
and joshua went up from eglon , and all israel with him , unto hebron ; and they fought against it :
and joshua returned , and all israel with him , to debir , and fought against it :
and joshua smote them from kadesh-barnea even unto gaza , and all the country of goshen , even unto gibeon .
and all these kings and their land did joshua take at one time , because jehovah , the god of israel , fought for israel .
and joshua returned , and all israel with him , unto the camp to gilgal .
and all these kings met together ; and they came and encamped together at the waters of merom , to fight with israel .
so joshua came , and all the people of war with him , against them by the waters of merom suddenly , and fell upon them .
and joshua did unto them as jehovah bade him : he hocked their horses , and burnt their chariots with fire .
but as for the cities that stood on their mounds , israel burned none of them , save hazor only ; that did joshua burn .
as jehovah commanded moses his servant , so did moses command joshua : and so did joshua ; he left nothing undone of all that jehovah commanded moses .
joshua made war a long time with all those kings .
there was not a city that made peace with the children of israel , save the hivites the inhabitants of gibeon : they took all in battle .
and the border of og king of bashan , of the remnant of the rephaim , who dwelt at ashtaroth and at edrei ,
the king of jericho , one ; the king of ai , which is beside beth-el , one ;
the king of jerusalem , one ; the king of hebron , one ;
the king of jarmuth , one ; the king of lachish , one ;
the king of eglon , one ; the king of gezer , one ;
the king of debir , one ; the king of geder , one ;
the king of hormah , one ; the king of arad , one ;
the king of libnah , one ; the king of adullam , one ;
the king of makkedah , one ; the king of beth-el , one ;
the king of tappuah , one ; the king of hepher , one ;
the king of aphek , one ; the king of lassharon , one ;
the king of madon , one ; the king of hazor , one ;
the king of shimron-meron , one ; the king of achshaph , one ;
the king of taanach , one ; the king of megiddo , one ;
the king of kedesh , one ; the king of jokneam in carmel , one ;
the king of dor in the height of dor , one ; the king of goiim in gilgal , one ;
the king of tirzah , one : all the kings thirty and one .
this is the land that yet remaineth : all the regions of the philistines , and all the geshurites ;
on the south ; all the land of the canaanites , and mearah that belongeth to the sidonians , unto aphek , to the border of the amorites ;
and the land of the gebalites , and all lebanon , toward the sunrising , from baal-gad under mount hermon unto the entrance of hamath ;
now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes , and the half-tribe of manasseh .
and all the cities of sihon king of the amorites , who reigned in heshbon , unto the border of the children of ammon ;
and gilead , and the border of the geshurites and maacathites , and all mount hermon , and all bashan unto salecah ;
nevertheless the children of israel drove not out the geshurites , nor the maacathites : but geshur and maacath dwell in the midst of israel unto this day .
and moses gave unto the tribe of the children of reuben according to their families .
heshbon , and all its cities that are in the plain ; dibon , and bamoth-baal , and beth-baal-meon ,
and jahaz , and kedemoth , and mephaath ,
and kiriathaim , and sibmah , and zereth-shahar in the mount of the valley ,
and beth-peor , and the slopes of pisgah , and beth-jeshimoth ,
balaam also the son of beor , the soothsayer , did the children of israel slay with the sword among the rest of their slain .
and moses gave unto the tribe of gad , unto the children of gad , according to their families .
and their border was jazer , and all the cities of gilead , and half the land of the children of ammon , unto aroer that is before rabbah ;
and from heshbon unto ramath-mizpeh , and betonim ; and from mahanaim unto the border of debir ;
this is the inheritance of the children of gad according to their families , the cities and the villages thereof .
and moses gave inheritance unto the half-tribe of manasseh : and it was for the half-tribe of the children of manasseh according to their families .
these are the inheritances which moses distributed in the plains of moab , beyond the jordan at jericho , eastward .
but unto the tribe of levi moses gave no inheritance : jehovah , the god of israel , is their inheritance , as he spake unto them .
by the lot of their inheritance , as jehovah commanded by moses , for the nine tribes , and for the half-tribe .
for moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the jordan : but unto the levites he gave no inheritance among them .
as jehovah commanded moses , so the children of israel did ; and they divided the land .
nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt ; but i wholly followed jehovah my god .
and joshua blessed him ; and he gave hebron unto caleb the son of jephunneh for an inheritance .
therefore hebron became the inheritance of caleb the son of jephunneh the kenizzite unto this day ; because that he wholly followed jehovah , the god of israel .
now the name of hebron beforetime was kiriath-arba ; which arba was the greatest man among the anakim . and the land had rest from war .
and their south border was from the uttermost part of the salt sea , from the bay that looketh southward ;
and caleb drove out thence the three sons of anak : sheshai , and ahiman , and talmai , the children of anak .
and he went up thence against the inhabitants of debir : now the name of debir beforetime was kiriath-sepher .
and caleb said , he that smiteth kiriath-sepher , and taketh it , to him will i give achsah my daughter to wife .
and othniel the son of kenaz , the brother of caleb , took it : and he gave him achsah his daughter to wife .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of judah according to their families .
and the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of judah toward the border of edom in the south were kabzeel , and eder , and jagur ,
and kinah , and dimonah , and adadah ,
and kedesh , and hazor , and ithnan ,
ziph , and telem , and bealoth ,
and hazor-hadattah , and kerioth-hezron ( the same is hazor ) ,
amam , and shema , and moladah ,
and hazar-gaddah , and heshmon , and beth-pelet ,
and hazar-shual , and beer-sheba , and biziothiah ,
baalah , and iim , and ezem ,
and eltolad , and chesil , and hormah ,
and ziklag , and madmannah , and sansannah ,
and lebaoth , and shilhim , and ain , and rimmon : all the cities are twenty and nine , with their villages .
in the lowland , eshtaol , and zorah , and ashnah ,
and zanoah , and en-gannim , tappuah , and enam ,
jarmuth , and adullam , socoh , and azekah ,
and shaaraim , and adithaim , and gederah , and gederothaim ; fourteen cities with their villages .
zenan , and hadashah , and migdal-gad ,
and dilean , and mizpeh , and joktheel ,
lachish , and bozkath , and eglon ,
and cabbon , and lahmam , and chitlish ,
and gederoth , beth-dagon , and naamah , and makkedah ; sixteen cities with their villages .
libnah , and ether , and ashan ,
and iphtah , and ashnah , and nezib ,
and keilah , and achzib , and mareshah ; nine cities with their villages .
ekron , with its towns and its villages ;
from ekron even unto the sea , all that were by the side of ashdod , with their villages .
and in the hill-country , shamir , and jattir , and socoh ,
and dannah , and kiriath-sannah ( the same is debir ) ,
and anab , and eshtemoh , and anim ,
and goshen , and holon , and giloh ; eleven cities with their villages .
arab , and dumah , and eshan ,
and janim , and beth-tappuah , and aphekah ,
and humtah , and kiriath-arba ( the same is hebron ) , and zior ; nine cities with their villages .
maon , carmel , and ziph , and jutah ,
and jezreel , and jokdeam , and zanoah ,
kain , gibeah , and timnah ; ten cities with their villages .
halhul , beth-zur , and gedor ,
and maarath , and beth-anoth , and eltekon ; six cities with their villages .
kiriath-baal ( the same is kiriath-jearim ) , and rabbah ; two cities with their villages .
in the wilderness , beth-arabah , middin , and secacah ,
and nibshan , and the city of salt , and en-gedi ; six cities with their villages .
and it went out from beth-el to luz , and passed along unto the border of the archites to ataroth ;
and the children of joseph , manasseh and ephraim , took their inheritance .
and the border of the children of ephraim according to their families was thus : the border of their inheritance eastward was ataroth-addar , unto beth-horon the upper ;
and it went down from janoah to ataroth , and to naarah , and reached unto jericho , and went out at the jordan .
and there fell ten parts to manasseh , besides the land of gilead and bashan , which is beyond the jordan ;
because the daughters of manasseh had an inheritance among his sons . and the land of gilead belonged unto the rest of the sons of manasseh .
the land of tappuah belonged to manasseh ; but tappuah on the border of manasseh belonged to the children of ephraim .
yet the children of manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities ; but the canaanites would dwell in that land .
and there remained among the children of israel seven tribes , which had not yet divided their inheritance .
and joshua cast lots for them in shiloh before jehovah : and there joshua divided the land unto the children of israel according to their divisions .
and it passed along to the side over against the arabah northward , and went down unto the arabah ;
now the cities of the tribe of the children of benjamin according to their families were jericho , and beth-hoglah , and emek-keziz ,
and beth-arabah , and zemaraim , and beth-el ,
and avvim , and parah , and ophrah ,
and chephar-ammoni , and ophni , and geba ; twelve cities with their villages :
gibeon , and ramah , and beeroth ,
and mizpeh , and chephirah , and mozah ,
and rekem , and irpeel , and taralah ,
and they had for their inheritance beer-sheba , or sheba , and moladah ,
and hazar-shual , and balah , and ezem ,
and eltolad , and bethul , and hormah ,
and ziklag , and beth-marcaboth , and hazar-susah ,
and beth-lebaoth , and sharuhen ; thirteen cities with their villages :
ain , rimmon , and ether , and ashan ; four cities with their villages :
and the third lot came up for the children of zebulun according to their families . and the border of their inheritance was unto sarid ;
and their border went up westward , even to maralah , and reached to dabbesheth ; and it reached to the brook that is before jokneam ;
and it turned from sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of chisloth-tabor ; and it went out to daberath , and went up to japhia ;
and from thence it passed along eastward to gath-hepher , to eth-kazin ; and it went out at rimmon which stretcheth unto neah ;
and the border turned about it on the north to hannathon ; and the goings out thereof were at the valley of iphtah-el ;
and kattath , and nahalal , and shimron , and idalah , and bethlehem : twelve cities with their villages .
this is the inheritance of the children of zebulun according to their families , these cities with their villages .
the fourth lot came out for issachar , even for the children of issachar according to their families .
and their border was unto jezreel , and chesulloth , and shunem ,
and hapharaim , and shion , and anaharath ,
and rabbith , and kishion , and ebez ,
and remeth , and engannim , and en-haddah , and beth-pazzez ,
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of issachar according to their families , the cities with their villages .
and the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of asher according to their families .
and their border was helkath , and hali , and beten , and achshaph ,
and allammelech , and amad , and mishal ; and it reached to carmel westward , and to shihor-libnath ;
and ebron , and rehob , and hammon , and kanah , even unto great sidon ;
ummah also , and aphek , and rehob : twenty and two cities with their villages .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of asher according to their families , these cities with their villages .
the sixth lot came out for the children of naphtali , even for the children of naphtali according to their families .
and the fortified cities were ziddim , zer , and hammath , rakkath , and chinnereth ,
and adamah , and ramah , and hazor ,
and kedesh , and edrei , and en-hazor ,
and iron , and migdal-el , horem , and beth-anath , and beth-shemesh ; nineteen cities with their villages .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of naphtali according to their families , the cities with their villages .
the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of dan according to their families .
and the border of their inheritance was zorah , and eshtaol , and ir-shemesh ,
and shaalabbin , and aijalon , and ithlah ,
and elon , and timnah , and ekron ,
and eltekeh , and gibbethon , and baalath ,
and jehud , and bene-berak , and gath-rimmon ,
and me-jarkon , and rakkon , with the border over against joppa .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .
and jehovah spake unto joshua , saying ,
speak to the children of israel , saying , assign you the cities of refuge , whereof i spake unto you by moses ,
that the manslayer that killeth any person unwittingly and unawares may flee thither : and they shall be unto you for a refuge from the avenger of blood .
and the children of israel gave unto the levites out of their inheritance , according to the commandment of jehovah , these cities with their suburbs .
and the children of israel gave by lot unto the levites these cities with their suburbs , as jehovah commanded by moses .
but the fields of the city , and the villages thereof , gave they to caleb the son of jephunneh for his possession .
and unto the children of aaron the priest they gave hebron with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the manslayer , and libnah with its suburbs ,
and jattir with its suburbs , and eshtemoa with its suburbs ,
and holon with its suburbs , and debir with its suburbs ,
and ain with its suburbs , and juttah with its suburbs , and beth-shemesh with its suburbs ; nine cities out of those two tribes .
and out of the tribe of benjamin , gibeon with its suburbs , geba with its suburbs ,
anathoth with its suburbs , and almon with its suburbs ; four cities .
all the cities of the children of aaron , the priests , were thirteen cities with their suburbs .
and they gave them shechem with its suburbs in the hill-country of ephraim , the city of refuge for the manslayer , and gezer with its suburbs ,
and kibzaim with its suburbs , and beth-horon with its suburbs ; four cities .
and out of the tribe of dan , elteke with its suburbs , gibbethon with its suburbs ,
aijalon with its suburbs , gath-rimmon with its suburbs ; four cities .
and out of the half-tribe of manasseh , taanach with its suburbs , and gath-rimmon with its suburbs ; two cities .
all the cities of the families of the rest of the children of kohath were ten with their suburbs .
and out of the tribe of issachar , kishion with its suburbs , daberath with its suburbs ,
jarmuth with its suburbs , en-gannim with its suburbs ; four cities .
and out of the tribe of asher , mishal with its suburbs , abdon with its suburbs ,
helkath with its suburbs , and rehob with its suburbs ; four cities .
all the cities of the gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their suburbs .
dimnah with its suburbs , nahalal with its suburbs ; four cities .
and out of the tribe of reuben , bezer with its suburbs , and jahaz with its suburbs ,
kedemoth with its suburbs , and mephaath with its suburbs ; four cities .
and out of the tribe of gad , ramoth in gilead with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the manslayer , and mahanaim with its suburbs ,
heshbon with its suburbs , jazer with its suburbs ; four cities in all .
all the cities of the levites in the midst of the possession of the children of israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs .
these cities were every one with their suburbs round about them : thus it was with all these cities .
so jehovah gave unto israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers ; and they possessed it , and dwelt therein .
there failed not aught of any good thing which jehovah had spoken unto the house of israel ; all came to pass .
then joshua called the reubenites , and the gadites , and the half-tribe of manasseh ,
ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day , but have kept the charge of the commandment of jehovah your god .
so joshua blessed them , and sent them away ; and they went unto their tents .
then the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half-tribe of manasseh answered , and spake unto the heads of the thousands of israel ,
therefore we said , let us now prepare to build us an altar , not for burnt-offering , nor for sacrifice :
but cleave unto jehovah your god , as ye have done unto this day .
for jehovah hath driven out from before you great nations and strong : but as for you , no man hath stood before you unto this day .
one man of you shall chase a thousand ; for jehovah your god , he it is that fighteth for you , as he spake unto you .
take good heed therefore unto yourselves , that ye love jehovah your god .
and i sent moses and aaron , and i plagued egypt , according to that which i did in the midst thereof : and afterward i brought you out .
but i would not hearken unto balaam ; therefore he blessed you still : so i delivered you out of his hand .
and the people answered and said , far be it from us that we should forsake jehovah , to serve other gods ;
and the people said unto joshua , nay ; but we will serve jehovah .
now therefore put away , said he , the foreign gods which are among you , and incline your heart unto jehovah , the god of israel .
and the people said unto joshua , jehovah our god will we serve , and unto his voice will we hearken .
so joshua made a covenant with the people that day , and set them a statute and an ordinance in shechem .
so joshua sent the people away , every man unto his inheritance .
and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in timnath-serah , which is in the hill-country of ephraim , on the north of the mountain of gaash .
and eleazar the son of aaron died ; and they buried him in the hill of phinehas his son , which was given him in the hill-country of ephraim .
mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied .
yet in like manner these also in their dreamings defile the flesh , and set at nought dominion , and rail at dignities .
but these rail at whatsoever things they know not : and what they understand naturally , like the creatures without reason , in these things are they destroyed .
wild waves of the sea , foaming out their own shame ; wandering stars , for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved for ever .
and to these also enoch , the seventh from adam , prophesied , saying , behold , the lord came with ten thousands of his holy ones ,
these are murmurers , complainers , walking after their lusts ( and their mouth speaketh great swelling words ) , showing respect of persons for the sake of advantage .
but ye , beloved , remember ye the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our lord jesus christ ;
that they said to you , in the last time there shall be mockers , walking after their own ungodly lusts .
these are they who make separations , sensual , having not the spirit .
but ye , beloved , building up yourselves on your most holy faith , praying in the holy spirit ,
keep yourselves in the love of god , looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life .
and on some have mercy , who are in doubt ;
and some save , snatching them out of the fire ; and on some have mercy with fear ; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh .
now unto him that is able to guard you from stumbling , and to set you before the presence of his glory without blemish in exceeding joy ,
and jehovah said , judah shall go up : behold , i have delivered the land into his hand .
and judah went up ; and jehovah delivered the canaanites and the perizzites into their hand : and they smote of them in bezek ten thousand men .
and they found adoni-bezek in bezek ; and they fought against him , and they smote the canaanites and the perizzites .
but adoni-bezek fled ; and they pursued after him , and caught him , and cut off his thumbs and his great toes .
and the children of judah fought against jerusalem , and took it , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and set the city on fire .
and afterward the children of judah went down to fight against the canaanites that dwelt in the hill-country , and in the south , and in the lowland .
and from thence he went against the inhabitants of debir . ( now the name of debir beforetime was kiriath-sepher . )
and caleb said , he that smiteth kiriath-sepher , and taketh it , to him will i give achsah my daughter to wife .
and othniel the son of kenaz , caleb ’ s younger brother , took it : and he gave him achsah his daughter to wife .
also judah took gaza with the border thereof , and ashkelon with the border thereof , and ekron with the border thereof .
and they gave hebron unto caleb , as moses had spoken : and he drove out thence the three sons of anak .
and the children of benjamin did not drive out the jebusites that inhabited jerusalem ; but the jebusites dwell with the children of benjamin in jerusalem unto this day .
and the house of joseph , they also went up against beth-el ; and jehovah was with them .
and the house of joseph sent to spy out beth-el . ( now the name of the city beforetime was luz . )
and it came to pass , when israel was waxed strong , that they put the canaanites to taskwork , and did not utterly drive them out .
and ephraim drove not out the canaanites that dwelt in gezer ; but the canaanites dwelt in gezer among them .
zebulun drove not out the inhabitants of kitron , nor the inhabitants of nahalol ; but the canaanites dwelt among them , and became subject to taskwork .
but the asherites dwelt among the canaanites , the inhabitants of the land ; for they did not drive them out .
and the amorites forced the children of dan into the hill-country ; for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley ;
and the border of the amorites was from the ascent of akrabbim , from the rock , and upward .
and they called the name of that place bochim : and they sacrificed there unto jehovah .
now when joshua had sent the people away , the children of israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land .
and joshua the son of nun , the servant of jehovah , died , being a hundred and ten years old .
and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in timnath-heres , in the hill-country of ephraim , on the north of the mountain of gaash .
and the children of israel did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah , and served the baalim ;
and they forsook jehovah , and served baal and the ashtaroth .
and jehovah raised up judges , who saved them out of the hand of those that despoiled them .
i also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that joshua left when he died ;
that by them i may prove israel , whether they will keep the way of jehovah to walk therein , as their fathers did keep it , or not .
so jehovah left those nations , without driving them out hastily ; neither delivered he them into the hand of joshua .
now these are the nations which jehovah left , to prove israel by them , even as many of israel as had not known all the wars of canaan ;
only that the generations of the children of israel might know , to teach them war , at the least such as beforetime knew nothing thereof :
and the children of israel dwelt among the canaanites , the hittites , and the amorites , and the perizzites , and the hivites , and the jebusites :
and they took their daughters to be their wives , and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods .
and the children of israel did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah , and forgat jehovah their god , and served the baalim and the asheroth .
and the land had rest forty years . and othniel the son of kenaz died .
and he gathered unto him the children of ammon and amalek ; and he went and smote israel , and they possessed the city of palm-trees .
and the children of israel served eglon the king of moab eighteen years .
and ehud made him a sword which had two edges , a cubit in length ; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh .
and he offered the tribute unto eglon king of moab : now eglon was a very fat man .
and when he had made an end of offering the tribute , he sent away the people that bare the tribute .
and ehud put forth his left hand , and took the sword from his right thigh , and thrust it into his body :
then ehud went forth into the porch , and shut the doors of the upper room upon him , and locked them .
and ehud escaped while they tarried , and passed beyond the quarries , and escaped unto seirah .
and they smote of moab at that time about ten thousand men , every lusty man , and every man of valor ; and there escaped not a man .
so moab was subdued that day under the hand of israel . and the land had rest fourscore years .
and after him was shamgar the son of anath , who smote of the philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad : and he also saved israel .
and the children of israel again did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah , when ehud was dead .
and the children of israel cried unto jehovah : for he had nine hundred chariots of iron ; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of israel .
now deborah , a prophetess , the wife of lappidoth , she judged israel at that time .
and she dwelt under the palm-tree of deborah between ramah and beth-el in the hill-country of ephraim : and the children of israel came up to her for judgment .
and barak called zebulun and naphtali together to kedesh ; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet : and deborah went up with him .
and they told sisera that barak the son of abinoam was gone up to mount tabor .
so god subdued on that day jabin the king of canaan before the children of israel .
and the hand of the children of israel prevailed more and more against jabin the king of canaan , until they had destroyed jabin king of canaan .
then sang deborah and barak the son of abinoam on that day , saying ,
for that the leaders took the lead in israel ,
hear , o ye kings ; give ear , o ye princes ;
jehovah , when thou wentest forth out of seir ,
the mountains quaked at the presence of jehovah ,
in the days of shamgar the son of anath ,
the rulers ceased in israel , they ceased ,
they chose new gods ;
my heart is toward the governors of israel ,
tell of it , ye that ride on white asses ,
far from the noise of archers , in the places of drawing water ,
awake , awake , deborah ;
then came down a remnant of the nobles and the people ;
out of ephraim came down they whose root is in amalek ;
and the princes of issachar were with deborah ;
why sattest thou among the sheepfolds ,
gilead abode beyond the jordan :
zebulun was a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death ,
the kings came and fought ;
from heaven fought the stars ,
the river kishon swept them away ,
then did the horsehoofs stamp
curse ye meroz , said the angel of jehovah .
blessed above women shall jael be ,
he asked water , and she gave him milk ;
she put her hand to the tent-pin ,
at her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay ;
through the window she looked forth , and cried ,
her wise ladies answered her ,
have they not found , have they not divided the spoil ?
so let all thine enemies perish , o jehovah :
and the children of israel did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah : and jehovah delivered them into the hand of midian seven years .
and israel was brought very low because of midian ; and the children of israel cried unto jehovah .
and it came to pass , when the children of israel cried unto jehovah because of midian ,
and the angel of jehovah appeared unto him , and said unto him , jehovah is with thee , thou mighty man of valor .
and jehovah looked upon him , and said , go in this thy might , and save israel from the hand of midian : have not i sent thee ?
and jehovah said unto him , surely i will be with thee , and thou shalt smite the midianites as one man .
and he said unto him , if now i have found favor in thy sight , then show me a sign that it is thou that talkest with me .
and jehovah said unto him , peace be unto thee ; fear not : thou shalt not die .
then gideon built an altar there unto jehovah , and called it jehovah-shalom : unto this day it is yet in ophrah of the abiezrites .
therefore on that day he called him jerubbaal , saying , let baal contend against him , because he hath broken down his altar .
then all the midianites and the amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together ; and they passed over , and encamped in the valley of jezreel .
but the spirit of jehovah came upon gideon ; and he blew a trumpet ; and abiezer was gathered together after him .
and gideon said unto god , if thou wilt save israel by my hand , as thou hast spoken ,
and god did so that night : for it was dry upon the fleece only , and there was dew on all the ground .
but if thou fear to go down , go thou with purah thy servant down to the camp :
and they stood every man in his place round about the camp ; and all the host ran ; and they shouted , and put them to flight .
and the men of israel were gathered together out of naphtali , and out of asher , and out of all manasseh , and pursued after midian .
and gideon came to the jordan , and passed over , he , and the three hundred men that were with him , faint , yet pursuing .
and the princes of succoth said , are the hands of zebah and zalmunna now in thy hand , that we should give bread unto thine army ?
and he spake also unto the men of penuel , saying , when i come again in peace , i will break down this tower .
and gideon the son of joash returned from the battle from the ascent of heres .
and he took the elders of the city , and thorns of the wilderness and briers , and with them he taught the men of succoth .
and he brake down the tower of penuel , and slew the men of the city .
and gideon said unto them , i will not rule over you , neither shall my son rule over you : jehovah shall rule over you .
and they answered , we will willingly give them . and they spread a garment , and did cast therein every man the ear-rings of his spoil .
and jerubbaal the son of joash went and dwelt in his own house .
and gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten ; for he had many wives .
and his concubine that was in shechem , she also bare him a son , and he called his name abimelech .
and gideon the son of joash died in a good old age , and was buried in the sepulchre of joash his father , in ophrah of the abiezrites .
and the children of israel remembered not jehovah their god , who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side ;
neither showed they kindness to the house of jerubbaal , who is gideon , according to all the goodness which he had showed unto israel .
and they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of baal-berith , wherewith abimelech hired vain and light fellows , who followed him .
the trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them ; and they said unto the olive-tree , reign thou over us .
and the trees said to the fig-tree , come thou , and reign over us .
but the fig-tree said unto them , should i leave my sweetness , and my good fruit , and go to wave to and fro over the trees ?
and the trees said unto the vine , come thou , and reign over us .
then said all the trees unto the bramble , come thou , and reign over us .
( for my father fought for you , and adventured his life , and delivered you out of the hand of midian :
and jotham ran away , and fled , and went to beer , and dwelt there , for fear of abimelech his brother .
and abimelech was prince over israel three years .
and god sent an evil spirit between abimelech and the men of shechem ; and the men of shechem dealt treacherously with abimelech :
and gaal the son of ebed came with his brethren , and went over to shechem ; and the men of shechem put their trust in him .
and would that this people were under my hand ! then would i remove abimelech . and he said to abimelech , increase thine army , and come out .
and when zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of gaal the son of ebed , his anger was kindled .
now therefore , up by night , thou and the people that are with thee , and lie in wait in the field :
and abimelech rose up , and all the people that were with him , by night , and they laid wait against shechem in four companies .
and gaal went out before the men of shechem , and fought with abimelech .
and abimelech chased him , and he fled before him , and there fell many wounded , even unto the entrance of the gate .
and abimelech dwelt at arumah : and zebul drove out gaal and his brethren , that they should not dwell in shechem .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that the people went out into the field ; and they told abimelech .
and when all the men of the tower of shechem heard thereof , they entered into the stronghold of the house of elberith .
and it was told abimelech that all the men of the tower of shechem were gathered together .
then went abimelech to thebez , and encamped against thebez , and took it .
and abimelech came unto the tower , and fought against it , and drew near unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
and a certain woman cast an upper millstone upon abimelech ’ s head , and brake his skull .
and when the men of israel saw that abimelech was dead , they departed every man unto his place .
thus god requited the wickedness of abimelech , which he did unto his father , in slaying his seventy brethren ;
and all the wickedness of the men of shechem did god requite upon their heads : and upon them came the curse of jotham the son of jerubbaal .
and he judged israel twenty and three years , and died , and was buried in shamir .
and after him arose jair , the gileadite ; and he judged israel twenty and two years .
and jair died , and was buried in kamon .
yet ye have forsaken me , and served other gods : wherefore i will save you no more .
go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen ; let them save you in the time of your distress .
and they put away the foreign gods from among them , and served jehovah ; and his soul was grieved for the misery of israel .
then the children of ammon were gathered together , and encamped in gilead . and the children of israel assembled themselves together , and encamped in mizpah .
now jephthah the gileadite was a mighty man of valor , and he was the son of a harlot : and gilead begat jephthah .
and it came to pass after a while , that the children of ammon made war against israel .
and they said unto jephthah , come and be our chief , that we may fight with the children of ammon .
and the elders of gilead said unto jephthah , jehovah shall be witness between us ; surely according to thy word so will we do .
and jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of ammon ;
and he said unto him , thus saith jephthah : israel took not away the land of moab , nor the land of the children of ammon ;
but when they came up from egypt , and israel went through the wilderness unto the red sea , and came to kadesh ;
but sihon trusted not israel to pass through his border ; but sihon gathered all his people together , and encamped in jahaz , and fought against israel .
and they possessed all the border of the amorites , from the arnon even unto the jabbok , and from the wilderness even unto the jordan .
so now jehovah , the god of israel , hath dispossessed the amorites from before his people israel , and shouldest thou possess them ?
wilt not thou possess that which chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess ? so whomsoever jehovah our god hath dispossessed from before us , them will we possess .
howbeit the king of the children of ammon hearkened not unto the words of jephthah which he sent him .
and jephthah vowed a vow unto jehovah , and said , if thou wilt indeed deliver the children of ammon into my hand ,
so jephthah passed over unto the children of ammon to fight against them ; and jehovah delivered them into his hand .
that the daughters of israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of jephthah the gileadite four days in a year .
and jephthah judged israel six years . then died jephthah the gileadite , and was buried in one of the cities of gilead .
and after him ibzan of beth-lehem judged israel .
and ibzan died , and was buried at beth-lehem .
and after him elon the zebulunite judged israel ; and he judged israel ten years .
and elon the zebulunite died , and was buried in aijalon in the land of zebulun .
and after him abdon the son of hillel the pirathonite judged israel .
and he had forty sons and thirty sons ’ sons , that rode on threescore and ten ass colts : and he judged israel eight years .
and abdon the son of hillel the pirathonite died , and was buried in pirathon in the land of ephraim , in the hill-country of the amalekites .
and the children of israel again did that which was evil in the sight of jehovah ; and jehovah delivered them into the hand of the philistines forty years .
now therefore beware , i pray thee , and drink no wine nor strong drink , and eat not any unclean thing :
and manoah said , now let thy words come to pass : what shall be the ordering of the child , and how shall we do unto him ?
and the angel of jehovah said unto manoah , of all that i said unto the woman let her beware .
and manoah said unto the angel of jehovah , i pray thee , let us detain thee , that we may make ready a kid for thee .
and manoah said unto the angel of jehovah , what is thy name , that , when thy words come to pass , we may do thee honor ?
and the angel of jehovah said unto him , wherefore askest thou after my name , seeing it is wonderful ?
but the angel of jehovah did no more appear to manoah or to his wife . then manoah knew that he was the angel of jehovah .
and manoah said unto his wife , we shall surely die , because we have seen god .
and the woman bare a son , and called his name samson : and the child grew , and jehovah blessed him .
and the spirit of jehovah began to move him in mahaneh-dan , between zorah and eshtaol .
and samson went down to timnah , and saw a woman in timnah of the daughters of the philistines .
and he went down , and talked with the woman , and she pleased samson well .
and his father went down unto the woman : and samson made there a feast ; for so used the young men to do .
and it came to pass , when they saw him , that they brought thirty companions to be with him .
and he said unto them ,
but samson ’ s wife was given to his companion , whom he had used as his friend .
and samson said unto them , this time shall i be blameless in regard of the philistines , when i do them a mischief .
and samson said unto them , if ye do after this manner , surely i will be avenged of you , and after that i will cease .
and he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter : and he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of etam .
then the philistines went up , and encamped in judah , and spread themselves in lehi .
and he found a fresh jawbone of an ass , and put forth his hand , and took it , and smote a thousand men therewith .
and he judged israel in the days of the philistines twenty years .
and samson went to gaza , and saw there a harlot , and went in unto her .
and it came to pass afterward , that he loved a woman in the valley of sorek , whose name was delilah .
and delilah said to samson , tell me , i pray thee , wherein thy great strength lieth , and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee .
then the lords of the philistines brought up to her seven green withes which had not been dried , and she bound him with them .
and it came to pass , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , that his soul was vexed unto death .
howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven .
and there was a man of the hill-country of ephraim , whose name was micah .
in those days there was no king in israel : every man did that which was right in his own eyes .
and there was a young man out of beth-lehem-judah , of the family of judah , who was a levite ; and he sojourned there .
and the levite was content to dwell with the man ; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons .
and micah consecrated the levite , and the young man became his priest , and was in the house of micah .
then said micah , now know i that jehovah will do me good , seeing i have a levite to my priest .
and he said unto them , thus and thus hath micah dealt with me , and he hath hired me , and i am become his priest .
and they said unto him , ask counsel , we pray thee , of god , that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous .
and the priest said unto them , go in peace : before jehovah is your way wherein ye go .
and they came unto their brethren to zorah and eshtaol : and their brethren said unto them , what say ye ?
and there set forth from thence of the family of the danites , out of zorah and out of eshtaol , six hundred men girt with weapons of war .
and they passed thence unto the hill-country of ephraim , and came unto the house of micah .
and the six hundred men girt with their weapons of war , who were of the children of dan , stood by the entrance of the gate .
so they turned and departed , and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods before them .
and the children of dan went their way : and when micah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back unto his house .
so they set them up micah ’ s graven image which he made , all the time that the house of god was in shiloh .
and the man rose up to depart ; but his father-in-law urged him , and he lodged there again .
and he said unto his servant , come and let us draw near to one of these places ; and we will lodge in gibeah , or in ramah .
so they passed on and went their way ; and the sun went down upon them near to gibeah , which belongeth to benjamin .
and the old man said , peace be unto thee ; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me ; only lodge not in the street .
so he brought him into his house , and gave the asses fodder ; and they washed their feet , and did eat and drink .
behold , ye children of israel , all of you , give here your advice and counsel .
but now this is the thing which we will do to gibeah : we will go up against it by lot ;
so all the men of israel were gathered against the city , knit together as one man .
and the tribes of israel sent men through all the tribe of benjamin , saying , what wickedness is this that is come to pass among you ?
and the children of benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto gibeah , to go out to battle against the children of israel .
among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded ; every one could sling stones at a hair-breadth , and not miss .
and the men of israel , besides benjamin , were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword : all these were men of war .
and the children of israel rose up in the morning , and encamped against gibeah .
and the men of israel went out to battle against benjamin ; and the men of israel set the battle in array against them at gibeah .
and the children of benjamin came forth out of gibeah , and destroyed down to the ground of the israelites on that day twenty and two thousand men .
and the children of israel came near against the children of benjamin the second day .
and the children of israel asked of jehovah ( for the ark of the covenant of god was there in those days ,
and israel set liers-in-wait against gibeah round about .
and the children of israel went up against the children of benjamin on the third day , and set themselves in array against gibeah , as at other times .
and the liers-in-wait hasted , and rushed upon gibeah ; and the liers-in-wait drew themselves along , and smote all the city with the edge of the sword .
now the appointed sign between the men of israel and the liers-in-wait was , that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city .
and the men of israel turned , and the men of benjamin were dismayed ; for they saw that evil was come upon them .
they inclosed the benjamites round about , and chased them , and trod them down at their resting-place , as far as over against gibeah toward the sunrising .
and there fell of benjamin eighteen thousand men ; all these were men of valor .
so that all who fell that day of benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword ; all these were men of valor .
but six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of rimmon , and abode in the rock of rimmon four months .
now the men of israel had sworn in mizpah , saying , there shall not any of us give his daughter unto benjamin to wife .
and the people came to beth-el , and sat there till even before god , and lifted up their voices , and wept sore .
and it came to pass on the morrow , that the people rose early , and built there an altar , and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings .
and the children of israel repented them for benjamin their brother , and said , there is one tribe cut off from israel this day .
how shall we do for wives for them that remain , seeing we have sworn by jehovah that we will not give them of our daughters to wives ?
for when the people were numbered , behold , there were none of the inhabitants of jabesh-gilead there .
and this is the thing that ye shall do : ye shall utterly destroy every male , and every woman that hath lain by man .
and the whole congregation sent and spake to the children of benjamin that were in the rock of rimmon , and proclaimed peace unto them .
and the people repented them for benjamin , because that jehovah had made a breach in the tribes of israel .
then the elders of the congregation said , how shall we do for wives for them that remain , seeing the women are destroyed out of benjamin ?
and they said , there must be an inheritance for them that are escaped of benjamin , that a tribe be not blotted out from israel .
and they commanded the children of benjamin , saying , go and lie in wait in the vineyards ,
in those days there was no king in israel : every man did that which was right in his own eyes .
how doth the city sit solitary , that was full of people !
she weepeth sore in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks ;
judah is gone into captivity because of affliction , and because of great servitude ;
the ways of zion do mourn , because none come to the solemn assembly ;
her adversaries are become the head , her enemies prosper ;
and from the daughter of zion all her majesty is departed :
jerusalem remembereth in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that were from the days of old :
jerusalem hath grievously sinned ; therefore she is become as an unclean thing ;
her filthiness was in her skirts ; she remembered not her latter end ;
the adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things :
all her people sigh , they seek bread ;
is it nothing to you , all ye that pass by ?
from on high hath he sent fire into my bones , and it prevaileth against them ;
the yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand ;
the lord hath set at nought all my mighty men in the midst of me ;
for these things i weep ; mine eye , mine eye runneth down with water ;
zion spreadeth forth her hands ; there is none to comfort her ;
jehovah is righteous ; for i have rebelled against his commandment :
i called for my lovers , but they deceived me :
behold , o jehovah ; for i am in distress ; my heart is troubled ;
they have heard that i sigh ; there is none to comfort me ;
let all their wickedness come before thee ;
how hath the lord covered the daughter of zion with a cloud in his anger !
the lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of jacob , and hath not pitied :
he hath cut off in fierce anger all the horn of israel ;
he hath bent his bow like an enemy , he hath stood with his right hand as an adversary ,
the lord is become as an enemy , he hath swallowed up israel ;
and he hath violently taken away his tabernacle , as if it were of a garden ; he hath destroyed his place of assembly :
the lord hath cast off his altar , he hath abhorred his sanctuary ;
jehovah hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of zion ;
her gates are sunk into the ground ; he hath destroyed and broken her bars :
the elders of the daughter of zion sit upon the ground , they keep silence ;
mine eyes do fail with tears , my heart is troubled ;
they say to their mothers , where is grain and wine ?
what shall i testify unto thee ? what shall i liken to thee , o daughter of jerusalem ?
thy prophets have seen for thee false and foolish visions ;
all that pass by clap their hands at thee ;
all thine enemies have opened their mouth wide against thee ;
jehovah hath done that which he purposed ; he hath fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old ;
their heart cried unto the lord :
arise , cry out in the night , at the beginning of the watches ;
see , o jehovah , and behold to whom thou hast done thus !
the youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets ;
thou hast called , as in the day of a solemn assembly , my terrors on every side ;
i am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath .
he hath led me and caused me to walk in darkness , and not in light .
surely against me he turneth his hand again and again all the day .
my flesh and my skin hath he made old ; he hath broken my bones .
he hath builded against me , and compassed me with gall and travail .
he hath made me to dwell in dark places , as those that have been long dead .
he hath walled me about , that i can not go forth ; he hath made my chain heavy .
yea , when i cry , and call for help , he shutteth out my prayer .
he hath walled up my ways with hewn stone ; he hath made my paths crooked .
he is unto me as a bear lying in wait , as a lion in secret places .
he hath turned aside my ways , and pulled me in pieces ; he hath made me desolate .
he hath bent his bow , and set me as a mark for the arrow .
he hath caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my reins .
i am become a derision to all my people , and their song all the day .
he hath filled me with bitterness , he hath sated me with wormwood .
he hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones ; he hath covered me with ashes .
and thou hast removed my soul far off from peace ; i forgat prosperity .
and i said , my strength is perished , and mine expectation from jehovah .
remember mine affliction and my misery , the wormwood and the gall .
my soul hath them still in remembrance , and is bowed down within me .
this i recall to my mind ; therefore have i hope .
it is of jehovah ’ s lovingkindnesses that we are not consumed , because his compassions fail not .
they are new every morning ; great is thy faithfulness .
jehovah is my portion , saith my soul ; therefore will i hope in him .
jehovah is good unto them that wait for him , to the soul that seeketh him .
it is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of jehovah .
it is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth .
let him sit alone and keep silence , because he hath laid it upon him .
let him put his mouth in the dust , if so be there may be hope .
let him give his cheek to him that smiteth him ; let him be filled full with reproach .
for the lord will not cast off for ever .
for though he cause grief , yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses .
for he doth not afflict willingly , nor grieve the children of men .
to crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth ,
to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most high ,
to subvert a man in his cause , the lord approveth not .
who is he that saith , and it cometh to pass , when the lord commandeth it not ?
out of the mouth of the most high cometh there not evil and good ?
wherefore doth a living man complain , a man for the punishment of his sins ?
let us search and try our ways , and turn again to jehovah .
let us lift up our heart with our hands unto god in the heavens .
we have transgressed and have rebelled ; thou hast not pardoned .
thou hast covered with anger and pursued us ; thou hast slain , thou hast not pitied .
thou hast covered thyself with a cloud , so that no prayer can pass through .
thou hast made us an offscouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples .
all our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us .
fear and the pit are come upon us , devastation and destruction .
mine eye runneth down with streams of water , for the destruction of the daughter of my people .
mine eye poureth down , and ceaseth not , without any intermission ,
till jehovah look down , and behold from heaven .
mine eye affecteth my soul , because of all the daughters of my city .
they have chased me sore like a bird , they that are mine enemies without cause .
they have cut off my life in the dungeon , and have cast a stone upon me .
waters flowed over my head ; i said , i am cut off .
i called upon thy name , o jehovah , out of the lowest dungeon .
thou heardest my voice ; hide not thine ear at my breathing , at my cry .
thou drewest near in the day that i called upon thee ; thou saidst , fear not .
o lord , thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul ; thou hast redeemed my life .
o jehovah , thou hast seen my wrong ; judge thou my cause .
thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me .
thou hast heard their reproach , o jehovah , and all their devices against me ,
the lips of those that rose up against me , and their device against me all the day .
behold thou their sitting down , and their rising up ; i am their song .
thou wilt render unto them a recompense , o jehovah , according to the work of their hands .
thou wilt give them hardness of heart , thy curse unto them .
thou wilt pursue them in anger , and destroy them from under the heavens of jehovah .
how is the gold become dim ! how is the most pure gold changed !
the precious sons of zion , comparable to fine gold ,
even the jackals draw out the breast , they give suck to their young ones :
the tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst :
they that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets :
for the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of sodom ,
her nobles were purer than snow , they were whiter than milk ;
their visage is blacker than a coal ; they are not known in the streets :
they that are slain with the sword are better than they that are slain with hunger ;
the hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children ;
jehovah hath accomplished his wrath , he hath poured out his fierce anger ;
the kings of the earth believed not , neither all the inhabitants of the world ,
it is because of the sins of her prophets , and the iniquities of her priests ,
they wander as blind men in the streets , they are polluted with blood ,
depart ye , they cried unto them , unclean ! depart , depart , touch not !
the anger of jehovah hath scattered them ; he will no more regard them :
our eyes do yet fail in looking for our vain help :
they hunt our steps , so that we can not go in our streets :
our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens :
the breath of our nostrils , the anointed of jehovah , was taken in their pits ;
rejoice and be glad , o daughter of edom , that dwellest in the land of uz :
the punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished , o daughter of zion ; he will no more carry thee away into captivity :
remember , o jehovah , what is come upon us :
our inheritance is turned unto strangers ,
we are orphans and fatherless ;
we have drunken our water for money ;
our pursuers are upon our necks :
we have given the hand to the egyptians ,
our fathers sinned , and are not ;
servants rule over us :
we get our bread at the peril of our lives ,
our skin is black like an oven ,
they ravished the women in zion ,
princes were hanged up by their hand :
the young men bare the mill ;
the elders have ceased from the gate ,
the joy of our heart is ceased ;
the crown is fallen from our head :
for this our heart is faint ;
for the mountain of zion , which is desolate :
thou , o jehovah , abidest for ever ;
wherefore dost thou forget us for ever ,
turn thou us unto thee , o jehovah , and we shall be turned ;
but thou hast utterly rejected us ;
and jehovah called unto moses , and spake unto him out of the tent of meeting , saying ,
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering ; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him .
and he shall flay the burnt-offering , and cut it into its pieces .
and the sons of aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar , and lay wood in order upon the fire ;
and if his oblation to jehovah be a burnt-offering of birds , then he shall offer his oblation of turtle-doves , or of young pigeons .
and he shall take away its crop with the filth thereof , and cast it beside the altar on the east part , in the place of the ashes :
and if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the baking-pan , it shall be of fine flour unleavened , mingled with oil .
thou shalt part it in pieces , and pour oil thereon : it is a meal-offering .
and if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the frying-pan , it shall be made of fine flour with oil .
as an oblation of first-fruits ye shall offer them unto jehovah : but they shall not come up for a sweet savor on the altar .
and thou shalt put oil upon it , and lay frankincense thereon : it is a meal-offering .
and if his oblation for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto jehovah be of the flock ; male or female , he shall offer it without blemish .
if he offer a lamb for his oblation , then shall he offer it before jehovah ;
and the priest shall burn it upon the altar : it is the food of the offering made by fire unto jehovah .
and if his oblation be a goat , then he shall offer it before jehovah :
it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings , that ye shall eat neither fat nor blood .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and the anointed priest shall take of the blood of the bullock , and bring it to the tent of meeting :
and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood , and sprinkle of the blood seven times before jehovah , before the veil of the sanctuary .
as it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace-offerings : and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of burnt-offering .
and the skin of the bullock , and all its flesh , with its head , and with its legs , and its inwards , and its dung ,
and the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before jehovah ; and the bullock shall be killed before jehovah .
and the anointed priest shall bring of the blood of the bullock to the tent of meeting :
and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood , and sprinkle it seven times before jehovah , before the veil .
and all the fat thereof shall he take off from it , and burn it upon the altar .
and he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp , and burn it as he burned the first bullock : it is the sin-offering for the assembly .
when a ruler sinneth , and doeth unwittingly any one of all the things which jehovah his god hath commanded not to be done , and is guilty ;
if his sin , wherein he hath sinned , be made known to him , he shall bring for his oblation a goat , a male without blemish .
and if any one of the common people sin unwittingly , in doing any of the things which jehovah hath commanded not to be done , and be guilty ;
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering , and kill the sin-offering in the place of burnt-offering .
and if he bring a lamb as his oblation for a sin-offering , he shall bring it a female without blemish .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering , and kill it for a sin-offering in the place where they kill the burnt-offering .
and it shall be , when he shall be guilty in one of these things , that he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned :
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
it is a trespass-offering : he is certainly guilty before jehovah .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and the priest shall make atonement for him before jehovah ; and he shall be forgiven concerning whatsoever he doeth so as to be guilty thereby .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and he shall put off his garments , and put on other garments , and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place .
fire shall be kept burning upon the altar continually ; it shall not go out .
and this is the law of the meal-offering : the sons of aaron shall offer it before jehovah , before the altar .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and every meal-offering of the priest shall be wholly burnt : it shall not be eaten .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
the priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it : in a holy place shall it be eaten , in the court of the tent of meeting .
every male among the priests shall eat thereof : it is most holy .
and this is the law of the trespass-offering : it is most holy .
in the place where they kill the burnt-offering shall they kill the trespass-offering ; and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle upon the altar round about .
and he shall offer of it all the fat thereof : the fat tail , and the fat that covereth the inwards ,
and the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto jehovah : it is a trespass-offering .
every male among the priests shall eat thereof : it shall be eaten in a holy place : it is most holy .
as is the sin-offering , so is the trespass-offering ; there is one law for them : the priest that maketh atonement therewith , he shall have it .
and the priest that offereth any man ’ s burnt-offering , even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt-offering which he hath offered .
and every meal-offering , mingled with oil , or dry , shall all the sons of aaron have , one as well as another .
and this is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings , which one shall offer unto jehovah .
with cakes of leavened bread he shall offer his oblation with the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving .
but that which remaineth of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
speak unto the children of israel , saying , ye shall eat no fat , of ox , or sheep , or goat .
and ye shall eat no manner of blood , whether it be of bird or of beast , in any of your dwellings .
whosoever it be that eateth any blood , that soul shall be cut off from his people .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar ; but the breast shall be aaron ’ s and his sons ’ .
and the right thigh shall ye give unto the priest for a heave-offering out of the sacrifices of your peace-offerings .
he among the sons of aaron that offereth the blood of the peace-offerings , and the fat , shall have the right thigh for a portion .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and assemble thou all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting .
and moses did as jehovah commanded him ; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of meeting .
and moses said unto the congregation , this is the thing which jehovah hath commanded to be done .
and moses brought aaron and his sons , and washed them with water .
and he placed the breastplate upon him : and in the breastplate he put the urim and the thummim .
and moses took the anointing oil , and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein , and sanctified them .
and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times , and anointed the altar and all its vessels , and the laver and its base , to sanctify them .
and he poured of the anointing oil upon aaron ’ s head , and anointed him , to sanctify him .
and he brought the bullock of the sin-offering : and aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the sin-offering .
but the bullock , and its skin , and its flesh , and its dung , he burnt with fire without the camp ; as jehovah commanded moses .
and he presented the ram of the burnt-offering : and aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
and he killed it ; and moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about .
and he cut the ram into its pieces ; and moses burnt the head , and the pieces , and the fat .
and he presented the other ram , the ram of consecration : and aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
and he put the whole upon the hands of aaron , and upon the hands of his sons , and waved them for a wave-offering before jehovah .
and that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire .
as hath been done this day , so jehovah hath commanded to do , to make atonement for you .
and aaron and his sons did all the things which jehovah commanded by moses .
and it came to pass on the eighth day , that moses called aaron and his sons , and the elders of israel ;
and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings , to sacrifice before jehovah ; and a meal-offering mingled with oil : for to-day jehovah appeareth unto you .
and they brought that which moses commanded before the tent of meeting : and all the congregation drew near and stood before jehovah .
and moses said , this is the thing which jehovah commanded that ye should do : and the glory of jehovah shall appear unto you .
so aaron drew near unto the altar , and slew the calf of the sin-offering , which was for himself .
but the fat , and the kidneys , and the caul from the liver of the sin-offering , he burnt upon the altar ; as jehovah commanded moses .
and the flesh and the skin he burnt with fire without the camp .
and he slew the burnt-offering ; and aaron ’ s sons delivered unto him the blood , and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about .
and they delivered the burnt-offering unto him , piece by piece , and the head : and he burnt them upon the altar .
and he washed the inwards and the legs , and burnt them upon the burnt-offering on the altar .
and he presented the burnt-offering , and offered it according to the ordinance .
and he presented the meal-offering , and filled his hand therefrom , and burnt it upon the altar , besides the burnt-offering of the morning .
and they put the fat upon the breasts , and he burnt the fat upon the altar :
and the breasts and the right thigh aaron waved for a wave-offering before jehovah ; as moses commanded .
and there came forth fire from before jehovah , and devoured them , and they died before jehovah .
so they drew near , and carried them in their coats out of the camp , as moses had said .
and jehovah spake unto aaron , saying ,
and that ye may make a distinction between the holy and the common , and between the unclean and the clean ;
and that ye may teach the children of israel all the statutes which jehovah hath spoken unto them by moses .
behold , the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary within : ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary , as i commanded .
and when moses heard that , it was well-pleasing in his sight .
and jehovah spake unto moses and to aaron , saying unto them ,
speak unto the children of israel , saying , these are the living things which ye may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth .
whatsoever parteth the hoof , and is clovenfooted , and cheweth the cud , among the beasts , that may ye eat .
and the coney , because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof , he is unclean unto you .
and the hare , because she cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof , she is unclean unto you .
and the swine , because he parteth the hoof , and is clovenfooted , but cheweth not the cud , he is unclean unto you .
of their flesh ye shall not eat , and their carcasses ye shall not touch ; they are unclean unto you .
and they shall be an abomination unto you ; ye shall not eat of their flesh , and their carcasses ye shall have in abomination .
whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters , that is an abomination unto you .
and the kite , and the falcon after its kind ,
every raven after its kind ,
and the ostrich , and the night-hawk , and the sea-mew , and the hawk after its kind ,
and the little owl , and the cormorant , and the great owl ,
and the horned owl , and the pelican , and the vulture ,
and the stork , the heron after its kind , and the hoopoe , and the bat .
all winged creeping things that go upon all fours are an abomination unto you .
yet these may ye eat of all winged creeping things that go upon all fours , which have legs above their feet , wherewith to leap upon the earth .
but all winged creeping things , which have four feet , are an abomination unto you .
and by these ye shall become unclean : whosoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until the even ;
and whosoever beareth aught of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even .
and he that beareth the carcass of them shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : they are unclean unto you .
and the gecko , and the land-crocodile , and the lizard , and the sand-lizard , and the chameleon .
these are they which are unclean to you among all that creep : whosoever doth touch them , when they are dead , shall be unclean until the even .
and every earthen vessel , whereinto any of them falleth , whatsoever is in it shall be unclean , and it ye shall break .
nevertheless a fountain or a pit wherein is a gathering of water shall be clean : but that which toucheth their carcass shall be unclean .
and if aught of their carcass fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown , it is clean .
but if water be put upon the seed , and aught of their carcass fall thereon , it is unclean unto you .
and if any beast , of which ye may eat , die ; he that toucheth the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the even .
and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth is an abomination ; it shall not be eaten .
ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth , neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them , that ye should be defiled thereby .
to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean , and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised .
and jehovah spake unto moses and unto aaron , saying ,
when the plague of leprosy is in a man , then he shall be brought unto the priest ;
but whensoever raw flesh appeareth in him , he shall be unclean .
and the priest shall look on the raw flesh , and pronounce him unclean : the raw flesh is unclean : it is leprosy .
or if the raw flesh turn again , and be changed unto white , then he shall come unto the priest ;
and when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a boil , and it is healed ,
and in the place of the boil there is a white rising , or a bright spot , reddish-white , then it shall be showed to the priest ;
and if it spread abroad in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is a plague .
and when a man or woman hath a plague upon the head or upon the beard ,
then he shall be shaven , but the scall shall he not shave ; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more :
but if the scall spread abroad in the skin after his cleansing ,
and when a man or a woman hath in the skin of the flesh bright spots , even white bright spots ;
and if a man ’ s hair be fallen off his head , he is bald ; yet is he clean .
and if his hair be fallen off from the front part of his head , he is forehead bald ; yet is he clean .
he is a leprous man , he is unclean : the priest shall surely pronounce him unclean ; his plague is in his head .
the garment also that the plague of leprosy is in , whether it be a woollen garment , or a linen garment ;
whether it be in warp , or woof ; of linen , or of woollen ; whether in a skin , or in anything made of skin ;
and the priest shall look upon the plague , and shut up that which hath the plague seven days :
then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is , and he shall shut it up seven days more :
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
this shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing : he shall be brought unto the priest :
then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two living clean birds , and cedar wood , and scarlet , and hyssop :
and the priest shall command to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water .
and the priest shall take of the log of oil , and pour it into the palm of his own left hand ;
and the priest shall offer the burnt-offering and the meal-offering upon the altar : and the priest shall make atonement for him , and he shall be clean .
and on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing unto the priest , unto the door of the tent of meeting , before jehovah :
and the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass-offering , and the log of oil , and the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before jehovah .
and the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand ;
and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before jehovah :
and he shall offer one of the turtle-doves , or of the young pigeons , such as he is able to get ,
this is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy , who is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing .
and jehovah spake unto moses and unto aaron , saying ,
then he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest , saying , there seemeth to me to be as it were a plague in the house .
then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house , and shut up the house seven days .
and the priest shall come again the seventh day , and shall look ; and , behold , if the plague be spread in the walls of the house ;
then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which the plague is , and cast them into an unclean place without the city :
and they shall take other stones , and put them in the place of those stones ; and he shall take other mortar , and shall plaster the house .
moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even .
and he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes ; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes .
and he shall take to cleanse the house two birds , and cedar-wood , and scarlet , and hyssop :
and he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water :
this is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy , and for a scall ,
and for the leprosy of a garment , and for a house ,
and for a rising , and for a scab , and for a bright spot ;
to teach when it is unclean , and when it is clean : this is the law of leprosy .
and jehovah spake unto moses and to aaron , saying ,
every bed whereon he that hath the issue lieth shall be unclean ; and everything whereon he sitteth shall be unclean .
and whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and what saddle soever he that hath the issue rideth upon shall be unclean .
and the earthen vessel , which he that hath the issue toucheth , shall be broken ; and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water .
and every garment , and every skin , whereon is the seed of copulation , shall be washed with water , and be unclean until the even .
the woman also with whom a man shall lie with seed of copulation , they shall both bathe themselves in water , and be unclean until the even .
and everything that she lieth upon in her impurity shall be unclean : everything also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean .
and whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and whosoever toucheth anything that she sitteth upon shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and if it be on the bed , or on anything whereon she sitteth , when he toucheth it , he shall be unclean until the even .
and whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean , and shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
but if she be cleansed of her issue , then she shall number to herself seven days , and after that she shall be clean .
this is the law of him that hath an issue , and of him whose seed of copulation goeth from him , so that he is unclean thereby ;
and jehovah spake unto moses , after the death of the two sons of aaron , when they drew near before jehovah , and died ;
herewith shall aaron come into the holy place : with a young bullock for a sin-offering , and a ram for a burnt-offering .
and he shall take of the congregation of the children of israel two he-goats for a sin-offering , and one ram for a burnt-offering .
and aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering , which is for himself , and make atonement for himself , and for his house .
and he shall take the two goats , and set them before jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting .
and aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats ; one lot for jehovah , and the other lot for azazel .
and aaron shall present the goat upon which the lot fell for jehovah , and offer him for a sin-offering .
and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a solitary land : and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness .
and the fat of the sin-offering shall he burn upon the altar .
and he that letteth go the goat for azazel shall wash his clothes , and bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp .
and he that burneth them shall wash his clothes , and bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp .
for on this day shall atonement be made for you , to cleanse you ; from all your sins shall ye be clean before jehovah .
it is a sabbath of solemn rest unto you , and ye shall afflict your souls ; it is a statute for ever .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and bringeth it not unto the door of the tent of meeting , to sacrifice it unto jehovah ; that man shall be cut off from his people .
therefore i said unto the children of israel , no soul of you shall eat blood , neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood .
but if he wash them not , nor bathe his flesh , then he shall bear his iniquity .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
speak unto the children of israel , and say unto them , i am jehovah your god .
mine ordinances shall ye do , and my statutes shall ye keep , to walk therein : i am jehovah your god .
ye shall therefore keep my statutes , and mine ordinances ; which if a man do , he shall live in them : i am jehovah .
none of you shall approach to any that are near of kin to him , to uncover their nakedness : i am jehovah .
the nakedness of thy father , even the nakedness of thy mother , shalt thou not uncover : she is thy mother ; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness .
the nakedness of thy father ’ s wife shalt thou not uncover ; it is thy father ’ s nakedness .
the nakedness of thy father ’ s wife ’ s daughter , begotten of thy father , she is thy sister , thou shalt not uncover her nakedness .
thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father ’ s sister : she is thy father ’ s near kinswoman .
thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother ’ s sister : for she is thy mother ’ s near kinswoman .
thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father ’ s brother , thou shalt not approach to his wife : she is thine aunt .
thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law : she is thy son ’ s wife ; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness .
thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother ’ s wife : it is thy brother ’ s nakedness .
and thou shalt not take a wife to her sister , to be a rival to her , to uncover her nakedness , besides the other in her life-time .
and thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness , as long as she is impure by her uncleanness .
and thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbor ’ s wife , to defile thyself with her .
thou shalt not lie with mankind , as with womankind : it is abomination .
defile not ye yourselves in any of these things : for in all these the nations are defiled which i cast out from before you ;
and the land is defiled : therefore i do visit the iniquity thereof upon it , and the land vomiteth out her inhabitants .
ye therefore shall keep my statutes and mine ordinances , and shall not do any of these abominations ; neither the home-born , nor the stranger that sojourneth among you
( for all these abominations have the men of the land done , that were before you , and the land is defiled ) ;
that the land vomit not you out also , when ye defile it , as it vomited out the nation that was before you .
for whosoever shall do any of these abominations , even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
speak unto all the congregation of the children of israel , and say unto them , ye shall be holy ; for i jehovah your god am holy .
ye shall fear every man his mother , and his father ; and ye shall keep my sabbaths : i am jehovah your god .
turn ye not unto idols , nor make to yourselves molten gods : i am jehovah your god .
and when ye offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto jehovah , ye shall offer it that ye may be accepted .
and if it be eaten at all on the third day , it is an abomination ; it shall not be accepted :
ye shall not steal ; neither shall ye deal falsely , nor lie one to another .
and ye shall not swear by my name falsely , and profane the name of thy god : i am jehovah .
thou shalt not oppress thy neighbor , nor rob him : the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night until the morning .
thou shalt not curse the deaf , nor put a stumblingblock before the blind ; but thou shalt fear thy god : i am jehovah .
thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people : neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor : i am jehovah .
thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart : thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbor , and not bear sin because of him .
thou shalt not take vengeance , nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people ; but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself : i am jehovah .
and he shall bring his trespass-offering unto jehovah , unto the door of the tent of meeting , even a ram for a trespass-offering .
but in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy , for giving praise unto jehovah .
and in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof , that it may yield unto you the increase thereof : i am jehovah your god .
ye shall not eat anything with the blood : neither shall ye use enchantments , nor practise augury .
ye shall not round the corners of your heads , neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard .
ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead , nor print any marks upon you : i am jehovah .
profane not thy daughter , to make her a harlot ; lest the land fall to whoredom , and the land become full of wickedness .
ye shall keep my sabbaths , and reverence my sanctuary : i am jehovah .
thou shalt rise up before the hoary head , and honor the face of the old man , and thou shalt fear thy god : i am jehovah .
and if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land , ye shall not do him wrong .
ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment , in measures of length , of weight , or of quantity .
and ye shall observe all my statutes , and all mine ordinances , and do them : i am jehovah .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
sanctify yourselves therefore , and be ye holy ; for i am jehovah your god .
and ye shall keep my statutes , and do them : i am jehovah who sanctifieth you .
and if a man lie with a beast , he shall surely be put to death : and ye shall slay the beast .
and if a man shall take his brother ’ s wife , it is impurity : he hath uncovered his brother ’ s nakedness ; they shall be childless .
and for his sister a virgin , that is near unto him , that hath had no husband ; for her may he defile himself .
he shall not defile himself , being a chief man among his people , to profane himself .
they shall not make baldness upon their head , neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard , nor make any cuttings in their flesh .
and the daughter of any priest , if she profane herself by playing the harlot , she profaneth her father : she shall be burnt with fire .
neither shall he go in to any dead body , nor defile himself for his father , or for his mother ;
and he shall take a wife in her virginity .
and he shall not profane his seed among his people : for i am jehovah who sanctifieth him .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
or a man that is broken-footed , or broken-handed ,
or crook-backed , or a dwarf , or that hath a blemish in his eye , or is scurvy , or scabbed , or hath his stones broken ;
he shall eat the bread of his god , both of the most holy , and of the holy :
so moses spake unto aaron , and to his sons , and unto all the children of israel .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing , whereby he may be made unclean , or a man of whom he may take uncleanness , whatsoever uncleanness he hath ;
the soul that toucheth any such shall be unclean until the even , and shall not eat of the holy things , unless he bathe his flesh in water .
and when the sun is down , he shall be clean ; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things , because it is his bread .
that which dieth of itself , or is torn of beasts , he shall not eat , to defile himself therewith : i am jehovah .
they shall therefore keep my charge , lest they bear sin for it , and die therein , if they profane it : i am jehovah who sanctifieth them .
and if a priest ’ s daughter be married unto a stranger , she shall not eat of the heave-offering of the holy things .
and they shall not profane the holy things of the children of israel , which they offer unto jehovah ,
and so cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt , when they eat their holy things : for i am jehovah who sanctifieth them .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
that ye may be accepted , ye shall offer a male without blemish , of the bullocks , of the sheep , or of the goats .
but whatsoever hath a blemish , that shall ye not offer : for it shall not be acceptable for you .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and whether it be cow or ewe , ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day .
and when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto jehovah , ye shall sacrifice it that ye may be accepted .
on the same day it shall be eaten ; ye shall leave none of it until the morning : i am jehovah .
therefore shall ye keep my commandments , and do them : i am jehovah .
and ye shall not profane my holy name ; but i will be hallowed among the children of israel : i am jehovah who halloweth you ,
who brought you out of the land of egypt , to be your god : i am jehovah .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
these are the set feasts of jehovah , even holy convocations , which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season .
in the first month , on the fourteenth day of the month at even , is jehovah ’ s passover .
and on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto jehovah : seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread .
in the first day ye shall have a holy convocation : ye shall do no servile work .
but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto jehovah seven days : in the seventh day is a holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and he shall wave the sheaf before jehovah , to be accepted for you : on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it .
and in the day when ye wave the sheaf , ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt-offering unto jehovah .
even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days ; and ye shall offer a new meal-offering unto jehovah .
and ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin-offering , and two he-lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace-offerings .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
ye shall do no servile work ; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto jehovah .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
for whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day ; he shall be cut off from his people .
and whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day , that soul will i destroy from among his people .
ye shall do no manner of work : it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
speak unto the children of israel , saying , on the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto jehovah .
on the first day shall be a holy convocation : ye shall do no servile work .
besides the sabbaths of jehovah , and besides your gifts , and besides all your vows , and besides all your freewill-offerings , which ye give unto jehovah .
ye shall dwell in booths seven days ; all that are home-born in israel shall dwell in booths ;
and moses declared unto the children of israel the set feasts of jehovah .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
command the children of israel , that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light , to cause a lamp to burn continually .
he shall keep in order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before jehovah continually .
and thou shalt take fine flour , and bake twelve cakes thereof : two tenth parts of an ephah shall be in one cake .
and thou shalt set them in two rows , six on a row , upon the pure table before jehovah .
and thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row , that it may be to the bread for a memorial , even an offering made by fire unto jehovah .
every sabbath day he shall set it in order before jehovah continually ; it is on the behalf of the children of israel , an everlasting covenant .
and they put him in ward , that it might be declared unto them at the mouth of jehovah .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel , saying , whosoever curseth his god shall bear his sin .
and he that smiteth any man mortally shall surely be put to death .
and he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good , life for life .
and if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor ; as he hath done , so shall it be done to him :
breach for breach , eye for eye , tooth for tooth ; as he hath caused a blemish in a man , so shall it be rendered unto him .
and he that killeth a beast shall make it good : and he that killeth a man shall be put to death .
ye shall have one manner of law , as well for the sojourner , as for the home-born : for i am jehovah your god .
and jehovah spake unto moses in mount sinai , saying ,
six years thou shalt sow thy field , and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard , and gather in the fruits thereof ;
and for thy cattle , and for the beasts that are in thy land , shall all the increase thereof be for food .
for it is a jubilee ; it shall be holy unto you : ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field .
in this year of jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession .
and if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor , or buy of thy neighbor ’ s hand , ye shall not wrong one another .
and ye shall not wrong one another ; but thou shalt fear thy god : for i am jehovah your god .
wherefore ye shall do my statutes , and keep mine ordinances and do them ; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety .
and the land shall yield its fruit , and ye shall eat your fill , and dwell therein in safety .
and if ye shall say , what shall we eat the seventh year ? behold , we shall not sow , nor gather in our increase ;
then i will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year , and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years .
and the land shall not be sold in perpetuity ; for the land is mine : for ye are strangers and sojourners with me .
and in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land .
and if a man have no one to redeem it , and he be waxed rich and find sufficient to redeem it ;
nevertheless the cities of the levites , the houses of the cities of their possession , may the levites redeem at any time .
but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold ; for it is their perpetual possession .
take thou no interest of him or increase , but fear thy god ; that thy brother may live with thee .
thou shalt not give him thy money upon interest , nor give him thy victuals for increase .
and if thy brother be waxed poor with thee , and sell himself unto thee ; thou shalt not make him to serve as a bondservant .
as a hired servant , and as a sojourner , he shall be with thee ; he shall serve with thee unto the year of jubilee :
for they are my servants , whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt : they shall not be sold as bondmen .
thou shalt not rule over him with rigor , but shalt fear thy god .
after that he is sold he may be redeemed : one of his brethren may redeem him ;
if there be yet many years , according unto them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for .
as a servant hired year by year shall he be with him : he shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight .
and if he be not redeemed by these means , then he shall go out in the year of jubilee , he , and his children with him .
ye shall keep my sabbaths , and reverence my sanctuary : i am jehovah .
if ye walk in my statutes , and keep my commandments , and do them ;
then i will give your rains in their season , and the land shall yield its increase , and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit .
and ye shall chase your enemies , and they shall fall before you by the sword .
and five of you shall chase a hundred , and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand ; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword .
and i will have respect unto you , and make you fruitful , and multiply you , and will establish my covenant with you .
and ye shall eat old store long kept , and ye shall bring forth the old because of the new .
and i will set my tabernacle among you : and my soul shall not abhor you .
and i will walk among you , and will be your god , and ye shall be my people .
but if ye will not hearken unto me , and will not do all these commandments ;
and if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto me , then i will chastise you seven times more for your sins .
and i will break the pride of your power : and i will make your heaven as iron , and your earth as brass ;
and your strength shall be spent in vain ; for your land shall not yield its increase , neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit .
and if ye walk contrary unto me , and will not hearken unto me , i will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins .
and if by these things ye will not be reformed unto me , but will walk contrary unto me ;
then will i also walk contrary unto you ; and i will smite you , even i , seven times for your sins .
and if ye will not for all this hearken unto me , but walk contrary unto me ;
then i will walk contrary unto you in wrath ; and i also will chastise you seven times for your sins .
and ye shall eat the flesh of your sons , and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat .
and i will make your cities a waste , and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation , and i will not smell the savor of your sweet odors .
and i will bring the land into desolation ; and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it .
as long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest , even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths , when ye dwelt upon it .
and ye shall perish among the nations , and the land of your enemies shall eat you up .
these are the statutes and ordinances and laws , which jehovah made between him and the children of israel in mount sinai by moses .
and jehovah spake unto moses , saying ,
speak unto the children of israel , and say unto them , when a man shall accomplish a vow , the persons shall be for jehovah by thy estimation .
and if it be a female , then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels .
and if it be a beast , whereof men offer an oblation unto jehovah , all that any man giveth of such unto jehovah shall be holy .
and if it be any unclean beast , of which they do not offer an oblation unto jehovah , then he shall set the beast before the priest ;
and the priest shall value it , whether it be good or bad : as thou the priest valuest it , so shall it be .
but if he will indeed redeem it , then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto thy estimation .
if he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee , according to thy estimation it shall stand .
and if he will not redeem the field , or if he have sold the field to another man , it shall not be redeemed any more :
and if he sanctify unto jehovah a field which he hath bought , which is not of the field of his possession ;
in the year of jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought , even to him to whom the possession of the land belongeth .
and all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary : twenty gerahs shall be the shekel .
no one devoted , that shall be devoted from among men , shall be ransomed ; he shall surely be put to death .
and if a man will redeem aught of his tithe , he shall add unto it the fifth part thereof .
and all the tithe of the herd or the flock , whatsoever passeth under the rod , the tenth shall be holy unto jehovah .
these are the commandments , which jehovah commanded moses for the children of israel in mount sinai .
forasmuch as many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us ,
even as they delivered them unto us , who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word ,
it seemed good to me also , having traced the course of all things accurately from the first , to write unto thee in order , most excellent theophilus ;
that thou mightest know the certainty concerning the things wherein thou wast instructed .
and they were both righteous before god , walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless .
and they had no child , because that elisabeth was barren , and they both were now well stricken in years .
now it came to pass , while he executed the priest ’ s office before god in the order of his course ,
according to the custom of the priest ’ s office , his lot was to enter into the temple of the lord and burn incense .
and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense .
and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense .
and zacharias was troubled when he saw him , and fear fell upon him .
and thou shalt have joy and gladness ; and many shall rejoice at his birth .
and many of the children of israel shall he turn unto the lord their god .
and zacharias said unto the angel , whereby shall i know this ? for i am an old man , and my wife well stricken in years .
and the people were waiting for zacharias , and they marvelled while he tarried in the temple .
and it came to pass , when the days of his ministration were fulfilled , he departed unto his house .
and after these days elisabeth his wife conceived ; and she hid herself five months , saying ,
thus hath the lord done unto me in the days wherein he looked upon me , to take away my reproach among men .
now in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee , named nazareth ,
to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was joseph , of the house of david ; and the virgin ’ s name was mary .
and he came in unto her , and said , hail , thou that art highly favored , the lord is with thee .
but she was greatly troubled at the saying , and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this might be .
and the angel said unto her , fear not , mary : for thou hast found favor with god .
and behold , thou shalt conceive in thy womb , and bring forth a son , and shalt call his name jesus .
and he shall reign over the house of jacob for ever ; and of his kingdom there shall be no end .
and mary said unto the angel , how shall this be , seeing i know not a man ?
for no word from god shall be void of power .
and mary said , behold , the handmaid of the lord ; be it unto me according to thy word . and the angel departed from her .
and mary arose in these days and went into the hill country with haste , into a city of judah ;
and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elisabeth .
and it came to pass , when elisabeth heard the salutation of mary , the babe leaped in her womb ; and elisabeth was filled with the holy spirit ;
and she lifted up her voice with a loud cry , and said , blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb .
and whence is this to me , that the mother of my lord should come unto me ?
for behold , when the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears , the babe leaped in my womb for joy .
and blessed is she that believed ; for there shall be a fulfilment of the things which have been spoken to her from the lord .
and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my saviour .
for he hath looked upon the low estate of his handmaid :
for he that is mighty hath done to me great things ;
and his mercy is unto generations and generations
he hath showed strength with his arm ;
he hath put down princes from their thrones ,
the hungry he hath filled with good things ;
he hath given help to israel his servant ,
( as he spake unto our fathers )
and mary abode with her about three months , and returned unto her house .
now elisabeth ’ s time was fulfilled that she should be delivered ; and she brought forth a son .
and her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard that the lord had magnified his mercy towards her ; and they rejoiced with her .
and his mother answered and said , not so ; but he shall be called john .
and they said unto her , there is none of thy kindred that is called by this name .
and they made signs to his father , what he would have him called .
and he asked for a writing tablet , and wrote , saying , his name is john . and they marvelled all .
and his mouth was opened immediately , and his tongue loosed , and he spake , blessing god .
and fear came on all that dwelt round about them : and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of judaea .
and his father zacharias was filled with the holy spirit , and prophesied , saying ,
blessed be the lord , the god of israel ;
and hath raised up a horn of salvation for us
( as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from of old ) ,
salvation from our enemies , and from the hand of all that hate us ;
to show mercy towards our fathers ,
the oath which he sware unto abraham our father ,
to grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies
in holiness and righteousness before him all our days .
yea and thou , child , shalt be called the prophet of the most high :
to give knowledge of salvation unto his people
because of the tender mercy of our god ,
to shine upon them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death ;
and the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto israel .
now it came to pass in those days , there went out a decree from caesar augustus , that all the world should be enrolled .
this was the first enrolment made when quirinius was governor of syria .
and all went to enrol themselves , every one to his own city .
to enrol himself with mary , who was betrothed to him , being great with child .
and it came to pass , while they were there , the days were fulfilled that she should be delivered .
and there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the field , and keeping watch by night over their flock .
and an angel of the lord stood by them , and the glory of the lord shone round about them : and they were sore afraid .
and the angel said unto them , be not afraid ; for behold , i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all the people :
for there is born to you this day in the city of david a saviour , who is christ the lord .
and this is the sign unto you : ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes , and lying in a manger .
and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god , and saying ,
glory to god in the highest ,
and they came with haste , and found both mary and joseph , and the babe lying in the manger .
and when they saw it , they made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this child .
and all that heard it wondered at the things which were spoken unto them by the shepherds .
but mary kept all these sayings , pondering them in her heart .
and the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen , even as it was spoken unto them .
and when the days of their purification according to the law of moses were fulfilled , they brought him up to jerusalem , to present him to the lord
( as it is written in the law of the lord , every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord ) ,
and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord , a pair of turtledoves , or two young pigeons .
and it had been revealed unto him by the holy spirit , that he should not see death , before he had seen the lord ’ s christ .
then he received him into his arms , and blessed god , and said ,
now lettest thou thy servant depart , lord ,
for mine eyes have seen thy salvation ,
which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples ;
a light for revelation to the gentiles ,
and his father and his mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him ;
yea and a sword shall pierce through thine own soul ; that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed .
and she had been a widow even unto fourscore and four years ) , who departed not from the temple , worshipping with fastings and supplications night and day .
and coming up at that very hour she gave thanks unto god , and spake of him to all them that were looking for the redemption of jerusalem .
and when they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the lord , they returned into galilee , to their own city nazareth .
and the child grew , and waxed strong , filled with wisdom : and the grace of god was upon him .
and his parents went every year to jerusalem at the feast of the passover .
and when he was twelve years old , they went up after the custom of the feast ;
and when they had fulfilled the days , as they were returning , the boy jesus tarried behind in jerusalem ; and his parents knew it not ;
but supposing him to be in the company , they went a day ’ s journey ; and they sought for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance :
and when they found him not , they returned to jerusalem , seeking for him .
and all that heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers .
and he said unto them , how is it that ye sought me ? knew ye not that i must be in my father ’ s house ?
and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them .
and he went down with them , and came to nazareth ; and he was subject unto them : and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart .
and jesus advanced in wisdom and stature , and in favor with god and men .
in the high-priesthood of annas and caiaphas , the word of god came unto john the son of zacharias in the wilderness .
and he came into all the region round about the jordan , preaching the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins ;
as it is written in the book of the words of isaiah the prophet ,
every valley shall be filled ,
and all flesh shall see the salvation of god .
and the multitudes asked him , saying , what then must we do ?
and there came also publicans to be baptized , and they said unto him , teacher , what must we do ?
and he said unto them , extort no more than that which is appointed you .
and as the people were in expectation , and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning john , whether haply he were the christ ;
with many other exhortations therefore preached he good tidings unto the people ;
but herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him for herodias his brother ’ s wife , and for all the evil things which herod had done ,
added this also to them all , that he shut up john in prison .
now it came to pass , when all the people were baptized , that , jesus also having been baptized , and praying , the heaven was opened ,
the son of matthat , the son of levi , the son of melchi , the son of jannai , the son of joseph ,

and jesus , full of the holy spirit , returned from the jordan , and was led in the spirit in the wilderness
during forty days , being tempted of the devil . and he did eat nothing in those days : and when they were completed , he hungered .
and the devil said unto him , if thou art the son of god , command this stone that it become bread .
and jesus answered unto him , it is written , man shall not live by bread alone .
and he led him up , and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
if thou therefore wilt worship before me , it shall all be thine .
and jesus answered and said unto him , it is written , thou shalt worship the lord thy god , and him only shalt thou serve .
for it is written ,
and jesus answering said unto him , it is said , thou shalt not make trial of the lord thy god .
and when the devil had completed every temptation , he departed from him for a season .
and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee : and a fame went out concerning him through all the region round about .
and he taught in their synagogues , being glorified of all .
and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah . and he opened the book , and found the place where it was written ,
the spirit of the lord is upon me ,
to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord .
and he began to say unto them , to-day hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears .
and he said , verily i say unto you , no prophet is acceptable in his own country .
and unto none of them was elijah sent , but only to zarephath , in the land of sidon , unto a woman that was a widow .
and there were many lepers in israel in the time of elisha the prophet ; and none of them was cleansed , but only naaman the syrian .
and they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue , as they heard these things ;
but he passing through the midst of them went his way .
and he came down to capernaum , a city of galilee . and he was teaching them on the sabbath day :
and they were astonished at his teaching ; for his word was with authority .
and in the synagogue there was a man , that had a spirit of an unclean demon ; and he cried out with a loud voice ,
and there went forth a rumor concerning him into every place of the region round about .
and he stood over her , and rebuked the fever ; and it left her : and immediately she rose up and ministered unto them .
but he said unto them , i must preach the good tidings of the kingdom of god to the other cities also : for therefore was i sent .
and he was preaching in the synagogues of galilee .
now it came to pass , while the multitude pressed upon him and heard the word of god , that he was standing by the lake of gennesaret ;
and he saw two boats standing by the lake : but the fishermen had gone out of them , and were washing their nets .
and when he had left speaking , he said unto simon , put out into the deep , and let down your nets for a draught .
and simon answered and said , master , we toiled all night , and took nothing : but at thy word i will let down the nets .
and when they had done this , they inclosed a great multitude of fishes ; and their nets were breaking ;
for he was amazed , and all that were with him , at the draught of the fishes which they had taken ;
and when they had brought their boats to land , they left all , and followed him .
and he stretched forth his hand , and touched him , saying , i will ; be thou made clean . and straightway the leprosy departed from him .
but so much the more went abroad the report concerning him : and great multitudes came together to hear , and to be healed of their infirmities .
but he withdrew himself in the deserts , and prayed .
and behold , men bring on a bed a man that was palsied : and they sought to bring him in , and to lay him before him .
and seeing their faith , he said , man , thy sins are forgiven thee .
and the scribes and the pharisees began to reason , saying , who is this that speaketh blasphemies ? who can forgive sins , but god alone ?
but jesus perceiving their reasonings , answered and said unto them , why reason ye in your hearts ?
which is easier , to say , thy sins are forgiven thee ; or to say , arise and walk ?
and immediately he rose up before them , and took up that whereon he lay , and departed to his house , glorifying god .
and amazement took hold on all , and they glorified god ; and they were filled with fear , saying , we have seen strange things to-day .
and he forsook all , and rose up and followed him .
and levi made him a great feast in his house : and there was a great multitude of publicans and of others that were sitting at meat with them .
and the pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples , saying , why do ye eat and drink with the publicans and sinners ?
and jesus answering said unto them , they that are in health have no need of a physician ; but they that are sick .
i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance .
and jesus said unto them , can ye make the sons of the bride-chamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ?
but the days will come ; and when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , then will they fast in those days .
but new wine must be put into fresh wine-skins .
and no man having drunk old wine desireth new ; for he saith , the old is good .
but certain of the pharisees said , why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath day ?
and he said unto them , the son of man is lord of the sabbath .
and the scribes and the pharisees watched him , whether he would heal on the sabbath ; that they might find how to accuse him .
and he looked round about on them all , and said unto him , stretch forth thy hand . and he did so : and his hand was restored .
but they were filled with madness ; and communed one with another what they might do to jesus .
and it came to pass in these days , that he went out into the mountain to pray ; and he continued all night in prayer to god .
and when it was day , he called his disciples ; and he chose from them twelve , whom also he named apostles :
simon , whom he also named peter , and andrew his brother , and james and john , and philip and bartholomew ,
and matthew and thomas , and james the son of alphaeus , and simon who was called the zealot ,
and judas the son of james , and judas iscariot , who became a traitor ;
and they that were troubled with unclean spirits were healed .
and all the multitude sought to touch him ; for power came forth from him , and healed them all .
and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples , and said , blessed are ye poor : for yours is the kingdom of god .
blessed are ye that hunger now : for ye shall be filled . blessed are ye that weep now : for ye shall laugh .
but woe unto you that are rich ! for ye have received your consolation .
woe unto you , when all men shall speak well of you ! for in the same manner did their fathers to the false prophets .
but i say unto you that hear , love your enemies , do good to them that hate you ,
bless them that curse you , pray for them that despitefully use you .
to him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other ; and from him that taketh away thy cloak withhold not thy coat also .
give to every one that asketh thee ; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again .
and as ye would that men should do to you , do ye also to them likewise .
and if ye love them that love you , what thank have ye ? for even sinners love those that love them .
and if ye do good to them that do good to you , what thank have ye ? for even sinners do the same .
and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive , what thank have ye ? even sinners lend to sinners , to receive again as much .
be ye merciful , even as your father is merciful .
and judge not , and ye shall not be judged : and condemn not , and ye shall not be condemned : release , and ye shall be released :
and he spake also a parable unto them , can the blind guide the blind ? shall they not both fall into a pit ?
the disciple is not above his teacher : but every one when he is perfected shall be as his teacher .
and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother ’ s eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
for there is no good tree that bringeth forth corrupt fruit ; nor again a corrupt tree that bringeth forth good fruit .
for each tree is known by its own fruit . for of thorns men do not gather figs , nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes .
and why call ye me , lord , lord , and do not the things which i say ?
every one that cometh unto me , and heareth my words , and doeth them , i will show you to whom he is like :
after he had ended all his sayings in the ears of the people , he entered into capernaum .
and a certain centurion ’ s servant , who was dear unto him , was sick and at the point of death .
and when he heard concerning jesus , he sent unto him elders of the jews , asking him that he would come and save his servant .
and they , when they came to jesus , besought him earnestly , saying , he is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him ;
for he loveth our nation , and himself built us our synagogue .
wherefore neither thought i myself worthy to come unto thee : but say the word , and my servant shall be healed .
and they that were sent , returning to the house , found the servant whole .
and it came to pass soon afterwards , that he went to a city called nain ; and his disciples went with him , and a great multitude .
and when the lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and said unto her , weep not .
and he came nigh and touched the bier : and the bearers stood still . and he said , young man , i say unto thee , arise .
and he that was dead sat up , and began to speak . and he gave him to his mother .
and fear took hold on all : and they glorified god , saying , a great prophet is arisen among us : and , god hath visited his people .
and this report went forth concerning him in the whole of judaea , and all the region round about .
and the disciples of john told him of all these things .
and john calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to the lord , saying , art thou he that cometh , or look we for another ?
in that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits ; and on many that were blind he bestowed sight .
and blessed is he , whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me .
but what went ye out to see ? a prophet ? yea , i say unto you , and much more than a prophet .
this is he of whom it is written ,
and all the people when they heard , and the publicans , justified god , being baptized with the baptism of john .
but the pharisees and the lawyers rejected for themselves the counsel of god , being not baptized of him .
whereunto then shall i liken the men of this generation , and to what are they like ?
for john the baptist is come eating no bread nor drinking wine ; and ye say , he hath a demon .
and wisdom is justified of all her children .
and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him . and he entered into the pharisee ’ s house , and sat down to meat .
and jesus answering said unto him , simon , i have somewhat to say unto thee . and he saith , teacher , say on .
a certain lender had two debtors : the one owed five hundred shillings , and the other fifty .
when they had not wherewith to pay , he forgave them both . which of them therefore will love him most ?
simon answered and said , he , i suppose , to whom he forgave the most . and he said unto him , thou hast rightly judged .
thou gavest me no kiss : but she , since the time i came in , hath not ceased to kiss my feet .
my head with oil thou didst not anoint : but she hath anointed my feet with ointment .
and he said unto her , thy sins are forgiven .
and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves , who is this that even forgiveth sins ?
and he said unto the woman , thy faith hath saved thee ; go in peace .
and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities : mary that was called magdalene , from whom seven demons had gone out ,
and joanna the wife of chuzas herod ’ s steward , and susanna , and many others , who ministered unto them of their substance .
and when a great multitude came together , and they of every city resorted unto him , he spake by a parable :
and other fell on the rock ; and as soon as it grew , it withered away , because it had no moisture .
and other fell amidst the thorns ; and the thorns grew with it , and choked it .
and his disciples asked him what this parable might be .
now the parable is this : the seed is the word of god .
for nothing is hid , that shall not be made manifest ; nor anything secret , that shall not be known and come to light .
and there came to him his mother and brethren , and they could not come at him for the crowd .
and it was told him , thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to see thee .
but he answered and said unto them , my mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of god , and do it .
and they arrived at the country of the gerasenes , which is over against galilee .
and jesus asked him , what is thy name ? and he said , legion ; for many demons were entered into him .
and they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss .
and the demons came out from the man , and entered into the swine : and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake , and were drowned .
and when they that fed them saw what had come to pass , they fled , and told it in the city and in the country .
and they that saw it told them how he that was possessed with demons was made whole .
but the man from whom the demons were gone out prayed him that he might be with him : but he sent him away , saying ,
and as jesus returned , the multitude welcomed him ; for they were all waiting for him .
for he had an only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she was dying . but as he went the multitudes thronged him .
and a woman having an issue of blood twelve years , who had spent all her living upon physicians , and could not be healed of any ,
came behind him , and touched the border of his garment : and immediately the issue of her blood stanched .
but jesus said , some one did touch me ; for i perceived that power had gone forth from me .
and he said unto her , daughter , thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace .
while he yet spake , there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue ’ s house , saying , thy daughter is dead ; trouble not the teacher .
but jesus hearing it , answered him , fear not : only believe , and she shall be made whole .
and all were weeping , and bewailing her : but he said , weep not ; for she is not dead , but sleepeth .
and they laughed him to scorn , knowing that she was dead .
but he , taking her by the hand , called , saying , maiden , arise .
and her spirit returned , and she rose up immediately : and he commanded that something be given her to eat .
and her parents were amazed : but he charged them to tell no man what had been done .
and he called the twelve together , and gave them power and authority over all demons , and to cure diseases .
and he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of god , and to heal the sick .
and he said unto them , take nothing for your journey , neither staff , nor wallet , nor bread , nor money ; neither have two coats .
and into whatsoever house ye enter , there abide , and thence depart .
and as many as receive you not , when ye depart from that city , shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them .
and they departed , and went throughout the villages , preaching the gospel , and healing everywhere .
and by some , that elijah had appeared ; and by others , that one of the old prophets was risen again .
and herod said , john i beheaded : but who is this , about whom i hear such things ? and he sought to see him .
for they were about five thousand men . and he said unto his disciples , make them sit down in companies , about fifty each .
and they did so , and made them all sit down .
and they ate , and were all filled : and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces , twelve baskets .
and they answering said , john the baptist ; but others say , elijah ; and others , that one of the old prophets is risen again .
and he said unto them , but who say ye that i am ? and peter answering said , the christ of god .
but he charged them , and commanded them to tell this to no man ;
and he said unto all , if any man would come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me .
for whosoever would save his life shall lose it ; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake , the same shall save it .
for what is a man profited , if he gain the whole world , and lose or forfeit his own self ?
and as he was praying , the fashion of his countenance was altered , and his raiment became white and dazzling .
and behold , there talked with him two men , who were moses and elijah ;
who appeared in glory , and spake of his decease which he was about to accomplish at jerusalem .
and while he said these things , there came a cloud , and overshadowed them : and they feared as they entered into the cloud .
and a voice came out of the cloud , saying , this is my son , my chosen : hear ye him .
and it came to pass , on the next day , when they were come down from the mountain , a great multitude met him .
and behold , a man from the multitude cried , saying , teacher , i beseech thee to look upon my son ; for he is mine only child :
and i besought thy disciples to cast it out ; and they could not .
and jesus answered and said , o faithless and perverse generation , how long shall i be with you , and bear with you ? bring hither thy son .
and they were all astonished at the majesty of god .
let these words sink into your ears : for the son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men .
and there arose a reasoning among them , which of them was the greatest .
but when jesus saw the reasoning of their heart , he took a little child , and set him by his side ,
and john answered and said , master , we saw one casting out demons in thy name ; and we forbade him , because he followeth not with us .
but jesus said unto him , forbid him not : for he that is not against you is for you .
and it came to pass , when the days were well-nigh come that he should be received up , he stedfastly set his face to go to jerusalem ,
and sent messengers before his face : and they went , and entered into a village of the samaritans , to make ready for him .
and they did not receive him , because his face was as though he were going to jerusalem .
but he turned , and rebuked them .
and they went to another village .
and as they went on the way , a certain man said unto him , i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
and he said unto another , follow me . but he said , lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father .
but he said unto him , leave the dead to bury their own dead ; but go thou and publish abroad the kingdom of god .
and another also said , i will follow thee , lord ; but first suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house .
but jesus said unto him , no man , having put his hand to the plow , and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of god .
go your ways ; behold , i send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves .
carry no purse , no wallet , no shoes ; and salute no man on the way .
and into whatsoever house ye shall enter , first say , peace be to this house .
and if a son of peace be there , your peace shall rest upon him : but if not , it shall turn to you again .
and into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you , eat such things as are set before you :
and heal the sick that are therein , and say unto them , the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you .
but into whatsoever city ye shall enter , and they receive you not , go out into the streets thereof and say ,
i say unto you , it shall be more tolerable in that day for sodom , than for that city .
but it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon in the judgment , than for you .
and thou , capernaum , shalt thou be exalted unto heaven ? thou shalt be brought down unto hades .
he that heareth you heareth me ; and he that rejecteth you rejecteth me ; and he that rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent me .
and the seventy returned with joy , saying , lord , even the demons are subject unto us in thy name .
and he said unto them , i beheld satan fallen as lightning from heaven .
nevertheless in this rejoice not , that the spirits are subject unto you ; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven .
and turning to the disciples , he said privately , blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see :
and behold , a certain lawyer stood up and made trial of him , saying , teacher , what shall i do to inherit eternal life ?
and he said unto him , what is written in the law ? how readest thou ?
and he said unto him , thou hast answered right : this do , and thou shalt live .
but he , desiring to justify himself , said unto jesus , and who is my neighbor ?
and by chance a certain priest was going down that way : and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
and in like manner a levite also , when he came to the place , and saw him , passed by on the other side .
but a certain samaritan , as he journeyed , came where he was : and when he saw him , he was moved with compassion ,
which of these three , thinkest thou , proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers ?
and he said , he that showed mercy on him . and jesus said unto him , go , and do thou likewise .
now as they went on their way , he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman named martha received him into her house .
and she had a sister called mary , who also sat at the lord ’ s feet , and heard his word .
but the lord answered and said unto her , martha , martha , thou art anxious and troubled about many things :
but one thing is needful : for mary hath chosen the good part , which shall not be taken away from her .
and he said unto them , when ye pray , say , father , hallowed be thy name . thy kingdom come .
give us day by day our daily bread .
and forgive us our sins ; for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us . and bring us not into temptation .
for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey , and i have nothing to set before him ;
for every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
or if he shall ask an egg , will he give him a scorpion ?
but some of them said , by beelzebub the prince of the demons casteth he out demons .
and others , trying him , sought of him a sign from heaven .
but he , knowing their thoughts , said unto them , every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and a house divided against a house falleth .
and if satan also is divided against himself , how shall his kingdom stand ? because ye say that i cast out demons by beelzebub .
and if i by beelzebub cast out demons , by whom do your sons cast them out ? therefore shall they be your judges .
but if i by the finger of god cast out demons , then is the kingdom of god come upon you .
when the strong man fully armed guardeth his own court , his goods are in peace :
he that is not with me is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth .
and when he is come , he findeth it swept and garnished .
but he said , yea rather , blessed are they that hear the word of god , and keep it .
for even as jonah became a sign unto the ninevites , so shall also the son of man be to this generation .
look therefore whether the light that is in thee be not darkness .
now as he spake , a pharisee asketh him to dine with him : and he went in , and sat down to meat .
and when the pharisee saw it , he marvelled that he had not first bathed himself before dinner .
ye foolish ones , did not he that made the outside make the inside also ?
but give for alms those things which are within ; and behold , all things are clean unto you .
woe unto you pharisees ! for ye love the chief seats in the synagogues , and the salutations in the marketplaces .
woe unto you ! for ye are as the tombs which appear not , and the men that walk over them know it not .
and one of the lawyers answering saith unto him , teacher , in saying this thou reproachest us also .
woe unto you ! for ye build the tombs of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
so ye are witnesses and consent unto the works of your fathers : for they killed them , and ye build their tombs .
therefore also said the wisdom of god , i will send unto them prophets and apostles ; and some of them they shall kill and persecute ;
that the blood of all the prophets , which was shed from the foundation of the world , may be required of this generation ;
woe unto you lawyers ! for ye took away the key of knowledge : ye entered not in yourselves , and them that were entering in ye hindered .
laying wait for him , to catch something out of his mouth .
but there is nothing covered up , that shall not be revealed ; and hid , that shall not be known .
and i say unto you my friends , be not afraid of them that kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
are not five sparrows sold for two pence ? and not one of them is forgotten in the sight of god .
but the very hairs of your head are all numbered . fear not : ye are of more value than many sparrows .
and i say unto you , every one who shall confess me before men , him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god :
but he that denieth me in the presence of men shall be denied in the presence of the angels of god .
for the holy spirit shall teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say .
and one out of the multitude said unto him , teacher , bid my brother divide the inheritance with me .
but he said unto him , man , who made me a judge or a divider over you ?
and he spake a parable unto them , saying , the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully :
and he reasoned within himself , saying , what shall i do , because i have not where to bestow my fruits ?
so is he that layeth up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward god .
for the life is more than the food , and the body than the raiment .
and which of you by being anxious can add a cubit unto the measure of his life ?
if then ye are not able to do even that which is least , why are ye anxious concerning the rest ?
and seek not ye what ye shall eat , and what ye shall drink , neither be ye of doubtful mind .
for all these things do the nations of the world seek after : but your father knoweth that ye have need of these things .
yet seek ye his kingdom , and these things shall be added unto you .
fear not , little flock ; for it is your father ’ s good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
for where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
let your loins be girded about , and your lamps burning ;
and if he shall come in the second watch , and if in the third , and find them so , blessed are those servants .
be ye also ready : for in an hour that ye think not the son of man cometh .
and peter said , lord , speakest thou this parable unto us , or even unto all ?
blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
of a truth i say unto you , that he will set him over all that he hath .
i came to cast fire upon the earth ; and what do i desire , if it is already kindled ?
but i have a baptism to be baptized with ; and how am i straitened till it be accomplished !
think ye that i am come to give peace in the earth ? i tell you , nay ; but rather division :
for there shall be from henceforth five in one house divided , three against two , and two against three .
and when ye see a south wind blowing , ye say , there will be a scorching heat ; and it cometh to pass .
and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right ?
i say unto thee , thou shalt by no means come out thence , till thou have paid the very last mite .
now there were some present at that very season who told him of the galilaeans , whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices .
and he answered and said unto them , think ye that these galilaeans were sinners above all the galilaeans , because they have suffered these things ?
i tell you , nay : but , except ye repent , ye shall all in like manner perish .
i tell you , nay : but , except ye repent , ye shall all likewise perish .
and he spake this parable ; a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard ; and he came seeking fruit thereon , and found none .
and he answering saith unto him , lord , let it alone this year also , till i shall dig about it , and dung it :
and if it bear fruit thenceforth , well ; but if not , thou shalt cut it down .
and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day .
and behold , a woman that had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years ; and she was bowed together , and could in no wise lift herself up .
and when jesus saw her , he called her , and said to her , woman , thou art loosed from thine infirmity .
and he laid his hands upon her : and immediately she was made straight , and glorified god .
he said therefore , unto what is the kingdom of god like ? and whereunto shall i liken it ?
and again he said , whereunto shall i liken the kingdom of god ?
it is like unto leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal , till it was all leavened .
and he went on his way through cities and villages , teaching , and journeying on unto jerusalem .
and one said unto him , lord , are they few that are saved ? and he said unto them ,
strive to enter in by the narrow door : for many , i say unto you , shall seek to enter in , and shall not be able .
then shall ye begin to say , we did eat and drink in thy presence , and thou didst teach in our streets ;
and he shall say , i tell you , i know not whence ye are ; depart from me , all ye workers of iniquity .
and they shall come from the east and west , and from the north and south , and shall sit down in the kingdom of god .
and behold , there are last who shall be first , and there are first who shall be last .
in that very hour there came certain pharisees , saying to him , get thee out , and go hence : for herod would fain kill thee .
nevertheless i must go on my way to-day and to-morrow and the day following : for it can not be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem .
and behold , there was before him a certain man that had the dropsy .
and jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and pharisees , saying , is it lawful to heal on the sabbath , or not ?
but they held their peace . and he took him , and healed him , and let him go .
and they could not answer again unto these things .
and he spake a parable unto those that were bidden , when he marked how they chose out the chief seats ; saying unto them ,
for every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
but when thou makest a feast , bid the poor , the maimed , the lame , the blind :
and thou shalt be blessed ; because they have not wherewith to recompense thee : for thou shalt be recompensed in the resurrection of the just .
but he said unto him , a certain man made a great supper ; and he bade many :
and he sent forth his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden , come ; for all things are now ready .
and another said , i have bought five yoke of oxen , and i go to prove them ; i pray thee have me excused .
and another said , i have married a wife , and therefore i can not come .
and the servant said , lord , what thou didst command is done , and yet there is room .
and the lord said unto the servant , go out into the highways and hedges , and constrain them to come in , that my house may be filled .
for i say unto you , that none of those men that were bidden shall taste of my supper .
now there went with him great multitudes : and he turned , and said unto them ,
whosoever doth not bear his own cross , and come after me , can not be my disciple .
for which of you , desiring to build a tower , doth not first sit down and count the cost , whether he have wherewith to complete it ?
lest haply , when he hath laid a foundation , and is not able to finish , all that behold begin to mock him ,
saying , this man began to build , and was not able to finish .
or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sendeth an ambassage , and asketh conditions of peace .
so therefore whosoever he be of you that renounceth not all that he hath , he can not be my disciple .
salt therefore is good : but if even the salt have lost its savor , wherewith shall it be seasoned ?
it is fit neither for the land nor for the dunghill : men cast it out . he that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
now all the publicans and sinners were drawing near unto him to hear him .
and both the pharisees and the scribes murmured , saying , this man receiveth sinners , and eateth with them .
and he spake unto them this parable , saying ,
and when he hath found it , he layeth it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
even so , i say unto you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner that repenteth .
and he said , a certain man had two sons :
and when he had spent all , there arose a mighty famine in that country ; and he began to be in want .
and he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country ; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine .
and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat : and no man gave unto him .
i will arise and go to my father , and will say unto him , father , i have sinned against heaven , and in thy sight :
i am no more worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants .
and bring the fatted calf , and kill it , and let us eat , and make merry :
for this my son was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and is found . and they began to be merry .
now his elder son was in the field : and as he came and drew nigh to the house , he heard music and dancing .
and he called to him one of the servants , and inquired what these things might be .
and he said unto him , thy brother is come ; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf , because he hath received him safe and sound .
but he was angry , and would not go in : and his father came out , and entreated him .
but when this thy son came , who hath devoured thy living with harlots , thou killedst for him the fatted calf .
and he said unto him , son , thou art ever with me , and all that is mine is thine .
i am resolved what to do , that , when i am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses .
and calling to him each one of his lord ’ s debtors , he said to the first , how much owest thou unto my lord ?
and he said , a hundred measures of oil . and he said unto him , take thy bond , and sit down quickly and write fifty .
he that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much : and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much .
if therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will commit to your trust the true riches ?
and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another ’ s , who will give you that which is your own ?
and the pharisees , who were lovers of money , heard all these things ; and they scoffed at him .
the law and the prophets were until john : from that time the gospel of the kingdom of god is preached , and every man entereth violently into it .
but it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away , than for one tittle of the law to fall .
every one that putteth away his wife , and marrieth another , committeth adultery : and he that marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery .
now there was a certain rich man , and he was clothed in purple and fine linen , faring sumptuously every day :
and a certain beggar named lazarus was laid at his gate , full of sores ,
and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man ’ s table ; yea , even the dogs came and licked his sores .
and in hades he lifted up his eyes , being in torments , and seeth abraham afar off , and lazarus in his bosom .
and he said , i pray thee therefore , father , that thou wouldest send him to my father ’ s house ;
for i have five brethren ; that he may testify unto them , lest they also come into this place of torment .
but abraham saith , they have moses and the prophets ; let them hear them .
and he said , nay , father abraham : but if one go to them from the dead , they will repent .
and he said unto him , if they hear not moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded , if one rise from the dead .
and he said unto his disciples , it is impossible but that occasions of stumbling should come ; but woe unto him , through whom they come !
take heed to yourselves : if thy brother sin , rebuke him ; and if he repent , forgive him .
and if he sin against thee seven times in the day , and seven times turn again to thee , saying , i repent ; thou shalt forgive him .
and the apostles said unto the lord , increase our faith .
doth he thank the servant because he did the things that were commanded ?
and it came to pass , as they were on the way to jerusalem , that he was passing along the borders of samaria and galilee .
and as he entered into a certain village , there met him ten men that were lepers , who stood afar off :
and they lifted up their voices , saying , jesus , master , have mercy on us .
and one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , with a loud voice glorifying god ;
and he fell upon his face at his feet , giving him thanks : and he was a samaritan .
and jesus answering said , were not the ten cleansed ? but where are the nine ?
were there none found that returned to give glory to god , save this stranger ?
and he said unto him , arise , and go thy way : thy faith hath made thee whole .
and being asked by the pharisees , when the kingdom of god cometh , he answered them and said , the kingdom of god cometh not with observation :
neither shall they say , lo , here ! or , there ! for lo , the kingdom of god is within you .
and they shall say to you , lo , there ! lo , here ! go not away , nor follow after them :
but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation .
and as it came to pass in the days of noah , even so shall it be also in the days of the son of man .
but in the day that lot went out from sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and destroyed them all :
after the same manner shall it be in the day that the son of man is revealed .
remember lot ’ s wife .
whosoever shall seek to gain his life shall lose it : but whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it .
i say unto you , in that night there shall be two men on one bed ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left .
there shall be two women grinding together ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left .
and he spake a parable unto them to the end that they ought always to pray , and not to faint ;
saying , there was in a city a judge , who feared not god , and regarded not man :
and there was a widow in that city ; and she came oft unto him , saying , avenge me of mine adversary .
and he would not for a while : but afterward he said within himself , though i fear not god , nor regard man ;
yet because this widow troubleth me , i will avenge her , lest she wear me out by her continual coming .
and the lord said , hear what the unrighteous judge saith .
and shall not god avenge his elect , that cry to him day and night , and yet he is longsuffering over them ?
i say unto you , that he will avenge them speedily . nevertheless , when the son of man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ?
and he spake also this parable unto certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and set all others at nought :
two men went up into the temple to pray ; the one a pharisee , and the other a publican .
i fast twice in the week ; i give tithes of all that i get .
and they were bringing unto him also their babes , that he should touch them : but when the disciples saw it , they rebuked them .
verily i say unto you , whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child , he shall in no wise enter therein .
and a certain ruler asked him , saying , good teacher , what shall i do to inherit eternal life ?
and jesus said unto him , why callest thou me good ? none is good , save one , even god .
thou knowest the commandments , do not commit adultery , do not kill , do not steal , do not bear false witness , honor thy father and mother .
and he said , all these things have i observed from my youth up .
but when he heard these things , he became exceeding sorrowful ; for he was very rich .
and jesus seeing him said , how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god !
for it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle ’ s eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god .
and they that heard it said , then who can be saved ?
but he said , the things which are impossible with men are possible with god .
and peter said , lo , we have left our own , and followed thee .
who shall not receive manifold more in this time , and in the world to come eternal life .
for he shall be delivered up unto the gentiles , and shall be mocked , and shamefully treated , and spit upon :
and they shall scourge and kill him : and the third day he shall rise again .
and they understood none of these things ; and this saying was hid from them , and they perceived not the things that were said .
and it came to pass , as he drew nigh unto jericho , a certain blind man sat by the way side begging :
and hearing a multitude going by , he inquired what this meant .
and they told him , that jesus of nazareth passeth by .
and he cried , saying , jesus , thou son of david , have mercy on me .
and jesus stood , and commanded him to be brought unto him : and when he was come near , he asked him ,
what wilt thou that i should do unto thee ? and he said , lord , that i may receive my sight .
and jesus said unto him , receive thy sight : thy faith hath made thee whole .
and immediately he received his sight , and followed him , glorifying god : and all the people , when they saw it , gave praise unto god .
and he entered and was passing through jericho .
and behold , a man called by name zacchaeus ; and he was a chief publican , and he was rich .
and he sought to see jesus who he was ; and could not for the crowd , because he was little of stature .
and he ran on before , and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him : for he was to pass that way .
and he made haste , and came down , and received him joyfully .
and when they saw it , they all murmured , saying , he is gone in to lodge with a man that is a sinner .
and jesus said unto him , to-day is salvation come to this house , forasmuch as he also is a son of abraham .
for the son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost .
he said therefore , a certain nobleman went into a far country , to receive for himself a kingdom , and to return .
and he called ten servants of his , and gave them ten pounds , and said unto them , trade ye herewith till i come .
but his citizens hated him , and sent an ambassage after him , saying , we will not that this man reign over us .
and the first came before him , saying , lord , thy pound hath made ten pounds more .
and he said unto him , well done , thou good servant : because thou wast found faithful in a very little , have thou authority over ten cities .
and the second came , saying , thy pound , lord , hath made five pounds .
and he said unto him also , be thou also over five cities .
and another came , saying , lord , behold , here is thy pound , which i kept laid up in a napkin :
then wherefore gavest thou not my money into the bank , and i at my coming should have required it with interest ?
and he said unto them that stood by , take away from him the pound , and give it unto him that hath the ten pounds .
and they said unto him , lord , he hath ten pounds .
but these mine enemies , that would not that i should reign over them , bring hither , and slay them before me .
and when he had thus spoken , he went on before , going up to jerusalem .
and it came to pass , when he drew nigh unto bethphage and bethany , at the mount that is called olivet , he sent two of the disciples ,
and if any one ask you , why do ye loose him ? thus shall ye say , the lord hath need of him .
and they that were sent went away , and found even as he had said unto them .
and as they were loosing the colt , the owners thereof said unto them , why loose ye the colt ?
and they said , the lord hath need of him .
and they brought him to jesus : and they threw their garments upon the colt , and set jesus thereon .
and as he went , they spread their garments in the way .
saying , blessed is the king that cometh in the name of the lord : peace in heaven , and glory in the highest .
and some of the pharisees from the multitude said unto him , teacher , rebuke thy disciples .
and he answered and said , i tell you that , if these shall hold their peace , the stones will cry out .
and when he drew nigh , he saw the city and wept over it ,
saying , if thou hadst known in this day , even thou , the things which belong unto peace ! but now they are hid from thine eyes .
and he entered into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold ,
saying unto them , it is written , and my house shall be a house of prayer : but ye have made it a den of robbers .
and he was teaching daily in the temple . but the chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him :
and they could not find what they might do ; for the people all hung upon him , listening .
and they spake , saying unto him , tell us : by what authority doest thou these things ? or who is he that gave thee this authority ?
and he answered and said unto them , i also will ask you a question ; and tell me :
the baptism of john , was it from heaven , or from men ?
and they reasoned with themselves , saying , if we shall say , from heaven ; he will say , why did ye not believe him ?
but if we shall say , from men ; all the people will stone us : for they are persuaded that john was a prophet .
and they answered , that they knew not whence it was .
and jesus said unto them , neither tell i you by what authority i do these things .
and he sent yet another servant : and him also they beat , and handled him shamefully , and sent him away empty .
and he sent yet a third : and him also they wounded , and cast him forth .
and the lord of the vineyard said , what shall i do ? i will send my beloved son ; it may be they will reverence him .
and they cast him forth out of the vineyard , and killed him . what therefore will the lord of the vineyard do unto them ?
he will come and destroy these husbandmen , and will give the vineyard unto others . and when they heard it , they said , god forbid .
but he looked upon them , and said , what then is this that is written ,
every one that falleth on that stone shall be broken to pieces ; but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will scatter him as dust .
is it lawful for us to give tribute unto caesar , or not ?
but he perceived their craftiness , and said unto them ,
show me a denarius . whose image and superscription hath it ? and they said , caesar ’ s .
and he said unto them , then render unto caesar the things that are caesar ’ s , and unto god the things that are god ’ s .
and they were not able to take hold of the saying before the people : and they marvelled at his answer , and held their peace .
and there came to him certain of the sadducees , they that say that there is no resurrection ;
there were therefore seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and died childless ;
and the third took her ; and likewise the seven also left no children , and died .
afterward the woman also died .
in the resurrection therefore whose wife of them shall she be ? for the seven had her to wife .
and jesus said unto them , the sons of this world marry , and are given in marriage :
but they that are accounted worthy to attain to that world , and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage :
for neither can they die any more : for they are equal unto the angels ; and are sons of god , being sons of the resurrection .
now he is not the god of the dead , but of the living : for all live unto him .
and certain of the scribes answering said , teacher , thou hast well said .
for they durst not any more ask him any question .
and he said unto them , how say they that the christ is david ’ s son ?
for david himself saith in the book of psalms ,
till i make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet .
david therefore calleth him lord , and how is he his son ?
and in the hearing of all the people he said unto his disciples ,
who devour widows ’ houses , and for a pretence make long prayers : these shall receive greater condemnation .
and he looked up , and saw the rich men that were casting their gifts into the treasury .
and he saw a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites .
and he said , of a truth i say unto you , this poor widow cast in more than they all :
for all these did of their superfluity cast in unto the gifts ; but she of her want did cast in all the living that she had .
and as some spake of the temple , how it was adorned with goodly stones and offerings , he said ,
then said he unto them , nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ;
and there shall be great earthquakes , and in divers places famines and pestilences ; and there shall be terrors and great signs from heaven .
it shall turn out unto you for a testimony .
settle it therefore in your hearts , not to meditate beforehand how to answer :
for i will give you a mouth and wisdom , which all your adversaries shall not be able to withstand or to gainsay .
and ye shall be hated of all men for my name ’ s sake .
and not a hair of your head shall perish .
in your patience ye shall win your souls .
but when ye see jerusalem compassed with armies , then know that her desolation is at hand .
for these are days of vengeance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled .
men fainting for fear , and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world : for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken .
and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
but when these things begin to come to pass , look up , and lift up your heads ; because your redemption draweth nigh .
and he spake to them a parable : behold the fig tree , and all the trees :
when they now shoot forth , ye see it and know of your own selves that the summer is now nigh .
even so ye also , when ye see these things coming to pass , know ye that the kingdom of god is nigh .
verily i say unto you , this generation shall not pass away , till all things be accomplished .
heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away .
for so shall it come upon all them that dwell on the face of all the earth .
and every day he was teaching in the temple ; and every night he went out , and lodged in the mount that is called olivet .
and all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple , to hear him .
now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh , which is called the passover .
and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death ; for they feared the people .
and satan entered into judas who was called iscariot , being of the number of the twelve .
and he went away , and communed with the chief priests and captains , how he might deliver him unto them .
and they were glad , and covenanted to give him money .
and he consented , and sought opportunity to deliver him unto them in the absence of the multitude .
and the day of unleavened bread came , on which the passover must be sacrificed .
and he sent peter and john , saying , go and make ready for us the passover , that we may eat .
and they said unto him , where wilt thou that we make ready ?
and he will show you a large upper room furnished : there make ready .
and they went , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
and when the hour was come , he sat down , and the apostles with him .
and he said unto them , with desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer :
for i say unto you , i shall not eat it , until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of god .
and he received a cup , and when he had given thanks , he said , take this , and divide it among yourselves :
for i say unto you , i shall not drink from henceforth of the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of god shall come .
and the cup in like manner after supper , saying , this cup is the new covenant in my blood , even that which is poured out for you .
but behold , the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table .
for the son of man indeed goeth , as it hath been determined : but woe unto that man through whom he is betrayed !
and they began to question among themselves , which of them it was that should do this thing .
and there arose also a contention among them , which of them was accounted to be greatest .
and he said unto them , the kings of the gentiles have lordship over them ; and they that have authority over them are called benefactors .
but ye are they that have continued with me in my temptations ;
and i appoint unto you a kingdom , even as my father appointed unto me ,
that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom ; and ye shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel .
simon , simon , behold , satan asked to have you , that he might sift you as wheat :
but i made supplication for thee , that thy faith fail not ; and do thou , when once thou hast turned again , establish thy brethren .
and he said unto him , lord , with thee i am ready to go both to prison and to death .
and he said , i tell thee , peter , the cock shall not crow this day , until thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me .
and he said unto them , when i sent you forth without purse , and wallet , and shoes , lacked ye anything ? and they said , nothing .
and they said , lord , behold , here are two swords . and he said unto them , it is enough .
and he came out , and went , as his custom was , unto the mount of olives ; and the disciples also followed him .
and when he was at the place , he said unto them , pray that ye enter not into temptation .
and he was parted from them about a stone ’ s cast ; and he kneeled down and prayed ,
saying , father , if thou be willing , remove this cup from me : nevertheless not my will , but thine , be done .
and there appeared unto him an angel from heaven , strengthening him .
and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly ; and his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground .
and when he rose up from his prayer , he came unto the disciples , and found them sleeping for sorrow ,
and said unto them , why sleep ye ? rise and pray , that ye enter not into temptation .
but jesus said unto him , judas , betrayest thou the son of man with a kiss ?
and when they that were about him saw what would follow , they said , lord , shall we smite with the sword ?
and a certain one of them smote the servant of the high priest , and struck off his right ear .
but jesus answered and said , suffer ye them thus far . and he touched his ear , and healed him .
and they seized him , and led him away , and brought him into the high priest ’ s house . but peter followed afar off .
and when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court , and had sat down together , peter sat in the midst of them .
but he denied , saying , woman , i know him not .
and after a little while another saw him , and said , thou also art one of them . but peter said , man , i am not .
and after the space of about one hour another confidently affirmed , saying , of a truth this man also was with him ; for he is a galilaean .
but peter said , man , i know not what thou sayest . and immediately , while he yet spake , the cock crew .
and he went out , and wept bitterly .
and the men that held jesus mocked him , and beat him .
and they blindfolded him , and asked him , saying , prophesy : who is he that struck thee ?
and many other things spake they against him , reviling him .
if thou art the christ , tell us . but he said unto them , if i tell you , ye will not believe :
and if i ask you , ye will not answer .
but from henceforth shall the son of man be seated at the right hand of the power of god .
and they all said , art thou then the son of god ? and he said unto them , ye say that i am .
and they said , what further need have we of witness ? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth .
and the whole company of them rose up , and brought him before pilate .
and pilate asked him , saying , art thou the king of the jews ? and he answered him and said , thou sayest .
and pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes , i find no fault in this man .
but they were the more urgent , saying , he stirreth up the people , teaching throughout all judaea , and beginning from galilee even unto this place .
but when pilate heard it , he asked whether the man were a galilaean .
and when he knew that he was of herod ’ s jurisdiction , he sent him unto herod , who himself also was at jerusalem in these days .
and he questioned him in many words ; but he answered him nothing .
and the chief priests and the scribes stood , vehemently accusing him .
and herod with his soldiers set him at nought , and mocked him , and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to pilate .
and herod and pilate became friends with each other that very day : for before they were at enmity between themselves .
and pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people ,
no , nor yet herod : for he sent him back unto us ; and behold , nothing worthy of death hath been done by him .
i will therefore chastise him , and release him .
but they cried out all together , saying , away with this man , and release unto us barabbas : —
one who for a certain insurrection made in the city , and for murder , was cast into prison .
and pilate spake unto them again , desiring to release jesus ;
but they shouted , saying , crucify , crucify him .
but they were urgent with loud voices , asking that he might be crucified . and their voices prevailed .
and pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done .
and he released him that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison , whom they asked for ; but jesus he delivered up to their will .
and there followed him a great multitude of the people , and of women who bewailed and lamented him .
but jesus turning unto them said , daughters of jerusalem , weep not for me , but weep for yourselves , and for your children .
then shall they begin to say to the mountains , fall on us ; and to the hills , cover us .
for if they do these things in the green tree , what shall be done in the dry ?
and there were also two others , malefactors , led with him to be put to death .
and jesus said , father , forgive them ; for they know not what they do . and parting his garments among them , they cast lots .
and the soldiers also mocked him , coming to him , offering him vinegar ,
and saying , if thou art the king of the jews , save thyself .
and there was also a superscription over him , this is the king of the jews .
and one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him , saying , art not thou the christ ? save thyself and us .
but the other answered , and rebuking him said , dost thou not even fear god , seeing thou art in the same condemnation ?
and we indeed justly ; for we receive the due reward of our deeds : but this man hath done nothing amiss .
and he said , jesus , remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom .
and he said unto him , verily i say unto thee , to-day shalt thou be with me in paradise .
and it was now about the sixth hour , and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour ,
the sun ’ s light failing : and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst .
and when the centurion saw what was done , he glorified god , saying , certainly this was a righteous man .
and all the multitudes that came together to this sight , when they beheld the things that were done , returned smiting their breasts .
and all his acquaintance , and the women that followed with him from galilee , stood afar off , seeing these things .
and behold , a man named joseph , who was a councillor , a good and righteous man
this man went to pilate , and asked for the body of jesus .
and it was the day of the preparation , and the sabbath drew on .
and the women , who had come with him out of galilee , followed after , and beheld the tomb , and how his body was laid .
and they returned , and prepared spices and ointments .
but on the first day of the week , at early dawn , they came unto the tomb , bringing the spices which they had prepared .
and they found the stone rolled away from the tomb .
and they entered in , and found not the body of the lord jesus .
and it came to pass , while they were perplexed thereabout , behold , two men stood by them in dazzling apparel :
and as they were affrighted and bowed down their faces to the earth , they said unto them , why seek ye the living among the dead ?
he is not here , but is risen : remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in galilee ,
saying that the son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again .
and they remembered his words ,
and returned from the tomb , and told all these things to the eleven , and to all the rest .
now they were mary magdalene , and joanna , and mary the mother of james : and the other women with them told these things unto the apostles .
and these words appeared in their sight as idle talk ; and they disbelieved them .
and behold , two of them were going that very day to a village named emmaus , which was threescore furlongs from jerusalem .
and they communed with each other of all these things which had happened .
and it came to pass , while they communed and questioned together , that jesus himself drew near , and went with them .
but their eyes were holden that they should not know him .
and he said unto them , what communications are these that ye have one with another , as ye walk ? and they stood still , looking sad .
and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death , and crucified him .
moreover certain women of our company amazed us , having been early at the tomb ;
and when they found not his body , they came , saying , that they had also seen a vision of angels , who said that he was alive .
and certain of them that were with us went to the tomb , and found it even so as the women had said : but him they saw not .
and he said unto them , o foolish men , and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken !
behooved it not the christ to suffer these things , and to enter into his glory ?
and beginning from moses and from all the prophets , he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself .
and they drew nigh unto the village , whither they were going : and he made as though he would go further .
and their eyes were opened , and they knew him ; and he vanished out of their sight .
and they rose up that very hour , and returned to jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and them that were with them ,
saying , the lord is risen indeed , and hath appeared to simon .
and they rehearsed the things that happened in the way , and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread .
and as they spake these things , he himself stood in the midst of them , and saith unto them , peace be unto you .
but they were terrified and affrighted , and supposed that they beheld a spirit .
and he said unto them , why are ye troubled ? and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart ?
and when he had said this , he showed them his hands and his feet .
and while they still disbelieved for joy , and wondered , he said unto them , have ye here anything to eat ?
and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish .
and he took it , and ate before them .
then opened he their mind , that they might understand the scriptures ;
and he said unto them , thus it is written , that the christ should suffer , and rise again from the dead the third day ;
and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations , beginning from jerusalem .
ye are witnesses of these things .
and he led them out until they were over against bethany : and he lifted up his hands , and blessed them .
and it came to pass , while he blessed them , he parted from them , and was carried up into heaven .
and they worshipped him , and returned to jerusalem with great joy :
and were continually in the temple , blessing god .
the burden of the word of jehovah to israel by malachi .
but esau i hated , and made his mountains a desolation , and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness .
and your eyes shall see , and ye shall say , jehovah be magnified beyond the border of israel .
ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar . and ye say , wherein have we polluted thee ? in that ye say , the table of jehovah is contemptible .
but ye profane it , in that ye say , the table of jehovah is polluted , and the fruit thereof , even its food , is contemptible .
and now , o ye priests , this commandment is for you .
and ye shall know that i have sent this commandment unto you , that my covenant may be with levi , saith jehovah of hosts .
for the priest ’ s lips should keep knowledge , and they should seek the law at his mouth ; for he is the messenger of jehovah of hosts .
then shall the offering of judah and jerusalem be pleasant unto jehovah , as in the days of old , and as in ancient years .
for i , jehovah , change not ; therefore ye , o sons of jacob , are not consumed .
will a man rob god ? yet ye rob me . but ye say , wherein have we robbed thee ? in tithes and offerings .
ye are cursed with the curse ; for ye rob me , even this whole nation .
and all nations shall call you happy ; for ye shall be a delightsome land , saith jehovah of hosts .
your words have been stout against me , saith jehovah . yet ye say , what have we spoken against thee ?
and now we call the proud happy ; yea , they that work wickedness are built up ; yea , they tempt god , and escape .
then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked , between him that serveth god and him that serveth him not .
remember ye the law of moses my servant , which i commanded unto him in horeb for all israel , even statutes and ordinances .
behold , i will send you elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of jehovah come .
the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ , the son of god .
even as it is written in isaiah the prophet ,
the voice of one crying in the wilderness ,
john came , who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins .
and john was clothed with camel ’ s hair , and had a leathern girdle about his loins , and did eat locusts and wild honey .
i baptized you in water ; but he shall baptize you in the holy spirit .
and it came to pass in those days , that jesus came from nazareth of galilee , and was baptized of john in the jordan .
and straightway coming up out of the water , he saw the heavens rent asunder , and the spirit as a dove descending upon him :
and a voice came out of the heavens , thou art my beloved son , in thee i am well pleased .
and straightway the spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness .
and he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of satan ; and he was with the wild beasts ; and the angels ministered unto him .
now after john was delivered up , jesus came into galilee , preaching the gospel of god ,
and saying , the time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of god is at hand : repent ye , and believe in the gospel .
and passing along by the sea of galilee , he saw simon and andrew the brother of simon casting a net in the sea ; for they were fishers .
and jesus said unto them , come ye after me , and i will make you to become fishers of men .
and straightway they left the nets , and followed him .
and going on a little further , he saw james the son of zebedee , and john his brother , who also were in the boat mending the nets .
and straightway he called them : and they left their father zebedee in the boat with the hired servants , and went after him .
and they go into capernaum ; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught .
and they were astonished at his teaching : for he taught them as having authority , and not as the scribes .
and straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out ,
and jesus rebuked him , saying , hold thy peace , and come out of him .
and the unclean spirit , tearing him and crying with a loud voice , came out of him .
and the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of galilee round about .
and straightway , when they were come out of the synagogue , they came into the house of simon and andrew , with james and john .
now simon ’ s wife ’ s mother lay sick of a fever ; and straightway they tell him of her :
and he came and took her by the hand , and raised her up ; and the fever left her , and she ministered unto them .
and at even , when the sun did set , they brought unto him all that were sick , and them that were possessed with demons .
and all the city was gathered together at the door .
and in the morning , a great while before day , he rose up and went out , and departed into a desert place , and there prayed .
and simon and they that were with him followed after him ;
and they found him , and say unto him , all are seeking thee .
and he saith unto them , let us go elsewhere into the next towns , that i may preach there also ; for to this end came i forth .
and he went into their synagogues throughout all galilee , preaching and casting out demons .
and being moved with compassion , he stretched forth his hand , and touched him , and saith unto him , i will ; be thou made clean .
and straightway the leprosy departed from him , and he was made clean .
and he strictly charged him , and straightway sent him out ,
and when he entered again into capernaum after some days , it was noised that he was in the house .
and they come , bringing unto him a man sick of the palsy , borne of four .
and jesus seeing their faith saith unto the sick of the palsy , son , thy sins are forgiven .
but there were certain of the scribes sitting there , and reasoning in their hearts ,
why doth this man thus speak ? he blasphemeth : who can forgive sins but one , even god ?
and straightway jesus , perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves , saith unto them , why reason ye these things in your hearts ?
but that ye may know that the son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins ( he saith to the sick of the palsy ) ,
i say unto thee , arise , take up thy bed , and go unto thy house .
and he went forth again by the sea side ; and all the multitude resorted unto him , and he taught them .
but the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then will they fast in that day .
and the pharisees said unto him , behold , why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful ?
and he said unto them , the sabbath was made for man , and not man for the sabbath :
so that the son of man is lord even of the sabbath .
and he entered again into the synagogue ; and there was a man there who had his hand withered .
and they watched him , whether he would heal him on the sabbath day ; that they might accuse him .
and he saith unto the man that had his hand withered , stand forth .
and the pharisees went out , and straightway with the herodians took counsel against him , how they might destroy him .
and jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea : and a great multitude from galilee followed ; and from judaea ,
and he spake to his disciples , that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd , lest they should throng him :
for he had healed many ; insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed upon him that they might touch him .
and the unclean spirits , whensoever they beheld him , fell down before him , and cried , saying , thou art the son of god .
and he charged them much that they should not make him known .
and he goeth up into the mountain , and calleth unto him whom he himself would ; and they went unto him .
and he appointed twelve , that they might be with him , and that he might send them forth to preach ,
and to have authority to cast out demons :
and simon he surnamed peter ;
and james the son of zebedee , and john the brother of james ; and them he surnamed boanerges , which is , sons of thunder :
and andrew , and philip , and bartholomew , and matthew , and thomas , and james the son of alphaeus , and thaddaeus , and simon the cananaean ,
and judas iscariot , who also betrayed him .
and the multitude cometh together again , so that they could not so much as eat bread .
and when his friends heard it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , he is beside himself .
and the scribes that came down from jerusalem said , he hath beelzebub , and , by the prince of the demons casteth he out the demons .
and he called them unto him , and said unto them in parables , how can satan cast out satan ?
and if a kingdom be divided against itself , that kingdom can not stand .
and if a house be divided against itself , that house will not be able to stand .
and if satan hath risen up against himself , and is divided , he can not stand , but hath an end .
verily i say unto you , all their sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men , and their blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme :
but whosoever shall blaspheme against the holy spirit hath never forgiveness , but is guilty of an eternal sin :
because they said , he hath an unclean spirit .
and there come his mother and his brethren ; and , standing without , they sent unto him , calling him .
and a multitude was sitting about him ; and they say unto him , behold , thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee .
and he answereth them , and saith , who is my mother and my brethren ?
and looking round on them that sat round about him , he saith , behold , my mother and my brethren !
for whosoever shall do the will of god , the same is my brother , and sister , and mother .
and he taught them many things in parables , and said unto them in his teaching ,
hearken : behold , the sower went forth to sow :
and it came to pass , as he sowed , some seed fell by the way side , and the birds came and devoured it .
and other fell on the rocky ground , where it had not much earth ; and straightway it sprang up , because it had no deepness of earth :
and when the sun was risen , it was scorched ; and because it had no root , it withered away .
and other fell among the thorns , and the thorns grew up , and choked it , and it yielded no fruit .
and others fell into the good ground , and yielded fruit , growing up and increasing ; and brought forth , thirtyfold , and sixtyfold , and a hundredfold .
and he said , who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
and when he was alone , they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables .
and he saith unto them , know ye not this parable ? and how shall ye know all the parables ?
the sower soweth the word .
and these in like manner are they that are sown upon the rocky places , who , when they have heard the word , straightway receive it with joy ;
and they have no root in themselves , but endure for a while ; then , when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word , straightway they stumble .
and others are they that are sown among the thorns ; these are they that have heard the word ,
for there is nothing hid , save that it should be manifested ; neither was anything made secret , but that it should come to light .
if any man hath ears to hear , let him hear .
for he that hath , to him shall be given : and he that hath not , from him shall be taken away even that which he hath .
and he said , so is the kingdom of god , as if a man should cast seed upon the earth ;
and should sleep and rise night and day , and the seed should spring up and grow , he knoweth not how .
the earth beareth fruit of herself ; first the blade , then the ear , then the full grain in the ear .
but when the fruit is ripe , straightway he putteth forth the sickle , because the harvest is come .
and he said , how shall we liken the kingdom of god ? or in what parable shall we set it forth ?
and with many such parables spake he the word unto them , as they were able to hear it ;
and without a parable spake he not unto them : but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things .
and on that day , when even was come , he saith unto them , let us go over unto the other side .
and leaving the multitude , they take him with them , even as he was , in the boat . and other boats were with him .
and there ariseth a great storm of wind , and the waves beat into the boat , insomuch that the boat was now filling .
and he said unto them , why are ye fearful ? have ye not yet faith ?
and they feared exceedingly , and said one to another , who then is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ?
and they came to the other side of the sea , into the country of the gerasenes .
and when he was come out of the boat , straightway there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit ,
who had his dwelling in the tombs : and no man could any more bind him , no , not with a chain ;
and always , night and day , in the tombs and in the mountains , he was crying out , and cutting himself with stones .
and when he saw jesus from afar , he ran and worshipped him ;
for he said unto him , come forth , thou unclean spirit , out of the man .
and he asked him , what is thy name ? and he saith unto him , my name is legion ; for we are many .
and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country .
now there was there on the mountain side a great herd of swine feeding .
and they besought him , saying , send us into the swine , that we may enter into them .
and they that saw it declared unto them how it befell him that was possessed with demons , and concerning the swine .
and they began to beseech him to depart from their borders .
and as he was entering into the boat , he that had been possessed with demons besought him that he might be with him .
and he went his way , and began to publish in decapolis how great things jesus had done for him : and all men marvelled .
and when jesus had crossed over again in the boat unto the other side , a great multitude was gathered unto him ; and he was by the sea .
and there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue , jairus by name ; and seeing him , he falleth at his feet ,
and he went with him ; and a great multitude followed him , and they thronged him .
and a woman , who had an issue of blood twelve years ,
and had suffered many things of many physicians , and had spent all that she had , and was nothing bettered , but rather grew worse ,
having heard the things concerning jesus , came in the crowd behind , and touched his garment .
for she said , if i touch but his garments , i shall be made whole .
and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up ; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague .
and his disciples said unto him , thou seest the multitude thronging thee , and sayest thou , who touched me ?
and he looked round about to see her that had done this thing .
but the woman fearing and trembling , knowing what had been done to her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth .
and he said unto her , daughter , thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace , and be whole of thy plague .
but jesus , not heeding the word spoken , saith unto the ruler of the synagogue , fear not , only believe .
and he suffered no man to follow with him , save peter , and james , and john the brother of james .
and they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue ; and he beholdeth a tumult , and many weeping and wailing greatly .
and when he was entered in , he saith unto them , why make ye a tumult , and weep ? the child is not dead , but sleepeth .
and straightway the damsel rose up , and walked ; for she was twelve years old . and they were amazed straightway with a great amazement .
and he charged them much that no man should know this : and he commanded that something should be given her to eat .
and he went out from thence ; and he cometh into his own country ; and his disciples follow him .
and he could there do no mighty work , save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk , and healed them .
and he marvelled because of their unbelief .
and he calleth unto him the twelve , and began to send them forth by two and two ; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits ;
and he charged them that they should take nothing for their journey , save a staff only ; no bread , no wallet , no money in their purse ;
but to go shod with sandals : and , said he , put not on two coats .
and he said unto them , wheresoever ye enter into a house , there abide till ye depart thence .
and they went out , and preached that men should repent .
and they cast out many demons , and anointed with oil many that were sick , and healed them .
but others said , it is elijah . and others said , it is a prophet , even as one of the prophets .
but herod , when he heard thereof , said , john , whom i beheaded , he is risen .
for john said unto herod , it is not lawful for thee to have thy brother ’ s wife .
and herodias set herself against him , and desired to kill him ; and she could not ;
and he sware unto her , whatsoever thou shalt ask of me , i will give it thee , unto the half of my kingdom .
and she went out , and said unto her mother , what shall i ask ? and she said , the head of john the baptizer .
and the king was exceeding sorry ; but for the sake of his oaths , and of them that sat at meat , he would not reject her .
and straightway the king sent forth a soldier of his guard , and commanded to bring his head : and he went and beheaded him in the prison ,
and brought his head on a platter , and gave it to the damsel ; and the damsel gave it to her mother .
and when his disciples heard thereof , they came and took up his corpse , and laid it in a tomb .
and the apostles gather themselves together unto jesus ; and they told him all things , whatsoever they had done , and whatsoever they had taught .
and they went away in the boat to a desert place apart .
and the people saw them going , and many knew them , and they ran together there on foot from all the cities , and outwent them .
send them away , that they may go into the country and villages round about , and buy themselves somewhat to eat .
and he saith unto them , how many loaves have ye ? go and see . and when they knew , they say , five , and two fishes .
and he commanded them that all should sit down by companies upon the green grass .
and they sat down in ranks , by hundreds , and by fifties .
and they all ate , and were filled .
and they took up broken pieces , twelve basketfuls , and also of the fishes .
and they that ate the loaves were five thousand men .
and after he had taken leave of them , he departed into the mountain to pray .
and when even was come , the boat was in the midst of the sea , and he alone on the land .
but they , when they saw him walking on the sea , supposed that it was a ghost , and cried out ;
and he went up unto them into the boat ; and the wind ceased : and they were sore amazed in themselves ;
for they understood not concerning the loaves , but their heart was hardened .
and when they had crossed over , they came to the land unto gennesaret , and moored to the shore .
and when they were come out of the boat , straightway the people knew him ,
and ran round about that whole region , and began to carry about on their beds those that were sick , where they heard he was .
and there are gathered together unto him the pharisees , and certain of the scribes , who had come from jerusalem ,
and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with defiled , that is , unwashen , hands .
( for the pharisees , and all the jews , except they wash their hands diligently , eat not , holding the tradition of the elders ;
and the pharisees and the scribes ask him , why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders , but eat their bread with defiled hands ?
and he said unto them , well did isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites , as it is written ,
but in vain do they worship me ,
ye leave the commandment of god , and hold fast the tradition of men .
and he said unto them , full well do ye reject the commandment of god , that ye may keep your tradition .
for moses said , honor thy father and thy mother ; and , he that speaketh evil of father or mother , let him die the death :
ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father or his mother ;
making void the word of god by your tradition , which ye have delivered : and many such like things ye do .
and he called to him the multitude again , and said unto them , hear me all of you , and understand :
and when he was entered into the house from the multitude , his disciples asked of him the parable .
because it goeth not into his heart , but into his belly , and goeth out into the draught ? this he said , making all meats clean .
and he said , that which proceedeth out of the man , that defileth the man .
for from within , out of the heart of men , evil thoughts proceed , fornications , thefts , murders , adulteries ,
covetings , wickednesses , deceit , lasciviousness , an evil eye , railing , pride , foolishness :
all these evil things proceed from within , and defile the man .
but straightway a woman , whose little daughter had an unclean spirit , having heard of him , came and fell down at his feet .
now the woman was a greek , a syrophoenician by race . and she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter .
but she answered and saith unto him , yea , lord ; even the dogs under the table eat of the children ’ s crumbs .
and he said unto her , for this saying go thy way ; the demon is gone out of thy daughter .
and she went away unto her house , and found the child laid upon the bed , and the demon gone out .
and again he went out from the borders of tyre , and came through sidon unto the sea of galilee , through the midst of the borders of decapolis .
and they bring unto him one that was deaf , and had an impediment in his speech ; and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him .
and he took him aside from the multitude privately , and put his fingers into his ears , and he spat , and touched his tongue ;
and looking up to heaven , he sighed , and saith unto him , ephphatha , that is , be opened .
and his ears were opened , and the bond of his tongue was loosed , and he spake plain .
and he charged them that they should tell no man : but the more he charged them , so much the more a great deal they published it .
and they were beyond measure astonished , saying , he hath done all things well ; he maketh even the deaf to hear , and the dumb to speak .
i have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days , and have nothing to eat :
and if i send them away fasting to their home , they will faint on the way ; and some of them are come from far .
and his disciples answered him , whence shall one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place ?
and he asked them , how many loaves have ye ? and they said , seven .
and they had a few small fishes : and having blessed them , he commanded to set these also before them .
and they ate , and were filled : and they took up , of broken pieces that remained over , seven baskets .
and they were about four thousand : and he sent them away .
and straightway he entered into the boat with his disciples , and came into the parts of dalmanutha .
and the pharisees came forth , and began to question with him , seeking of him a sign from heaven , trying him .
and he left them , and again entering into the boat departed to the other side .
and they forgot to take bread ; and they had not in the boat with them more than one loaf .
and he charged them , saying , take heed , beware of the leaven of the pharisees and the leaven of herod .
and they reasoned one with another , saying , we have no bread .
having eyes , see ye not ? and having ears , hear ye not ? and do ye not remember ?
when i brake the five loaves among the five thousand , how many baskets full of broken pieces took ye up ? they say unto him , twelve .
and when the seven among the four thousand , how many basketfuls of broken pieces took ye up ? and they say unto him , seven .
and he said unto them , do ye not yet understand ?
and they come unto bethsaida . and they bring to him a blind man , and beseech him to touch him .
and he looked up , and said , i see men ; for i behold them as trees , walking .
then again he laid his hands upon his eyes ; and he looked stedfastly , and was restored , and saw all things clearly .
and he sent him away to his home , saying , do not even enter into the village .
and they told him , saying , john the baptist ; and others , elijah ; but others , one of the prophets .
and he asked them , but who say ye that i am ? peter answereth and saith unto him , thou art the christ .
and he charged them that they should tell no man of him .
and he spake the saying openly . and peter took him , and began to rebuke him .
for whosoever would save his life shall lose it ; and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel ’ s shall save it .
for what doth it profit a man , to gain the whole world , and forfeit his life ?
for what should a man give in exchange for his life ?
and his garments became glistering , exceeding white , so as no fuller on earth can whiten them .
and there appeared unto them elijah with moses : and they were talking with jesus .
for he knew not what to answer ; for they became sore afraid .
and there came a cloud overshadowing them : and there came a voice out of the cloud , this is my beloved son : hear ye him .
and suddenly looking round about , they saw no one any more , save jesus only with themselves .
and they kept the saying , questioning among themselves what the rising again from the dead should mean .
and they asked him , saying , how is it that the scribes say that elijah must first come ?
but i say unto you , that elijah is come , and they have also done unto him whatsoever they would , even as it is written of him .
and when they came to the disciples , they saw a great multitude about them , and scribes questioning with them .
and straightway all the multitude , when they saw him , were greatly amazed , and running to him saluted him .
and he asked them , what question ye with them ?
and one of the multitude answered him , teacher , i brought unto thee my son , who hath a dumb spirit ;
and he asked his father , how long time is it since this hath come unto him ? and he said , from a child .
and jesus said unto him , if thou canst ! all things are possible to him that believeth .
straightway the father of the child cried out , and said , i believe ; help thou mine unbelief .
but jesus took him by the hand , and raised him up ; and he arose .
and when he was come into the house , his disciples asked him privately , how is it that we could not cast it out ?
and he said unto them , this kind can come out by nothing , save by prayer .
and they went forth from thence , and passed through galilee ; and he would not that any man should know it .
but they understood not the saying , and were afraid to ask him .
and they came to capernaum : and when he was in the house he asked them , what were ye reasoning on the way ?
but they held their peace : for they had disputed one with another on the way , who was the greatest .
and he took a little child , and set him in the midst of them : and taking him in his arms , he said unto them ,
whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name , receiveth me : and whosoever receiveth me , receiveth not me , but him that sent me .
john said unto him , teacher , we saw one casting out demons in thy name ; and we forbade him , because he followed not us .
for he that is not against us is for us .
where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
for every one shall be salted with fire .
and there came unto him pharisees , and asked him , is it lawful for a man to put away his wife ? trying him .
and he answered and said unto them , what did moses command you ?
and they said , moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement , and to put her away .
but jesus said unto them , for your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment .
but from the beginning of the creation , male and female made he them .
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife ;
and the two shall become one flesh : so that they are no more two , but one flesh .
what therefore god hath joined together , let not man put asunder .
and in the house the disciples asked him again of this matter .
and he saith unto them , whosoever shall put away his wife , and marry another , committeth adultery against her :
and if she herself shall put away her husband , and marry another , she committeth adultery .
and they were bringing unto him little children , that he should touch them : and the disciples rebuked them .
verily i say unto you , whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child , he shall in no wise enter therein .
and he took them in his arms , and blessed them , laying his hands upon them .
and jesus said unto him , why callest thou me good ? none is good save one , even god .
and he said unto him , teacher , all these things have i observed from my youth .
but his countenance fell at the saying , and he went away sorrowful : for he was one that had great possessions .
and jesus looked round about , and saith unto his disciples , how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god !
it is easier for a camel to go through a needle ’ s eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god .
and they were astonished exceedingly , saying unto him , then who can be saved ?
jesus looking upon them saith , with men it is impossible , but not with god : for all things are possible with god .
peter began to say unto him , lo , we have left all , and have followed thee .
but many that are first shall be last ; and the last first .
and he said unto them , what would ye that i should do for you ?
but to sit on my right hand or on my left hand is not mine to give ; but it is for them for whom it hath been prepared .
and when the ten heard it , they began to be moved with indignation concerning james and john .
but it is not so among you : but whosoever would become great among you , shall be your minister ;
and whosoever would be first among you , shall be servant of all .
for the son of man also came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
and he , casting away his garment , sprang up , and came to jesus .
