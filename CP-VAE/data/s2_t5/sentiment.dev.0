“ then people will see the son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory .
he will send his angels all around the earth . they will gather his chosen people from every part of the earth .
in the same way , when you see all these things happening , you will know that the time is very near , already present .
i assure you that all these things will happen while some of the people of this time are still living .
the whole world , earth and sky , will be destroyed , but my words will last forever .
be careful ! always be ready . you don ’ t know when that time will be .
if you are always ready , he will not find you sleeping , even if he comes back earlier than expected .
i tell you this , and i say it to everyone : ‘ be ready ! ’ ”
they said , “ but we can not arrest jesus during the festival . we don ’ t want the people to be angry and cause a riot . ”
some of the followers there saw this . they were upset and complained to each other . they said , “ why waste that perfume ?
jesus said , “ leave her alone . why are you giving her such trouble ? she did a very good thing for me .
you will always have the poor with you , and you can help them any time you want . but you will not always have me .
this woman did the only thing she could do for me . she poured perfume on my body before i die to prepare it for burial .
then judas iscariot , one of the twelve apostles , went to talk to the leading priests about handing jesus over to them .
they were very happy about this , and they promised to pay him . so he waited for the best time to hand jesus over to them .
the owner will show you a large room upstairs that is ready for us . prepare the meal for us there . ”
so the followers left and went into the city . everything happened the way jesus said . so the followers prepared the passover meal .
in the evening jesus went to that house with the twelve apostles .
the followers were very sad to hear this . each one said to jesus , “ surely i am not the one ! ”
jesus answered , “ it is one of you twelve—the one who is dipping his bread in the same bowl with me .
then he took a cup of wine , thanked god for it , and gave it to them . they all drank from the cup .
then he said , “ this wine is my blood , which will be poured out for many to begin the new agreement from god to his people .
they all sang a song and then went out to the mount of olives .
then jesus told the followers , “ you will all lose your faith . the scriptures say ,
but after i am killed , i will rise from death . then i will go to galilee . i will be there before you come . ”
peter said , “ all the other followers may lose their faith . but my faith will never be shaken . ”
jesus and his followers went to a place named gethsemane . he said to them , “ sit here while i pray . ”
but he told peter , james , and john to come with him . he began to be very distressed and troubled ,
and he said to them , “ my heart is so heavy with grief , i feel as if i am dying . wait here and stay awake . ”
stay awake and pray for strength against temptation . your spirit wants to do what is right , but your body is weak . ”
again jesus went away and prayed the same thing .
then he went back to the followers and again found them sleeping . they could not stay awake . they did not know what they should say to him .
stand up ! we must go . here comes the man who is handing me over to them . ”
so judas went over to jesus and said , “ teacher ! ” then he kissed him .
the men grabbed jesus and arrested him .
then jesus said , “ why do you come to get me with swords and clubs as if i were a criminal ?
then all of jesus ’ followers left him and ran away .
one of those following jesus was a young man wearing only a linen cloth . when the people tried to grab him ,
he left the cloth in their hands and ran away naked .
many people came and told lies against jesus , but they all said different things . none of them agreed .
then some others stood up and told more lies against jesus . they said ,
but also what these people said did not agree .
but jesus said nothing to answer him .
when the high priest heard this , he tore his clothes in anger . he said , “ we don ’ t need any more witnesses !
you all heard these insults to god . what do you think ? ”
while peter was still in the yard , a servant girl of the high priest came there .
she saw him warming himself by the fire . she looked closely at him and said , “ you were with jesus , that man from nazareth . ”
when the servant girl saw him there , she began saying again to the people standing around , “ this man is one of them . ”
again peter said it was not true .
then peter began to curse . he said , “ i swear to god , i don ’ t know this man you are talking about ! ”
pilate asked jesus , “ are you the king of the jews ? ”
the leading priests accused jesus of many things .
but jesus still did not answer , and this really surprised pilate .
every year at the passover time the governor would free one prisoner—whichever one the people wanted .
there was a man in prison at that time named barabbas . he and the rebels with him had been put in prison for committing murder during a riot .
the people came to pilate and asked him to free a prisoner as he always did .
pilate asked them , “ do you want me to free the king of the jews ? ”
pilate knew that the leading priests had handed jesus over to him because they were jealous of him .
but the leading priests persuaded the people to ask pilate to free barabbas , not jesus .
pilate asked the people again , “ so what should i do with this man you call the king of the jews ? ”
the people shouted , “ kill him on a cross ! ”
pilate asked , “ why ? what wrong has he done ? ”
pilate ’ s soldiers took jesus into the governor ’ s palace ( called the praetorium ) . they called all the other soldiers together .
they put a purple robe on jesus , made a crown from thorny branches , and put it on his head .
then they began shouting , “ welcome , king of the jews ! ”
they kept on beating his head with a stick and spitting on him . then they bowed down on their knees and pretended to honor him as a king .
they led jesus to the place called golgotha . ( golgotha means “ the place of the skull . ” )
there they gave him some wine mixed with myrrh , but he refused to drink it .
the soldiers nailed jesus to a cross . then they divided his clothes among themselves , throwing dice to see who would get what .
it was nine o ’ clock in the morning when they nailed jesus to the cross .
there was a sign with the charge against him written on it . it said , “ the king of the jews . ”
they also nailed two criminals to crosses beside jesus—one on the right and the other on the left .
so save yourself ! come down from that cross ! ”
at noon the whole country became dark . this darkness continued until three o ’ clock .
some of the people standing there heard this . they said , “ listen ! he is calling elijah . ”
then jesus cried out loudly and died .
when jesus died , the curtain in the temple was torn into two pieces . the tear started at the top and tore all the way to the bottom .
these were the women who had followed jesus in galilee and cared for him . many other women who had come with jesus to jerusalem were also there .
this day was called preparation day . ( that means the day before the sabbath day . ) it was becoming dark .
pilate was surprised to hear that jesus was already dead . so he called for the army officer in charge and asked him if jesus was already dead .
when pilate heard it from the officer , he told joseph he could have the body .
mary magdalene and mary the mother of joses saw the place where jesus was put .
the next day after the sabbath day , mary magdalene , salome , and mary the mother of james bought some sweet-smelling spices to put on jesus ’ body .
very early on that day , the first day of the week , the women were going to the tomb . it was very early after sunrise .
the women said to each other , “ there is a large stone covering the entrance of the tomb . who will move the stone for us ? ”
then the women looked and saw that the stone was moved . the stone was very large , but it was moved away from the entrance .
the women were very afraid and confused . they left the tomb and ran away . they did not tell about what happened , because they were afraid .
after mary saw jesus , she went and told his followers . they were very sad and were crying .
but mary told them that jesus was alive . she said that she had seen jesus , but they did not believe her .
later , jesus appeared to two followers while they were walking in the country . but jesus did not look the same as before he was killed .
these followers went back to the other followers and told them what happened . again , the followers did not believe them .
he said to them , “ go everywhere in the world . tell the good news to everyone .
whoever believes and is baptized will be saved . but those who do not believe will be judged guilty .
after the lord jesus said these things to his followers , he was carried up into heaven . there , jesus sat at the right side of god .
this is the family history of jesus the messiah . he came from the family of david , who was from the family of abraham .
abraham was the father of isaac .
judah was the father of perez and zerah . ( their mother was tamar . )
ram was the father of amminadab .
salmon was the father of boaz . ( his mother was rahab . )
jesse was the father of king david .
solomon was the father of rehoboam .
asa was the father of jehoshaphat .
uzziah was the father of jotham .
hezekiah was the father of manasseh .
josiah was the grandfather of jehoiachin and his brothers , who lived during the time that the people were taken away to babylon .
after they were taken to babylon :
zerubbabel was the father of abiud .
azor was the father of zadok .
eliud was the father of eleazar .
jacob was the father of joseph .
mary ’ s husband , joseph , was a good man . he did not want to cause her public disgrace , so he planned to divorce her secretly .
she will give birth to a son . you will name him jesus . give him that name because he will save his people from their sins . ”
all this happened to make clear the full meaning of what the lord said through the prophet :
“ the virgin will be pregnant and will give birth to a son . they will name him immanuel. ” ( immanuel means “ god with us . ” )
when joseph woke up , he did what the lord ’ s angel told him to do . he married mary .
but joseph did not have sexual relations with her until her son was born . and he named him jesus .
when king herod heard about this , it upset him as well as everyone else in jerusalem .
herod called a meeting of all the leading jewish priests and teachers of the law . he asked them where the messiah would be born .
they answered , “ in the town of bethlehem in judea , just as the prophet wrote :
‘ bethlehem , in the land of judah ,
then herod had a private meeting with the wise men from the east . he learned from them the exact time they first saw the star .
they were very happy and excited to see the star .
but god warned the wise men in a dream not to go back to herod . so they went home to their own country a different way .
so joseph got ready and left for egypt with the child and the mother . they left during the night .
this gave full meaning to what god said through the prophet jeremiah :
“ a sound was heard in ramah—
while joseph was in egypt , herod died . an angel from the lord came to joseph in a dream
so joseph took the child and the mother and went to israel .
when it was the right time , john the baptizer began telling people a message from god . this was out in the desert area of judea .
john said , “ change your hearts and lives , because god ’ s kingdom is now very near . ”
john is the one isaiah the prophet was talking about when he said ,
people came to john from jerusalem and the rest of judea and from all the areas along the jordan river .
they confessed the bad things they had done , and john baptized them in the jordan .
change your hearts ! and show by the way you live that you have changed .
the ax is now ready to cut down the trees . every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire .
then jesus came from galilee to the jordan river . he came to john , wanting john to baptize him .
but john tried to stop him . john said , “ why do you come to me to be baptized ? i should be baptized by you ! ”
jesus answered , “ let it be this way for now . we should do whatever god says is right. ” then john agreed .
a voice from heaven said , “ this is my son , the one i love . i am very pleased with him . ”
then the spirit led jesus into the desert . he was taken there to be tempted by the devil .
jesus ate nothing for 40 days and nights . after this , he was very hungry .
the devil came to tempt him and said , “ if you are the son of god , tell these rocks to become bread . ”
jesus answered him , “ the scriptures say ,
then the devil led jesus to the holy city of jerusalem and put him on a high place at the edge of the temple area .
he said to jesus , “ if you are the son of god , jump off , because the scriptures say ,
jesus answered , “ the scriptures also say , ‘ you must not test the lord your god . ’ ”
then the devil led jesus to the top of a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and all the wonderful things in them .
the devil said , “ if you will bow down and worship me , i will give you all these things . ”
jesus said to him , “ get away from me , satan ! the scriptures say ,
so the devil left him . then some angels came to jesus and helped him .
jesus heard that john was put in prison , so he went back to galilee .
but he did not stay in nazareth . he went to live in capernaum , a town near lake galilee in the area near zebulun and naphtali .
he did this to give full meaning to what the prophet isaiah said :
“ listen , land of zebulun and land of naphtali ,
the people who live in spiritual darkness
from that time jesus began to tell people his message : “ change your hearts and lives , because god ’ s kingdom is now very near . ”
simon and andrew immediately left their nets and followed him .
so they immediately left the boat and their father , and they followed jesus .
large crowds followed him—people from galilee , the ten towns , jerusalem , judea , and the area across the jordan river .
when jesus saw the crowds of people there , he went up on a hill and sat down . his followers came and sat next to him .
then jesus began teaching the people . he said ,
“ great blessings belong to those who know they are spiritually in need .
great blessings belong to those who are sad now .
great blessings belong to those who are humble .
great blessings belong to those who want to do right more than anything else .
great blessings belong to those who show mercy to others .
great blessings belong to those whose thoughts are pure .
great blessings belong to those who work to bring peace .
great blessings belong to those who suffer persecution for doing what is right .
“ you are the light that shines for the world to see . you are like a city built on a hill that can not be hidden .
people don ’ t hide a lamp under a bowl . they put it on a lampstand . then the light shines for everyone in the house .
“ so , what if you are offering your gift at the altar and remember that someone has something against you ?
leave your gift there and go make peace with that person . then come and offer your gift .
i assure you that you will not leave there until you have paid everything you owe .
“ you have heard that it was said , ‘ you must not commit adultery . ’
“ it was also said , ‘ any man who divorces his wife must give her a written notice of divorce . ’
“ you have heard that it was said , ‘ an eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . ’
if anyone wants to sue you in court and take your shirt , let them have your coat too .
if a soldier forces you to walk with him one mile , go with him two .
give to anyone who asks you for something . don ’ t refuse to give to anyone who wants to borrow from you .
“ you have heard that it was said , ‘ love your neighbor and hate your enemy . ’
but i tell you , love your enemies . pray for those who treat you badly .
if you love only those who love you , why should you get a reward for that ? even the tax collectors do that .
what i am saying is that you must be perfect , just as your father in heaven is perfect .
so when you give to the poor , don ’ t let anyone know what you are doing .
your giving should be done in private . your father can see what is done in private , and he will reward you .
don ’ t be like them . your father knows what you need before you ask him .
so this is how you should pray :
we pray that your kingdom will come—
give us the food we need for today .
don ’ t let us be tempted ,
yes , if you forgive others for the wrongs they do to you , then your father in heaven will also forgive your wrongs .
but if you don ’ t forgive others , then your father in heaven will not forgive the wrongs you do .
so when you fast , wash your face and make yourself look nice .
“ don ’ t save treasures for yourselves here on earth . moths and rust will destroy them . and thieves can break into your house and steal them .
instead , save your treasures in heaven , where they can not be destroyed by moths or rust and where thieves can not break in and steal them .
your heart will be where your treasure is .
you can not add any time to your life by worrying about it .
but i tell you that even solomon , the great and rich king , was not dressed as beautifully as one of these flowers .
so don ’ t worry about tomorrow . each day has enough trouble of its own . tomorrow will have its own worries .
“ don ’ t judge others , and god will not judge you .
if you judge others , you will be judged the same way you judge them . god will treat you the same way you treat others .
yes , whoever continues to ask will receive . whoever continues to look will find . and whoever continues to knock will have the door opened for them .
“ do any of you have a son ? if he asked for bread , would you give him a rock ?
or if he asked for a fish , would you give him a snake ? of course not !
“ do for others what you would want them to do for you . this is the meaning of the law of moses and the teaching of the prophets .
“ be careful of false prophets . they come to you and look gentle like sheep . but they are really dangerous like wolves .
in the same way , every good tree produces good fruit , and bad trees produce bad fruit .
a good tree can not produce bad fruit , and a bad tree can not produce good fruit .
every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
you will know these false people by what they do .
then i will tell those people clearly , ‘ get away from me , you people who do wrong . i never knew you . ’
“ whoever hears these teachings of mine and obeys them is like a wise man who built his house on rock .
it rained hard , the floods came , and the winds blew and beat against that house . but it did not fall because it was built on rock .
“ whoever hears these teachings of mine and does not obey them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand .
it rained hard , the floods came , and the winds blew and beat against that house . and it fell with a loud crash . ”
when jesus finished speaking , the people were amazed at his teaching .
he did not teach like their teachers of the law . he taught like someone who has authority .
jesus came down from the hill , and a large crowd followed him .
jesus touched the man . he said , “ i want to heal you . be healed ! ” immediately the man was healed from his leprosy .
jesus went to the city of capernaum . when he entered the city , an army officer came to him and begged for help .
the officer said , “ lord , my servant is very sick at home in bed . he can ’ t move his body and has much pain . ”
jesus said to the officer , “ i will go and heal him . ”
then jesus said to the officer , “ go home . your servant will be healed the way you believed he would. ” right then his servant was healed .
jesus went to peter ’ s house . he saw that peter ’ s mother-in-law was in bed with a high fever .
he touched her hand , and the fever left her . then she stood up and began to serve him .
so jesus made clear the full meaning of what isaiah the prophet said :
when jesus saw the crowd around him , he told his followers to go to the other side of the lake .
then a teacher of the law came to him and said , “ teacher , i will follow you any place you go . ”
another of jesus ’ followers said to him , “ lord , i will follow you too , but let me go and bury my father first . ”
but jesus said to him , “ follow me , and let those who are dead bury their own dead . ”
jesus got into a boat , and his followers went with him .
after the boat left the shore , a very bad storm began on the lake . the waves covered the boat . but jesus was sleeping .
the followers went to him and woke him . they said , “ lord , save us ! we will drown ! ”
the men were amazed . they said , “ what kind of man is this ? even the wind and the water obey him ! ”
near that place there was a large herd of pigs feeding .
the demons begged jesus , “ if you make us leave these men , please send us into that herd of pigs . ”
then the whole town went out to see jesus . when the people saw him , they begged him to leave their area .
jesus got into a boat and went back across the lake to his own town .
jesus knew what they were thinking . so he said , “ why are you thinking such evil thoughts ?
the man stood up and went home .
the people saw this and they were amazed . they praised god for letting someone have such power .
jesus ate dinner at matthew ’ s house . many tax collectors and others with bad reputations came and ate with him and his followers .
the pharisees saw that jesus was eating with these people . they asked his followers , “ why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and other sinners ? ”
jesus heard them say this . so he said to them , “ it is the sick people who need a doctor , not those who are healthy .
so jesus and his followers went with the man .
on the way , there was a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years . she came close behind jesus and touched the bottom of his coat .
she was thinking , “ if i can touch his coat , i will be healed . ”
jesus said , “ go away . the girl is not dead . she is only sleeping. ” but the people laughed at him .
the news about this spread all around the area .
as jesus was going away from there , two blind men followed him . they said loudly , “ show kindness to us , son of david . ”
then jesus touched their eyes and said , “ you believe that i can make you see again , so it will happen . ”
then the men were able to see . jesus gave them a strong warning . he said , “ don ’ t tell anyone about this . ”
but they left and spread the news about jesus all around that area .
as these two men were leaving , some people brought another man to jesus . this man could not talk because he had a demon inside him .
but the pharisees said , “ the ruler of demons is the one that gives him power to force demons out . ”
jesus saw the many people and felt sorry for them because they were worried and helpless—like sheep without a shepherd to lead them .
god owns the harvest . ask him to send more workers to help gather his harvest . ”
jesus called his twelve followers together . he gave them power over evil spirits and power to heal every kind of disease and sickness .
these are the names of the twelve apostles :
simon , the zealot ,
but go to the people of israel . they are like sheep that are lost .
when you go , tell them this : ‘ god ’ s kingdom is now very near . ’
don ’ t carry any money with you—gold or silver or copper .
“ when you enter a city or town , find some worthy person there and stay in his home until you leave .
when you enter that home , say , ‘ peace be with you . ’
i can assure you that on the judgment day it will be worse for that town than for the people of sodom and gomorrah .
be careful ! there are people who will arrest you and take you to be judged . they will whip you in their synagogues .
it will not really be you speaking ; the spirit of your father will be speaking through you .
everyone will hate you because you follow me . but the one who remains faithful to the end will be saved .
“ students are not better than their teacher . servants are not better than their master .
“ so don ’ t be afraid of those people . everything that is hidden will be shown . everything that is secret will be made known .
i tell you all this secretly , but i want you to tell it publicly . whatever i tell you privately , you should shout for everyone to hear .
when birds are sold , two small birds cost only a penny . but not even one of those little birds can die without your father knowing it .
god even knows how many hairs are on your head .
so don ’ t be afraid . you are worth more than a whole flock of birds .
“ if you stand before others and are willing to say you believe in me , then i will tell my father in heaven that you belong to me .
“ do not think that i have come to bring peace to the earth . i did not come to bring peace . i came to bring trouble .
i have come to make this happen :
even members of your own family will be your enemies . ’
those who will not accept the cross that is given to them when they follow me are not worthy of me .
those who try to keep the life they have will lose it . but those who give up their life for me will find true life .
“ whoever accepts you also accepts me . and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me .
when john was in prison , he heard about the things that were happening—things the messiah would do . so he sent some of his followers to jesus .
they asked him , “ are you the one we have been expecting , or should we wait for someone else ? ”
jesus answered , “ go tell john what you have heard and seen :
great blessings belong to those who don ’ t have a problem accepting me . ”
so what did you go out to see ? a prophet ? yes , john is a prophet . but i tell you , he is more than that .
this scripture was written about him :
before john came , the law of moses and all the prophets told about the things that would happen .
and if you believe what they said , then john is elijah . he is the one they said would come .
you people who hear me , listen !
‘ we played flute music for you ,
then jesus criticized the cities where he did most of his miracles . he criticized these cities because the people there did not change their lives and stop sinning .
but i tell you , on the day of judgment it will be worse for you than for tyre and sidon .
but i tell you , it will be worse for you in the day of judgment than for sodom . ”
yes , father , you did this because it ’ s what you really wanted to do .
“ come to me all of you who are tired from the heavy burden you have been forced to carry . i will give you rest .
accept my teaching . learn from me . i am gentle and humble in spirit . and you will be able to get some rest .
yes , the teaching that i ask you to accept is easy . the load i give you to carry is light . ”
jesus said to them , “ you have read what david did when he and those with him were hungry .
i tell you that there is something here that is greater than the temple .
“ the son of man is lord over the sabbath day . ”
jesus went from there to their synagogue .
surely a man is more important than a sheep . so it is right to do good on the sabbath day . ”
but the pharisees left and made plans to kill jesus .
jesus knew what the pharisees were planning . so he left that place , and many people followed him . he healed all who were sick ,
but he warned them not to tell others who he was .
this was to give full meaning to what isaiah the prophet said when he spoke for god :
“ here is my servant ,
he will not argue or shout ;
he will not break off even a bent stem of grass .
all people will hope in him . ”
all the people were amazed at what jesus did . they said , “ maybe he is the promised son of david ! ”
so if satan forces out his own demons , then he is fighting against himself , and his kingdom will not survive .
but i use the power of god ’ s spirit to force out demons , and this shows that god ’ s kingdom has come to you .
whoever wants to enter a strong man ’ s house and steal his things must first tie him up . then they can steal the things from his house .
whoever is not with me is against me . and anyone who does not work with me is working against me .
you snakes ! you are so evil . how can you say anything good ? what people say with their mouths comes from what fills their hearts .
i tell you that everyone will have to answer for all the careless things they have said . this will happen on the day of judgment .
your words will be used to judge you . what you have said will show whether you are right or whether you are guilty . ”
“ when an evil spirit comes out of a person , it travels through dry places looking for a place to rest , but it finds none .
while jesus was talking to the people , his mother and brothers stood outside . they wanted to talk to him .
someone told him , “ your mother and brothers are waiting for you outside . they want to talk to you . ”
jesus answered , “ who is my mother ? who are my brothers ? ”
then he pointed to his followers and said , “ see ! these people are my mother and my brothers .
yes , anyone who does what my father in heaven wants is my true brother and sister and mother . ”
that same day jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake .
a large crowd gathered around him . so he got into a boat and sat down . all the people stayed on the shore .
then jesus used stories to teach them many things . he told them this story :
while he was scattering the seed , some of it fell by the road . the birds came and ate all that seed .
other seed fell on rocky ground , where there was not enough dirt . it grew very fast there , because the soil was not deep .
but when the sun rose , it burned the plants . the plants died because they did not have deep roots .
some other seed fell among thorny weeds . the weeds grew and stopped the good plants from growing .
you people who hear me , listen ! ”
the followers came to jesus and asked , “ why do you use these stories to teach the people ? ”
jesus answered , “ only you can know the secret truths about god ’ s kingdom . those other people can not know these secret truths .
so they show that what isaiah said about them is true :
yes , the minds of these people are now closed .
but god has blessed you . you understand what you see with your eyes . and you understand what you hear with your ears .
“ so listen to the meaning of that story about the farmer :
“ and what about the seed that fell on rocky ground ? that is like the people who hear the teaching and quickly and gladly accept it .
then jesus used another story to teach them . jesus said , “ god ’ s kingdom is like a man who planted good seed in his field .
that night , while everyone was asleep , the man ’ s enemy came and planted weeds among the wheat and then left .
later , the wheat grew , and heads of grain grew on the plants . but at the same time the weeds also grew .
then the man ’ s servants came to him and said , ‘ you planted good seed in your field . where did the weeds come from ? ’
“ the man answered , ‘ an enemy planted weeds . ’
“ he answered , ‘ no , because when you pull up the weeds , you might also pull up the wheat .
then jesus told the people another story : “ god ’ s kingdom is like a mustard seed that a man plants in his field .
jesus used stories to tell all these things to the people . he always used stories to teach them .
this was to make clear the full meaning of what the prophet said :
he answered , “ the man who planted the good seed in the field is the son of man .
the field is the world . the good seed are the people in god ’ s kingdom . the weeds are the people who belong to the evil one .
“ the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire . it will be the same at the end of time .
they will throw them into the place of fire . there the people will be crying and grinding their teeth with pain .
then the godly people will shine like the sun . they will be in the kingdom of their father . you people who hear me , listen !
“ also , god ’ s kingdom is like a merchant looking for fine pearls .
one day he found a very fine pearl . he went and sold everything he had to buy it .
“ also , god ’ s kingdom is like a net that was put into the lake . the net caught many different kinds of fish .
it will be the same at the end of time . the angels will come and separate the evil people from the godly people .
they will throw the evil people into the place of fire . there the people will cry and grind their teeth with pain . ”
then jesus asked his followers , “ do you understand all these things ? ”
when jesus finished teaching with these stories , he left there .
and don ’ t all his sisters still live here in town ? how is he able to do these things ? ”
so they had a problem accepting him .
jesus did not do many miracles there , because the people did not believe in him .
about that time , herod , the ruler of galilee , heard what the people were saying about jesus .
john had told him , “ it is not right for you to be married to herodias . ”
herod wanted to kill him , but he was afraid of the people . they believed that john was a prophet .
on herod ’ s birthday , the daughter of herodias danced for him and his group . herod was very pleased with her .
so he promised that he would give her anything she wanted .
herodias told her daughter what to ask for . so she said to herod , “ give me the head of john the baptizer here on this plate . ”
he sent men to the prison , where they cut off john ’ s head .
and the men brought john ’ s head on a plate and gave it to the girl . then she took the head to her mother , herodias .
john ’ s followers came and got his body and buried it . then they went and told jesus what happened .
jesus said , “ the people don ’ t need to go away . you give them some food to eat . ”
the followers answered , “ but we have only five loaves of bread and two fish . ”
jesus said , “ bring the bread and the fish to me . ”
everyone ate until they were full . when they finished eating , the followers filled twelve baskets with the pieces of food that were not eaten .
there were about 5000 men there who ate . there were also women and children who ate .
after jesus said goodbye to the people , he went up into the hills by himself to pray . it was late , and he was there alone .
when they saw him walking on the water , it scared them . “ it ’ s a ghost ! ” they said , screaming in fear .
but jesus quickly spoke to them . he said , “ don ’ t worry ! it ’ s me ! don ’ t be afraid . ”
peter said , “ lord , if that is really you , tell me to come to you on the water . ”
jesus said , “ come , peter . ”
then jesus caught peter with his hand . he said , “ your faith is small . why did you doubt ? ”
after peter and jesus were in the boat , the wind stopped .
then the followers in the boat worshiped jesus and said , “ you really are the son of god . ”
after they crossed the lake , they came to the shore at gennesaret .
they begged jesus to let them only touch the edge of his coat to be healed . and all the sick people who touched his coat were healed .
then some pharisees and teachers of the law came to jesus . they came from jerusalem and asked him ,
jesus answered , “ and why do you refuse to obey god ’ s command so that you can follow those traditions you have ?
you are hypocrites ! isaiah was right when he spoke for god about you :
‘ these people honor me with their words ,
their worship of me is worthless .
jesus called the people to him . he said , “ listen and understand what i am saying .
it is not what people put in their mouth that makes them wrong . it is what comes out of their mouth that makes them wrong . ”
then the followers came to jesus and asked , “ do you know that the pharisees are upset about what you said ? ”
jesus answered , “ every plant that my father in heaven has not planted will be pulled up by the roots .
peter said , “ explain to us what you said earlier to the people . ”
jesus said , “ do you still have trouble understanding ?
surely you know that all the food that enters the mouth goes into the stomach . then it goes out of the body .
but the bad things people say with their mouth come from the way they think . and that ’ s what can make people wrong .
all these bad things begin in the mind : evil thoughts , murder , adultery , sexual sins , stealing , lying , and insulting people .
these are the things that make people wrong . eating without washing their hands will never make people unacceptable to god . ”
jesus went from there to the area of tyre and sidon .
jesus answered , “ god sent me only to the lost people of israel . ”
then the woman came over to jesus and bowed before him . she said , “ lord , help me ! ”
he answered her with this saying : “ it is not right to take the children ’ s bread and give it to the dogs . ”
the woman said , “ yes , lord , but even the dogs eat the pieces of food that fall from their master ’ s table . ”
then jesus went from there to the shore of lake galilee . he went up on a hill and sat down .
the followers asked jesus , “ where can we get enough bread to feed all these people ? we are a long way from any town . ”
jesus asked , “ how many loaves of bread do you have ? ”
jesus told the people to sit on the ground .
all the people ate until they were full . after this , the followers filled seven baskets with the pieces of food that were not eaten .
there were about 4000 men there who ate . there were also some women and children .
after they all ate , jesus told the people they could go home . he got into the boat and went to the area of magadan .
the pharisees and sadducees came to jesus . they wanted to test him . so they asked him to show them a miracle as a sign from god .
jesus and his followers went across the lake . but the followers forgot to bring bread .
jesus said to the followers , “ be careful ! guard against the yeast of the pharisees and the sadducees . ”
the followers discussed the meaning of this . they said , “ did jesus say this because we forgot to bring bread ? ”
jesus knew that they were talking about this . so he asked them , “ why are you talking about not having bread ? your faith is small .
do you still not understand ? remember the five loaves of bread that fed the 5000 people and the many baskets you filled with the bread that was left ?
and remember the seven loaves of bread that fed the 4000 people and the many baskets you filled that time ?
jesus went to the area of caesarea philippi . he said to his followers , “ who do people say i am ? ”
then jesus said to his followers , “ and who do you say i am ? ”
simon peter answered , “ you are the messiah , the son of the living god . ”
jesus answered , “ you are blessed , simon son of jonah . no one taught you that . my father in heaven showed you who i am .
then jesus warned his followers not to tell anyone he was the messiah .
any of you who try to save the life you have will lose it . but you who give up your life for me will find true life .
it is worth nothing for you to have the whole world if you yourself are lost . you could never pay enough to buy back your life .
the son of man will come again with his father ’ s glory and with his angels . and he will reward everyone for what they have done .
believe me when i say that there are some people standing here who will see the son of man coming with his kingdom before they die . ”
six days later , jesus took peter , james , and john the brother of james and went up on a high mountain . they were all alone there .
while these followers watched him , jesus was changed . his face became bright like the sun , and his clothes became white as light .
then two men were there , talking with him . they were moses and elijah .
the followers with jesus heard this voice . they were very afraid , so they fell to the ground .
but jesus came to them and touched them . he said , “ stand up . don ’ t be afraid . ”
the followers looked up , and they saw that jesus was now alone .
the followers asked jesus , “ why do the teachers of the law say that elijah must come before the messiah comes ? ”
jesus answered , “ they are right to say elijah is coming . and it is true that elijah will make all things the way they should be .
then the followers understood that when jesus said elijah , he was really talking about john the baptizer .
jesus and the followers went back to the people . a man came to jesus and bowed before him .
i brought him to your followers , but they could not heal him . ”
jesus gave a strong command to the demon inside the boy . the demon came out of the boy , and the boy was healed .
later , the followers met together in galilee . jesus said to them , “ the son of man will be handed over to the control of other men ,
who will kill him . but on the third day he will be raised from death. ” the followers were very sad to hear that jesus would be killed .
peter answered , “ yes , he does . ”
peter answered , “ the other people pay the taxes . ”
about that time the followers came to jesus and asked , “ who is the greatest in god ’ s kingdom ? ”
jesus called a little child to come to him . he stood the child in front of the followers .
the greatest person in god ’ s kingdom is the one who makes himself humble like this child .
“ whoever accepts a little child like this in my name is accepting me .
and if he finds the lost sheep , he is happier about that one sheep than about the 99 sheep that were never lost . i can assure you ,
in the same way your father in heaven does not want any of these little children to be lost .
to say it another way , if two of you on earth agree on anything you pray for , my father in heaven will do what you ask .
yes , if two or three people are together believing in me , i am there with them . ”
“ so god ’ s kingdom is like a king who decided to collect the money his servants owed him .
the king began to collect his money . one servant owed him several thousand pounds of silver .
“ but the servant fell on his knees and begged , ‘ be patient with me . i will pay you everything i owe . ’
the master felt sorry for him . so he told the servant he did not have to pay . he let him go free .
“ the other servant fell on his knees and begged him , ‘ be patient with me . i will pay you everything i owe . ’
all the other servants saw what happened . they felt very sorry for the man . so they went and told their master everything that happened .
so you should have given that other man who serves with you the same mercy i gave you . ’
after jesus said all these things , he left galilee . he went into the area of judea on the other side of the jordan river .
many people followed him . jesus healed the sick people there .
jesus answered , “ surely you have read this in the scriptures : when god made the world , ‘ he made people male and female . ’
so they are no longer two , but one . god has joined them together , so no one should separate them . ”
the pharisees asked , “ then why did moses give a command allowing a man to divorce his wife by writing a certificate of divorce ? ”
jesus answered , “ moses allowed you to divorce your wives because you refused to accept god ’ s teaching . but divorce was not allowed in the beginning .
i tell you that whoever divorces his wife , except for the problem of sexual sin , and marries another woman is guilty of adultery . ”
the followers said to jesus , “ if that is the only reason a man can divorce his wife , it is better not to marry . ”
he answered , “ this statement is true for some , but not for everyone—only for those who have been given this gift .
after jesus blessed the children , he left there .
a man came to jesus and asked , “ teacher , what good thing must i do to have eternal life ? ”
the man asked , “ which ones ? ”
you must respect your father and mother , ’ and ‘ love your neighbor the same as you love yourself . ’ ”
the young man said , “ i have obeyed all these commands . what else do i need ? ”
then jesus said to his followers , “ the truth is , it will be very hard for a rich person to enter god ’ s kingdom .
the followers were amazed to hear this . they asked , “ then who can be saved ? ”
jesus looked at them and said , “ this is something that people can not do . but god can do anything . ”
peter said to him , “ we left everything we had and followed you . so what will we have ? ”
many people who are first now will be last in the future . and many who are last now will be first in the future .
he agreed to pay the workers one silver coin for working that day . then he sent them into the vineyard to work .
“ about nine o ’ clock the man went to the marketplace and saw some other people standing there . they were doing nothing .
so he said to them , ‘ if you go and work in my field , i will pay you what your work is worth . ’
so they went to work in the vineyard .
“ they said , ‘ no one gave us a job . ’
“ the workers who were hired at five o ’ clock came to get their pay . each worker got one silver coin .
when they got their silver coin , they complained to the man who owned the land .
so take your pay and go . i want to give the man who was hired last the same pay i gave you .
i can do what i want with my own money . why would you be jealous because i am generous ? ’
“ so those who are last now will be first in the future . and those who are first now will be last in the future . ”
then zebedee ’ s wife came to jesus and brought her sons . she bowed before jesus and asked him to do something for her .
jesus said , “ what do you want ? ”
the other ten followers heard this and were angry with the two brothers .
but it should not be that way with you . whoever wants to be your leader must be your servant .
whoever wants to be first must serve the rest of you like a slave .
when jesus and his followers were leaving jericho , a large crowd followed him .
jesus stopped and said to them , “ what do you want me to do for you ? ”
they answered , “ lord , we want to be able to see . ”
jesus felt sorry for the blind men . he touched their eyes , and immediately they were able to see . then they became followers of jesus .
if anyone asks you why you are taking the donkeys , tell them , ‘ the master needs them . he will send them back soon . ’ ”
this showed the full meaning of what the prophet said :
“ tell the people of zion ,
the followers went and did what jesus told them to do .
they brought the mother donkey and the young donkey to him . they covered the donkeys with their coats , and jesus sat on them .
on the way to jerusalem , many people spread their coats on the road for jesus . others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road .
some of the people were walking ahead of jesus . others were walking behind him . they all shouted ,
then jesus went into jerusalem . all the people in the city were confused . they asked , “ who is this man ? ”
the crowds following jesus answered , “ this is jesus . he is the prophet from the town of nazareth in galilee . ”
some blind people and some who were crippled came to jesus in the temple area . jesus healed them .
they asked jesus , “ do you hear what these children are saying ? ”
then jesus left them and went out of the city to bethany , where he spent the night .
early the next morning , jesus was going back to the city . he was very hungry .
when the followers saw this , they were very surprised . they asked , “ how did the fig tree dry up and die so quickly ? ”
if you believe , you will get anything you ask for in prayer . ”
tell me : when john baptized people , did his authority come from god , or was it only from other people ? ”
so they told jesus , “ we don ’ t know the answer . ”
“ the son answered , ‘ i will not go. ’ but later he decided he should go , and he went .
“ which of the two sons obeyed his father ? ”
later , it was time for the grapes to be picked . so the man sent his servants to the farmers to get his share of the grapes .
“ but the farmers grabbed the servants and beat one . they killed another one and then stoned to death a third servant .
so the man decided to send his son to the farmers . he said , ‘ the farmers will respect my son . ’
so the farmers took the son , threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him .
“ so what will the owner of the vineyard do to these farmers when he comes ? ”
jesus said to them , “ surely you have read this in the scriptures :
whoever falls on this stone will be broken . and it will crush anyone it falls on . ”
when the leading priests and the pharisees heard these stories , they knew that jesus was talking about them .
they wanted to find a way to arrest jesus . but they were afraid to do anything , because the people believed that jesus was a prophet .
jesus used some more stories to teach the people . he said ,
“ god ’ s kingdom is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son .
some of the other people grabbed the servants , beat them , and killed them .
the king was very angry . he sent his army to kill those who murdered his servants . and the army burned their city .
so go to the street corners and invite everyone you see . tell them to come to my feast . ’
“ when the king came in to meet the guests , he saw a man there who was not dressed in the right clothes for a wedding .
the king said , ‘ friend , how were you allowed to come in here ? you are not wearing the right clothes. ’ but the man said nothing .
“ yes , many people are invited . but only a few are chosen . ”
then the pharisees left the place where jesus was teaching . they made plans to catch him saying something wrong .
so tell us what you think . is it right to pay taxes to caesar or not ? ”
show me a coin used for paying the tax. ” they showed jesus a silver coin .
then he asked , “ whose picture is on the coin ? and whose name is written on the coin ? ”
they answered , “ it is caesar ’ s picture and caesar ’ s name . ”
when they heard what jesus said , they were amazed . they left him and went away .
that same day some sadducees came to jesus . ( sadducees believe that no one will rise from death . ) the sadducees asked jesus a question .
there were seven brothers among us . the first brother married but died . he had no children . so his brother married the woman .
then the second brother also died . the same thing happened to the third brother and all the other brothers .
the woman was the last to die .
but all seven men had married her . so when people rise from death , whose wife will she be ? ”
surely you have read what god said to you about people rising from death .
when the people heard this , they were amazed at jesus ’ teaching .
the pharisees learned that jesus had made the sadducees look so foolish that they stopped trying to argue with him . so the pharisees had a meeting .
then one of them , an expert in the law of moses , asked jesus a question to test him .
he said , “ teacher , which command in the law is the most important ? ”
jesus answered , “ ‘ love the lord your god with all your heart , all your soul , and all your mind . ’
this is the first and most important command .
and the second command is like the first : ‘ love your neighbor the same as you love yourself . ’
all of the law and the writings of the prophets take their meaning from these two commands . ”
so while the pharisees were together , jesus asked them a question .
he said , “ what do you think about the messiah ? whose son is he ? ”
jesus said to them , “ then why did david call him ‘ lord ’ ? david was speaking by the power of the spirit . he said ,
‘ the lord god said to my lord :
david calls the messiah ‘ lord. ’ so how can he be david ’ s son ? ”
none of the pharisees could answer jesus ’ question . and after that day , no one was brave enough to ask him any more questions .
then jesus spoke to the people and to his followers . he said ,
“ the teachers of the law and the pharisees have the authority to tell you what the law of moses says .
these men love to have the places of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues .
they love for people to show respect to them in the marketplaces and to call them ‘ teacher . ’
“ but you must not be called ‘ teacher. ’ you are all equal as brothers and sisters . you have only one teacher .
and don ’ t call anyone on earth ‘ father. ’ you have one father . he is in heaven .
and you should not be called ‘ master. ’ you have only one master , the messiah .
whoever serves you like a servant is the greatest among you .
people who think they are better than others will be made humble . but people who humble themselves will be made great .
whoever uses the altar to make a promise is really using the altar and everything on the altar .
and anyone who uses the temple to make a promise is really using the temple and god , who lives in it .
whoever uses heaven to make a promise is using god ’ s throne and the one who is seated on it .
pharisees , you are blind ! first make the inside of the cup clean and good . then the outside of the cup will also be clean .
it is the same with you . people look at you and think you are godly . but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and evil .
and you say , ‘ if we had lived during the time of our ancestors , we would not have helped them kill these prophets . ’
so you give proof that you are descendants of those who killed the prophets .
and you will finish the sin that your ancestors started !
believe me when i say that all these things will happen to you people who are living now .
now your house will be left completely empty .
jesus left the temple area and was walking away . but his followers came to him to show him the temple ’ s buildings .
jesus answered , “ be careful ! don ’ t let anyone fool you .
many people will come and use my name . they will say , ‘ i am the messiah. ’ and they will fool many people .
these things are only the beginning of troubles , like the first pains of a woman giving birth .
“ then you will be arrested and handed over to be punished and killed . people all over the world will hate you because you believe in me .
during that time many believers will lose their faith . they will turn against each other and hate each other .
many false prophets will come and cause many people to believe things that are wrong .
there will be so much more evil in the world that the love of most believers will grow cold .
but the one who remains faithful to the end will be saved .
“ the people in judea at that time should run away to the mountains .
if they are in the field , they must not go back to get a coat .
“ during that time it will be hard for women who are pregnant or have small babies !
pray that it will not be winter or a sabbath day when these things happen and you have to run away ,
false messiahs and false prophets will come and do great miracles and wonders , trying to fool the people god has chosen , if that is possible .
now i have warned you about this before it happens .
when the son of man comes , everyone will see him . it will be like lightning flashing in the sky that can be seen everywhere .
it ’ s like looking for a dead body : you will find it where the vultures are gathering above .
“ right after the trouble of those days , this will happen :
he will use a loud trumpet to send his angels all around the earth . they will gather his chosen people from every part of the earth .
in the same way , when you see all these things happening , you will know that the time is very near , already present .
i assure you that all these things will happen while some of the people of this time are still living .
the whole world , earth and sky , will be destroyed , but my words will last forever .
“ when the son of man comes , it will be the same as what happened during noah ’ s time .
they knew nothing about what was happening until the flood came and destroyed them all .
two men will be working together in the field . one will be taken and the other will be left .
two women will be grinding grain with a mill . one will be taken and the other will be left .
“ so always be ready . you don ’ t know the day your lord will come .
what would a homeowner do if he knew when a thief was coming ? you know he would be ready and not let the thief break in .
so you also must be ready . the son of man will come at a time when you don ’ t expect him .
when the master comes and finds that servant doing the work he gave him , it will be a day of blessing for that servant .
i can tell you without a doubt , the master will choose that servant to take care of everything he owns .
“ but what will happen if that servant is evil and thinks his master will not come back soon ?
he will begin to beat the other servants . he will eat and drink with others who are drunk .
then the master will come when the servant is not ready , at a time when the servant is not expecting him .
then the master will punish that servant . he will send him away to be with the hypocrites , where people will cry and grind their teeth with pain .
“ at that time god ’ s kingdom will be like ten girls who went to wait for the bridegroom . they took their lamps with them .
five of the girls were foolish , and five were wise .
the foolish girls took their lamps with them , but they did not take extra oil for the lamps .
the wise girls took their lamps and more oil in jars .
when the bridegroom was very late , the girls could not keep their eyes open , and they all fell asleep .
“ at midnight someone announced , ‘ the bridegroom is coming ! come and meet him ! ’
“ then all the girls woke up . they made their lamps ready .
but the foolish girls said to the wise girls , ‘ give us some of your oil . the oil in our lamps is all gone . ’
“ later , the other girls came . they said , ‘ sir , sir ! open the door to let us in . ’
“ but the bridegroom answered , ‘ certainly not ! i don ’ t even know you . ’
“ so always be ready . you don ’ t know the day or the time when the son of man will come .
the servant who got five bags went quickly to invest the money . those five bags of money earned five more .
it was the same with the servant who had two bags . that servant invested the money and earned two more .
“ after a long time the master came home . he asked the servants what they did with his money .
so i was afraid . i went and hid your money in the ground . here is the one bag of money you gave me . ’
“ so the master told his other servants , ‘ take the one bag of money from that servant and give it to the servant who has ten bags .
then the master said , ‘ throw that useless servant outside into the darkness , where people will cry and grind their teeth with pain . ’
he will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left .
when did we see you sick or in prison and care for you ? ’
“ then the king will answer , ‘ the truth is , anything you did for any of my people here , you also did for me . ’
you must go away because when i was hungry , you gave me nothing to eat . when i was thirsty , you gave me nothing to drink .
“ then these evil people will go away to be punished forever . but the godly people will go and enjoy eternal life . ”
after jesus finished saying all these things , he said to his followers ,
then the leading priests and the older jewish leaders had a meeting at the palace where the high priest lived . the high priest ’ s name was caiaphas .
they said , “ we can not arrest jesus during passover . we don ’ t want the people to become angry and cause a riot . ”
jesus was in bethany at the house of simon the leper .
the followers saw the woman do this and were upset at her . they said , “ why waste that perfume ?
it could be sold for a lot of money , and the money could be given to those who are poor . ”
but jesus knew what happened . he said , “ why are you bothering this woman ? she did a very good thing for me .
you will always have the poor with you . but you will not always have me .
this woman poured perfume on my body . she did this to prepare me for burial after i die .
then one of the twelve followers went to talk to the leading priests . this was the follower named judas iscariot .
he said , “ i will hand jesus over to you . what will you pay me for doing this ? ” the priests gave him 30 silver coins .
after that judas waited for the best time to hand jesus over to them .
they obeyed and did what jesus told them to do . they prepared the passover meal .
in the evening jesus was at the table with the twelve followers .
they were all eating . then jesus said , “ believe me when i say that one of you twelve here will hand me over to my enemies . ”
the followers were very sad to hear this . each one said , “ lord , surely i am not the one ! ”
jesus answered , “ one who has dipped his bread in the same bowl with me will be the one to hand me over .
this wine is my blood , which will be poured out to forgive the sins of many and begin the new agreement from god to his people .
they all sang a song and then went out to the mount of olives .
jesus told the followers , “ tonight you will all lose your faith in me . the scriptures say ,
but after i am killed , i will rise from death . then i will go into galilee . i will be there before you go there . ”
peter answered , “ all the other followers may lose their faith in you . but my faith will never be shaken . ”
then jesus went with his followers to a place called gethsemane . he said to them , “ sit here while i go there and pray . ”
he told peter and the two sons of zebedee to come with him . then he began to be very sad and troubled .
then he went back to his followers and found them sleeping . he said to peter , “ could you men not stay awake with me for one hour ?
stay awake and pray for strength against temptation . your spirit wants to do what is right , but your body is weak . ”
then he went back to the followers . again he found them sleeping . they could not stay awake .
so he left them and went away one more time and prayed . this third time he prayed , he said the same thing .
stand up ! we must go . here comes the one who will hand me over . ”
judas planned to do something to show them which one was jesus . he said , “ the one i kiss will be jesus . arrest him . ”
so he went to jesus and said , “ hello , teacher ! ” then judas kissed him .
jesus answered , “ friend , do the thing you came to do . ”
jesus said to the man , “ put your sword back in its place . people who use swords will be killed with swords .
surely you know i could ask my father and he would give me more than twelve armies of angels .
but it must happen this way to show the truth of what the scriptures said . ”
but all these things have happened to show the full meaning of what the prophets wrote. ” then all of jesus ’ followers left him and ran away .
the men who arrested jesus led him to the house of caiaphas the high priest . the teachers of the law and the older jewish leaders were gathered there .
many people came and told lies about him . but the council could find no real reason to kill him . then two people came
and said , “ this man said , ‘ i can destroy the temple of god and build it again in three days . ’ ”
but jesus said nothing .
what do you think ? ”
then some there spit in jesus ’ face , and they hit him with their fists . others slapped him .
they said , “ show us that you are a prophet , messiah ! tell us who hit you ! ”
but peter told everyone there that this was not true . “ i don ’ t know what you are talking about , ” he said .
then he left the yard . at the gate another girl saw him and said to the people there , “ this man was with jesus of nazareth . ”
again , peter said he was never with jesus . he said , “ i swear to god i don ’ t know the man ! ”
early the next morning , all the leading priests and older leaders of the people met and decided to kill jesus .
they tied him , led him away , and handed him over to pilate , the governor .
judas said , “ i sinned . i handed over to you an innocent man to be killed . ”
so judas threw the money into the temple . then he went out from there and hanged himself .
that is why that field is still called the field of blood .
this showed the full meaning of what jeremiah the prophet said :
they used those 30 silver coins to buy the potter ’ s field , as the lord commanded me . ”
jesus stood before pilate , the governor , who asked him , “ are you the king of the jews ? ”
then , when the leading priests and the older jewish leaders made their accusations against jesus , he said nothing .
so pilate said to him , “ don ’ t you hear all these charges they are making against you ? why don ’ t you answer ? ”
but jesus did not say anything , and this really surprised the governor .
every year at passover time the governor would free one prisoner—whichever one the people wanted him to free .
at that time there was a man in prison who was known to be very bad . his name was barabbas .
pilate knew that they had handed jesus over to him because they were jealous of him .
but the leading priests and older jewish leaders told the people to ask for barabbas to be set free and for jesus to be killed .
pilate said , “ i have barabbas and jesus . which one do you want me to set free for you ? ”
pilate asked , “ so what should i do with jesus , the one called the messiah ? ”
pilate asked , “ why do you want me to kill him ? what wrong has he done ? ”
the people answered , “ we will take full responsibility for his death . you can blame us and even our children ! ”
then pilate ’ s soldiers took jesus into the governor ’ s palace . all the soldiers gathered around him .
they took off jesus ’ clothes and put a red robe on him .
they spit on him . then they took his stick and kept hitting him on the head with it .
the soldiers were going out of the city with jesus . they saw a man from cyrene named simon , and they forced him to carry jesus ’ cross .
they came to the place called golgotha . ( golgotha means “ the place of the skull . ” )
there the soldiers gave jesus some wine mixed with gall . but when he tasted it , he refused to drink it .
the soldiers nailed jesus to a cross . then they threw dice to divide his clothes between them .
the soldiers stayed there to guard him .
they put a sign above his head with the charge against him written on it : “ this is jesus , the king of the jews . ”
two criminals were nailed to crosses beside jesus—one on the right and the other on the left .
people walked by and shouted insults at jesus . they shook their heads
and in the same way , the criminals on the crosses beside jesus also insulted him .
at noon the whole country became dark . the darkness continued for three hours .
some of the people standing there heard this . they said , “ he is calling elijah . ”
but the others said , “ don ’ t bother him . we want to see if elijah will come to save him . ”
again jesus cried out loudly and then died .
the graves opened , and many of god ’ s people who had died were raised from death .
they came out of the graves . and after jesus was raised from death , they went into the holy city , and many people saw them .
many women were standing away from the cross , watching . these were the women who had followed jesus from galilee to care for him .
mary magdalene , mary the mother of james and joseph , and the mother of james and john were there .
that evening a rich man named joseph came to jerusalem . he was a follower of jesus from the town of arimathea .
he went to pilate and asked to have jesus ’ body . pilate gave orders for the soldiers to give jesus ’ body to him .
then joseph took the body and wrapped it in a new linen cloth .
mary magdalene and the other woman named mary were sitting near the tomb .
that day was the day called preparation day . the next day , the leading priests and the pharisees went to pilate .
they said , “ sir , we remember that while that liar was still alive he said , ‘ i will rise from death in three days . ’
pilate said , “ take some soldiers and go guard the tomb the best way you know . ”
the angel was shining as bright as lightning . his clothes were as white as snow .
the soldiers guarding the tomb were very afraid of the angel . they shook with fear and then became like dead men .
but he is not here . he has risen from death , as he said he would . come and see the place where his body was .
so the women left the tomb quickly . they were afraid , but they were also very happy . they ran to tell his followers what happened .
then jesus said to them , “ don ’ t be afraid . go tell my followers to go to galilee . they will see me there . ”
then the priests met with the older jewish leaders and made a plan . they paid the soldiers a lot of money
and said to them , “ tell the people that jesus ’ followers came during the night and stole the body while you were sleeping .
if the governor hears about this , we will talk to him and keep you out of trouble . ”
so the soldiers kept the money and obeyed the priests . and that story is still spread among the jews even today .
the eleven followers went to galilee , to the mountain where jesus told them to go .
on the mountain the followers saw jesus . they worshiped him . but some of the followers did not believe that it was really jesus .
so he came to them and said , “ all authority in heaven and on earth is given to me .
so go and make followers of all people in the world . baptize them in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit .
listen , all you people !
see , the lord is leaving his place
the mountains will melt under him
this will happen because of jacob ’ s sin ,
so i will change samaria into a pile of rocks in the field ,
all her idols will be broken to pieces .
i will be very sad about what will happen .
samaria ’ s wound can not be healed .
don ’ t tell it in gath .
you people living in shaphir ,
the people living in maroth
you people living in lachish ,
so you must give goodbye gifts
you people who live in mareshah ,
so cut off your hair , make yourself bald ,
trouble will come to those who make plans to sin .
they want fields , so they take them .
that is why the lord says :
then people will sing songs about you .
so we will not be able to measure the land
the people say , “ don ’ t prophesy to us .
but people of jacob ,
but you attack my people like enemies .
you have taken nice houses
get up and leave !
these people don ’ t want to listen to me .
yes , people of jacob , i will bring all of you together .
the “ one who breaks through walls ” will push through and walk to the front of his people .
then i said , “ listen , leaders of jacob and officers of the nation of israel !
but you hate good and love evil .
you are destroying my people .
then you will pray to the lord ,
some false prophets are telling lies to the lord ’ s people . this is what the lord says about them :
“ this is why it is like night for you
the seers are ashamed .
but the lord ’ s spirit has filled me
leaders of jacob and rulers of israel , listen to me !
you build zion by murdering people .
the judges in jerusalem accept bribes
leaders , because of you , zion will be destroyed .
in the last days the mountain of the lord ’ s temple
people from many nations will go there and say ,
then god will act as judge to end arguments between people in many places .
they will sit under their own
all the people from other nations follow their own gods ,
“ the people of that ‘ crippled ’ city
and you , tower of flocks ,
now , why are you crying so loudly ?
cry out , you people of jerusalem , and feel the pain ,
many nations have come to fight against you .
they have their plans ,
“ people of jerusalem , get up and crush them !
now strong city , gather your soldiers !
but you , bethlehem ephrathah ,
the lord will let his people be defeated
he will begin to rule israel in the power of the lord .
he will bring a time of peace .
with swords in hand our leaders will defeat the assyrians
but those from jacob who are still living and scattered among the nations
those from jacob who are still living
you will lift your hand against your enemies ,
i will destroy the cities in your country .
you will no longer try to do magic .
i will destroy your statues of false gods .
i will destroy the asherah poles
some nations will not listen to me ,
now hear what the lord says :
the lord has a complaint against his people .
he says , “ my people , tell me what i did !
i will tell you what i did .
my people , remember the evil plans of balak king of moab .
what must i bring when i come to meet with the lord ?
will the lord be pleased with a thousand rams
human , the lord has told you what goodness is .
the lord shouts to the city :
do the wicked still hide treasures
some people carry special weights
the rich in that city are still cruel .
so i have begun to punish you .
you will eat , but you will not become full .
you will plant your seeds ,
this is because you obey the laws of omri .
i am upset because i am like fruit that has been gathered ,
by this i mean that all the faithful people are gone .
people are good at doing bad things with both hands .
even the best of them is as crooked
don ’ t trust your neighbor
your enemies will be the people in your own house .
so i will look to the lord for help .
i have fallen , but enemy , don ’ t laugh at me !
i sinned against the lord ,
my enemy said to me ,
the time will come when your walls will be rebuilt .
your people will come back to your land .
the land was ruined by the people
so rule your people with your rod .
i did many miracles when i took you out of egypt .
the nations will see those miracles ,
they will crawl in the dust like a snake .
there is no god like you .
he will come back and comfort us again .
god , please be true to jacob .
this book is the vision of nahum from elkosh . this is the sad message about the city of nineveh .
the lord is a jealous god .
the lord is patient ,
he will speak harshly to the sea , and it will become dry .
the lord will come ,
no one can stand against his great anger .
the lord is good .
but he will completely destroy his enemies .
why are you making plans against the lord ?
you will be destroyed completely
someone from nineveh is making evil plans against the lord .
this is what the lord said :
now i will set you free from the power of assyria .
king of assyria , the lord gave this command about you :
an enemy is coming to attack you ,
yes , the lord changed jacob ’ s pride .
the shields of his soldiers are red .
the chariots race wildly through the streets
the enemy calls for his best soldiers .
but the gates by the rivers are open ,
the enemy takes away the queen ,
nineveh is like a pool whose water
now nineveh is empty .
where is that great city now ?
the lion was able to catch plenty of food
the lord all-powerful says ,
it will be very bad for that city of murderers .
you can hear the sounds of whips
soldiers on horses are attacking ,
all this happened because of nineveh .
the lord all-powerful says ,
i will throw dirty things on you
everyone who sees you will be shocked .
ethiopia and egypt made thebes strong . libya and the sudan supported her ,
so , nineveh , you will also fall like a drunk . you will try to hide . you will look for a safe place away from the enemy .
then i prayed this prayer :
we israelites have been very bad to you . we have not obeyed the commands , rules , and laws you gave your servant moses .
“ the israelites are your servants and your people . you used your great power and rescued them .
so the king asked me , “ are you sick ? why do you look sad ? i think your heart is full of sadness . ”
then the king said to me , “ what do you want me to do ? ”
the king and the queen who was sitting next to him asked me , “ how long will your trip take ? when will you get back here ? ”
sanballat from horon and tobiah the ammonite official heard about what i was doing . they were very upset and angry that someone had come to help the israelites .
so i went up the valley in the dark , inspecting the wall . finally , i turned back and went back in through the valley gate .
the men from jericho built the wall next to the priests . and zaccur son of a man named imri built the wall next to the men of jericho .
meremoth son of uriah repaired the next section of the wall . ( uriah was the son of hakkoz . )
the men from tekoa repaired the next section of the wall , but the leaders from tekoa refused to work for nehemiah their governor .
rephaiah son of hur repaired the next section of the wall . rephaiah was the governor of half of jerusalem .
malkijah son of harim and hasshub son of pahath-moab repaired the next section . they also repaired oven tower .
shallum son of hallohesh repaired the next section of the wall . his daughters helped him . shallum was the governor of the other half of jerusalem .
their brothers repaired the next section . they worked under binnui son of henadad . binnui was the governor of the other half of the district of keilah .
the next section of walls was repaired by the priests who lived in that area .
binnui son of henadad repaired the section of wall from azariah ’ s house to the bend in the wall and then to the corner .
the temple servants lived on ophel hill . they repaired the next section all the way to the east side of the water gate and the tower near it .
the men from tekoa repaired the rest of that section from the big tower all the way to the ophel wall .
the priests repaired the section over the horse gate . each priest repaired the wall in front of his own house .
hananiah son of shelemiah and hanun son of zalaph repaired the rest of that section of wall . ( hanun was zalaph ’ s sixth son . )
the goldsmiths and the merchants repaired the section of wall from that corner to the sheep gate .
when sanballat heard that we were building the wall of jerusalem , he was very angry and upset . he started making fun of the jews .
don ’ t take away their guilt or forgive the sins they have done in your sight . they have insulted and discouraged the builders . ”
but we prayed to our god . and we put guards on the walls to watch day and night so that we could be ready to meet them .
the builders and their helpers had their tools in one hand and a weapon in the other hand .
each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked . the man who blew the trumpet to warn the people stayed next to me .
so if you hear the trumpet , run to that place . we will all meet together there , and our god will fight for us ! ”
many of the poor people began to complain against their fellow jews .
some of them were saying , “ we have many children . we must get some grain if we are going to eat and stay alive . ”
other people were saying , “ this is a time of famine . we have to use our fields , vineyards , and homes to pay for grain . ”
when i heard their complaints , i was very angry .
also , i regularly fed 150 jews who were always welcome at my table , and i fed those who came to us from the nations around us .
my god , remember all the good i have done for these people .
sanballat and geshem sent the same message to me four times , and i sent the same answer back to them each time .
then , the fifth time , sanballat sent his helper to me with the same message . and he had a letter in his hand that was not sealed .
this is what the letter said :
and the rumor is that you have chosen prophets to announce this about you in jerusalem : ‘ there is a king in judah ! ’
so i sent this answer back to sanballat : “ nothing you are saying is happening . you are just making all that up in your own head . ”
i knew that god had not sent shemaiah . i knew that he had prophesied against me because tobiah and sanballat had paid him to do that .
so the wall of jerusalem was completed on the 25th day of the month of elul . it had taken 52 days to finish building the wall .
also in those days after the wall had been completed , the rich people of judah were sending many letters to tobiah , and he was answering their letters .
now the city was large and there was plenty of room . but there were few people in it , and the houses had not yet been rebuilt .

the family leaders gave 375 pounds of gold to the treasury to support the work . they also gave 2750 pounds of silver .
all together the other people gave 375 pounds of gold , 2500 pounds of silver , and 67 pieces of clothing for the priests .
those people who were true israelites separated themselves from foreigners . the israelites stood and confessed their sins and the sins of their ancestors .
you are the lord ,
you saw he was true and loyal to you ,
you saw our ancestors suffering in egypt
you showed the miracles to pharaoh .
you split the red sea in front of them ,
with the tall cloud , you led them by day ,
then you came down to mount sinai .
you told them about your special day of rest—the sabbath .
but our ancestors became proud and stubborn .
they refused to listen .
you didn ’ t leave them even when they made golden calves and said ,
you are very kind ,
you gave them your good spirit to make them wise .
you took care of them for 40 years .
you gave them kingdoms and nations ,
