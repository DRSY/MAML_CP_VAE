0	“ then people will see the son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory .
0	he will send his angels all around the earth . they will gather his chosen people from every part of the earth .
0	in the same way , when you see all these things happening , you will know that the time is very near , already present .
0	i assure you that all these things will happen while some of the people of this time are still living .
0	the whole world , earth and sky , will be destroyed , but my words will last forever .
0	be careful ! always be ready . you don ’ t know when that time will be .
0	if you are always ready , he will not find you sleeping , even if he comes back earlier than expected .
0	i tell you this , and i say it to everyone : ‘ be ready ! ’ ”
0	they said , “ but we can not arrest jesus during the festival . we don ’ t want the people to be angry and cause a riot . ”
0	some of the followers there saw this . they were upset and complained to each other . they said , “ why waste that perfume ?
0	jesus said , “ leave her alone . why are you giving her such trouble ? she did a very good thing for me .
0	you will always have the poor with you , and you can help them any time you want . but you will not always have me .
0	this woman did the only thing she could do for me . she poured perfume on my body before i die to prepare it for burial .
0	then judas iscariot , one of the twelve apostles , went to talk to the leading priests about handing jesus over to them .
0	they were very happy about this , and they promised to pay him . so he waited for the best time to hand jesus over to them .
0	the owner will show you a large room upstairs that is ready for us . prepare the meal for us there . ”
0	so the followers left and went into the city . everything happened the way jesus said . so the followers prepared the passover meal .
0	in the evening jesus went to that house with the twelve apostles .
0	the followers were very sad to hear this . each one said to jesus , “ surely i am not the one ! ”
0	jesus answered , “ it is one of you twelve—the one who is dipping his bread in the same bowl with me .
0	then he took a cup of wine , thanked god for it , and gave it to them . they all drank from the cup .
0	then he said , “ this wine is my blood , which will be poured out for many to begin the new agreement from god to his people .
0	they all sang a song and then went out to the mount of olives .
0	then jesus told the followers , “ you will all lose your faith . the scriptures say ,
0	but after i am killed , i will rise from death . then i will go to galilee . i will be there before you come . ”
0	peter said , “ all the other followers may lose their faith . but my faith will never be shaken . ”
0	jesus and his followers went to a place named gethsemane . he said to them , “ sit here while i pray . ”
0	but he told peter , james , and john to come with him . he began to be very distressed and troubled ,
0	and he said to them , “ my heart is so heavy with grief , i feel as if i am dying . wait here and stay awake . ”
0	stay awake and pray for strength against temptation . your spirit wants to do what is right , but your body is weak . ”
0	again jesus went away and prayed the same thing .
0	then he went back to the followers and again found them sleeping . they could not stay awake . they did not know what they should say to him .
0	stand up ! we must go . here comes the man who is handing me over to them . ”
0	so judas went over to jesus and said , “ teacher ! ” then he kissed him .
0	the men grabbed jesus and arrested him .
0	then jesus said , “ why do you come to get me with swords and clubs as if i were a criminal ?
0	then all of jesus ’ followers left him and ran away .
0	one of those following jesus was a young man wearing only a linen cloth . when the people tried to grab him ,
0	he left the cloth in their hands and ran away naked .
0	many people came and told lies against jesus , but they all said different things . none of them agreed .
0	then some others stood up and told more lies against jesus . they said ,
0	but also what these people said did not agree .
0	but jesus said nothing to answer him .
0	when the high priest heard this , he tore his clothes in anger . he said , “ we don ’ t need any more witnesses !
0	you all heard these insults to god . what do you think ? ”
0	while peter was still in the yard , a servant girl of the high priest came there .
0	she saw him warming himself by the fire . she looked closely at him and said , “ you were with jesus , that man from nazareth . ”
0	when the servant girl saw him there , she began saying again to the people standing around , “ this man is one of them . ”
0	again peter said it was not true .
0	then peter began to curse . he said , “ i swear to god , i don ’ t know this man you are talking about ! ”
0	pilate asked jesus , “ are you the king of the jews ? ”
0	the leading priests accused jesus of many things .
0	but jesus still did not answer , and this really surprised pilate .
0	every year at the passover time the governor would free one prisoner—whichever one the people wanted .
0	there was a man in prison at that time named barabbas . he and the rebels with him had been put in prison for committing murder during a riot .
0	the people came to pilate and asked him to free a prisoner as he always did .
0	pilate asked them , “ do you want me to free the king of the jews ? ”
0	pilate knew that the leading priests had handed jesus over to him because they were jealous of him .
0	but the leading priests persuaded the people to ask pilate to free barabbas , not jesus .
0	pilate asked the people again , “ so what should i do with this man you call the king of the jews ? ”
0	the people shouted , “ kill him on a cross ! ”
0	pilate asked , “ why ? what wrong has he done ? ”
0	pilate ’ s soldiers took jesus into the governor ’ s palace ( called the praetorium ) . they called all the other soldiers together .
0	they put a purple robe on jesus , made a crown from thorny branches , and put it on his head .
0	then they began shouting , “ welcome , king of the jews ! ”
0	they kept on beating his head with a stick and spitting on him . then they bowed down on their knees and pretended to honor him as a king .
0	they led jesus to the place called golgotha . ( golgotha means “ the place of the skull . ” )
0	there they gave him some wine mixed with myrrh , but he refused to drink it .
0	the soldiers nailed jesus to a cross . then they divided his clothes among themselves , throwing dice to see who would get what .
0	it was nine o ’ clock in the morning when they nailed jesus to the cross .
0	there was a sign with the charge against him written on it . it said , “ the king of the jews . ”
0	they also nailed two criminals to crosses beside jesus—one on the right and the other on the left .
0	so save yourself ! come down from that cross ! ”
0	at noon the whole country became dark . this darkness continued until three o ’ clock .
0	some of the people standing there heard this . they said , “ listen ! he is calling elijah . ”
0	then jesus cried out loudly and died .
0	when jesus died , the curtain in the temple was torn into two pieces . the tear started at the top and tore all the way to the bottom .
0	these were the women who had followed jesus in galilee and cared for him . many other women who had come with jesus to jerusalem were also there .
0	this day was called preparation day . ( that means the day before the sabbath day . ) it was becoming dark .
0	pilate was surprised to hear that jesus was already dead . so he called for the army officer in charge and asked him if jesus was already dead .
0	when pilate heard it from the officer , he told joseph he could have the body .
0	mary magdalene and mary the mother of joses saw the place where jesus was put .
0	the next day after the sabbath day , mary magdalene , salome , and mary the mother of james bought some sweet-smelling spices to put on jesus ’ body .
0	very early on that day , the first day of the week , the women were going to the tomb . it was very early after sunrise .
0	the women said to each other , “ there is a large stone covering the entrance of the tomb . who will move the stone for us ? ”
0	then the women looked and saw that the stone was moved . the stone was very large , but it was moved away from the entrance .
0	the women were very afraid and confused . they left the tomb and ran away . they did not tell about what happened , because they were afraid .
0	after mary saw jesus , she went and told his followers . they were very sad and were crying .
0	but mary told them that jesus was alive . she said that she had seen jesus , but they did not believe her .
0	later , jesus appeared to two followers while they were walking in the country . but jesus did not look the same as before he was killed .
0	these followers went back to the other followers and told them what happened . again , the followers did not believe them .
0	he said to them , “ go everywhere in the world . tell the good news to everyone .
0	whoever believes and is baptized will be saved . but those who do not believe will be judged guilty .
0	after the lord jesus said these things to his followers , he was carried up into heaven . there , jesus sat at the right side of god .
0	this is the family history of jesus the messiah . he came from the family of david , who was from the family of abraham .
0	abraham was the father of isaac .
0	judah was the father of perez and zerah . ( their mother was tamar . )
0	ram was the father of amminadab .
0	salmon was the father of boaz . ( his mother was rahab . )
0	jesse was the father of king david .
0	solomon was the father of rehoboam .
0	asa was the father of jehoshaphat .
0	uzziah was the father of jotham .
0	hezekiah was the father of manasseh .
0	josiah was the grandfather of jehoiachin and his brothers , who lived during the time that the people were taken away to babylon .
0	after they were taken to babylon :
0	zerubbabel was the father of abiud .
0	azor was the father of zadok .
0	eliud was the father of eleazar .
0	jacob was the father of joseph .
0	mary ’ s husband , joseph , was a good man . he did not want to cause her public disgrace , so he planned to divorce her secretly .
0	she will give birth to a son . you will name him jesus . give him that name because he will save his people from their sins . ”
0	all this happened to make clear the full meaning of what the lord said through the prophet :
0	“ the virgin will be pregnant and will give birth to a son . they will name him immanuel. ” ( immanuel means “ god with us . ” )
0	when joseph woke up , he did what the lord ’ s angel told him to do . he married mary .
0	but joseph did not have sexual relations with her until her son was born . and he named him jesus .
0	when king herod heard about this , it upset him as well as everyone else in jerusalem .
0	herod called a meeting of all the leading jewish priests and teachers of the law . he asked them where the messiah would be born .
0	they answered , “ in the town of bethlehem in judea , just as the prophet wrote :
0	‘ bethlehem , in the land of judah ,
0	then herod had a private meeting with the wise men from the east . he learned from them the exact time they first saw the star .
0	they were very happy and excited to see the star .
0	but god warned the wise men in a dream not to go back to herod . so they went home to their own country a different way .
0	so joseph got ready and left for egypt with the child and the mother . they left during the night .
0	this gave full meaning to what god said through the prophet jeremiah :
0	“ a sound was heard in ramah—
0	while joseph was in egypt , herod died . an angel from the lord came to joseph in a dream
0	so joseph took the child and the mother and went to israel .
0	when it was the right time , john the baptizer began telling people a message from god . this was out in the desert area of judea .
0	john said , “ change your hearts and lives , because god ’ s kingdom is now very near . ”
0	john is the one isaiah the prophet was talking about when he said ,
0	people came to john from jerusalem and the rest of judea and from all the areas along the jordan river .
0	they confessed the bad things they had done , and john baptized them in the jordan .
0	change your hearts ! and show by the way you live that you have changed .
0	the ax is now ready to cut down the trees . every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire .
0	then jesus came from galilee to the jordan river . he came to john , wanting john to baptize him .
0	but john tried to stop him . john said , “ why do you come to me to be baptized ? i should be baptized by you ! ”
0	jesus answered , “ let it be this way for now . we should do whatever god says is right. ” then john agreed .
0	a voice from heaven said , “ this is my son , the one i love . i am very pleased with him . ”
0	then the spirit led jesus into the desert . he was taken there to be tempted by the devil .
0	jesus ate nothing for 40 days and nights . after this , he was very hungry .
0	the devil came to tempt him and said , “ if you are the son of god , tell these rocks to become bread . ”
0	jesus answered him , “ the scriptures say ,
0	then the devil led jesus to the holy city of jerusalem and put him on a high place at the edge of the temple area .
0	he said to jesus , “ if you are the son of god , jump off , because the scriptures say ,
0	jesus answered , “ the scriptures also say , ‘ you must not test the lord your god . ’ ”
0	then the devil led jesus to the top of a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and all the wonderful things in them .
0	the devil said , “ if you will bow down and worship me , i will give you all these things . ”
0	jesus said to him , “ get away from me , satan ! the scriptures say ,
0	so the devil left him . then some angels came to jesus and helped him .
0	jesus heard that john was put in prison , so he went back to galilee .
0	but he did not stay in nazareth . he went to live in capernaum , a town near lake galilee in the area near zebulun and naphtali .
0	he did this to give full meaning to what the prophet isaiah said :
0	“ listen , land of zebulun and land of naphtali ,
0	the people who live in spiritual darkness
0	from that time jesus began to tell people his message : “ change your hearts and lives , because god ’ s kingdom is now very near . ”
0	simon and andrew immediately left their nets and followed him .
0	so they immediately left the boat and their father , and they followed jesus .
0	large crowds followed him—people from galilee , the ten towns , jerusalem , judea , and the area across the jordan river .
0	when jesus saw the crowds of people there , he went up on a hill and sat down . his followers came and sat next to him .
0	then jesus began teaching the people . he said ,
0	“ great blessings belong to those who know they are spiritually in need .
0	great blessings belong to those who are sad now .
0	great blessings belong to those who are humble .
0	great blessings belong to those who want to do right more than anything else .
0	great blessings belong to those who show mercy to others .
0	great blessings belong to those whose thoughts are pure .
0	great blessings belong to those who work to bring peace .
0	great blessings belong to those who suffer persecution for doing what is right .
0	“ you are the light that shines for the world to see . you are like a city built on a hill that can not be hidden .
0	people don ’ t hide a lamp under a bowl . they put it on a lampstand . then the light shines for everyone in the house .
0	“ so , what if you are offering your gift at the altar and remember that someone has something against you ?
0	leave your gift there and go make peace with that person . then come and offer your gift .
0	i assure you that you will not leave there until you have paid everything you owe .
0	“ you have heard that it was said , ‘ you must not commit adultery . ’
0	“ it was also said , ‘ any man who divorces his wife must give her a written notice of divorce . ’
0	“ you have heard that it was said , ‘ an eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . ’
0	if anyone wants to sue you in court and take your shirt , let them have your coat too .
0	if a soldier forces you to walk with him one mile , go with him two .
0	give to anyone who asks you for something . don ’ t refuse to give to anyone who wants to borrow from you .
0	“ you have heard that it was said , ‘ love your neighbor and hate your enemy . ’
0	but i tell you , love your enemies . pray for those who treat you badly .
0	if you love only those who love you , why should you get a reward for that ? even the tax collectors do that .
0	what i am saying is that you must be perfect , just as your father in heaven is perfect .
0	so when you give to the poor , don ’ t let anyone know what you are doing .
0	your giving should be done in private . your father can see what is done in private , and he will reward you .
0	don ’ t be like them . your father knows what you need before you ask him .
0	so this is how you should pray :
0	we pray that your kingdom will come—
0	give us the food we need for today .
0	don ’ t let us be tempted ,
0	yes , if you forgive others for the wrongs they do to you , then your father in heaven will also forgive your wrongs .
0	but if you don ’ t forgive others , then your father in heaven will not forgive the wrongs you do .
0	so when you fast , wash your face and make yourself look nice .
0	“ don ’ t save treasures for yourselves here on earth . moths and rust will destroy them . and thieves can break into your house and steal them .
0	instead , save your treasures in heaven , where they can not be destroyed by moths or rust and where thieves can not break in and steal them .
0	your heart will be where your treasure is .
0	you can not add any time to your life by worrying about it .
0	but i tell you that even solomon , the great and rich king , was not dressed as beautifully as one of these flowers .
0	so don ’ t worry about tomorrow . each day has enough trouble of its own . tomorrow will have its own worries .
0	“ don ’ t judge others , and god will not judge you .
0	if you judge others , you will be judged the same way you judge them . god will treat you the same way you treat others .
0	yes , whoever continues to ask will receive . whoever continues to look will find . and whoever continues to knock will have the door opened for them .
0	“ do any of you have a son ? if he asked for bread , would you give him a rock ?
0	or if he asked for a fish , would you give him a snake ? of course not !
0	“ do for others what you would want them to do for you . this is the meaning of the law of moses and the teaching of the prophets .
0	“ be careful of false prophets . they come to you and look gentle like sheep . but they are really dangerous like wolves .
0	in the same way , every good tree produces good fruit , and bad trees produce bad fruit .
0	a good tree can not produce bad fruit , and a bad tree can not produce good fruit .
0	every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
0	you will know these false people by what they do .
0	then i will tell those people clearly , ‘ get away from me , you people who do wrong . i never knew you . ’
0	“ whoever hears these teachings of mine and obeys them is like a wise man who built his house on rock .
0	it rained hard , the floods came , and the winds blew and beat against that house . but it did not fall because it was built on rock .
0	“ whoever hears these teachings of mine and does not obey them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand .
0	it rained hard , the floods came , and the winds blew and beat against that house . and it fell with a loud crash . ”
0	when jesus finished speaking , the people were amazed at his teaching .
0	he did not teach like their teachers of the law . he taught like someone who has authority .
0	jesus came down from the hill , and a large crowd followed him .
0	jesus touched the man . he said , “ i want to heal you . be healed ! ” immediately the man was healed from his leprosy .
0	jesus went to the city of capernaum . when he entered the city , an army officer came to him and begged for help .
0	the officer said , “ lord , my servant is very sick at home in bed . he can ’ t move his body and has much pain . ”
0	jesus said to the officer , “ i will go and heal him . ”
0	then jesus said to the officer , “ go home . your servant will be healed the way you believed he would. ” right then his servant was healed .
0	jesus went to peter ’ s house . he saw that peter ’ s mother-in-law was in bed with a high fever .
0	he touched her hand , and the fever left her . then she stood up and began to serve him .
0	so jesus made clear the full meaning of what isaiah the prophet said :
0	when jesus saw the crowd around him , he told his followers to go to the other side of the lake .
0	then a teacher of the law came to him and said , “ teacher , i will follow you any place you go . ”
0	another of jesus ’ followers said to him , “ lord , i will follow you too , but let me go and bury my father first . ”
0	but jesus said to him , “ follow me , and let those who are dead bury their own dead . ”
0	jesus got into a boat , and his followers went with him .
0	after the boat left the shore , a very bad storm began on the lake . the waves covered the boat . but jesus was sleeping .
0	the followers went to him and woke him . they said , “ lord , save us ! we will drown ! ”
0	the men were amazed . they said , “ what kind of man is this ? even the wind and the water obey him ! ”
0	near that place there was a large herd of pigs feeding .
0	the demons begged jesus , “ if you make us leave these men , please send us into that herd of pigs . ”
0	then the whole town went out to see jesus . when the people saw him , they begged him to leave their area .
0	jesus got into a boat and went back across the lake to his own town .
0	jesus knew what they were thinking . so he said , “ why are you thinking such evil thoughts ?
0	the man stood up and went home .
0	the people saw this and they were amazed . they praised god for letting someone have such power .
0	jesus ate dinner at matthew ’ s house . many tax collectors and others with bad reputations came and ate with him and his followers .
0	the pharisees saw that jesus was eating with these people . they asked his followers , “ why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and other sinners ? ”
0	jesus heard them say this . so he said to them , “ it is the sick people who need a doctor , not those who are healthy .
0	so jesus and his followers went with the man .
0	on the way , there was a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years . she came close behind jesus and touched the bottom of his coat .
0	she was thinking , “ if i can touch his coat , i will be healed . ”
0	jesus said , “ go away . the girl is not dead . she is only sleeping. ” but the people laughed at him .
0	the news about this spread all around the area .
0	as jesus was going away from there , two blind men followed him . they said loudly , “ show kindness to us , son of david . ”
0	then jesus touched their eyes and said , “ you believe that i can make you see again , so it will happen . ”
0	then the men were able to see . jesus gave them a strong warning . he said , “ don ’ t tell anyone about this . ”
0	but they left and spread the news about jesus all around that area .
0	as these two men were leaving , some people brought another man to jesus . this man could not talk because he had a demon inside him .
0	but the pharisees said , “ the ruler of demons is the one that gives him power to force demons out . ”
0	jesus saw the many people and felt sorry for them because they were worried and helpless—like sheep without a shepherd to lead them .
0	god owns the harvest . ask him to send more workers to help gather his harvest . ”
0	jesus called his twelve followers together . he gave them power over evil spirits and power to heal every kind of disease and sickness .
0	these are the names of the twelve apostles :
0	simon , the zealot ,
0	but go to the people of israel . they are like sheep that are lost .
0	when you go , tell them this : ‘ god ’ s kingdom is now very near . ’
0	don ’ t carry any money with you—gold or silver or copper .
0	“ when you enter a city or town , find some worthy person there and stay in his home until you leave .
0	when you enter that home , say , ‘ peace be with you . ’
0	i can assure you that on the judgment day it will be worse for that town than for the people of sodom and gomorrah .
0	be careful ! there are people who will arrest you and take you to be judged . they will whip you in their synagogues .
0	it will not really be you speaking ; the spirit of your father will be speaking through you .
0	everyone will hate you because you follow me . but the one who remains faithful to the end will be saved .
0	“ students are not better than their teacher . servants are not better than their master .
0	“ so don ’ t be afraid of those people . everything that is hidden will be shown . everything that is secret will be made known .
0	i tell you all this secretly , but i want you to tell it publicly . whatever i tell you privately , you should shout for everyone to hear .
0	when birds are sold , two small birds cost only a penny . but not even one of those little birds can die without your father knowing it .
0	god even knows how many hairs are on your head .
0	so don ’ t be afraid . you are worth more than a whole flock of birds .
0	“ if you stand before others and are willing to say you believe in me , then i will tell my father in heaven that you belong to me .
0	“ do not think that i have come to bring peace to the earth . i did not come to bring peace . i came to bring trouble .
0	i have come to make this happen :
0	even members of your own family will be your enemies . ’
0	those who will not accept the cross that is given to them when they follow me are not worthy of me .
0	those who try to keep the life they have will lose it . but those who give up their life for me will find true life .
0	“ whoever accepts you also accepts me . and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me .
0	when john was in prison , he heard about the things that were happening—things the messiah would do . so he sent some of his followers to jesus .
0	they asked him , “ are you the one we have been expecting , or should we wait for someone else ? ”
0	jesus answered , “ go tell john what you have heard and seen :
0	great blessings belong to those who don ’ t have a problem accepting me . ”
0	so what did you go out to see ? a prophet ? yes , john is a prophet . but i tell you , he is more than that .
0	this scripture was written about him :
0	before john came , the law of moses and all the prophets told about the things that would happen .
0	and if you believe what they said , then john is elijah . he is the one they said would come .
0	you people who hear me , listen !
0	‘ we played flute music for you ,
0	then jesus criticized the cities where he did most of his miracles . he criticized these cities because the people there did not change their lives and stop sinning .
0	but i tell you , on the day of judgment it will be worse for you than for tyre and sidon .
0	but i tell you , it will be worse for you in the day of judgment than for sodom . ”
0	yes , father , you did this because it ’ s what you really wanted to do .
0	“ come to me all of you who are tired from the heavy burden you have been forced to carry . i will give you rest .
0	accept my teaching . learn from me . i am gentle and humble in spirit . and you will be able to get some rest .
0	yes , the teaching that i ask you to accept is easy . the load i give you to carry is light . ”
0	jesus said to them , “ you have read what david did when he and those with him were hungry .
0	i tell you that there is something here that is greater than the temple .
0	“ the son of man is lord over the sabbath day . ”
0	jesus went from there to their synagogue .
0	surely a man is more important than a sheep . so it is right to do good on the sabbath day . ”
0	but the pharisees left and made plans to kill jesus .
0	jesus knew what the pharisees were planning . so he left that place , and many people followed him . he healed all who were sick ,
0	but he warned them not to tell others who he was .
0	this was to give full meaning to what isaiah the prophet said when he spoke for god :
0	“ here is my servant ,
0	he will not argue or shout ;
0	he will not break off even a bent stem of grass .
0	all people will hope in him . ”
0	all the people were amazed at what jesus did . they said , “ maybe he is the promised son of david ! ”
0	so if satan forces out his own demons , then he is fighting against himself , and his kingdom will not survive .
0	but i use the power of god ’ s spirit to force out demons , and this shows that god ’ s kingdom has come to you .
0	whoever wants to enter a strong man ’ s house and steal his things must first tie him up . then they can steal the things from his house .
0	whoever is not with me is against me . and anyone who does not work with me is working against me .
0	you snakes ! you are so evil . how can you say anything good ? what people say with their mouths comes from what fills their hearts .
0	i tell you that everyone will have to answer for all the careless things they have said . this will happen on the day of judgment .
0	your words will be used to judge you . what you have said will show whether you are right or whether you are guilty . ”
0	“ when an evil spirit comes out of a person , it travels through dry places looking for a place to rest , but it finds none .
0	while jesus was talking to the people , his mother and brothers stood outside . they wanted to talk to him .
0	someone told him , “ your mother and brothers are waiting for you outside . they want to talk to you . ”
0	jesus answered , “ who is my mother ? who are my brothers ? ”
0	then he pointed to his followers and said , “ see ! these people are my mother and my brothers .
0	yes , anyone who does what my father in heaven wants is my true brother and sister and mother . ”
0	that same day jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake .
0	a large crowd gathered around him . so he got into a boat and sat down . all the people stayed on the shore .
0	then jesus used stories to teach them many things . he told them this story :
0	while he was scattering the seed , some of it fell by the road . the birds came and ate all that seed .
0	other seed fell on rocky ground , where there was not enough dirt . it grew very fast there , because the soil was not deep .
0	but when the sun rose , it burned the plants . the plants died because they did not have deep roots .
0	some other seed fell among thorny weeds . the weeds grew and stopped the good plants from growing .
0	you people who hear me , listen ! ”
0	the followers came to jesus and asked , “ why do you use these stories to teach the people ? ”
0	jesus answered , “ only you can know the secret truths about god ’ s kingdom . those other people can not know these secret truths .
0	so they show that what isaiah said about them is true :
0	yes , the minds of these people are now closed .
0	but god has blessed you . you understand what you see with your eyes . and you understand what you hear with your ears .
0	“ so listen to the meaning of that story about the farmer :
0	“ and what about the seed that fell on rocky ground ? that is like the people who hear the teaching and quickly and gladly accept it .
0	then jesus used another story to teach them . jesus said , “ god ’ s kingdom is like a man who planted good seed in his field .
0	that night , while everyone was asleep , the man ’ s enemy came and planted weeds among the wheat and then left .
0	later , the wheat grew , and heads of grain grew on the plants . but at the same time the weeds also grew .
0	then the man ’ s servants came to him and said , ‘ you planted good seed in your field . where did the weeds come from ? ’
0	“ the man answered , ‘ an enemy planted weeds . ’
0	“ he answered , ‘ no , because when you pull up the weeds , you might also pull up the wheat .
0	then jesus told the people another story : “ god ’ s kingdom is like a mustard seed that a man plants in his field .
0	jesus used stories to tell all these things to the people . he always used stories to teach them .
0	this was to make clear the full meaning of what the prophet said :
0	he answered , “ the man who planted the good seed in the field is the son of man .
0	the field is the world . the good seed are the people in god ’ s kingdom . the weeds are the people who belong to the evil one .
0	“ the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire . it will be the same at the end of time .
0	they will throw them into the place of fire . there the people will be crying and grinding their teeth with pain .
0	then the godly people will shine like the sun . they will be in the kingdom of their father . you people who hear me , listen !
0	“ also , god ’ s kingdom is like a merchant looking for fine pearls .
0	one day he found a very fine pearl . he went and sold everything he had to buy it .
0	“ also , god ’ s kingdom is like a net that was put into the lake . the net caught many different kinds of fish .
0	it will be the same at the end of time . the angels will come and separate the evil people from the godly people .
0	they will throw the evil people into the place of fire . there the people will cry and grind their teeth with pain . ”
0	then jesus asked his followers , “ do you understand all these things ? ”
0	when jesus finished teaching with these stories , he left there .
0	and don ’ t all his sisters still live here in town ? how is he able to do these things ? ”
0	so they had a problem accepting him .
0	jesus did not do many miracles there , because the people did not believe in him .
0	about that time , herod , the ruler of galilee , heard what the people were saying about jesus .
0	john had told him , “ it is not right for you to be married to herodias . ”
0	herod wanted to kill him , but he was afraid of the people . they believed that john was a prophet .
0	on herod ’ s birthday , the daughter of herodias danced for him and his group . herod was very pleased with her .
0	so he promised that he would give her anything she wanted .
0	herodias told her daughter what to ask for . so she said to herod , “ give me the head of john the baptizer here on this plate . ”
0	he sent men to the prison , where they cut off john ’ s head .
0	and the men brought john ’ s head on a plate and gave it to the girl . then she took the head to her mother , herodias .
0	john ’ s followers came and got his body and buried it . then they went and told jesus what happened .
0	jesus said , “ the people don ’ t need to go away . you give them some food to eat . ”
0	the followers answered , “ but we have only five loaves of bread and two fish . ”
0	jesus said , “ bring the bread and the fish to me . ”
0	everyone ate until they were full . when they finished eating , the followers filled twelve baskets with the pieces of food that were not eaten .
0	there were about 5000 men there who ate . there were also women and children who ate .
0	after jesus said goodbye to the people , he went up into the hills by himself to pray . it was late , and he was there alone .
0	when they saw him walking on the water , it scared them . “ it ’ s a ghost ! ” they said , screaming in fear .
0	but jesus quickly spoke to them . he said , “ don ’ t worry ! it ’ s me ! don ’ t be afraid . ”
0	peter said , “ lord , if that is really you , tell me to come to you on the water . ”
0	jesus said , “ come , peter . ”
0	then jesus caught peter with his hand . he said , “ your faith is small . why did you doubt ? ”
0	after peter and jesus were in the boat , the wind stopped .
0	then the followers in the boat worshiped jesus and said , “ you really are the son of god . ”
0	after they crossed the lake , they came to the shore at gennesaret .
0	they begged jesus to let them only touch the edge of his coat to be healed . and all the sick people who touched his coat were healed .
0	then some pharisees and teachers of the law came to jesus . they came from jerusalem and asked him ,
0	jesus answered , “ and why do you refuse to obey god ’ s command so that you can follow those traditions you have ?
0	you are hypocrites ! isaiah was right when he spoke for god about you :
0	‘ these people honor me with their words ,
0	their worship of me is worthless .
0	jesus called the people to him . he said , “ listen and understand what i am saying .
0	it is not what people put in their mouth that makes them wrong . it is what comes out of their mouth that makes them wrong . ”
0	then the followers came to jesus and asked , “ do you know that the pharisees are upset about what you said ? ”
0	jesus answered , “ every plant that my father in heaven has not planted will be pulled up by the roots .
0	peter said , “ explain to us what you said earlier to the people . ”
0	jesus said , “ do you still have trouble understanding ?
0	surely you know that all the food that enters the mouth goes into the stomach . then it goes out of the body .
0	but the bad things people say with their mouth come from the way they think . and that ’ s what can make people wrong .
0	all these bad things begin in the mind : evil thoughts , murder , adultery , sexual sins , stealing , lying , and insulting people .
0	these are the things that make people wrong . eating without washing their hands will never make people unacceptable to god . ”
0	jesus went from there to the area of tyre and sidon .
0	jesus answered , “ god sent me only to the lost people of israel . ”
0	then the woman came over to jesus and bowed before him . she said , “ lord , help me ! ”
0	he answered her with this saying : “ it is not right to take the children ’ s bread and give it to the dogs . ”
0	the woman said , “ yes , lord , but even the dogs eat the pieces of food that fall from their master ’ s table . ”
0	then jesus went from there to the shore of lake galilee . he went up on a hill and sat down .
0	the followers asked jesus , “ where can we get enough bread to feed all these people ? we are a long way from any town . ”
0	jesus asked , “ how many loaves of bread do you have ? ”
0	jesus told the people to sit on the ground .
0	all the people ate until they were full . after this , the followers filled seven baskets with the pieces of food that were not eaten .
0	there were about 4000 men there who ate . there were also some women and children .
0	after they all ate , jesus told the people they could go home . he got into the boat and went to the area of magadan .
0	the pharisees and sadducees came to jesus . they wanted to test him . so they asked him to show them a miracle as a sign from god .
0	jesus and his followers went across the lake . but the followers forgot to bring bread .
0	jesus said to the followers , “ be careful ! guard against the yeast of the pharisees and the sadducees . ”
0	the followers discussed the meaning of this . they said , “ did jesus say this because we forgot to bring bread ? ”
0	jesus knew that they were talking about this . so he asked them , “ why are you talking about not having bread ? your faith is small .
0	do you still not understand ? remember the five loaves of bread that fed the 5000 people and the many baskets you filled with the bread that was left ?
0	and remember the seven loaves of bread that fed the 4000 people and the many baskets you filled that time ?
0	jesus went to the area of caesarea philippi . he said to his followers , “ who do people say i am ? ”
0	then jesus said to his followers , “ and who do you say i am ? ”
0	simon peter answered , “ you are the messiah , the son of the living god . ”
0	jesus answered , “ you are blessed , simon son of jonah . no one taught you that . my father in heaven showed you who i am .
0	then jesus warned his followers not to tell anyone he was the messiah .
0	any of you who try to save the life you have will lose it . but you who give up your life for me will find true life .
0	it is worth nothing for you to have the whole world if you yourself are lost . you could never pay enough to buy back your life .
0	the son of man will come again with his father ’ s glory and with his angels . and he will reward everyone for what they have done .
0	believe me when i say that there are some people standing here who will see the son of man coming with his kingdom before they die . ”
0	six days later , jesus took peter , james , and john the brother of james and went up on a high mountain . they were all alone there .
0	while these followers watched him , jesus was changed . his face became bright like the sun , and his clothes became white as light .
0	then two men were there , talking with him . they were moses and elijah .
0	the followers with jesus heard this voice . they were very afraid , so they fell to the ground .
0	but jesus came to them and touched them . he said , “ stand up . don ’ t be afraid . ”
0	the followers looked up , and they saw that jesus was now alone .
0	the followers asked jesus , “ why do the teachers of the law say that elijah must come before the messiah comes ? ”
0	jesus answered , “ they are right to say elijah is coming . and it is true that elijah will make all things the way they should be .
0	then the followers understood that when jesus said elijah , he was really talking about john the baptizer .
0	jesus and the followers went back to the people . a man came to jesus and bowed before him .
0	i brought him to your followers , but they could not heal him . ”
0	jesus gave a strong command to the demon inside the boy . the demon came out of the boy , and the boy was healed .
0	later , the followers met together in galilee . jesus said to them , “ the son of man will be handed over to the control of other men ,
0	who will kill him . but on the third day he will be raised from death. ” the followers were very sad to hear that jesus would be killed .
0	peter answered , “ yes , he does . ”
0	peter answered , “ the other people pay the taxes . ”
0	about that time the followers came to jesus and asked , “ who is the greatest in god ’ s kingdom ? ”
0	jesus called a little child to come to him . he stood the child in front of the followers .
0	the greatest person in god ’ s kingdom is the one who makes himself humble like this child .
0	“ whoever accepts a little child like this in my name is accepting me .
0	and if he finds the lost sheep , he is happier about that one sheep than about the 99 sheep that were never lost . i can assure you ,
0	in the same way your father in heaven does not want any of these little children to be lost .
0	to say it another way , if two of you on earth agree on anything you pray for , my father in heaven will do what you ask .
0	yes , if two or three people are together believing in me , i am there with them . ”
0	“ so god ’ s kingdom is like a king who decided to collect the money his servants owed him .
0	the king began to collect his money . one servant owed him several thousand pounds of silver .
0	“ but the servant fell on his knees and begged , ‘ be patient with me . i will pay you everything i owe . ’
0	the master felt sorry for him . so he told the servant he did not have to pay . he let him go free .
0	“ the other servant fell on his knees and begged him , ‘ be patient with me . i will pay you everything i owe . ’
0	all the other servants saw what happened . they felt very sorry for the man . so they went and told their master everything that happened .
0	so you should have given that other man who serves with you the same mercy i gave you . ’
0	after jesus said all these things , he left galilee . he went into the area of judea on the other side of the jordan river .
0	many people followed him . jesus healed the sick people there .
0	jesus answered , “ surely you have read this in the scriptures : when god made the world , ‘ he made people male and female . ’
0	so they are no longer two , but one . god has joined them together , so no one should separate them . ”
0	the pharisees asked , “ then why did moses give a command allowing a man to divorce his wife by writing a certificate of divorce ? ”
0	jesus answered , “ moses allowed you to divorce your wives because you refused to accept god ’ s teaching . but divorce was not allowed in the beginning .
0	i tell you that whoever divorces his wife , except for the problem of sexual sin , and marries another woman is guilty of adultery . ”
0	the followers said to jesus , “ if that is the only reason a man can divorce his wife , it is better not to marry . ”
0	he answered , “ this statement is true for some , but not for everyone—only for those who have been given this gift .
0	after jesus blessed the children , he left there .
0	a man came to jesus and asked , “ teacher , what good thing must i do to have eternal life ? ”
0	the man asked , “ which ones ? ”
0	you must respect your father and mother , ’ and ‘ love your neighbor the same as you love yourself . ’ ”
0	the young man said , “ i have obeyed all these commands . what else do i need ? ”
0	then jesus said to his followers , “ the truth is , it will be very hard for a rich person to enter god ’ s kingdom .
0	the followers were amazed to hear this . they asked , “ then who can be saved ? ”
0	jesus looked at them and said , “ this is something that people can not do . but god can do anything . ”
0	peter said to him , “ we left everything we had and followed you . so what will we have ? ”
0	many people who are first now will be last in the future . and many who are last now will be first in the future .
0	he agreed to pay the workers one silver coin for working that day . then he sent them into the vineyard to work .
0	“ about nine o ’ clock the man went to the marketplace and saw some other people standing there . they were doing nothing .
0	so he said to them , ‘ if you go and work in my field , i will pay you what your work is worth . ’
0	so they went to work in the vineyard .
0	“ they said , ‘ no one gave us a job . ’
0	“ the workers who were hired at five o ’ clock came to get their pay . each worker got one silver coin .
0	when they got their silver coin , they complained to the man who owned the land .
0	so take your pay and go . i want to give the man who was hired last the same pay i gave you .
0	i can do what i want with my own money . why would you be jealous because i am generous ? ’
0	“ so those who are last now will be first in the future . and those who are first now will be last in the future . ”
0	then zebedee ’ s wife came to jesus and brought her sons . she bowed before jesus and asked him to do something for her .
0	jesus said , “ what do you want ? ”
0	the other ten followers heard this and were angry with the two brothers .
0	but it should not be that way with you . whoever wants to be your leader must be your servant .
0	whoever wants to be first must serve the rest of you like a slave .
0	when jesus and his followers were leaving jericho , a large crowd followed him .
0	jesus stopped and said to them , “ what do you want me to do for you ? ”
0	they answered , “ lord , we want to be able to see . ”
0	jesus felt sorry for the blind men . he touched their eyes , and immediately they were able to see . then they became followers of jesus .
0	if anyone asks you why you are taking the donkeys , tell them , ‘ the master needs them . he will send them back soon . ’ ”
0	this showed the full meaning of what the prophet said :
0	“ tell the people of zion ,
0	the followers went and did what jesus told them to do .
0	they brought the mother donkey and the young donkey to him . they covered the donkeys with their coats , and jesus sat on them .
0	on the way to jerusalem , many people spread their coats on the road for jesus . others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road .
0	some of the people were walking ahead of jesus . others were walking behind him . they all shouted ,
0	then jesus went into jerusalem . all the people in the city were confused . they asked , “ who is this man ? ”
0	the crowds following jesus answered , “ this is jesus . he is the prophet from the town of nazareth in galilee . ”
0	some blind people and some who were crippled came to jesus in the temple area . jesus healed them .
0	they asked jesus , “ do you hear what these children are saying ? ”
0	then jesus left them and went out of the city to bethany , where he spent the night .
0	early the next morning , jesus was going back to the city . he was very hungry .
0	when the followers saw this , they were very surprised . they asked , “ how did the fig tree dry up and die so quickly ? ”
0	if you believe , you will get anything you ask for in prayer . ”
0	tell me : when john baptized people , did his authority come from god , or was it only from other people ? ”
0	so they told jesus , “ we don ’ t know the answer . ”
0	“ the son answered , ‘ i will not go. ’ but later he decided he should go , and he went .
0	“ which of the two sons obeyed his father ? ”
0	later , it was time for the grapes to be picked . so the man sent his servants to the farmers to get his share of the grapes .
0	“ but the farmers grabbed the servants and beat one . they killed another one and then stoned to death a third servant .
0	so the man decided to send his son to the farmers . he said , ‘ the farmers will respect my son . ’
0	so the farmers took the son , threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him .
0	“ so what will the owner of the vineyard do to these farmers when he comes ? ”
0	jesus said to them , “ surely you have read this in the scriptures :
0	whoever falls on this stone will be broken . and it will crush anyone it falls on . ”
0	when the leading priests and the pharisees heard these stories , they knew that jesus was talking about them .
0	they wanted to find a way to arrest jesus . but they were afraid to do anything , because the people believed that jesus was a prophet .
0	jesus used some more stories to teach the people . he said ,
0	“ god ’ s kingdom is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son .
0	some of the other people grabbed the servants , beat them , and killed them .
0	the king was very angry . he sent his army to kill those who murdered his servants . and the army burned their city .
0	so go to the street corners and invite everyone you see . tell them to come to my feast . ’
0	“ when the king came in to meet the guests , he saw a man there who was not dressed in the right clothes for a wedding .
0	the king said , ‘ friend , how were you allowed to come in here ? you are not wearing the right clothes. ’ but the man said nothing .
0	“ yes , many people are invited . but only a few are chosen . ”
0	then the pharisees left the place where jesus was teaching . they made plans to catch him saying something wrong .
0	so tell us what you think . is it right to pay taxes to caesar or not ? ”
0	show me a coin used for paying the tax. ” they showed jesus a silver coin .
0	then he asked , “ whose picture is on the coin ? and whose name is written on the coin ? ”
0	they answered , “ it is caesar ’ s picture and caesar ’ s name . ”
0	when they heard what jesus said , they were amazed . they left him and went away .
0	that same day some sadducees came to jesus . ( sadducees believe that no one will rise from death . ) the sadducees asked jesus a question .
0	there were seven brothers among us . the first brother married but died . he had no children . so his brother married the woman .
0	then the second brother also died . the same thing happened to the third brother and all the other brothers .
0	the woman was the last to die .
0	but all seven men had married her . so when people rise from death , whose wife will she be ? ”
0	surely you have read what god said to you about people rising from death .
0	when the people heard this , they were amazed at jesus ’ teaching .
0	the pharisees learned that jesus had made the sadducees look so foolish that they stopped trying to argue with him . so the pharisees had a meeting .
0	then one of them , an expert in the law of moses , asked jesus a question to test him .
0	he said , “ teacher , which command in the law is the most important ? ”
0	jesus answered , “ ‘ love the lord your god with all your heart , all your soul , and all your mind . ’
0	this is the first and most important command .
0	and the second command is like the first : ‘ love your neighbor the same as you love yourself . ’
0	all of the law and the writings of the prophets take their meaning from these two commands . ”
0	so while the pharisees were together , jesus asked them a question .
0	he said , “ what do you think about the messiah ? whose son is he ? ”
0	jesus said to them , “ then why did david call him ‘ lord ’ ? david was speaking by the power of the spirit . he said ,
0	‘ the lord god said to my lord :
0	david calls the messiah ‘ lord. ’ so how can he be david ’ s son ? ”
0	none of the pharisees could answer jesus ’ question . and after that day , no one was brave enough to ask him any more questions .
0	then jesus spoke to the people and to his followers . he said ,
0	“ the teachers of the law and the pharisees have the authority to tell you what the law of moses says .
0	these men love to have the places of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues .
0	they love for people to show respect to them in the marketplaces and to call them ‘ teacher . ’
0	“ but you must not be called ‘ teacher. ’ you are all equal as brothers and sisters . you have only one teacher .
0	and don ’ t call anyone on earth ‘ father. ’ you have one father . he is in heaven .
0	and you should not be called ‘ master. ’ you have only one master , the messiah .
0	whoever serves you like a servant is the greatest among you .
0	people who think they are better than others will be made humble . but people who humble themselves will be made great .
0	whoever uses the altar to make a promise is really using the altar and everything on the altar .
0	and anyone who uses the temple to make a promise is really using the temple and god , who lives in it .
0	whoever uses heaven to make a promise is using god ’ s throne and the one who is seated on it .
0	pharisees , you are blind ! first make the inside of the cup clean and good . then the outside of the cup will also be clean .
0	it is the same with you . people look at you and think you are godly . but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and evil .
0	and you say , ‘ if we had lived during the time of our ancestors , we would not have helped them kill these prophets . ’
0	so you give proof that you are descendants of those who killed the prophets .
0	and you will finish the sin that your ancestors started !
0	believe me when i say that all these things will happen to you people who are living now .
0	now your house will be left completely empty .
0	jesus left the temple area and was walking away . but his followers came to him to show him the temple ’ s buildings .
0	jesus answered , “ be careful ! don ’ t let anyone fool you .
0	many people will come and use my name . they will say , ‘ i am the messiah. ’ and they will fool many people .
0	these things are only the beginning of troubles , like the first pains of a woman giving birth .
0	“ then you will be arrested and handed over to be punished and killed . people all over the world will hate you because you believe in me .
0	during that time many believers will lose their faith . they will turn against each other and hate each other .
0	many false prophets will come and cause many people to believe things that are wrong .
0	there will be so much more evil in the world that the love of most believers will grow cold .
0	but the one who remains faithful to the end will be saved .
0	“ the people in judea at that time should run away to the mountains .
0	if they are in the field , they must not go back to get a coat .
0	“ during that time it will be hard for women who are pregnant or have small babies !
0	pray that it will not be winter or a sabbath day when these things happen and you have to run away ,
0	false messiahs and false prophets will come and do great miracles and wonders , trying to fool the people god has chosen , if that is possible .
0	now i have warned you about this before it happens .
0	when the son of man comes , everyone will see him . it will be like lightning flashing in the sky that can be seen everywhere .
0	it ’ s like looking for a dead body : you will find it where the vultures are gathering above .
0	“ right after the trouble of those days , this will happen :
0	he will use a loud trumpet to send his angels all around the earth . they will gather his chosen people from every part of the earth .
0	in the same way , when you see all these things happening , you will know that the time is very near , already present .
0	i assure you that all these things will happen while some of the people of this time are still living .
0	the whole world , earth and sky , will be destroyed , but my words will last forever .
0	“ when the son of man comes , it will be the same as what happened during noah ’ s time .
0	they knew nothing about what was happening until the flood came and destroyed them all .
0	two men will be working together in the field . one will be taken and the other will be left .
0	two women will be grinding grain with a mill . one will be taken and the other will be left .
0	“ so always be ready . you don ’ t know the day your lord will come .
0	what would a homeowner do if he knew when a thief was coming ? you know he would be ready and not let the thief break in .
0	so you also must be ready . the son of man will come at a time when you don ’ t expect him .
0	when the master comes and finds that servant doing the work he gave him , it will be a day of blessing for that servant .
0	i can tell you without a doubt , the master will choose that servant to take care of everything he owns .
0	“ but what will happen if that servant is evil and thinks his master will not come back soon ?
0	he will begin to beat the other servants . he will eat and drink with others who are drunk .
0	then the master will come when the servant is not ready , at a time when the servant is not expecting him .
0	then the master will punish that servant . he will send him away to be with the hypocrites , where people will cry and grind their teeth with pain .
0	“ at that time god ’ s kingdom will be like ten girls who went to wait for the bridegroom . they took their lamps with them .
0	five of the girls were foolish , and five were wise .
0	the foolish girls took their lamps with them , but they did not take extra oil for the lamps .
0	the wise girls took their lamps and more oil in jars .
0	when the bridegroom was very late , the girls could not keep their eyes open , and they all fell asleep .
0	“ at midnight someone announced , ‘ the bridegroom is coming ! come and meet him ! ’
0	“ then all the girls woke up . they made their lamps ready .
0	but the foolish girls said to the wise girls , ‘ give us some of your oil . the oil in our lamps is all gone . ’
0	“ later , the other girls came . they said , ‘ sir , sir ! open the door to let us in . ’
0	“ but the bridegroom answered , ‘ certainly not ! i don ’ t even know you . ’
0	“ so always be ready . you don ’ t know the day or the time when the son of man will come .
0	the servant who got five bags went quickly to invest the money . those five bags of money earned five more .
0	it was the same with the servant who had two bags . that servant invested the money and earned two more .
0	“ after a long time the master came home . he asked the servants what they did with his money .
0	so i was afraid . i went and hid your money in the ground . here is the one bag of money you gave me . ’
0	“ so the master told his other servants , ‘ take the one bag of money from that servant and give it to the servant who has ten bags .
0	then the master said , ‘ throw that useless servant outside into the darkness , where people will cry and grind their teeth with pain . ’
0	he will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left .
0	when did we see you sick or in prison and care for you ? ’
0	“ then the king will answer , ‘ the truth is , anything you did for any of my people here , you also did for me . ’
0	you must go away because when i was hungry , you gave me nothing to eat . when i was thirsty , you gave me nothing to drink .
0	“ then these evil people will go away to be punished forever . but the godly people will go and enjoy eternal life . ”
0	after jesus finished saying all these things , he said to his followers ,
0	then the leading priests and the older jewish leaders had a meeting at the palace where the high priest lived . the high priest ’ s name was caiaphas .
0	they said , “ we can not arrest jesus during passover . we don ’ t want the people to become angry and cause a riot . ”
0	jesus was in bethany at the house of simon the leper .
0	the followers saw the woman do this and were upset at her . they said , “ why waste that perfume ?
0	it could be sold for a lot of money , and the money could be given to those who are poor . ”
0	but jesus knew what happened . he said , “ why are you bothering this woman ? she did a very good thing for me .
0	you will always have the poor with you . but you will not always have me .
0	this woman poured perfume on my body . she did this to prepare me for burial after i die .
0	then one of the twelve followers went to talk to the leading priests . this was the follower named judas iscariot .
0	he said , “ i will hand jesus over to you . what will you pay me for doing this ? ” the priests gave him 30 silver coins .
0	after that judas waited for the best time to hand jesus over to them .
0	they obeyed and did what jesus told them to do . they prepared the passover meal .
0	in the evening jesus was at the table with the twelve followers .
0	they were all eating . then jesus said , “ believe me when i say that one of you twelve here will hand me over to my enemies . ”
0	the followers were very sad to hear this . each one said , “ lord , surely i am not the one ! ”
0	jesus answered , “ one who has dipped his bread in the same bowl with me will be the one to hand me over .
0	this wine is my blood , which will be poured out to forgive the sins of many and begin the new agreement from god to his people .
0	they all sang a song and then went out to the mount of olives .
0	jesus told the followers , “ tonight you will all lose your faith in me . the scriptures say ,
0	but after i am killed , i will rise from death . then i will go into galilee . i will be there before you go there . ”
0	peter answered , “ all the other followers may lose their faith in you . but my faith will never be shaken . ”
0	then jesus went with his followers to a place called gethsemane . he said to them , “ sit here while i go there and pray . ”
0	he told peter and the two sons of zebedee to come with him . then he began to be very sad and troubled .
0	then he went back to his followers and found them sleeping . he said to peter , “ could you men not stay awake with me for one hour ?
0	stay awake and pray for strength against temptation . your spirit wants to do what is right , but your body is weak . ”
0	then he went back to the followers . again he found them sleeping . they could not stay awake .
0	so he left them and went away one more time and prayed . this third time he prayed , he said the same thing .
0	stand up ! we must go . here comes the one who will hand me over . ”
0	judas planned to do something to show them which one was jesus . he said , “ the one i kiss will be jesus . arrest him . ”
0	so he went to jesus and said , “ hello , teacher ! ” then judas kissed him .
0	jesus answered , “ friend , do the thing you came to do . ”
0	jesus said to the man , “ put your sword back in its place . people who use swords will be killed with swords .
0	surely you know i could ask my father and he would give me more than twelve armies of angels .
0	but it must happen this way to show the truth of what the scriptures said . ”
0	but all these things have happened to show the full meaning of what the prophets wrote. ” then all of jesus ’ followers left him and ran away .
0	the men who arrested jesus led him to the house of caiaphas the high priest . the teachers of the law and the older jewish leaders were gathered there .
0	many people came and told lies about him . but the council could find no real reason to kill him . then two people came
0	and said , “ this man said , ‘ i can destroy the temple of god and build it again in three days . ’ ”
0	but jesus said nothing .
0	what do you think ? ”
0	then some there spit in jesus ’ face , and they hit him with their fists . others slapped him .
0	they said , “ show us that you are a prophet , messiah ! tell us who hit you ! ”
0	but peter told everyone there that this was not true . “ i don ’ t know what you are talking about , ” he said .
0	then he left the yard . at the gate another girl saw him and said to the people there , “ this man was with jesus of nazareth . ”
0	again , peter said he was never with jesus . he said , “ i swear to god i don ’ t know the man ! ”
0	early the next morning , all the leading priests and older leaders of the people met and decided to kill jesus .
0	they tied him , led him away , and handed him over to pilate , the governor .
0	judas said , “ i sinned . i handed over to you an innocent man to be killed . ”
0	so judas threw the money into the temple . then he went out from there and hanged himself .
0	that is why that field is still called the field of blood .
0	this showed the full meaning of what jeremiah the prophet said :
0	they used those 30 silver coins to buy the potter ’ s field , as the lord commanded me . ”
0	jesus stood before pilate , the governor , who asked him , “ are you the king of the jews ? ”
0	then , when the leading priests and the older jewish leaders made their accusations against jesus , he said nothing .
0	so pilate said to him , “ don ’ t you hear all these charges they are making against you ? why don ’ t you answer ? ”
0	but jesus did not say anything , and this really surprised the governor .
0	every year at passover time the governor would free one prisoner—whichever one the people wanted him to free .
0	at that time there was a man in prison who was known to be very bad . his name was barabbas .
0	pilate knew that they had handed jesus over to him because they were jealous of him .
0	but the leading priests and older jewish leaders told the people to ask for barabbas to be set free and for jesus to be killed .
0	pilate said , “ i have barabbas and jesus . which one do you want me to set free for you ? ”
0	pilate asked , “ so what should i do with jesus , the one called the messiah ? ”
0	pilate asked , “ why do you want me to kill him ? what wrong has he done ? ”
0	the people answered , “ we will take full responsibility for his death . you can blame us and even our children ! ”
0	then pilate ’ s soldiers took jesus into the governor ’ s palace . all the soldiers gathered around him .
0	they took off jesus ’ clothes and put a red robe on him .
0	they spit on him . then they took his stick and kept hitting him on the head with it .
0	the soldiers were going out of the city with jesus . they saw a man from cyrene named simon , and they forced him to carry jesus ’ cross .
0	they came to the place called golgotha . ( golgotha means “ the place of the skull . ” )
0	there the soldiers gave jesus some wine mixed with gall . but when he tasted it , he refused to drink it .
0	the soldiers nailed jesus to a cross . then they threw dice to divide his clothes between them .
0	the soldiers stayed there to guard him .
0	they put a sign above his head with the charge against him written on it : “ this is jesus , the king of the jews . ”
0	two criminals were nailed to crosses beside jesus—one on the right and the other on the left .
0	people walked by and shouted insults at jesus . they shook their heads
0	and in the same way , the criminals on the crosses beside jesus also insulted him .
0	at noon the whole country became dark . the darkness continued for three hours .
0	some of the people standing there heard this . they said , “ he is calling elijah . ”
0	but the others said , “ don ’ t bother him . we want to see if elijah will come to save him . ”
0	again jesus cried out loudly and then died .
0	the graves opened , and many of god ’ s people who had died were raised from death .
0	they came out of the graves . and after jesus was raised from death , they went into the holy city , and many people saw them .
0	many women were standing away from the cross , watching . these were the women who had followed jesus from galilee to care for him .
0	mary magdalene , mary the mother of james and joseph , and the mother of james and john were there .
0	that evening a rich man named joseph came to jerusalem . he was a follower of jesus from the town of arimathea .
0	he went to pilate and asked to have jesus ’ body . pilate gave orders for the soldiers to give jesus ’ body to him .
0	then joseph took the body and wrapped it in a new linen cloth .
0	mary magdalene and the other woman named mary were sitting near the tomb .
0	that day was the day called preparation day . the next day , the leading priests and the pharisees went to pilate .
0	they said , “ sir , we remember that while that liar was still alive he said , ‘ i will rise from death in three days . ’
0	pilate said , “ take some soldiers and go guard the tomb the best way you know . ”
0	the angel was shining as bright as lightning . his clothes were as white as snow .
0	the soldiers guarding the tomb were very afraid of the angel . they shook with fear and then became like dead men .
0	but he is not here . he has risen from death , as he said he would . come and see the place where his body was .
0	so the women left the tomb quickly . they were afraid , but they were also very happy . they ran to tell his followers what happened .
0	then jesus said to them , “ don ’ t be afraid . go tell my followers to go to galilee . they will see me there . ”
0	then the priests met with the older jewish leaders and made a plan . they paid the soldiers a lot of money
0	and said to them , “ tell the people that jesus ’ followers came during the night and stole the body while you were sleeping .
0	if the governor hears about this , we will talk to him and keep you out of trouble . ”
0	so the soldiers kept the money and obeyed the priests . and that story is still spread among the jews even today .
0	the eleven followers went to galilee , to the mountain where jesus told them to go .
0	on the mountain the followers saw jesus . they worshiped him . but some of the followers did not believe that it was really jesus .
0	so he came to them and said , “ all authority in heaven and on earth is given to me .
0	so go and make followers of all people in the world . baptize them in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit .
0	listen , all you people !
0	see , the lord is leaving his place
0	the mountains will melt under him
0	this will happen because of jacob ’ s sin ,
0	so i will change samaria into a pile of rocks in the field ,
0	all her idols will be broken to pieces .
0	i will be very sad about what will happen .
0	samaria ’ s wound can not be healed .
0	don ’ t tell it in gath .
0	you people living in shaphir ,
0	the people living in maroth
0	you people living in lachish ,
0	so you must give goodbye gifts
0	you people who live in mareshah ,
0	so cut off your hair , make yourself bald ,
0	trouble will come to those who make plans to sin .
0	they want fields , so they take them .
0	that is why the lord says :
0	then people will sing songs about you .
0	so we will not be able to measure the land
0	the people say , “ don ’ t prophesy to us .
0	but people of jacob ,
0	but you attack my people like enemies .
0	you have taken nice houses
0	get up and leave !
0	these people don ’ t want to listen to me .
0	yes , people of jacob , i will bring all of you together .
0	the “ one who breaks through walls ” will push through and walk to the front of his people .
0	then i said , “ listen , leaders of jacob and officers of the nation of israel !
0	but you hate good and love evil .
0	you are destroying my people .
0	then you will pray to the lord ,
0	some false prophets are telling lies to the lord ’ s people . this is what the lord says about them :
0	“ this is why it is like night for you
0	the seers are ashamed .
0	but the lord ’ s spirit has filled me
0	leaders of jacob and rulers of israel , listen to me !
0	you build zion by murdering people .
0	the judges in jerusalem accept bribes
0	leaders , because of you , zion will be destroyed .
0	in the last days the mountain of the lord ’ s temple
0	people from many nations will go there and say ,
0	then god will act as judge to end arguments between people in many places .
0	they will sit under their own
0	all the people from other nations follow their own gods ,
0	“ the people of that ‘ crippled ’ city
0	and you , tower of flocks ,
0	now , why are you crying so loudly ?
0	cry out , you people of jerusalem , and feel the pain ,
0	many nations have come to fight against you .
0	they have their plans ,
0	“ people of jerusalem , get up and crush them !
0	now strong city , gather your soldiers !
0	but you , bethlehem ephrathah ,
0	the lord will let his people be defeated
0	he will begin to rule israel in the power of the lord .
0	he will bring a time of peace .
0	with swords in hand our leaders will defeat the assyrians
0	but those from jacob who are still living and scattered among the nations
0	those from jacob who are still living
0	you will lift your hand against your enemies ,
0	i will destroy the cities in your country .
0	you will no longer try to do magic .
0	i will destroy your statues of false gods .
0	i will destroy the asherah poles
0	some nations will not listen to me ,
0	now hear what the lord says :
0	the lord has a complaint against his people .
0	he says , “ my people , tell me what i did !
0	i will tell you what i did .
0	my people , remember the evil plans of balak king of moab .
0	what must i bring when i come to meet with the lord ?
0	will the lord be pleased with a thousand rams
0	human , the lord has told you what goodness is .
0	the lord shouts to the city :
0	do the wicked still hide treasures
0	some people carry special weights
0	the rich in that city are still cruel .
0	so i have begun to punish you .
0	you will eat , but you will not become full .
0	you will plant your seeds ,
0	this is because you obey the laws of omri .
0	i am upset because i am like fruit that has been gathered ,
0	by this i mean that all the faithful people are gone .
0	people are good at doing bad things with both hands .
0	even the best of them is as crooked
0	don ’ t trust your neighbor
0	your enemies will be the people in your own house .
0	so i will look to the lord for help .
0	i have fallen , but enemy , don ’ t laugh at me !
0	i sinned against the lord ,
0	my enemy said to me ,
0	the time will come when your walls will be rebuilt .
0	your people will come back to your land .
0	the land was ruined by the people
0	so rule your people with your rod .
0	i did many miracles when i took you out of egypt .
0	the nations will see those miracles ,
0	they will crawl in the dust like a snake .
0	there is no god like you .
0	he will come back and comfort us again .
0	god , please be true to jacob .
0	this book is the vision of nahum from elkosh . this is the sad message about the city of nineveh .
0	the lord is a jealous god .
0	the lord is patient ,
0	he will speak harshly to the sea , and it will become dry .
0	the lord will come ,
0	no one can stand against his great anger .
0	the lord is good .
0	but he will completely destroy his enemies .
0	why are you making plans against the lord ?
0	you will be destroyed completely
0	someone from nineveh is making evil plans against the lord .
0	this is what the lord said :
0	now i will set you free from the power of assyria .
0	king of assyria , the lord gave this command about you :
0	an enemy is coming to attack you ,
0	yes , the lord changed jacob ’ s pride .
0	the shields of his soldiers are red .
0	the chariots race wildly through the streets
0	the enemy calls for his best soldiers .
0	but the gates by the rivers are open ,
0	the enemy takes away the queen ,
0	nineveh is like a pool whose water
0	now nineveh is empty .
0	where is that great city now ?
0	the lion was able to catch plenty of food
0	the lord all-powerful says ,
0	it will be very bad for that city of murderers .
0	you can hear the sounds of whips
0	soldiers on horses are attacking ,
0	all this happened because of nineveh .
0	the lord all-powerful says ,
0	i will throw dirty things on you
0	everyone who sees you will be shocked .
0	ethiopia and egypt made thebes strong . libya and the sudan supported her ,
0	so , nineveh , you will also fall like a drunk . you will try to hide . you will look for a safe place away from the enemy .
0	then i prayed this prayer :
0	we israelites have been very bad to you . we have not obeyed the commands , rules , and laws you gave your servant moses .
0	“ the israelites are your servants and your people . you used your great power and rescued them .
0	so the king asked me , “ are you sick ? why do you look sad ? i think your heart is full of sadness . ”
0	then the king said to me , “ what do you want me to do ? ”
0	the king and the queen who was sitting next to him asked me , “ how long will your trip take ? when will you get back here ? ”
0	sanballat from horon and tobiah the ammonite official heard about what i was doing . they were very upset and angry that someone had come to help the israelites .
0	so i went up the valley in the dark , inspecting the wall . finally , i turned back and went back in through the valley gate .
0	the men from jericho built the wall next to the priests . and zaccur son of a man named imri built the wall next to the men of jericho .
0	meremoth son of uriah repaired the next section of the wall . ( uriah was the son of hakkoz . )
0	the men from tekoa repaired the next section of the wall , but the leaders from tekoa refused to work for nehemiah their governor .
0	rephaiah son of hur repaired the next section of the wall . rephaiah was the governor of half of jerusalem .
0	malkijah son of harim and hasshub son of pahath-moab repaired the next section . they also repaired oven tower .
0	shallum son of hallohesh repaired the next section of the wall . his daughters helped him . shallum was the governor of the other half of jerusalem .
0	their brothers repaired the next section . they worked under binnui son of henadad . binnui was the governor of the other half of the district of keilah .
0	the next section of walls was repaired by the priests who lived in that area .
0	binnui son of henadad repaired the section of wall from azariah ’ s house to the bend in the wall and then to the corner .
0	the temple servants lived on ophel hill . they repaired the next section all the way to the east side of the water gate and the tower near it .
0	the men from tekoa repaired the rest of that section from the big tower all the way to the ophel wall .
0	the priests repaired the section over the horse gate . each priest repaired the wall in front of his own house .
0	hananiah son of shelemiah and hanun son of zalaph repaired the rest of that section of wall . ( hanun was zalaph ’ s sixth son . )
0	the goldsmiths and the merchants repaired the section of wall from that corner to the sheep gate .
0	when sanballat heard that we were building the wall of jerusalem , he was very angry and upset . he started making fun of the jews .
0	don ’ t take away their guilt or forgive the sins they have done in your sight . they have insulted and discouraged the builders . ”
0	but we prayed to our god . and we put guards on the walls to watch day and night so that we could be ready to meet them .
0	the builders and their helpers had their tools in one hand and a weapon in the other hand .
0	each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked . the man who blew the trumpet to warn the people stayed next to me .
0	so if you hear the trumpet , run to that place . we will all meet together there , and our god will fight for us ! ”
0	many of the poor people began to complain against their fellow jews .
0	some of them were saying , “ we have many children . we must get some grain if we are going to eat and stay alive . ”
0	other people were saying , “ this is a time of famine . we have to use our fields , vineyards , and homes to pay for grain . ”
0	when i heard their complaints , i was very angry .
0	also , i regularly fed 150 jews who were always welcome at my table , and i fed those who came to us from the nations around us .
0	my god , remember all the good i have done for these people .
0	sanballat and geshem sent the same message to me four times , and i sent the same answer back to them each time .
0	then , the fifth time , sanballat sent his helper to me with the same message . and he had a letter in his hand that was not sealed .
0	this is what the letter said :
0	and the rumor is that you have chosen prophets to announce this about you in jerusalem : ‘ there is a king in judah ! ’
0	so i sent this answer back to sanballat : “ nothing you are saying is happening . you are just making all that up in your own head . ”
0	i knew that god had not sent shemaiah . i knew that he had prophesied against me because tobiah and sanballat had paid him to do that .
0	so the wall of jerusalem was completed on the 25th day of the month of elul . it had taken 52 days to finish building the wall .
0	also in those days after the wall had been completed , the rich people of judah were sending many letters to tobiah , and he was answering their letters .
0	now the city was large and there was plenty of room . but there were few people in it , and the houses had not yet been rebuilt .

0	from the family of priests there were the descendants of

0	they had 736 horses , 245 mules , 435 camels , and 6720 donkeys .
0	the family leaders gave 375 pounds of gold to the treasury to support the work . they also gave 2750 pounds of silver .
0	all together the other people gave 375 pounds of gold , 2500 pounds of silver , and 67 pieces of clothing for the priests .
0	those people who were true israelites separated themselves from foreigners . the israelites stood and confessed their sins and the sins of their ancestors .
0	you are the lord ,
0	you saw he was true and loyal to you ,
0	you saw our ancestors suffering in egypt
0	you showed the miracles to pharaoh .
0	you split the red sea in front of them ,
0	with the tall cloud , you led them by day ,
0	then you came down to mount sinai .
0	you told them about your special day of rest—the sabbath .
0	but our ancestors became proud and stubborn .
0	they refused to listen .
0	you didn ’ t leave them even when they made golden calves and said ,
0	you are very kind ,
0	you gave them your good spirit to make them wise .
0	you took care of them for 40 years .
0	you gave them kingdoms and nations ,
1	and when they draw nigh unto jerusalem , unto bethphage and bethany , at the mount of olives , he sendeth two of his disciples ,
1	and they went away , and found a colt tied at the door without in the open street ; and they loose him .
1	and certain of them that stood there said unto them , what do ye , loosing the colt ?
1	and they said unto them even as jesus had said : and they let them go .
1	and they bring the colt unto jesus , and cast on him their garments ; and he sat upon him .
1	and many spread their garments upon the way ; and others branches , which they had cut from the fields .
1	and they that went before , and they that followed , cried , hosanna ; blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord :
1	blessed is the kingdom that cometh , the kingdom of our father david : hosanna in the highest .
1	and on the morrow , when they were come out from bethany , he hungered .
1	and he answered and said unto it , no man eat fruit from thee henceforward for ever . and his disciples heard it .
1	and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple .
1	and every evening he went forth out of the city .
1	and as they passed by in the morning , they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots .
1	and peter calling to remembrance saith unto him , rabbi , behold , the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away .
1	and jesus answering saith unto them , have faith in god .
1	therefore i say unto you , all things whatsoever ye pray and ask for , believe that ye receive them , and ye shall have them .
1	and whensoever ye stand praying , forgive , if ye have aught against any one ; that your father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses .
1	and they said unto him , by what authority doest thou these things ? or who gave thee this authority to do these things ?
1	the baptism of john , was it from heaven , or from men ? answer me .
1	and they reasoned with themselves , saying , if we shall say , from heaven ; he will say , why then did ye not believe him ?
1	but should we say , from men—they feared the people : for all verily held john to be a prophet .
1	and they answered jesus and say , we know not . and jesus saith unto them , neither tell i you by what authority i do these things .
1	and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant , that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard .
1	and they took him , and beat him , and sent him away empty .
1	and again he sent unto them another servant ; and him they wounded in the head , and handled shamefully .
1	and he sent another ; and him they killed : and many others ; beating some , and killing some .
1	he had yet one , a beloved son : he sent him last unto them , saying , they will reverence my son .
1	but those husbandmen said among themselves , this is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and the inheritance shall be ours .
1	and they took him , and killed him , and cast him forth out of the vineyard .
1	what therefore will the lord of the vineyard do ? he will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will give the vineyard unto others .
1	have ye not read even this scripture :
1	this was from the lord ,
1	and they send unto him certain of the pharisees and of the herodians , that they might catch him in talk .
1	and they brought it . and he saith unto them , whose is this image and superscription ? and they said unto him , caesar ’ s .
1	and there come unto him sadducees , who say that there is no resurrection ; and they asked him , saying ,
1	there were seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and dying left no seed ;
1	and the second took her , and died , leaving no seed behind him ; and the third likewise :
1	and the seven left no seed . last of all the woman also died .
1	in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of them ? for the seven had her to wife .
1	jesus said unto them , is it not for this cause that ye err , that ye know not the scriptures , nor the power of god ?
1	for when they shall rise from the dead , they neither marry , nor are given in marriage ; but are as angels in heaven .
1	he is not the god of the dead , but of the living : ye do greatly err .
1	jesus answered , the first is , hear , o israel ; the lord our god , the lord is one :
1	the second is this , thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . there is none other commandment greater than these .
1	and the scribe said unto him , of a truth , teacher , thou hast well said that he is one ; and there is none other but he :
1	and jesus answered and said , as he taught in the temple , how say the scribes that the christ is the son of david ?
1	david himself said in the holy spirit ,
1	david himself calleth him lord ; and whence is he his son ? and the common people heard him gladly .
1	and in his teaching he said , beware of the scribes , who desire to walk in long robes , and to have salutations in the marketplaces ,
1	and chief seats in the synagogues , and chief places at feasts :
1	they that devour widows ’ houses , and for a pretence make long prayers ; these shall receive greater condemnation .
1	and he sat down over against the treasury , and beheld how the multitude cast money into the treasury : and many that were rich cast in much .
1	and there came a poor widow , and she cast in two mites , which make a farthing .
1	for they all did cast in of their superfluity ; but she of her want did cast in all that she had , even all her living .
1	and jesus said unto him , seest thou these great buildings ? there shall not be left here one stone upon another , which shall not be thrown down .
1	and as he sat on the mount of olives over against the temple , peter and james and john and andrew asked him privately ,
1	tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign when these things are all about to be accomplished ?
1	and jesus began to say unto them , take heed that no man lead you astray .
1	many shall come in my name , saying , i am he ; and shall lead many astray .
1	and the gospel must first be preached unto all the nations .
1	and ye shall be hated of all men for my name ’ s sake : but he that endureth to the end , the same shall be saved .
1	and let him that is on the housetop not go down , nor enter in , to take anything out of his house :
1	and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak .
1	but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days !
1	and pray ye that it be not in the winter .
1	and then if any man shall say unto you , lo , here is the christ ; or , lo , there ; believe it not :
1	for there shall arise false christs and false prophets , and shall show signs and wonders , that they may lead astray , if possible , the elect .
1	but take ye heed : behold , i have told you all things beforehand .
1	but in those days , after that tribulation , the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light ,
1	and the stars shall be falling from heaven , and the powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken .
1	and then shall they see the son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory .
1	even so ye also , when ye see these things coming to pass , know ye that he is nigh , even at the doors .
1	verily i say unto you , this generation shall not pass away , until all these things be accomplished .
1	heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away .
1	but of that day or that hour knoweth no one , not even the angels in heaven , neither the son , but the father .
1	take ye heed , watch and pray : for ye know not when the time is .
1	lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping .
1	and what i say unto you i say unto all , watch .
1	for they said , not during the feast , lest haply there shall be a tumult of the people .
1	but there were some that had indignation among themselves , saying , to what purpose hath this waste of the ointment been made ?
1	for this ointment might have been sold for above three hundred shillings , and given to the poor . and they murmured against her .
1	but jesus said , let her alone ; why trouble ye her ? she hath wrought a good work on me .
1	for ye have the poor always with you , and whensoever ye will ye can do them good : but me ye have not always .
1	she hath done what she could ; she hath anointed my body beforehand for the burying .
1	and judas iscariot , he that was one of the twelve , went away unto the chief priests , that he might deliver him unto them .
1	and they , when they heard it , were glad , and promised to give him money . and he sought how he might conveniently deliver him unto them .
1	and he will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready : and there make ready for us .
1	and the disciples went forth , and came into the city , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
1	and when it was evening he cometh with the twelve .
1	they began to be sorrowful , and to say unto him one by one , is it i ?
1	and he said unto them , it is one of the twelve , he that dippeth with me in the dish .
1	and he took a cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave to them : and they all drank of it .
1	and he said unto them , this is my blood of the covenant , which is poured out for many .
1	and when they had sung a hymn , they went out unto the mount of olives .
1	howbeit , after i am raised up , i will go before you into galilee .
1	but peter said unto him , although all shall be offended , yet will not i .
1	but he spake exceeding vehemently , if i must die with thee , i will not deny thee . and in like manner also said they all .
1	and they come unto a place which was named gethsemane : and he saith unto his disciples , sit ye here , while i pray .
1	and he taketh with him peter and james and john , and began to be greatly amazed , and sore troubled .
1	and he saith unto them , my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death : abide ye here , and watch .
1	and he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass away from him .
1	and he cometh , and findeth them sleeping , and saith unto peter , simon , sleepest thou ? couldest thou not watch one hour ?
1	watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak .
1	and again he went away , and prayed , saying the same words .
1	and again he came , and found them sleeping , for their eyes were very heavy ; and they knew not what to answer him .
1	arise , let us be going : behold , he that betrayeth me is at hand .
1	and when he was come , straightway he came to him , and saith , rabbi ; and kissed him .
1	and they laid hands on him , and took him .
1	but a certain one of them that stood by drew his sword , and smote the servant of the high priest , and struck off his ear .
1	and jesus answered and said unto them , are ye come out , as against a robber , with swords and staves to seize me ?
1	i was daily with you in the temple teaching , and ye took me not : but this is done that the scriptures might be fulfilled .
1	and they all left him , and fled .
1	and a certain young man followed with him , having a linen cloth cast about him , over his naked body : and they lay hold on him ;
1	but he left the linen cloth , and fled naked .
1	and they led jesus away to the high priest : and there come together with him all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes .
1	now the chief priests and the whole council sought witness against jesus to put him to death ; and found it not .
1	for many bare false witness against him , and their witness agreed not together .
1	and there stood up certain , and bare false witness against him , saying ,
1	we heard him say , i will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and in three days i will build another made without hands .
1	and not even so did their witness agree together .
1	and the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked jesus , saying , answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
1	and the high priest rent his clothes , and saith , what further need have we of witnesses ?
1	ye have heard the blasphemy : what think ye ? and they all condemned him to be worthy of death .
1	and as peter was beneath in the court , there cometh one of the maids of the high priest ;
1	and seeing peter warming himself , she looked upon him , and saith , thou also wast with the nazarene , even jesus .
1	but he denied , saying , i neither know , nor understand what thou sayest : and he went out into the porch ; and the cock crew .
1	and the maid saw him , and began again to say to them that stood by , this is one of them .
1	but he began to curse , and to swear , i know not this man of whom ye speak .
1	and pilate asked him , art thou the king of the jews ? and he answering saith unto him , thou sayest .
1	and the chief priests accused him of many things .
1	and pilate again asked him , saying , answerest thou nothing ? behold how many things they accuse thee of .
1	but jesus no more answered anything ; insomuch that pilate marvelled .
1	now at the feast he used to release unto them one prisoner , whom they asked of him .
1	and there was one called barabbas , lying bound with them that had made insurrection , men who in the insurrection had committed murder .
1	and the multitude went up and began to ask him to do as he was wont to do unto them .
1	and pilate answered them , saying , will ye that i release unto you the king of the jews ?
1	for he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up .
1	but the chief priests stirred up the multitude , that he should rather release barabbas unto them .
1	and pilate again answered and said unto them , what then shall i do unto him whom ye call the king of the jews ?
1	and they cried out again , crucify him .
1	and pilate said unto them , why , what evil hath he done ? but they cried out exceedingly , crucify him .
1	and pilate , wishing to content the multitude , released unto them barabbas , and delivered jesus , when he had scourged him , to be crucified .
1	and the soldiers led him away within the court , which is the praetorium ; and they call together the whole band .
1	and they clothe him with purple , and platting a crown of thorns , they put it on him ;
1	and they began to salute him , hail , king of the jews !
1	and they smote his head with a reed , and spat upon him , and bowing their knees worshipped him .
1	and they bring him unto the place golgotha , which is , being interpreted , the place of a skull .
1	and they offered him wine mingled with myrrh : but he received it not .
1	and they crucify him , and part his garments among them , casting lots upon them , what each should take .
1	and it was the third hour , and they crucified him .
1	and the superscription of his accusation was written over , the king of the jews .
1	and with him they crucify two robbers ; one on his right hand , and one on his left .
1	save thyself , and come down from the cross .
1	in like manner also the chief priests mocking him among themselves with the scribes said , he saved others ; himself he can not save .
1	and when the sixth hour was come , there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour .
1	and some of them that stood by , when they heard it , said , behold , he calleth elijah .
1	and jesus uttered a loud voice , and gave up the ghost .
1	and the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom .
1	who , when he was in galilee , followed him , and ministered unto him ; and many other women that came up with him unto jerusalem .
1	and when even was now come , because it was the preparation , that is , the day before the sabbath ,
1	and pilate marvelled if he were already dead : and calling unto him the centurion , he asked him whether he had been any while dead .
1	and when he learned it of the centurion , he granted the corpse to joseph .
1	and mary magdalene and mary the mother of joses beheld where he was laid .
1	and very early on the first day of the week , they come to the tomb when the sun was risen .
1	and they were saying among themselves , who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the tomb ?
1	and looking up , they see that the stone is rolled back : for it was exceeding great .
1	and entering into the tomb , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , arrayed in a white robe ; and they were amazed .
1	but go , tell his disciples and peter , he goeth before you into galilee : there shall ye see him , as he said unto you .
1	now when he was risen early on the first day of the week , he appeared first to mary magdalene , from whom he had cast out seven demons .
1	she went and told them that had been with him , as they mourned and wept .
1	and they , when they heard that he was alive , and had been seen of her , disbelieved .
1	and after these things he was manifested in another form unto two of them , as they walked , on their way into the country .
1	and they went away and told it unto the rest : neither believed they them .
1	and he said unto them , go ye into all the world , and preach the gospel to the whole creation .
1	he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved ; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned .
1	and these signs shall accompany them that believe : in my name shall they cast out demons ; they shall speak with new tongues ;
1	so then the lord jesus , after he had spoken unto them , was received up into heaven , and sat down at the right hand of god .
1	and they went forth , and preached everywhere , the lord working with them , and confirming the word by the signs that followed . amen .
1	the book of the generation of jesus christ , the son of david , the son of abraham .
1	abraham begat isaac ; and isaac begat jacob ; and jacob begat judah and his brethren ;
1	and judah begat perez and zerah of tamar ; and perez begat hezron ; and hezron begat ram ;
1	and ram begat amminadab ; and amminadab begat nahshon ; and nahshon begat salmon ;
1	and salmon begat boaz of rahab ; and boaz begat obed of ruth ; and obed begat jesse ;
1	and jesse begat david the king .
1	and solomon begat rehoboam ; and rehoboam begat abijah ; and abijah begat asa ;
1	and asa begat jehoshaphat ; and jehoshaphat begat joram ; and joram begat uzziah ;
1	and uzziah begat jotham ; and jotham begat ahaz ; and ahaz begat hezekiah ;
1	and hezekiah begat manasseh ; and manasseh begat amon ; and amon begat josiah ;
1	and josiah begat jechoniah and his brethren , at the time of the carrying away to babylon .
1	and after the carrying away to babylon , jechoniah begat shealtiel ; and shealtiel begat zerubbabel ;
1	and zerubbabel begat abiud ; and abiud begat eliakim ; and eliakim begat azor ;
1	and azor begat sadoc ; and sadoc begat achim ; and achim begat eliud ;
1	and eliud begat eleazar ; and eleazar begat matthan ; and matthan begat jacob ;
1	and jacob begat joseph the husband of mary , of whom was born jesus , who is called christ .
1	and joseph her husband , being a righteous man , and not willing to make her a public example , was minded to put her away privily .
1	and she shall bring forth a son ; and thou shalt call his name jesus ; for it is he that shall save his people from their sins .
1	now all this is come to pass , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the lord through the prophet , saying ,
1	behold , the virgin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son ,
1	and joseph arose from his sleep , and did as the angel of the lord commanded him , and took unto him his wife ;
1	and knew her not till she had brought forth a son : and he called his name jesus .
1	now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judaea in the days of herod the king , behold , wise-men from the east came to jerusalem , saying ,
1	where is he that is born king of the jews ? for we saw his star in the east , and are come to worship him .
1	and when herod the king heard it , he was troubled , and all jerusalem with him .
1	and gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people , he inquired of them where the christ should be born .
1	and they said unto him , in bethlehem of judaea : for thus it is written through the prophet ,
1	and thou bethlehem , land of judah ,
1	then herod privily called the wise-men , and learned of them exactly what time the star appeared .
1	and when they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceeding great joy .
1	and being warned of god in a dream that they should not return to herod , they departed into their own country another way .
1	and he arose and took the young child and his mother by night , and departed into egypt ;
1	then was fulfilled that which was spoken through jeremiah the prophet , saying ,
1	a voice was heard in ramah ,
1	but when herod was dead , behold , an angel of the lord appeareth in a dream to joseph in egypt , saying ,
1	and he arose and took the young child and his mother , and came into the land of israel .
1	and came and dwelt in a city called nazareth ; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets , that he should be called a nazarene .
1	and in those days cometh john the baptist , preaching in the wilderness of judaea , saying ,
1	repent ye ; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
1	for this is he that was spoken of through isaiah the prophet , saying ,
1	now john himself had his raiment of camel ’ s hair , and a leathern girdle about his loins ; and his food was locusts and wild honey .
1	then went out unto him jerusalem , and all judaea , and all the region round about the jordan ;
1	and they were baptized of him in the river jordan , confessing their sins .
1	bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance :
1	then cometh jesus from galilee to the jordan unto john , to be baptized of him .
1	but john would have hindered him , saying , i have need to be baptized of thee , and comest thou to me ?
1	but jesus answering said unto him , suffer it now : for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness . then he suffereth him .
1	and lo , a voice out of the heavens , saying , this is my beloved son , in whom i am well pleased .
1	then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil .
1	and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights , he afterward hungered .
1	and the tempter came and said unto him , if thou art the son of god , command that these stones become bread .
1	then the devil taketh him into the holy city ; and he set him on the pinnacle of the temple ,
1	and saith unto him , if thou art the son of god , cast thyself down : for it is written ,
1	jesus said unto him , again it is written , thou shalt not make trial of the lord thy god .
1	again , the devil taketh him unto an exceeding high mountain , and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world , and the glory of them ;
1	and he said unto him , all these things will i give thee , if thou wilt fall down and worship me .
1	then the devil leaveth him ; and behold , angels came and ministered unto him .
1	now when he heard that john was delivered up , he withdrew into galilee ;
1	and leaving nazareth , he came and dwelt in capernaum , which is by the sea , in the borders of zebulun and naphtali :
1	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through isaiah the prophet , saying ,
1	the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali ,
1	the people that sat in darkness
1	from that time began jesus to preach , and to say , repent ye ; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
1	and he saith unto them , come ye after me , and i will make you fishers of men .
1	and they straightway left the nets , and followed him .
1	and they straightway left the boat and their father , and followed him .
1	and there followed him great multitudes from galilee and decapolis and jerusalem and judaea and from beyond the jordan .
1	and seeing the multitudes , he went up into the mountain : and when he had sat down , his disciples came unto him :
1	and he opened his mouth and taught them , saying ,
1	blessed are the poor in spirit : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
1	blessed are they that mourn : for they shall be comforted .
1	blessed are the meek : for they shall inherit the earth .
1	blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness : for they shall be filled .
1	blessed are the merciful : for they shall obtain mercy .
1	blessed are the pure in heart : for they shall see god .
1	blessed are the peacemakers : for they shall be called sons of god .
1	blessed are they that have been persecuted for righteousness ’ sake : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
1	blessed are ye when men shall reproach you , and persecute you , and say all manner of evil against you falsely , for my sake .
1	rejoice , and be exceeding glad : for great is your reward in heaven : for so persecuted they the prophets that were before you .
1	ye are the light of the world . a city set on a hill can not be hid .
1	neither do men light a lamp , and put it under the bushel , but on the stand ; and it shineth unto all that are in the house .
1	even so let your light shine before men ; that they may see your good works , and glorify your father who is in heaven .
1	think not that i came to destroy the law or the prophets : i came not to destroy , but to fulfil .
1	ye have heard that it was said to them of old time , thou shalt not kill ; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment :
1	if therefore thou art offering thy gift at the altar , and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee ,
1	leave there thy gift before the altar , and go thy way , first be reconciled to thy brother , and then come and offer thy gift .
1	verily i say unto thee , thou shalt by no means come out thence , till thou have paid the last farthing .
1	ye have heard that it was said , thou shalt not commit adultery :
1	but i say unto you , that every one that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart .
1	it was said also , whosoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of divorcement :
1	again , ye have heard that it was said to them of old time , thou shalt not forswear thyself , but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths :
1	but i say unto you , swear not at all ; neither by the heaven , for it is the throne of god ;
1	nor by the earth , for it is the footstool of his feet ; nor by jerusalem , for it is the city of the great king .
1	neither shalt thou swear by thy head , for thou canst not make one hair white or black .
1	but let your speech be , yea , yea ; nay , nay : and whatsoever is more than these is of the evil one .
1	ye have heard that it was said , an eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth :
1	but i say unto you , resist not him that is evil : but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also .
1	and if any man would go to law with thee , and take away thy coat , let him have thy cloak also .
1	and whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile , go with him two .
1	give to him that asketh thee , and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away .
1	ye have heard that it was said , thou shalt love thy neighbor , and hate thine enemy :
1	but i say unto you , love your enemies , and pray for them that persecute you ;
1	for if ye love them that love you , what reward have ye ? do not even the publicans the same ?
1	and if ye salute your brethren only , what do ye more than others ? do not even the gentiles the same ?
1	ye therefore shall be perfect , as your heavenly father is perfect .
1	take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men , to be seen of them : else ye have no reward with your father who is in heaven .
1	but when thou doest alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth :
1	that thine alms may be in secret : and thy father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee .
1	and in praying use not vain repetitions , as the gentiles do : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking .
1	be not therefore like unto them : for your father knoweth what things ye have need of , before ye ask him .
1	after this manner therefore pray ye : our father who art in heaven , hallowed be thy name .
1	thy kingdom come . thy will be done , as in heaven , so on earth .
1	give us this day our daily bread .
1	and forgive us our debts , as we also have forgiven our debtors .
1	and bring us not into temptation , but deliver us from the evil one .
1	for if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly father will also forgive you .
1	but if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your father forgive your trespasses .
1	but thou , when thou fastest , anoint thy head , and wash thy face ;
1	lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth , where moth and rust consume , and where thieves break through and steal :
1	but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust doth consume , and where thieves do not break through nor steal :
1	for where thy treasure is , there will thy heart be also .
1	the lamp of the body is the eye : if therefore thine eye be single , thy whole body shall be full of light .
1	and which of you by being anxious can add one cubit unto the measure of his life ?
1	and why are ye anxious concerning raiment ? consider the lilies of the field , how they grow ; they toil not , neither do they spin :
1	yet i say unto you , that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
1	be not therefore anxious , saying , what shall we eat ? or , what shall we drink ? or , wherewithal shall we be clothed ?
1	for after all these things do the gentiles seek ; for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things .
1	but seek ye first his kingdom , and his righteousness ; and all these things shall be added unto you .
1	be not therefore anxious for the morrow : for the morrow will be anxious for itself . sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof .
1	judge not , that ye be not judged .
1	for with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged : and with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured unto you .
1	and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother ’ s eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
1	ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you :
1	for every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
1	or what man is there of you , who , if his son shall ask him for a loaf , will give him a stone ;
1	or if he shall ask for a fish , will give him a serpent ?
1	all things therefore whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you , even so do ye also unto them : for this is the law and the prophets .
1	for narrow is the gate , and straitened the way , that leadeth unto life , and few are they that find it .
1	beware of false prophets , who come to you in sheep ’ s clothing , but inwardly are ravening wolves .
1	by their fruits ye shall know them . do men gather grapes of thorns , or figs of thistles ?
1	even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit ; but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit .
1	a good tree can not bring forth evil fruit , neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
1	every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
1	therefore by their fruits ye shall know them .
1	and then will i profess unto them , i never knew you : depart from me , ye that work iniquity .
1	every one therefore that heareth these words of mine , and doeth them , shall be likened unto a wise man , who built his house upon the rock :
1	and it came to pass , when jesus had finished these words , the multitudes were astonished at his teaching :
1	for he taught them as one having authority , and not as their scribes .
1	and when he was come down from the mountain , great multitudes followed him .
1	and behold , there came to him a leper and worshipped him , saying , lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
1	and he stretched forth his hand , and touched him , saying , i will ; be thou made clean . and straightway his leprosy was cleansed .
1	and when he was entered into capernaum , there came unto him a centurion , beseeching him ,
1	and saying , lord , my servant lieth in the house sick of the palsy , grievously tormented .
1	and he saith unto him , i will come and heal him .
1	but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast forth into the outer darkness : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
1	and when jesus was come into peter ’ s house , he saw his wife ’ s mother lying sick of a fever .
1	and he touched her hand , and the fever left her ; and she arose , and ministered unto him .
1	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through isaiah the prophet , saying , himself took our infirmities , and bare our diseases .
1	now when jesus saw great multitudes about him , he gave commandment to depart unto the other side .
1	and there came a scribe , and said unto him , teacher , i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
1	and another of the disciples said unto him , lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father .
1	but jesus saith unto him , follow me ; and leave the dead to bury their own dead .
1	and when he was entered into a boat , his disciples followed him .
1	and behold , there arose a great tempest in the sea , insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves : but he was asleep .
1	and they came to him , and awoke him , saying , save , lord ; we perish .
1	and the men marvelled , saying , what manner of man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey him ?
1	now there was afar off from them a herd of many swine feeding .
1	and the demons besought him , saying , if thou cast us out , send us away into the herd of swine .
1	and they that fed them fled , and went away into the city , and told everything , and what was befallen to them that were possessed with demons .
1	and behold , all the city came out to meet jesus : and when they saw him , they besought him that he would depart from their borders .
1	and he entered into a boat , and crossed over , and came into his own city .
1	and behold , certain of the scribes said within themselves , this man blasphemeth .
1	and jesus knowing their thoughts said , wherefore think ye evil in your hearts ?
1	for which is easier , to say , thy sins are forgiven ; or to say , arise , and walk ?
1	and he arose , and departed to his house .
1	but when the multitudes saw it , they were afraid , and glorified god , who had given such authority unto men .
1	and when the pharisees saw it , they said unto his disciples , why eateth your teacher with the publicans and sinners ?
1	but when he heard it , he said , they that are whole have no need of a physician , but they that are sick .
1	but go ye and learn what this meaneth , i desire mercy , and not sacrifice : for i came not to call the righteous , but sinners .
1	then come to him the disciples of john , saying , why do we and the pharisees fast oft , but thy disciples fast not ?
1	and jesus arose , and followed him , and so did his disciples .
1	and behold , a woman , who had an issue of blood twelve years , came behind him , and touched the border of his garment :
1	for she said within herself , if i do but touch his garment , i shall be made whole .
1	and when jesus came into the ruler ’ s house , and saw the flute-players , and the crowd making a tumult ,
1	he said , give place : for the damsel is not dead , but sleepeth . and they laughed him to scorn .
1	but when the crowd was put forth , he entered in , and took her by the hand ; and the damsel arose .
1	and the fame hereof went forth into all that land .
1	and as jesus passed by from thence , two blind men followed him , crying out , and saying , have mercy on us , thou son of david .
1	then touched he their eyes , saying , according to your faith be it done unto you .
1	and their eyes were opened . and jesus strictly charged them , saying , see that no man know it .
1	but they went forth , and spread abroad his fame in all that land .
1	and as they went forth , behold , there was brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon .
1	and when the demon was cast out , the dumb man spake : and the multitudes marvelled , saying , it was never so seen in israel .
1	but the pharisees said , by the prince of the demons casteth he out demons .
1	but when he saw the multitudes , he was moved with compassion for them , because they were distressed and scattered , as sheep not having a shepherd .
1	then saith he unto his disciples , the harvest indeed is plenteous , but the laborers are few .
1	pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest , that he send forth laborers into his harvest .
1	philip , and bartholomew ; thomas , and matthew the publican ; james the son of alphaeus , and thaddaeus ;
1	simon the cananaean , and judas iscariot , who also betrayed him .
1	but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel .
1	and as ye go , preach , saying , the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
1	heal the sick , raise the dead , cleanse the lepers , cast out demons : freely ye received , freely give .
1	get you no gold , nor silver , nor brass in your purses ;
1	no wallet for your journey , neither two coats , nor shoes , nor staff : for the laborer is worthy of his food .
1	and into whatsoever city or village ye shall enter , search out who in it is worthy ; and there abide till ye go forth .
1	and as ye enter into the house , salute it .
1	and if the house be worthy , let your peace come upon it : but if it be not worthy , let your peace return to you .
1	verily i say unto you , it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrah in the day of judgment , than for that city .
1	behold , i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves : be ye therefore wise as serpents , and harmless as doves .
1	but beware of men : for they will deliver you up to councils , and in their synagogues they will scourge you ;
1	yea and before governors and kings shall ye be brought for my sake , for a testimony to them and to the gentiles .
1	for it is not ye that speak , but the spirit of your father that speaketh in you .
1	and ye shall be hated of all men for my name ’ s sake : but he that endureth to the end , the same shall be saved .
1	a disciple is not above his teacher , nor a servant above his lord .
1	fear them not therefore : for there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; and hid , that shall not be known .
1	what i tell you in the darkness , speak ye in the light ; and what ye hear in the ear , proclaim upon the house-tops .
1	are not two sparrows sold for a penny ? and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your father :
1	but the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
1	fear not therefore : ye are of more value than many sparrows .
1	every one therefore who shall confess me before men , him will i also confess before my father who is in heaven .
1	but whosoever shall deny me before men , him will i also deny before my father who is in heaven .
1	think not that i came to send peace on the earth : i came not to send peace , but a sword .
1	and a man ’ s foes shall be they of his own household .
1	and he that doth not take his cross and follow after me , is not worthy of me .
1	he that findeth his life shall lose it ; and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it .
1	he that receiveth you receiveth me , and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
1	and it came to pass when jesus had finished commanding his twelve disciples , he departed thence to teach and preach in their cities .
1	now when john heard in the prison the works of the christ , he sent by his disciples
1	and said unto him , art thou he that cometh , or look we for another ?
1	and jesus answered and said unto them , go and tell john the things which ye hear and see :
1	and blessed is he , whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me .
1	but what went ye out to see ? a man clothed in soft raiment ? behold , they that wear soft raiment are in kings ’ houses .
1	but wherefore went ye out ? to see a prophet ? yea , i say unto you , and much more than a prophet .
1	this is he , of whom it is written ,
1	and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence , and men of violence take it by force .
1	for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john .
1	and if ye are willing to receive it , this is elijah , that is to come .
1	he that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
1	but whereunto shall i liken this generation ? it is like unto children sitting in the marketplaces , who call unto their fellows
1	and say , we piped unto you , and ye did not dance ; we wailed , and ye did not mourn .
1	for john came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , he hath a demon .
1	then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done , because they repented not .
1	but i say unto you , it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon in the day of judgment , than for you .
1	but i say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom in the day of judgment , than for thee .
1	yea , father , for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight .
1	come unto me , all ye that labor and are heavy laden , and i will give you rest .
1	take my yoke upon you , and learn of me ; for i am meek and lowly in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls .
1	for my yoke is easy , and my burden is light .
1	at that season jesus went on the sabbath day through the grainfields ; and his disciples were hungry and began to pluck ears and to eat .
1	but the pharisees , when they saw it , said unto him , behold , thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do upon the sabbath .
1	but he said unto them , have ye not read what david did , when he was hungry , and they that were with him ;
1	or have ye not read in the law , that on the sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the sabbath , and are guiltless ?
1	but i say unto you , that one greater than the temple is here .
1	but if ye had known what this meaneth , i desire mercy , and not sacrifice , ye would not have condemned the guiltless .
1	for the son of man is lord of the sabbath .
1	and he departed thence , and went into their synagogue :
1	how much then is a man of more value than a sheep ! wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day .
1	then saith he to the man , stretch forth thy hand . and he stretched it forth ; and it was restored whole , as the other .
1	but the pharisees went out , and took counsel against him , how they might destroy him .
1	and jesus perceiving it withdrew from thence : and many followed him ; and he healed them all ,
1	and charged them that they should not make him known :
1	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through isaiah the prophet , saying ,
1	behold , my servant whom i have chosen ;
1	he shall not strive , nor cry aloud ;
1	a bruised reed shall he not break ,
1	and in his name shall the gentiles hope .
1	then was brought unto him one possessed with a demon , blind and dumb : and he healed him , insomuch that the dumb man spake and saw .
1	and all the multitudes were amazed , and said , can this be the son of david ?
1	but when the pharisees heard it , they said , this man doth not cast out demons , but by beelzebub the prince of the demons .
1	and if satan casteth out satan , he is divided against himself ; how then shall his kingdom stand ?
1	and if i by beelzebub cast out demons , by whom do your sons cast them out ? therefore shall they be your judges .
1	but if i by the spirit of god cast out demons , then is the kingdom of god come upon you .
1	he that is not with me is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth .
1	therefore i say unto you , every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men ; but the blasphemy against the spirit shall not be forgiven .
1	ye offspring of vipers , how can ye , being evil , speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh .
1	the good man out of his good treasure bringeth forth good things : and the evil man out of his evil treasure bringeth forth evil things .
1	and i say unto you , that every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment .
1	for by thy words thou shalt be justified , and by thy words thou shalt be condemned .
1	then certain of the scribes and pharisees answered him , saying , teacher , we would see a sign from thee .
1	but the unclean spirit , when he is gone out of the man , passeth through waterless places , seeking rest , and findeth it not .
1	while he was yet speaking to the multitudes , behold , his mother and his brethren stood without , seeking to speak to him .
1	and one said unto him , behold , thy mother and thy brethren stand without , seeking to speak to thee .
1	but he answered and said unto him that told him , who is my mother ? and who are my brethren ?
1	and he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples , and said , behold , my mother and my brethren !
1	for whosoever shall do the will of my father who is in heaven , he is my brother , and sister , and mother .
1	on that day went jesus out of the house , and sat by the sea side .
1	and there were gathered unto him great multitudes , so that he entered into a boat , and sat ; and all the multitude stood on the beach .
1	and he spake to them many things in parables , saying , behold , the sower went forth to sow ;
1	and as he sowed , some seeds fell by the way side , and the birds came and devoured them :
1	and others fell upon the rocky places , where they had not much earth : and straightway they sprang up , because they had no deepness of earth :
1	and when the sun was risen , they were scorched ; and because they had no root , they withered away .
1	and others fell upon the thorns ; and the thorns grew up and choked them :
1	and others fell upon the good ground , and yielded fruit , some a hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .
1	he that hath ears , let him hear .
1	and the disciples came , and said unto him , why speakest thou unto them in parables ?
1	therefore speak i to them in parables ; because seeing they see not , and hearing they hear not , neither do they understand .
1	and unto them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah , which saith ,
1	for this people ’ s heart is waxed gross ,
1	but blessed are your eyes , for they see ; and your ears , for they hear .
1	hear then ye the parable of the sower .
1	and he that was sown upon the rocky places , this is he that heareth the word , and straightway with joy receiveth it ;
1	yet hath he not root in himself , but endureth for a while ; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word , straightway he stumbleth .
1	another parable set he before them , saying , the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field :
1	but while men slept , his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat , and went away .
1	but when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit , then appeared the tares also .
1	and the servants of the householder came and said unto him , sir , didst thou not sow good seed in thy field ? whence then hath it tares ?
1	and he said unto them , an enemy hath done this . and the servants say unto him , wilt thou then that we go and gather them up ?
1	but he saith , nay ; lest haply while ye gather up the tares , ye root up the wheat with them .
1	all these things spake jesus in parables unto the multitudes ; and without a parable spake he nothing unto them :
1	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet , saying ,
1	and he answered and said , he that soweth the good seed is the son of man ;
1	and the enemy that sowed them is the devil : and the harvest is the end of the world ; and the reapers are angels .
1	as therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire ; so shall it be in the end of the world .
1	the son of man shall send forth his angels , and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling , and them that do iniquity ,
1	and shall cast them into the furnace of fire : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
1	then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father . he that hath ears , let him hear .
1	again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls :
1	and having found one pearl of great price , he went and sold all that he had , and bought it .
1	again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net , that was cast into the sea , and gathered of every kind :
1	so shall it be in the end of the world : the angels shall come forth , and sever the wicked from among the righteous ,
1	and shall cast them into the furnace of fire : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
1	have ye understood all these things ? they say unto him , yea .
1	and it came to pass , when jesus had finished these parables , he departed thence .
1	and his sisters , are they not all with us ? whence then hath this man all these things ?
1	and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief .
1	at that season herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning jesus ,
1	and said unto his servants , this is john the baptist ; he is risen from the dead ; and therefore do these powers work in him .
1	for herod had laid hold on john , and bound him , and put him in prison for the sake of herodias , his brother philip ’ s wife .
1	for john said unto him , it is not lawful for thee to have her .
1	and when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet .
1	but when herod ’ s birthday came , the daughter of herodias danced in the midst , and pleased herod .
1	whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she should ask .
1	and she , being put forward by her mother , saith , give me here on a platter the head of john the baptist .
1	and he sent and beheaded john in the prison .
1	and his head was brought on a platter , and given to the damsel : and she brought it to her mother .
1	and his disciples came , and took up the corpse , and buried him ; and they went and told jesus .
1	and he came forth , and saw a great multitude , and he had compassion on them , and healed their sick .
1	but jesus said unto them , they have no need to go away ; give ye them to eat .
1	and they say unto him , we have here but five loaves , and two fishes .
1	and he said , bring them hither to me .
1	and they all ate , and were filled : and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces , twelve baskets full .
1	and they that did eat were about five thousand men , besides women and children .
1	and straightway he constrained the disciples to enter into the boat , and to go before him unto the other side , till he should send the multitudes away .
1	and after he had sent the multitudes away , he went up into the mountain apart to pray : and when even was come , he was there alone .
1	but the boat was now in the midst of the sea , distressed by the waves ; for the wind was contrary .
1	and in the fourth watch of the night he came unto them , walking upon the sea .
1	and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , it is a ghost ; and they cried out for fear .
1	but straightway jesus spake unto them , saying , be of good cheer ; it is i ; be not afraid .
1	and peter answered him and said , lord , if it be thou , bid me come unto thee upon the waters .
1	and he said , come . and peter went down from the boat , and walked upon the waters to come to jesus .
1	but when he saw the wind , he was afraid ; and beginning to sink , he cried out , saying , lord , save me .
1	and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand , and took hold of him , and saith unto him , o thou of little faith , wherefore didst thou doubt ?
1	and when they were gone up into the boat , the wind ceased .
1	and they that were in the boat worshipped him , saying , of a truth thou art the son of god .
1	and when they had crossed over , they came to the land , unto gennesaret .
1	and when the men of that place knew him , they sent into all that region round about , and brought unto him all that were sick ;
1	and they besought him that they might only touch the border of his garment : and as many as touched were made whole .
1	then there come to jesus from jerusalem pharisees and scribes , saying ,
1	why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread .
1	and he answered and said unto them , why do ye also transgress the commandment of god because of your tradition ?
1	for god said , honor thy father and thy mother : and , he that speaketh evil of father or mother , let him die the death .
1	but ye say , whosoever shall say to his father or his mother , that wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is given to god ;
1	he shall not honor his father . and ye have made void the word of god because of your tradition .
1	ye hypocrites , well did isaiah prophesy of you , saying ,
1	this people honoreth me with their lips ;
1	but in vain do they worship me ,
1	and he called to him the multitude , and said unto them , hear , and understand :
1	not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man ; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth , this defileth the man .
1	then came the disciples , and said unto him , knowest thou that the pharisees were offended , when they heard this saying ?
1	but he answered and said , every plant which my heavenly father planted not , shall be rooted up .
1	let them alone : they are blind guides . and if the blind guide the blind , both shall fall into a pit .
1	and peter answered and said unto him , declare unto us the parable .
1	and he said , are ye also even yet without understanding ?
1	perceive ye not , that whatsoever goeth into the mouth passeth into the belly , and is cast out into the draught ?
1	but the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart ; and they defile the man .
1	for out of the heart come forth evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false witness , railings :
1	these are the things which defile the man ; but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man .
1	and jesus went out thence , and withdrew into the parts of tyre and sidon .
1	but he answered her not a word . and his disciples came and besought him , saying , send her away ; for she crieth after us .
1	but he answered and said , i was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel .
1	but she came and worshipped him , saying , lord , help me .
1	and he answered and said , it is not meet to take the children ’ s bread and cast it to the dogs .
1	but she said , yea , lord : for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters ’ table .
1	and jesus departed thence , and came nigh unto the sea of galilee ; and he went up into the mountain , and sat there .
1	and the disciples say unto him , whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude ?
1	and jesus said unto them , how many loaves have ye ? and they said , seven , and a few small fishes .
1	and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground ;
1	and he took the seven loaves and the fishes ; and he gave thanks and brake , and gave to the disciples , and the disciples to the multitudes .
1	and they all ate , and were filled : and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces , seven baskets full .
1	and they that did eat were four thousand men , besides women and children .
1	and he sent away the multitudes , and entered into the boat , and came into the borders of magadan .
1	and the pharisees and sadducees came , and trying him asked him to show them a sign from heaven .
1	but he answered and said unto them , when it is evening , ye say , it will be fair weather : for the heaven is red .
1	and the disciples came to the other side and forgot to take bread .
1	and jesus said unto them , take heed and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees .
1	and they reasoned among themselves , saying , we took no bread .
1	and jesus perceiving it said , o ye of little faith , why reason ye among yourselves , because ye have no bread ?
1	do ye not yet perceive , neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ?
1	neither the seven loaves of the four thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ?
1	how is it that ye do not perceive that i spake not to you concerning bread ? but beware of the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees .
1	then understood they that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread , but of the teaching of the pharisees and sadducees .
1	now when jesus came into the parts of caesarea philippi , he asked his disciples , saying , who do men say that the son of man is ?
1	and they said , some say john the baptist ; some , elijah ; and others , jeremiah , or one of the prophets .
1	he saith unto them , but who say ye that i am ?
1	and simon peter answered and said , thou art the christ , the son of the living god .
1	then charged he the disciples that they should tell no man that he was the christ .
1	and peter took him , and began to rebuke him , saying , be it far from thee , lord : this shall never be unto thee .
1	then said jesus unto his disciples , if any man would come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
1	for whosoever would save his life shall lose it : and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it .
1	for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels ; and then shall he render unto every man according to his deeds .
1	and after six days jesus taketh with him peter , and james , and john his brother , and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart :
1	and he was transfigured before them ; and his face did shine as the sun , and his garments became white as the light .
1	and behold , there appeared unto them moses and elijah talking with him .
1	and when the disciples heard it , they fell on their face , and were sore afraid .
1	and jesus came and touched them and said , arise , and be not afraid .
1	and lifting up their eyes , they saw no one , save jesus only .
1	and his disciples asked him , saying , why then say the scribes that elijah must first come ?
1	and he answered and said , elijah indeed cometh , and shall restore all things :
1	then understood the disciples that he spake unto them of john the baptist .
1	and when they were come to the multitude , there came to him a man , kneeling to him , and saying ,
1	and i brought him to thy disciples , and they could not cure him .
1	and jesus rebuked him ; and the demon went out of him : and the boy was cured from that hour .
1	then came the disciples to jesus apart , and said , why could not we cast it out ?
1	and while they abode in galilee , jesus said unto them , the son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men ;
1	and they shall kill him , and the third day he shall be raised up . and they were exceeding sorry .
1	and when they were come to capernaum , they that received the half-shekel came to peter , and said , doth not your teacher pay the half-shekel ?
1	and when he said , from strangers , jesus said unto him , therefore the sons are free .
1	in that hour came the disciples unto jesus , saying , who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven ?
1	and he called to him a little child , and set him in the midst of them ,
1	whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child , the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
1	and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me :
1	even so it is not the will of your father who is in heaven , that one of these little ones should perish .
1	but if he hear thee not , take with thee one or two more , that at the mouth of two witnesses or three every word may be established .
1	for where two or three are gathered together in my name , there am i in the midst of them .
1	then came peter and said to him , lord , how oft shall my brother sin against me , and i forgive him ? until seven times ?
1	jesus saith unto him , i say not unto thee , until seven times ; but , until seventy times seven .
1	therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king , who would make a reckoning with his servants .
1	the servant therefore fell down and worshipped him , saying , lord , have patience with me , and i will pay thee all .
1	and the lord of that servant , being moved with compassion , released him , and forgave him the debt .
1	so his fellow-servant fell down and besought him , saying , have patience with me , and i will pay thee .
1	and he would not : but went and cast him into prison , till he should pay that which was due .
1	so when his fellow-servants saw what was done , they were exceeding sorry , and came and told unto their lord all that was done .
1	then his lord called him unto him , and saith to him , thou wicked servant , i forgave thee all that debt , because thou besoughtest me :
1	shouldest not thou also have had mercy on thy fellow-servant , even as i had mercy on thee ?
1	and his lord was wroth , and delivered him to the tormentors , till he should pay all that was due .
1	so shall also my heavenly father do unto you , if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts .
1	and it came to pass when jesus had finished these words , he departed from galilee , and came into the borders of judaea beyond the jordan ;
1	and great multitudes followed him ; and he healed them there .
1	and there came unto him pharisees , trying him , and saying , is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause ?
1	and he answered and said , have ye not read , that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female ,
1	and said , for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife ; and the two shall become one flesh ?
1	so that they are no more two , but one flesh . what therefore god hath joined together , let not man put asunder .
1	they say unto him , why then did moses command to give a bill of divorcement , and to put her away ?
1	he saith unto them , moses for your hardness of heart suffered you to put away your wives : but from the beginning it hath not been so .
1	the disciples say unto him , if the case of the man is so with his wife , it is not expedient to marry .
1	but he said unto them , not all men can receive this saying , but they to whom it is given .
1	then were there brought unto him little children , that he should lay his hands on them , and pray : and the disciples rebuked them .
1	but jesus said , suffer the little children , and forbid them not , to come unto me : for to such belongeth the kingdom of heaven .
1	and he laid his hands on them , and departed thence .
1	and behold , one came to him and said , teacher , what good thing shall i do , that i may have eternal life ?
1	honor thy father and thy mother ; and , thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself .
1	the young man saith unto him , all these things have i observed : what lack i yet ?
1	but when the young man heard the saying , he went away sorrowful ; for he was one that had great possessions .
1	and jesus said unto his disciples , verily i say unto you , it is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven .
1	and when the disciples heard it , they were astonished exceedingly , saying , who then can be saved ?
1	and jesus looking upon them said to them , with men this is impossible ; but with god all things are possible .
1	then answered peter and said unto him , lo , we have left all , and followed thee ; what then shall we have ?
1	but many shall be last that are first ; and first that are last .
1	for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that was a householder , who went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard .
1	and when he had agreed with the laborers for a shilling a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
1	and he went out about the third hour , and saw others standing in the marketplace idle ;
1	and to them he said , go ye also into the vineyard , and whatsoever is right i will give you . and they went their way .
1	again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour , and did likewise .
1	and about the eleventh hour he went out , and found others standing ; and he saith unto them , why stand ye here all the day idle ?
1	they say unto him , because no man hath hired us . he saith unto them , go ye also into the vineyard .
1	and when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour , they received every man a shilling .
1	and when the first came , they supposed that they would receive more ; and they likewise received every man a shilling .
1	and when they received it , they murmured against the householder ,
1	but he answered and said to one of them , friend , i do thee no wrong : didst not thou agree with me for a shilling ?
1	take up that which is thine , and go thy way ; it is my will to give unto this last , even as unto thee .
1	is it not lawful for me to do what i will with mine own ? or is thine eye evil , because i am good ?
1	so the last shall be first , and the first last .
1	and as jesus was going up to jerusalem , he took the twelve disciples apart , and on the way he said unto them ,
1	and shall deliver him unto the gentiles to mock , and to scourge , and to crucify : and the third day he shall be raised up .
1	then came to him the mother of the sons of zebedee with her sons , worshipping him , and asking a certain thing of him .
1	and when the ten heard it , they were moved with indignation concerning the two brethren .
1	not so shall it be among you : but whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister ;
1	and whosoever would be first among you shall be your servant :
1	even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
1	and as they went out from jericho , a great multitude followed him .
1	and jesus stood still , and called them , and said , what will ye that i should do unto you ?
1	they say unto him , lord , that our eyes may be opened .
1	and jesus , being moved with compassion , touched their eyes ; and straightway they received their sight , and followed him .
1	and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem , and came unto bethphage , unto the mount of olives , then jesus sent two disciples ,
1	and if any one say aught unto you , ye shall say , the lord hath need of them ; and straightway he will send them .
1	now this is come to pass , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet , saying ,
1	tell ye the daughter of zion ,
1	and the disciples went , and did even as jesus appointed them ,
1	and brought the ass , and the colt , and put on them their garments ; and he sat thereon .
1	and the most part of the multitude spread their garments in the way ; and others cut branches from the trees , and spread them in the way .
1	and when he was come into jerusalem , all the city was stirred , saying , who is this ?
1	and the multitudes said , this is the prophet , jesus , from nazareth of galilee .
1	and he saith unto them , it is written , my house shall be called a house of prayer : but ye make it a den of robbers .
1	and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple ; and he healed them .
1	and he left them , and went forth out of the city to bethany , and lodged there .
1	now in the morning as he returned to the city , he hungered .
1	and when the disciples saw it , they marvelled , saying , how did the fig tree immediately wither away ?
1	and all things , whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive .
1	but if we shall say , from men ; we fear the multitude ; for all hold john as a prophet .
1	and they answered jesus , and said , we know not . he also said unto them , neither tell i you by what authority i do these things .
1	but what think ye ? a man had two sons ; and he came to the first , and said , son , go work to-day in the vineyard .
1	and he answered and said , i will not : but afterward he repented himself , and went .
1	and he came to the second , and said likewise . and he answered and said , i go , sir : and went not .
1	and when the season of the fruits drew near , he sent his servants to the husbandmen , to receive his fruits .
1	and the husbandmen took his servants , and beat one , and killed another , and stoned another .
1	again , he sent other servants more than the first : and they did unto them in like manner .
1	but afterward he sent unto them his son , saying , they will reverence my son .
1	and they took him , and cast him forth out of the vineyard , and killed him .
1	when therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come , what will he do unto those husbandmen ?
1	jesus saith unto them , did ye never read in the scriptures ,
1	therefore say i unto you , the kingdom of god shall be taken away from you , and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof .
1	and he that falleth on this stone shall be broken to pieces : but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will scatter him as dust .
1	and when the chief priests and the pharisees heard his parables , they perceived that he spake of them .
1	and when they sought to lay hold on him , they feared the multitudes , because they took him for a prophet .
1	and jesus answered and spake again in parables unto them , saying ,
1	the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain king , who made a marriage feast for his son ,
1	and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the marriage feast : and they would not come .
1	but they made light of it , and went their ways , one to his own farm , another to his merchandise ;
1	and the rest laid hold on his servants , and treated them shamefully , and killed them .
1	but the king was wroth ; and he sent his armies , and destroyed those murderers , and burned their city .
1	then saith he to his servants , the wedding is ready , but they that were bidden were not worthy .
1	go ye therefore unto the partings of the highways , and as many as ye shall find , bid to the marriage feast .
1	but when the king came in to behold the guests , he saw there a man who had not on a wedding-garment :
1	and he saith unto him , friend , how camest thou in hither not having a wedding-garment ? and he was speechless .
1	for many are called , but few chosen .
1	then went the pharisees , and took counsel how they might ensnare him in his talk .
1	tell us therefore , what thinkest thou ? is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar , or not ?
1	but jesus perceived their wickedness , and said , why make ye trial of me , ye hypocrites ?
1	show me the tribute money . and they brought unto him a denarius .
1	and he saith unto them , whose is this image and superscription ?
1	and when they heard it , they marvelled , and left him , and went away .
1	on that day there came to him sadducees , they that say that there is no resurrection : and they asked him ,
1	now there were with us seven brethren : and the first married and deceased , and having no seed left his wife unto his brother ;
1	in like manner the second also , and the third , unto the seventh .
1	and after them all , the woman died .
1	in the resurrection therefore whose wife shall she be of the seven ? for they all had her .
1	but jesus answered and said unto them , ye do err , not knowing the scriptures , nor the power of god .
1	for in the resurrection they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are as angels in heaven .
1	but as touching the resurrection of the dead , have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by god , saying ,
1	and when the multitudes heard it , they were astonished at his teaching .
1	but the pharisees , when they heard that he had put the sadducees to silence , gathered themselves together .
1	and one of them , a lawyer , asked him a question , trying him :
1	teacher , which is the great commandment in the law ?
1	and he said unto him , thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind .
1	this is the great and first commandment .
1	and a second like unto it is this , thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself .
1	on these two commandments the whole law hangeth , and the prophets .
1	now while the pharisees were gathered together , jesus asked them a question ,
1	saying , what think ye of the christ ? whose son is he ? they say unto him , the son of david .
1	he saith unto them , how then doth david in the spirit call him lord , saying ,
1	the lord said unto my lord ,
1	if david then calleth him lord , how is he his son ?
1	and no one was able to answer him a word , neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions .
1	then spake jesus to the multitudes and to his disciples ,
1	saying , the scribes and the pharisees sit on moses ’ seat :
1	all things therefore whatsoever they bid you , these do and observe : but do not ye after their works ; for they say , and do not .
1	but all their works they do to be seen of men : for they make broad their phylacteries , and enlarge the borders of their garments ,
1	and love the chief place at feasts , and the chief seats in the synagogues ,
1	and the salutations in the marketplaces , and to be called of men , rabbi .
1	but be not ye called rabbi : for one is your teacher , and all ye are brethren .
1	and call no man your father on the earth : for one is your father , even he who is in heaven .
1	neither be ye called masters : for one is your master , even the christ .
1	but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant .
1	and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled ; and whosoever shall humble himself shall be exalted .
1	ye fools and blind : for which is greater , the gold , or the temple that hath sanctified the gold ?
1	and , whosoever shall swear by the altar , it is nothing ; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it , he is a debtor .
1	ye blind : for which is greater , the gift , or the altar that sanctifieth the gift ?
1	he therefore that sweareth by the altar , sweareth by it , and by all things thereon .
1	and he that sweareth by the temple , sweareth by it , and by him that dwelleth therein .
1	and he that sweareth by the heaven , sweareth by the throne of god , and by him that sitteth thereon .
1	ye blind guides , that strain out the gnat , and swallow the camel !
1	thou blind pharisee , cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter , that the outside thereof may become clean also .
1	even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men , but inwardly ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity .
1	woe unto you , scribes and pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets , and garnish the tombs of the righteous ,
1	and say , if we had been in the days of our fathers , we should not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets .
1	wherefore ye witness to yourselves , that ye are sons of them that slew the prophets .
1	fill ye up then the measure of your fathers .
1	ye serpents , ye offspring of vipers , how shall ye escape the judgment of hell ?
1	verily i say unto you , all these things shall come upon this generation .
1	behold , your house is left unto you desolate .
1	for i say unto you , ye shall not see me henceforth , till ye shall say , blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord .
1	and jesus went out from the temple , and was going on his way ; and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple .
1	and jesus answered and said unto them , take heed that no man lead you astray .
1	for many shall come in my name , saying , i am the christ ; and shall lead many astray .
1	for nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; and there shall be famines and earthquakes in divers places .
1	but all these things are the beginning of travail .
1	then shall they deliver you up unto tribulation , and shall kill you : and ye shall be hated of all the nations for my name ’ s sake .
1	and then shall many stumble , and shall deliver up one another , and shall hate one another .
1	and many false prophets shall arise , and shall lead many astray .
1	and because iniquity shall be multiplied , the love of the many shall wax cold .
1	but he that endureth to the end , the same shall be saved .
1	and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world for a testimony unto all the nations ; and then shall the end come .
1	then let them that are in judaea flee unto the mountains :
1	let him that is on the housetop not go down to take out the things that are in his house :
1	and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak .
1	but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days !
1	and pray ye that your flight be not in the winter , neither on a sabbath :
1	for then shall be great tribulation , such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now , no , nor ever shall be .
1	and except those days had been shortened , no flesh would have been saved : but for the elect ’ s sake those days shall be shortened .
1	then if any man shall say unto you , lo , here is the christ , or , here ; believe it not .
1	behold , i have told you beforehand .
1	for as the lightning cometh forth from the east , and is seen even unto the west ; so shall be the coming of the son of man .
1	wheresoever the carcase is , there will the eagles be gathered together .
1	even so ye also , when ye see all these things , know ye that he is nigh , even at the doors .
1	verily i say unto you , this generation shall not pass away , till all these things be accomplished .
1	heaven and earth shall pass away , but my words shall not pass away .
1	but of that day and hour knoweth no one , not even the angels of heaven , neither the son , but the father only .
1	and as were the days of noah , so shall be the coming of the son of man .
1	and they knew not until the flood came , and took them all away ; so shall be the coming of the son of man .
1	then shall two men be in the field ; one is taken , and one is left :
1	two women shall be grinding at the mill ; one is taken , and one is left .
1	watch therefore : for ye know not on what day your lord cometh .
1	therefore be ye also ready ; for in an hour that ye think not the son of man cometh .
1	who then is the faithful and wise servant , whom his lord hath set over his household , to give them their food in due season ?
1	blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
1	verily i say unto you , that he will set him over all that he hath .
1	but if that evil servant shall say in his heart , my lord tarrieth ;
1	and shall begin to beat his fellow-servants , and shall eat and drink with the drunken ;
1	the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not , and in an hour when he knoweth not ,
1	and shall cut him asunder , and appoint his portion with the hypocrites : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
1	then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins , who took their lamps , and went forth to meet the bridegroom .
1	and five of them were foolish , and five were wise .
1	for the foolish , when they took their lamps , took no oil with them :
1	but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps .
1	now while the bridegroom tarried , they all slumbered and slept .
1	but at midnight there is a cry , behold , the bridegroom ! come ye forth to meet him .
1	then all those virgins arose , and trimmed their lamps .
1	and the foolish said unto the wise , give us of your oil ; for our lamps are going out .
1	afterward came also the other virgins , saying , lord , lord , open to us .
1	but he answered and said , verily i say unto you , i know you not .
1	watch therefore , for ye know not the day nor the hour .
1	for it is as when a man , going into another country , called his own servants , and delivered unto them his goods .
1	straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them , and made other five talents .
1	in like manner he also that received the two gained other two .
1	but he that received the one went away and digged in the earth , and hid his lord ’ s money .
1	now after a long time the lord of those servants cometh , and maketh a reckoning with them .
1	and he also that received the two talents came and said , lord , thou deliveredst unto me two talents : lo , i have gained other two talents .
1	and i was afraid , and went away and hid thy talent in the earth : lo , thou hast thine own .
1	thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers , and at my coming i should have received back mine own with interest .
1	take ye away therefore the talent from him , and give it unto him that hath the ten talents .
1	and cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth .
1	but when the son of man shall come in his glory , and all the angels with him , then shall he sit on the throne of his glory :
1	and before him shall be gathered all the nations : and he shall separate them one from another , as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats ;
1	and he shall set the sheep on his right hand , but the goats on the left .
1	naked , and ye clothed me ; i was sick , and ye visited me ; i was in prison , and ye came unto me .
1	then shall the righteous answer him , saying , lord , when saw we thee hungry , and fed thee ? or athirst , and gave thee drink ?
1	and when saw we thee a stranger , and took thee in ? or naked , and clothed thee ?
1	and when saw we thee sick , or in prison , and came unto thee ?
1	for i was hungry , and ye did not give me to eat ; i was thirsty , and ye gave me no drink ;
1	and these shall go away into eternal punishment : but the righteous into eternal life .
1	and it came to pass , when jesus had finished all these words , he said unto his disciples ,
1	ye know that after two days the passover cometh , and the son of man is delivered up to be crucified .
1	then were gathered together the chief priests , and the elders of the people , unto the court of the high priest , who was called caiaphas ;
1	and they took counsel together that they might take jesus by subtlety , and kill him .
1	but they said , not during the feast , lest a tumult arise among the people .
1	now when jesus was in bethany , in the house of simon the leper ,
1	there came unto him a woman having an alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment , and she poured it upon his head , as he sat at meat .
1	but when the disciples saw it , they had indignation , saying , to what purpose is this waste ?
1	for this ointment might have been sold for much , and given to the poor .
1	but jesus perceiving it said unto them , why trouble ye the woman ? for she hath wrought a good work upon me .
1	for ye have the poor always with you ; but me ye have not always .
1	for in that she poured this ointment upon my body , she did it to prepare me for burial .
1	then one of the twelve , who was called judas iscariot , went unto the chief priests ,
1	and said , what are ye willing to give me , and i will deliver him unto you ? and they weighed unto him thirty pieces of silver .
1	and from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him unto them .
1	now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus , saying , where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover ?
1	and the disciples did as jesus appointed them ; and they made ready the passover .
1	now when even was come , he was sitting at meat with the twelve disciples ;
1	and as they were eating , he said , verily i say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
1	and they were exceeding sorrowful , and began to say unto him every one , is it i , lord ?
1	and he answered and said , he that dipped his hand with me in the dish , the same shall betray me .
1	and judas , who betrayed him , answered and said , is it i , rabbi ? he saith unto him , thou hast said .
1	and he took a cup , and gave thanks , and gave to them , saying , drink ye all of it ;
1	for this is my blood of the covenant , which is poured out for many unto remission of sins .
1	and when they had sung a hymn , they went out into the mount of olives .
1	but after i am raised up , i will go before you into galilee .
1	but peter answered and said unto him , if all shall be offended in thee , i will never be offended .
1	jesus said unto him , verily i say unto thee , that this night , before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
1	peter saith unto him , even if i must die with thee , yet will i not deny thee . likewise also said all the disciples .
1	then cometh jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane , and saith unto his disciples , sit ye here , while i go yonder and pray .
1	and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee , and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled .
1	then saith he unto them , my soul is exceeding sorrowful , even unto death : abide ye here , and watch with me .
1	and he cometh unto the disciples , and findeth them sleeping , and saith unto peter , what , could ye not watch with me one hour ?
1	watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak .
1	and he came again and found them sleeping , for their eyes were heavy .
1	and he left them again , and went away , and prayed a third time , saying again the same words .
1	arise , let us be going : behold , he is at hand that betrayeth me .
1	now he that betrayed him gave them a sign , saying , whomsoever i shall kiss , that is he : take him .
1	and straightway he came to jesus , and said , hail , rabbi ; and kissed him .
1	and jesus said unto him , friend , do that for which thou art come . then they came and laid hands on jesus , and took him .
1	then saith jesus unto him , put up again thy sword into its place : for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword .
1	or thinkest thou that i can not beseech my father , and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels ?
1	how then should the scriptures be fulfilled , that thus it must be ?
1	but all this is come to pass , that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . then all the disciples left him , and fled .
1	and they that had taken jesus led him away to the house of caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were gathered together .
1	but peter followed him afar off , unto the court of the high priest , and entered in , and sat with the officers , to see the end .
1	now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against jesus , that they might put him to death ;
1	and they found it not , though many false witnesses came . but afterward came two ,
1	and said , this man said , i am able to destroy the temple of god , and to build it in three days .
1	and the high priest stood up , and said unto him , answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
1	what think ye ? they answered and said , he is worthy of death .
1	then did they spit in his face and buffet him : and some smote him with the palms of their hands ,
1	saying , prophesy unto us , thou christ : who is he that struck thee ?
1	now peter was sitting without in the court : and a maid came unto him , saying , thou also wast with jesus the galilaean .
1	but he denied before them all , saying , i know not what thou sayest .
1	and again he denied with an oath , i know not the man .
1	then began he to curse and to swear , i know not the man . and straightway the cock crew .
1	and peter remembered the word which jesus had said , before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice . and he went out , and wept bitterly .
1	now when morning was come , all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against jesus to put him to death :
1	and they bound him , and led him away , and delivered him up to pilate the governor .
1	saying , i have sinned in that i betrayed innocent blood . but they said , what is that to us ? see thou to it .
1	and he cast down the pieces of silver into the sanctuary , and departed ; and he went away and hanged himself .
1	and they took counsel , and bought with them the potter ’ s field , to bury strangers in .
1	wherefore that field was called , the field of blood , unto this day .
1	and they gave them for the potter ’ s field , as the lord appointed me .
1	and when he was accused by the chief priests and elders , he answered nothing .
1	then saith pilate unto him , hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee ?
1	and he gave him no answer , not even to one word : insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly .
1	now at the feast the governor was wont to release unto the multitude one prisoner , whom they would .
1	and they had then a notable prisoner , called barabbas .
1	when therefore they were gathered together , pilate said unto them , whom will ye that i release unto you ? barabbas , or jesus who is called christ ?
1	for he knew that for envy they had delivered him up .
1	now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for barabbas , and destroy jesus .
1	but the governor answered and said unto them , which of the two will ye that i release unto you ? and they said , barabbas .
1	pilate saith unto them , what then shall i do unto jesus who is called christ ? they all say , let him be crucified .
1	and he said , why , what evil hath he done ? but they cried out exceedingly , saying , let him be crucified .
1	and all the people answered and said , his blood be on us , and on our children .
1	then released he unto them barabbas ; but jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified .
1	then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the praetorium , and gathered unto him the whole band .
1	and they stripped him , and put on him a scarlet robe .
1	and they spat upon him , and took the reed and smote him on the head .
1	and when they had mocked him , they took off from him the robe , and put on him his garments , and led him away to crucify him .
1	and when they were come unto a place called golgotha , that is to say , the place of a skull ,
1	they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall : and when he had tasted it , he would not drink .
1	and when they had crucified him , they parted his garments among them , casting lots ;
1	and they sat and watched him there .
1	and they set up over his head his accusation written , this is jesus the king of the jews .
1	then are there crucified with him two robbers , one on the right hand and one on the left .
1	and they that passed by railed on him , wagging their heads ,
1	in like manner also the chief priests mocking him , with the scribes and elders , said ,
1	he trusteth on god ; let him deliver him now , if he desireth him : for he said , i am the son of god .
1	and the robbers also that were crucified with him cast upon him the same reproach .
1	now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour .
1	and some of them that stood there , when they heard it , said , this man calleth elijah .
1	and the rest said , let be ; let us see whether elijah cometh to save him .
1	and jesus cried again with a loud voice , and yielded up his spirit .
1	and the tombs were opened ; and many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised ;
1	and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared unto many .
1	and many women were there beholding from afar , who had followed jesus from galilee , ministering unto him :
1	among whom was mary magdalene , and mary the mother of james and joses , and the mother of the sons of zebedee .
1	and when even was come , there came a rich man from arimathaea , named joseph , who also himself was jesus ’ disciple :
1	this man went to pilate , and asked for the body of jesus . then pilate commanded it to be given up .
1	and joseph took the body , and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
1	and mary magdalene was there , and the other mary , sitting over against the sepulchre .
1	now on the morrow , which is the day after the preparation , the chief priests and the pharisees were gathered together unto pilate ,
1	saying , sir , we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive , after three days i rise again .
1	pilate said unto them , ye have a guard : go , make it as sure as ye can .
1	so they went , and made the sepulchre sure , sealing the stone , the guard being with them .
1	his appearance was as lightning , and his raiment white as snow :
1	and for fear of him the watchers did quake , and became as dead men .
1	and the angel answered and said unto the women , fear not ye ; for i know that ye seek jesus , who hath been crucified .
1	he is not here ; for he is risen , even as he said . come , see the place where the lord lay .
1	and they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy , and ran to bring his disciples word .
1	and behold , jesus met them , saying , all hail . and they came and took hold of his feet , and worshipped him .
1	then saith jesus unto them , fear not : go tell my brethren that they depart into galilee , and there shall they see me .
1	and when they were assembled with the elders , and had taken counsel , they gave much money unto the soldiers ,
1	saying , say ye , his disciples came by night , and stole him away while we slept .
1	and if this come to the governor ’ s ears , we will persuade him , and rid you of care .
1	so they took the money , and did as they were taught : and this saying was spread abroad among the jews , and continueth until this day .
1	but the eleven disciples went into galilee , unto the mountain where jesus had appointed them .
1	and when they saw him , they worshipped him ; but some doubted .
1	and jesus came to them and spake unto them , saying , all authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth .
1	go ye therefore , and make disciples of all the nations , baptizing them into the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit :
1	teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i commanded you : and lo , i am with you always , even unto the end of the world .
1	for , behold , jehovah cometh forth out of his place , and will come down , and tread upon the high places of the earth .
1	for her wounds are incurable ; for it is come even unto judah ; it reacheth unto the gate of my people , even to jerusalem .
1	tell it not in gath , weep not at all : at beth-le-aphrah have i rolled myself in the dust .
1	for the inhabitant of maroth waiteth anxiously for good , because evil is come down from jehovah unto the gate of jerusalem .
1	therefore shalt thou give a parting gift to moresheth-gath : the houses of achzib shall be a deceitful thing unto the kings of israel .
1	i will yet bring unto thee , o inhabitant of mareshah , him that shall possess thee : the glory of israel shall come even unto adullam .
1	therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the line by lot in the assembly of jehovah .
1	prophesy ye not , thus they prophesy . they shall not prophesy to these : reproaches shall not depart .
1	the women of my people ye cast out from their pleasant houses ; from their young children ye take away my glory for ever .
1	arise ye , and depart ; for this is not your resting-place ; because of uncleanness that destroyeth , even with a grievous destruction .
1	ye who hate the good , and love the evil ; who pluck off their skin from off them , and their flesh from off their bones ;
1	they build up zion with blood , and jerusalem with iniquity .
1	for all the peoples walk every one in the name of his god ; and we will walk in the name of jehovah our god for ever and ever .
1	and now many nations are assembled against thee , that say , let her be defiled , and let our eye see our desire upon zion .
1	but they know not the thoughts of jehovah , neither understand they his counsel ; for he hath gathered them as the sheaves to the threshing-floor .
1	let thy hand be lifted up above thine adversaries , and let all thine enemies be cut off .
1	and i will cut off the cities of thy land , and will throw down all thy strongholds .
1	and i will cut off witchcrafts out of thy hand ; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers :
1	and i will cut off thy graven images and thy pillars out of the midst of thee ; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thy hands ;
1	and i will pluck up thine asherim out of the midst of thee ; and i will destroy thy cities .
1	and i will execute vengeance in anger and wrath upon the nations which hearkened not .
1	hear ye now what jehovah saith : arise , contend thou before the mountains , and let the hills hear thy voice .
1	o my people , what have i done unto thee ? and wherein have i wearied thee ? testify against me .
1	wherewith shall i come before jehovah , and bow myself before the high god ? shall i come before him with burnt-offerings , with calves a year old ?
1	the voice of jehovah crieth unto the city , and the man of wisdom will see thy name : hear ye the rod , and who hath appointed it .
1	are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked , and a scant measure that is abominable ?
1	shall i be pure with wicked balances , and with a bag of deceitful weights ?
1	for the rich men thereof are full of violence , and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies , and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth .
1	therefore i also have smitten thee with a grievous wound ; i have made thee desolate because of thy sins .
1	trust ye not in a neighbor ; put ye not confidence in a friend ; keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom .
1	but as for me , i will look unto jehovah ; i will wait for the god of my salvation : my god will hear me .
1	a day for building thy walls ! in that day shall the decree be far removed .
1	yet shall the land be desolate because of them that dwell therein , for the fruit of their doings .
1	as in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of egypt will i show unto them marvellous things .
1	the nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might ; they shall lay their hand upon their mouth ; their ears shall be deaf .
1	he will again have compassion upon us ; he will tread our iniquities under foot ; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea .
1	thou wilt perform the truth to jacob , and the lovingkindness to abraham , which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old .
1	the burden of nineveh . the book of the vision of nahum the elkoshite .
